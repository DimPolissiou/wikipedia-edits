The pain is symmetrical and more pronounced in the morning, with the larger joints most affected. There is also possible periarticular [[tenosynovitis]] affecting the shoulders. The WHO guidelines advise to distinguish non-inflammatory [[arthralgia]] from inflammatory [[arthritis]]. With regard to ocular problems, sensitivity to light and blurry vision have been indicated among survivors. Among the aftereffects of Ebola virus disease, uveitis and optic nerve disease could appear after an individual is discharged. Ocular problems could threaten sight in survivors, thus the need for prompt treatment. In treating such individuals, the WHO recommends urgent intervention if uveitis is suspected; this consists mainly of prednisone (a [[corticosteroid]]). Hearing loss has been reported in Ebola survivors 25% of the time.

In March 2015, the CDC interviewed the survivors; they all reported having had at least one adverse symptom during their recovery period. The symptoms ranged from mild (e.g. hair loss) to more severe complications requiring re-hospitalisation or treatment. The most frequently reported symptoms were lethargy or fatigue, joint pain, and hair loss. Sixty-three per cent reported having eye problems including two who were diagnosed with uveitis, 75% reported psychological or cognitive symptoms, and 38% reported neural difficulties. Although most symptoms resolved or improved over time, only one survivor reported complete resolution of all symptoms.<ref name=\"New England Journal of Medicine\">{{cite journal| title=Post-Ebola Signs and Symptoms in U.S. Survivors | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | date=17 December 2015 | doi=10.1056/NEJMc1506576 | pmid=26672870 | volume=373 | issue=25 | pages=2484\u20132486|last1 = Epstein|first1 = Lauren| last2=Wong | first2=Karen K | last3=Kallen | first3=Alexander J | last4=Uyeki | first4=Timothy M }}</ref>\n\nA study published in May 2015 discussed the case of Ian Crozier, a Zimbabwe-born physician and American citizen who became infected with Ebola while he was working at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone.

However, after discharge Crozier began to experience symptoms including low back pain, bilateral [[enthesitis]] of the [[Achilles tendon]], [[paresthesias]] involving his lower legs, and eye pain, which was diagnosed as uveitis.  His eye condition worsened and a specimen of [[aqueous humor]] obtained from his eye tested positive for Ebola.

In March 2015, the United Nations Development Group reported that due to a decrease in trade, closing of borders, flight cancellations, and drop in foreign investment and tourism activity fuelled by stigma, the epidemic resulted in vast economic consequences both in the affected areas and throughout Africa.<ref name=\"auto2\" />  A September 2014 report in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' suggested that the economic impact of the Ebola outbreak could kill more people than the disease itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiannews.net/index.php/sid/225466201|publisher=Australian News.Net|title=IMF says Ebola impacted West African nations may need economic assistance}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to Ebola and economic activity in the country of Liberia, a study found that 8% of automotive firms, 8% of construction firms, 15% of food businesses and 30% of restaurants had closed due to the Ebola outbreak. Montserrado county experienced up to 20% firm closure. This indicated a decline in the Liberian national economy during the outbreak, as well as an indication that the county of Montserrado was hardest hit economically. The capital city Monrovia suffered construction and restaurant unemployment the most, while outside the capital, the food and beverage sectors suffered economically. A recuperation in the economy, at the end of the outbreak, was expected to be more rapid in some sectors than in others. Also, if the massive decline in economic activity persisted, the authors suggested a focus on economic recovery in addition to support for the healthcare system. The [[World Bank]] had projected an estimated loss of $1.6 billion in productivity for all three affected Western African countries combined for 2015. In Liberian counties that were less affected by the outbreak, the number of individuals employed fell by 24%. Montserrado saw a 47% decline in employment per firm in contrast to what was obtained prior to the Ebola outbreak.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2015/10/05/jech-2015-205959.full|title=Ebola, jobs and economic activity in Liberia|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=70|issue=3|pages=271\u2013277|author=Jeremy Bowles|accessdate=27 January 2016|doi=10.1136/jech-2015-205959|pmid=26438188|pmc=4789821|year=2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother study showed that the economic effect of the Ebola outbreak would be felt for years due to preexisting [[social vulnerability]]. The economic effects were being felt nationwide in Liberia, such as the termination of expansions in the mining business.

In spite of the end of civil violence since 2003 and inflows from international donors, the reconstruction of Liberia had been very slow and non-productive\u2014water delivery systems, sanitation facilities and centralised electricity were practically non-existent, even in Monrovia. Even before the outbreak, medical facilities did not have potable water, lighting or refrigeration.

Their recommendations were published in the November issue of ''[[The Lancet]]''.  According to the panel, the epidemic had exposed problems in the national (and international) institutions responsible for protecting the public from the human consequences of infectious disease outbreaks such as the Ebola epidemic.  The panel was highly critical of the WHO's management of the Ebola crisis noting that it took them months to respond and when they did they were slow to act, poorly co-ordinated and inadequately informed.  The report pointed out that the committee responsible for checking the WHO's actions during the outbreak (i.e. the WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel) had delayed responses due to worries about political resistance from the Western African leaders, economic consequences, and a system within the WHO that discouraged open debate about issues such as emergency declarations. The WHO may also have hesitated because it was criticised for creating panic by declaring a public health emergency during the relatively mild [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]]. This, the report states, showed the risks in having such consequential decision-making power in one individual\u2014a risk made worse when there was no mechanism of responsibility for such leadership failure.<ref name=\"lancet\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00946-0/abstract|title=Will Ebola change the game?

Included in the recommendations of the changes needed to fight future outbreaks is the creation of a U.N. Security Council health committee to expedite political attention to health issues and the establishment of a global fund to finance and accelerate the development of outbreak-relevant drugs and treatment.  The report also noted that competent governance of the global system demanded political leadership and a WHO that is more focused and appropriately financed and whose integrity is restored through the application of adequate reforms and leadership.<ref name=\"lancet\"/>\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for refusing to send Dr. Olivet Buck to Germany for experimental treatment after she contracted Ebola per the government of Sierra Leone's request. WHO claimed they could only evacuate medical professionals they had deployed to the region, not locals. Dr. Olivet Buck was the Medical Superintendent at Lumley Government Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It's believed that she contracted the virus while continuing to treat patients even during a shortage of personal protective equipment.

The pain is symmetrical and more pronounced in the morning, with the larger joints most affected. There is also possible periarticular [[tenosynovitis]] affecting the shoulders. The WHO guidelines advise to distinguish non-inflammatory [[arthralgia]] from inflammatory [[arthritis]]. With regard to ocular problems, sensitivity to light and blurry vision have been indicated among survivors. Among the aftereffects of Ebola virus disease, uveitis and optic nerve disease could appear after an individual is discharged. Ocular problems could threaten sight in survivors, thus the need for prompt treatment. In treating such individuals, the WHO recommends urgent intervention if uveitis is suspected; this consists mainly of prednisone (a [[corticosteroid]]). Hearing loss has been reported in Ebola survivors 25% of the time.

In March 2015, the CDC interviewed the survivors; they all reported having had at least one adverse symptom during their recovery period. The symptoms ranged from mild (e.g. hair loss) to more severe complications requiring re-hospitalisation or treatment. The most frequently reported symptoms were lethargy or fatigue, joint pain, and hair loss. Sixty-three per cent reported having eye problems including two who were diagnosed with uveitis, 75% reported psychological or cognitive symptoms, and 38% reported neural difficulties. Although most symptoms resolved or improved over time, only one survivor reported complete resolution of all symptoms.<ref name=\"New England Journal of Medicine\">{{cite journal| title=Post-Ebola Signs and Symptoms in U.S. Survivors | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | date=17 December 2015 | doi=10.1056/NEJMc1506576 | pmid=26672870 | volume=373 | issue=25 | pages=2484\u20132486|last1 = Epstein|first1 = Lauren| last2=Wong | first2=Karen K | last3=Kallen | first3=Alexander J | last4=Uyeki | first4=Timothy M }}</ref>\n\nA study published in May 2015 discussed the case of Ian Crozier, a Zimbabwe-born physician and American citizen who became infected with Ebola while he was working at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone.

However, after discharge Crozier began to experience symptoms including low back pain, bilateral [[enthesitis]] of the [[Achilles tendon]], [[paresthesias]] involving his lower legs, and eye pain, which was diagnosed as uveitis.  His eye condition worsened and a specimen of [[aqueous humor]] obtained from his eye tested positive for Ebola.

In March 2015, the United Nations Development Group reported that due to a decrease in trade, closing of borders, flight cancellations, and drop in foreign investment and tourism activity fuelled by stigma, the epidemic resulted in vast economic consequences both in the affected areas and throughout Africa.<ref name=\"auto2\" />  A September 2014 report in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' suggested that the economic impact of the Ebola outbreak could kill more people than the disease itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiannews.net/index.php/sid/225466201|publisher=Australian News.Net|title=IMF says Ebola impacted West African nations may need economic assistance}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to Ebola and economic activity in the country of Liberia, a study found that 8% of automotive firms, 8% of construction firms, 15% of food businesses and 30% of restaurants had closed due to the Ebola outbreak. Montserrado county experienced up to 20% firm closure. This indicated a decline in the Liberian national economy during the outbreak, as well as an indication that the county of Montserrado was hardest hit economically. The capital city Monrovia suffered construction and restaurant unemployment the most, while outside the capital, the food and beverage sectors suffered economically. A recuperation in the economy, at the end of the outbreak, was expected to be more rapid in some sectors than in others. Also, if the massive decline in economic activity persisted, the authors suggested a focus on economic recovery in addition to support for the healthcare system. The [[World Bank]] had projected an estimated loss of $1.6 billion in productivity for all three affected Western African countries combined for 2015. In Liberian counties that were less affected by the outbreak, the number of individuals employed fell by 24%. Montserrado saw a 47% decline in employment per firm in contrast to what was obtained prior to the Ebola outbreak.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2015/10/05/jech-2015-205959.full|title=Ebola, jobs and economic activity in Liberia|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=70|issue=3|pages=271\u2013277|author=Jeremy Bowles|accessdate=27 January 2016|doi=10.1136/jech-2015-205959|pmid=26438188|pmc=4789821|year=2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother study showed that the economic effect of the Ebola outbreak would be felt for years due to preexisting [[social vulnerability]]. The economic effects were being felt nationwide in Liberia, such as the termination of expansions in the mining business.

In spite of the end of civil violence since 2003 and inflows from international donors, the reconstruction of Liberia had been very slow and non-productive\u2014water delivery systems, sanitation facilities and centralised electricity were practically non-existent, even in Monrovia. Even before the outbreak, medical facilities did not have potable water, lighting or refrigeration.

Their recommendations were published in the November issue of ''[[The Lancet]]''.  According to the panel, the epidemic had exposed problems in the national (and international) institutions responsible for protecting the public from the human consequences of infectious disease outbreaks such as the Ebola epidemic.  The panel was highly critical of the WHO's management of the Ebola crisis noting that it took them months to respond and when they did they were slow to act, poorly co-ordinated and inadequately informed.  The report pointed out that the committee responsible for checking the WHO's actions during the outbreak (i.e. the WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel) had delayed responses due to worries about political resistance from the Western African leaders, economic consequences, and a system within the WHO that discouraged open debate about issues such as emergency declarations. The WHO may also have hesitated because it was criticised for creating panic by declaring a public health emergency during the relatively mild [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]]. This, the report states, showed the risks in having such consequential decision-making power in one individual\u2014a risk made worse when there was no mechanism of responsibility for such leadership failure.<ref name=\"lancet\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00946-0/abstract|title=Will Ebola change the game?

Included in the recommendations of the changes needed to fight future outbreaks is the creation of a U.N. Security Council health committee to expedite political attention to health issues and the establishment of a global fund to finance and accelerate the development of outbreak-relevant drugs and treatment.  The report also noted that competent governance of the global system demanded political leadership and a WHO that is more focused and appropriately financed and whose integrity is restored through the application of adequate reforms and leadership.<ref name=\"lancet\"/>\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for refusing to send Dr. Olivet Buck to Germany for experimental treatment after she contracted Ebola per the government of Sierra Leone's request. WHO claimed they could only evacuate medical professionals they had deployed to the region, not locals. Dr. Olivet Buck was the Medical Superintendent at Lumley Government Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It's believed that she contracted the virus while continuing to treat patients even during a shortage of personal protective equipment.

The ancient Greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long, including [[Zeus]], [[Achilles]], [[Apollo]], and [[Poseidon]]. Greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle. Such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off.  Also, in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle, they were known to cut the front short, but leave it long in the back, where it was more out of reach ([[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]). A widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long, and simply tied it back in a style known as a [[ponytail]] in order to keep it out of their enemies' reach. The ponytail method allowed warriors, who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches, to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice. Around the sixth century, however, the Greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles, with the exception of the Spartans. Women in the culture remained with the longer style, which for them showed freedom, health, and wealth, as well as good behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Irwin |first=M.

The tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle, causing the people to follow. [[Wulfstan (died 1023)|Wulfstan]], a religious leader, worried that those with longer hair would fight like women, and be unable to protect England from foreign invasion.

Through these centuries it was expected of [[Eastern Christian]]s to wear long hair as well as long beards, which was especially expected from clergy and monks.\n\nIn England, during the [[English Civil War]]s of 1642 to 1651, male hair length was emblematic of the disputes between [[Cavaliers]] and [[Roundheads]] (Puritans).

Most people would never cut their hair after they became adults, and cutting off one's hair was a penalty for minor crimes. Both men and women would coil up their hair and many hair-coiling styles were developed.\n\nBeginning in 1619, the ethnic [[Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] forced all men in China to adopt the [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]]: a long braid down the back with the hair near the forehead completely shaved. Hair length and style became a life-or-death matter in 1645 as the Manchu told them either their hair or their head would be cut.\nNearly every [[Han Chinese|Han]] rebel group began by shearing this pigtail (most especially in the case of the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping]], who were known in Chinese as the \"Longhairs\"), but the queue on penalty of death lasted until 1911, when the Chinese people cut their queues in unison at a time of rebellion.

Hadith does mention that women should not imitate men, and vice versa, and hence many scholars on this assumption, decree that women should let their hair grow longer than the hair of the Prophet, reaching beyond their shoulders, as hadith mentions that the Prophet had his hair between his shoulder and his earlobes.

This was one of the 'five requisites of faith', collectively called Kakars that form the external visible identifiers to clearly affirm a Sikh's commitment and dedication to the order (Hukam) of the tenth master and made one a member of the Khalsa. The Khalsa is the \"Saint-Soldier\" of Guru Gobind Singh who stated the following:\n\"He does not recognize anyone else except One Lord, not even the bestowal of charities, performance of merciful acts, austerities and restraint on pilgrim-stations; the perfect light of the Lord illuminates his heart, then consider him as the immaculate Khalsa.\" (Guru Gobind Singh in the Dasam Granth page 1350)\n\nThe Kesh or unshorn long hair is an indispensable part of the human body as created by waheguru that is the mainstay of the 'Jivan Jaach' and the Rehni that was prescribed by Guru Gobind Singh Sahib by which a Sikh is clearly and quickly identified, Kesh. The kanga, another requisite of faith is usually tucked behind the \"Rishi Knot\" and tied under the turban. The uncut long head hair and the beard in the case of men forms the main kakar for the Sikhs.\n\nKESADHARI, a term defining a Sikh as one who carries on his head the full growth of his kes (hair) which he never trims or cuts for any reason. Anyone, Sikh or non-Sikh, may keep the hair unshorn, but for the Sikh kes, unshorn hair, is a requisite of faith and an inviolable vow. The Sikh Rahit Maryada published by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, statutory body for the control and management of Sikh shrines and by extension for laying down rules about Sikh beliefs and practices, issued in 1945, after long and minute deliberations among Sikh scholars and theologians, defines a Sikh thus:\nEvery Sikh who has been admitted to the rites of amrit, i.e. who has been initiated as a Sikh, must allow his hair to grow to its full length. This also applies to those born of Sikh families but [who] have not yet received the rites of amrit of the tenth master, Guru Gobind Singh.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Personal grooming|Grooming]]\n*[[Haircut]]\n*[[Hair extensions]]\n*[[Hair stick]]\n*[[Lady Godiva]]\n*[[Long hair fetishism]], a form of ''Trichophilia''\n*[[Rapunzel]]\n\n==Images==\n*[[commons:Category:Female long hair in art|Female long hair in art]] (Gallery at Wikimedia commons)\n*[[commons:Category:Female long hair|Female long hair photos]] (Gallery at Wikimedia commons)\n*[[commons:Category:Male long hair in art|Male long hair in art]] (Gallery at Wikimedia commons)\n*[[commons:Category:Male long hair|Male long hair photos]] (Gallery at Wikimedia commons)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |ref=Byrd |last1=Byrd |first1=Ayana |first2=Lori |last2=Tharps |title=Hair Story |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |year=2002 |isbn=0-312-28322-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312283223 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commons category-inline}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{Human hair}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long Hair}}\n[[Category:Hairstyles]]\n[[Category:Pejorative terms for people]]\n[[Category:Heavy metal fashion]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|human head hair|other uses|Longhair (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Young man with long hair (State 1).jpg|230px|right|thumb|A man with shoulder length hair, 1599]]\n[[File:KonkanaBakshi.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A woman with waist length hair]]\n'''Long hair''' is a [[hairstyle]] where the [[head hair]] is allowed to grow to a considerable length.

The ancient Greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long, including [[Zeus]], [[Achilles]], [[Apollo]], and [[Poseidon]]. Greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle. Such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off.  Also, in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle, they were known to cut the front short, but leave it long in the back, where it was more out of reach ([[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]). A widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long, and simply tied it back in a style known as a [[ponytail]] in order to keep it out of their enemies' reach. The ponytail method allowed warriors, who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches, to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice. Around the sixth century, however, the Greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles, with the exception of the Spartans. Women in the culture remained with the longer style, which for them showed freedom, health, and wealth, as well as good behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Irwin |first=M.

The tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle, causing the people to follow.

This could in part be due to the \"man bun\" trend where men pull their shoulder length or longer hair back into a topknot [[Bun (hairstyle)|bun]].\n\n===Americas===\n====Native Americans====\n[[File:Yakima boy.png|thumb|right|[[Yakama people|Yakima]] boy with ''mid-back level'' hair.

Most people would never cut their hair after they became adults, and cutting off one's hair was a penalty for minor crimes. Both men and women would coil up their hair and many hair-coiling styles were developed.\n\nBeginning in 1619, the ethnic [[Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] forced all men in China to adopt the [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]]: a long braid down the back with the hair near the forehead completely shaved. Hair length and style became a life-or-death matter in 1645 as the Manchu told them either their hair or their head would be cut.\nNearly every [[Han Chinese|Han]] rebel group began by shearing this pigtail (most especially in the case of the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping]], who were known in Chinese as the \"Longhairs\"), but the queue on penalty of death lasted until 1911, when the Chinese people cut their queues in unison at a time of rebellion.

Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men as a sign of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as [[Thailand]], and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep their hair short.<ref name=\"reid\"/>\n\nIn rural areas in certain Asian countries, for example India, girls still usually let their hair grow long, and knee-length hair is not unusual.<ref name=Sherrow>Sherrow, Victoria (2006) [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher/page/242 ''Encyclopedia of hair: a cultural history''], Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 242. {{ISBN|0313331456}}</ref>\n\n====Japan====\n[[File:TANASHI CIMG5169.jpg|thumb|Japanese woman with long hair]]\nIn the medieval Japan, [[Heian period|heian]] men were not very interested in a woman's physical beauty and rarely had an opportunity to see it.

The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Yes, and honour it.\" Sometimes Abu Qatada oiled it twice in one day because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him. \"Honour it.\"\n\nWith regards to women, neither Qur'an nor Sunnah explicitly state that women cannot cut their hair. Hadith does mention that women should not imitate men, and vice versa, and hence many scholars on this assumption, decree that women should let their hair grow longer than the hair of the Prophet, reaching beyond their shoulders, as hadith mentions that the Prophet had his hair between his shoulder and his earlobes.

This was one of the 'five requisites of faith', collectively called Kakars that form the external visible identifiers to clearly affirm a Sikh's commitment and dedication to the order (Hukam) of the tenth master and made one a member of the Khalsa. The Khalsa is the \"Saint-Soldier\" of Guru Gobind Singh who stated the following:\n\"He does not recognize anyone else except One Lord, not even the bestowal of charities, performance of merciful acts, austerities and restraint on pilgrim-stations; the perfect light of the Lord illuminates his heart, then consider him as the immaculate Khalsa.\" (Guru Gobind Singh in the Dasam Granth page 1350)\n\nThe Kesh or unshorn long hair is an indispensable part of the human body as created by waheguru that is the mainstay of the 'Jivan Jaach' and the Rehni that was prescribed by Guru Gobind Singh Sahib by which a Sikh is clearly and quickly identified, Kesh. The kanga, another requisite of faith is usually tucked behind the \"Rishi Knot\" and tied under the turban. The uncut long head hair and the beard in the case of men forms the main kakar for the Sikhs.\n\nKESADHARI, a term defining a Sikh as one who carries on his head the full growth of his kes (hair) which he never trims or cuts for any reason. Anyone, Sikh or non-Sikh, may keep the hair unshorn, but for the Sikh kes, unshorn hair, is a requisite of faith and an inviolable vow. The Sikh Rahit Maryada published by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, statutory body for the control and management of Sikh shrines and by extension for laying down rules about Sikh beliefs and practices, issued in 1945, after long and minute deliberations among Sikh scholars and theologians, defines a Sikh thus:\nEvery Sikh who has been admitted to the rites of amrit, i.e. who has been initiated as a Sikh, must allow his hair to grow to its full length. This also applies to those born of Sikh families but [who] have not yet received the rites of amrit of the tenth master, Guru Gobind Singh.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Personal grooming|Grooming]]\n*[[Haircut]]\n*[[Hair extensions]]\n*[[Hair stick]]\n*[[Lady Godiva]]\n*[[Long hair fetishism]], a form of ''Trichophilia''\n*[[Rapunzel]]\n\n==Images==\n*[[commons:Category:Female long hair in art|Female long hair in art]] (Gallery at Wikimedia commons)\n*[[commons:Category:Female long hair|Female long hair photos]] (Gallery at Wikimedia commons)\n*[[commons:Category:Male long hair in art|Male long hair in art]] (Gallery at Wikimedia commons)\n*[[commons:Category:Male long hair|Male long hair photos]] (Gallery at Wikimedia commons)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |ref=Byrd |last1=Byrd |first1=Ayana |first2=Lori |last2=Tharps |title=Hair Story |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |year=2002 |isbn=0-312-28322-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312283223 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commons category-inline}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{Human hair}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long Hair}}\n[[Category:Hairstyles]]\n[[Category:Pejorative terms for people]]\n[[Category:Heavy metal fashion]]\n", "name_user": "41.112.147.148", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I added more information and tips on long hair)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_hair"}

Her capabilities of [[psychokinesis]] were confirmed on the afternoon of that same day when using the powers of her mind to tip over a glass, to the shock of herself and Miss Honey, so Matilda decides to exercise this ability at home by levitating a [[cigar]]. She continues to polish her talent, and learns of Miss Honey's traumatic and unspeakably abusive childhood at the hands of her aunt and guardian, Miss Trunchbull, after her father Magnus' unexpected death. Out of sympathy for Miss Honey's woes, Matilda develops a scheme in revenge against Miss Trunchbull, and in class one day she levitates a piece of chalk to the blackboard while Miss Trunchbull is visiting the room and tormenting the students, posing as the spirit of Magnus and threatening to punish Miss Trunchbull by name if she doesn't leave her inheritance to his daughter. Horrified, she completely vanishes from existence following the events of Matilda's practical joke, leaving her house and worldly possessions to her niece, without any information established relating to her current whereabouts. After the position of headmaster is overtaken by a different teacher, Matilda is relocated to the year six classroom (which was one of the many preventions standing in her way during Miss Trunchbull's tyranny, due to her particular hatred for especially young children and doubts regarding Matilda's genius intelligence), but finds herself unable to summon her psychokinesis one day. Miss Honey suggests that, after her promotion to the year six class, all of the intellect remaining unused in reception  was now being exercised, so as a result Matilda had lost her gift. (However, in the movie, although Matilda ceases using her telekinetic ability quite as frequently as before but because of the more frequent use of her knowledge, she still continues to use it on occasion, whereas in the book she seems to lose it entirely.) Aside from this, Matilda also specializes in the fields of reading and multiplication, having developed an astounding vocabulary and intellect during babyhood that went ignored because of her parents' immense ignorance.\n\n== Portrayals ==\nIn the [[Matilda (1996 film)|1996 film]] Matilda was portrayed by American [[child actor|child actress]] [[Mara Wilson]].

Her capabilities of [[psychokinesis]] were confirmed on the afternoon of that same day when using the powers of her mind to tip over a glass, to the shock of herself and Miss Honey, so Matilda decides to exercise this ability at home by levitating a [[cigar]]. She continues to polish her talent, and learns of Miss Honey's traumatic and unspeakably abusive childhood at the hands of her aunt and guardian, Miss Trunchbull, after her father Magnus' unexpected death. Out of sympathy for Miss Honey's woes, Matilda develops a scheme in revenge against Miss Trunchbull, and in class one day she levitates a piece of chalk to the blackboard while Miss Trunchbull is visiting the room and tormenting the students, posing as the spirit of Magnus and threatening to punish Miss Trunchbull by name if she doesn't leave her inheritance to his daughter. Horrified, she completely vanishes from existence following the events of Matilda's practical joke, leaving her house and worldly possessions to her niece, without any information established relating to her current whereabouts. After the position of headmaster is overtaken by a different teacher, Matilda is relocated to the year six classroom (which was one of the many preventions standing in her way during Miss Trunchbull's tyranny, due to her particular hatred for especially young children and doubts regarding Matilda's genius intelligence), but finds herself unable to summon her psychokinesis one day. Miss Honey suggests that, after her promotion to the year six class, all of the intellect remaining unused in reception  was now being exercised, so as a result Matilda had lost her gift. (However, in the movie, although Matilda ceases using her telekinetic ability quite as frequently as before but because of the more frequent use of her knowledge, she still continues to use it on occasion, whereas in the book she seems to lose it entirely.) Aside from this, Matilda also specializes in the fields of reading and multiplication, having developed an astounding vocabulary and intellect during babyhood that went ignored because of her parents' immense ignorance.\n\n== Portrayals ==\nIn the [[Matilda (1996 film)|1996 film]] Matilda was portrayed by American [[child actor|child actress]] [[Mara Wilson]].

The series is centered on the adventures of Maximum \"Max\" Ride and her family, called the Flock, who are human-avian hybrids born with wings after being experimented on at a lab called The School. The series is a reboot James Patterson's earlier novels ''[[When the Wind Blows (James Patterson novel)|When the Wind Blows]]'' and ''[[The Lake House (novel)|The Lake House]]'', aimed at a younger audience.\n\n==Plot==\n===''[[Maximum Ride: School's Out Forever|School's Out - Forever]]''===\n\nThe Flock is headed towards Washington, D.C., where they hope to find the answers to their origins. They end up being fostered by a former FBI agent and placed into a regular school system to live as \"normal kids.\" Their time here is peaceful and they experience typical teenage drama. They are later attacked by the Erasers and a new unknown enemy, and must flee again to find safety. Max finds out there has been a clone created of herself and intended for Max's destruction, Max II, with whom she must fight or flee from.\n\n===''[[Maximum Ride: The Final Warning|The Final Warning]]''===\n\nThe Flock unites again after finding each other, and they are asked by government officials to contribute their abilities to help a team of scientist study pollution levels in the oceans around Antarctica. flies out of a government meeting set up to decide what the government officials think is best for them. Later, they go to Antarctica at Jeb Batchelder and Dr. Valencia Martinez's request, where a team of scientists needs their assistance in studying ocean pollution levels. While there, a few members of the flock are captured by the Uber Director and taken to Florida. The rest of the group makes their way to rescue them and defeat this new villain, in the midst of a hurricane. Max and Fang begin to solidify a romantic relationship with each other. \n\n===''[[Fang: A Maximum Ride Novel]]''===\n\nThe Flock travels to Africa where they meet Dr. Hans Gunther-Hagen, a former Itex worker, and Dylan, another human-avian hybrid designed to be Max's \"perfect other half\". Dylan joins the Flock, although they are all wary of his motive. Max and Fang are kicked out of the group by Angel who has decided that they are too focused on their personal relationship than the evils they should be fighting. Fang is taken by Dr. Hans and experimented on, he dies for a moment before Max revives him back to life. After getting back to their home, Fang decides to permanently leave the group and start his own Flock. They are all heart-broken.\n\n===''[[Angel: A Maximum Ride Novel]]''===\n\nMax finds out about an organization known as the Doomsday Group is brainwashing people and makes an interest in going to stop this group. Meanwhile, Fang starts his own gang which includes Max's clone, now called Maya. The two teams join forces in Paris, although they don't exactly get along, but they must stop the Doomsday group from killing themselves and hurting others. They devise a plan, but everything goes awry when Gazzy fails to disarm all the bombs under the gathering spot, and the bombs explode while Fang, Gazzy, and Angel are still in the blast radius. Fang and Gazzy make it out safely, but Angel is missing, leaving everyone heartbroken. Angel's epilogue reveals that she is still alive, though her whereabouts remain a mystery.\n\n===''[[Nevermore: The Final Maximum Ride Adventure]]''===\n\nThe story begins when Max and the remaining members of the flock have to go to an ordinary school. Though Max is unhappy about it, she just cannot say no to Dylan. Meanwhile, Fang's gang is caught up when they're attacked by two convoy trucks and some of them are seriously injured and Maya is killed. Fang leaves the rest of his \"gang\" and tells them to move on with their lives, and he goes back to Max with his original Flock. Dylan at this time is under an influence to kill Fang in order to save Max, and the apocalypse is near. He is unable to kill Fang, and the Flock is led by Dr. Martinez to a paradise where they will be safe from the apocalypse and Angel is there to greet them. The apocalypse has taken the form as a virus and various natural disasters, and the Flock is trying to survive. This was supposed to be the last book in the series, but it was announced later that ''Maximum Ride Forever'' would be released in 2015.\n\n===''[[Maximum Ride Forever]]''===\n\nThe ninth book in the Maximum Ride series was announced for release on January 19, 2015, but later had its release date changed to May 4, 2015, later revised to May 18, 2015. Like the previous book, it was advertised as the final book in the series. This plot begins with the Flock splitting up in this post-apocalyptic world to find survivors after the decimation of most populations of people on the planet. Many of their loved ones have died or gone missing. Through out the book they locate their loved ones and fight a new enemy called, Remedy, and his Horseman who have been going around the remaining population of Earth and killing mutants. In a final battle of good and evil, Max defeats Remedy and the Horseman, and all the survivors go into hiding. For four years, the entire army lives in the underground settlement as they let the nuclear winter pass. Once it's safe for them to leave, the mutants travel to Peru where they settle on Incan ruins. The series ends with Phoenix, Max and Fang's four-year-old child, starting her first flying lesson.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main article|List of Maximum Ride characters}}\n\n===Maximum Ride===\n'''Maximum \"Max\" Ride''' is the title character and the primary protagonist of the series. She grew in a lab. She is a 14-year-old (15 in ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and ''Nevermore'') [[Bird|avian]]-human [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] and the leader of the Flock. She plays the part of a mother or \"mamma bird\" in this case. Her hair color has differed throughout the books, being described as dark as sun-streaked brown (''[[MAX: A Maximum Ride Novel|MAX]]'') and as light as blond (''School's Out Forever'', ''[[Maximum Ride: Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports|Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports]]''). She has peachy skin and eyes \"the color of non-barfed chocolate\", according to Angel. Max is 5'8\" and weighs 97 pounds, as described in ''[[Maximum Ride: The Final Warning|The Final Warning]]''. She has a 13-foot wingspan and is half [[Hispanic]] as described in ''[[Maximum Ride: Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports|Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports]]''. Her wings are light tan, with brown spots, and cream and brown streaks. Max's powers are to fly up to 350 mph, she is the strongest of the flock. She has great leadership abilities, is a master fighter, has a voice inside her head that tells her what to do most of the time, and she develops gills at the end of ''[[MAX: A Maximum Ride Novel|MAX]]''. In ''[[MAX: A Maximum Ride Novel|MAX]]'', Max talks with Fang in the desert after talking to him about Nudge wanting to cut her wings off. Later, the Flock meets [[#Dylan|Dylan]], who, according to Dr. Hans Gunther-Hagen, is Max's \"perfect other half\". Max teaches Dylan how to fly and fight. She also notices a slight jealousy from Fang. Max begins to feel an attraction for Dylan when Fang leaves. In ''[[Angel: A Maximum Ride Novel|Angel]]'', she and Dylan, an 8 month old clone with 2% avian DNA, grow closer, confusing her feelings about Fang, who begins to grow closer to Maya, who is Max's clone.\nMax is one of the two members of the Flock who found her parents; Iggy is the other. However, she is the only one to like her parents, as Iggy leaving his after only a week or so (they wanted to put him in a freak sideshow). She is stunned when she learned that Jeb Batchelder (a \"whitecoat\" who helped them escape from the school and then raised them and then suddenly left) was her father. Dr. Valencia Martinez is her biological mother. Max trusts Dr. Martinez completely, but remains wary of Jeb. She is also close to her half-sister, Dr. Martinez's daughter Ella, who Max first meets when trying to save her from some bullies in the first book. Max dislikes Ari (Her half-brother and Jeb's son) until she learns that they're related, with whom she is constantly fighting, but then he joins her \"mini-flock\" that was created in ''[[Maximum Ride: Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports|Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports]]'' for a short (he dies trying to help.) time after rescuing them from the School where they were going to be killed.\n\n===Fang===\n'''Fang''' is 14 years old (15 in the move:'''''Maximum ride'''''). He is second-in-command of the Flock and Max's best friend (later her boyfriend). He is only four months younger than Max. Fang is able to virtually disappear by staying very still and quiet. He is somewhat stronger than the rest of the flock, often sustaining near-fatal wounds, as in books one and two. Fang almost always wears dark clothing and always seems to be sneaking up on Max. He has dark, blue/black hair and eyes with olive skin. He is believed to have DNA of a raven because of his black wings that have a purple/blue shimmer. He has a fourteen-foot wingspan. In ''The Angel Experiment'', he found out that the School took him after he was born. When his mother had him the doctors told her that he had died. Fang decided that he didn't want to find his mother, she wasn't much older than his own age when she had him. He is somewhat reserved, but cares deeply about the Flock. He is usually very silent, and seems quite mysterious, always hiding his feelings.\nHe runs a blog about the Flock's adventures that proves useful in several books, such as in ''School's Out\u2014Forever''. In ''The Angel Experiment'', Max kisses Fang when he is injured. In ''School's Out\u2014Forever'', he is seen kissing the \"Red-Haired Wonder,\" Lisa. He and Max fight about this, but afterwards they make up. In ''Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports'', he kisses Max. In ''The Final Warning'', Fang seems to like Dr. Brigid Dwyer, who worked with the Flock in their mission to Antarctica, and Max becomes jealous resulting in tension between the two. In ''Saving The World And Other Extreme Sports'', when Ari joins the flock, Fang decides to lead half of the Flock and leaves Max with her half-brother. He later comes back, reuniting at the end of an epic battle made up of an army of his blog's followers, in which Ari \"expires\". Fang leaves the Flock again at the end of ''Fang'' because of Dylan, Max's \"perfect other half\", and because Angel has predicted that Fang would be the first to die; therefore, because he knows that by dying, he would put the others in danger, he leaves. Everyone is upset by this, especially Max, but she finds a letter later that he wrote to her saying that if in 20 years, the world hasn't come to an end, he'll meet her on the cliff where they learned to fly like the hawks.\n\nIn ''Angel'', Fang becomes the leader of a new Flock (aka 'Fang's Gang') which includes Ratchet, Star, Kate, Holden, and Maya (Max's clone), who help him try to stop the Doomsday Group. When he realizes he cannot stop the Doomsday Group on his own, he enlists the help of Max's Flock. Max and Fang seem to grow apart and start to like different people. Also, Fang starts having feelings for Maya, trying to replace Max. However, he then realizes that Maya is different from Max, and begins to treat her differently, although in his heart, he still loves Max. After the planned D-day, Fang leaves with his flock, leaving Max and her flock in the rubble of Paris, searching for Angel (who is missing).\n\nIn \"Nevermore\", Fang hears the 'Voice' and comes back for Max, after breaking one of his wings. He and Max grow back together after he comes back and abandons his 'Gang'. It takes some time, but eventually they love each other again. Fang manages to kill several erasers and see Dylan kill Ari. It is after that, when Dylan attempts to kill Fang, Max really realizes that she wants to be with Fang for the rest of her life. When Doctor Martinez (Max's mother) takes them and the Flock to a paradise island, he and Max resume their previous relationship. When he and Max escape to a perfect perch, he tells her that he loves her for the first time, just before they are hit by a tsunami. When they are both rescued, Max tells Fang that she loves him as well.\n\nFang dies in \"Maximum Ride Forever\", but he is revived when Dylan sacrifices himself for him to live and Max to be happy. Fang and Max then have a baby girl named Phoenix.\n\n=== Iggy ===\n'''Iggy''' is 14 years old, six months younger than Max (15 in the last three books), and third-in-command of the Flock. He is usually sarcastic, 6'0\", has extremely pale skin, whitish-strawberry blond hair, very light icy blue eyes, and a wingspan of 14 feet. Iggy is described as very handsome, especially because of his \"unseeing, yet captivating, eyes\". He is one of the only two flock members to have met his parents, the other being Max. His real name is revealed to be '''James Griffiths'''. When he found his parents, he learned that he was kidnapped by the School when he was about 4 months old. At first, Iggy decides to leave the Flock to live with his parents, but later leaves when he learns that his parents didn't want to have him back and only wanted to use him to make money off his story. Due to the whitecoats' experiments to enhance his night vision, Iggy is effectively blind, though he can see if his surroundings are white and can identify people by feeling their fingerprints and the feel of their wings. He can also feel colors. Despite his blindness, the Flock often leave things up to him that require precision or detail, such as cooking and doctoring. His senses are also the best of the flock due to his blindness, although he occasionally suffers resentment of his blindness and the resulting dependency of the Flock it creates. He and The Gasman are best friends and have a habit of building bombs out of almost anything and blowing things up, including alarm clocks. Iggy and Ella, Max's half sister, also showed signs of growing affection towards one another in ''Angel'', which ultimately culminated in a shared kiss in ''Nevermore''.\n\n=== Nudge ===\n'''Nudge''' is 11 years old (12 in ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and ''Nevermore''), has brown skin, and has wild, curly, long, dark brown hair. Described as Max's best supporter and the peacemaker, she likes Max over Fang and can't live without her. Her wings are often said to be tawny-brown, almost cream. Her real name is revealed to be '''Monique''', and she managed to track down who she believes to be her mother because of the resemblance in skin tone, but never meets her because she is attacked by Ari. She is a \"motormouth\" as said by Max several times in the books. The Flock calls her the Nudge Channel because when she's awake it's \"all Nudge, all the time.\" She likes fashion, especially about hair, clothes, and make-up. Nudge can hack into computers with her ability to sense leftover emotions, also called psychometric, and she can draw metal towards her by will, like a magnet. Of the flock, Nudge is the one who most longs for the normality of the lives of other kids their age; in ''MAX'', when Jeb offers the Flock to stay at a day and night school, Nudge wants to stay and get her wings cut off.\n\n===The Gasman (Gazzy)===\n'''The Gasman (Gazzy)''' is 8 years old (9 in ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and ''Nevermore'') with blond hair, blue eyes, tan/light brown wings with a 10-foot wingspan. He is Angel's biological older brother, and they are the only blood related siblings of the Flock. He has a mischievous nature and makes fun of Max sometimes. He and Iggy are experts at constructing and setting off bombs and explosives, as Max states, \"You could lock the Gasman in a padded cell with some dental floss and a bowl of Jell-O, and he'd find a way to make something explode.\" It is revealed that his parents sold both him and Angel, his younger sister, to the School when they were very young. The Gasman's most useful ability is to perfectly mimic any voice. Max and Fang find a picture of baby Gazzy when they go check out what they think was Gazzy and Angel's old residence; the Flock sees the picture many times accidentally and sometimes purposefully throughout the series. He is called The Gasman because he passes gas a great deal, owing to a problem with his digestive system. Additionally, he later develops a \"skill\": he can produce large \"mushroom-shaped\" clouds of gas which stink horrendously.\n\n=== Angel ===\n'''Angel''' is 6 years old (7 in ''The Final Warning'', ''Max'', ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and ''Nevermore''), with blue eyes and curly blonde hair. Angel is also the biological sister of The Gasman (Gazzy). Her wings are pure white and are 8&nbsp;ft (9&nbsp;ft in Fang) across. She obtains seemingly random powers at random times, but her most eminent power, lasting throughout the series, is the ability to read and control minds.\n\nIn ''The Angel Experiment'', she uses her powers to convince a woman to buy her an expensive teddy bear that she names Celeste. She acquires the ability to hold her breath underwater and swim in deep water at pressures that would crush a normal human as well as change her appearance into a 'bird of paradise' form and change her skin and eye color; however, after the initial introduction, this power is never mentioned again, except when she gets trapped under a snow pile in ''The Final Warning'', but the attempt was unsuccessful. She is usually mistaken to be powerless and innocent, but she is truly extremely intelligent and dangerous. Her ability to control people's minds gives her extreme power.\n\nIn ''Fang'', Angel believes that she is the strongest of the Flock, and holds a vote, temporarily kicking Max out of the group. She also has a 'Voice' in her head, like Max, but the Flock is unaware of this. Angel is portrayed as calculating, ruthless, and unstable in ''Fang'', and has pointed a gun at Max to make enemies back off.\n\nIn ''Angel'', she seems to have calmed some of the extreme changes of her personality that occurred in ''Fang'', and helps Max to balance her feelings for Fang and Dylan. She appears to be content with her role and no longer bids for power, but advises Max, who is still suspicious of her. In the end, she volunteers to go undercover in a new evil organization (The Doomsday Group). She goes missing after she and Gazzy fail to defuse a bomb, and the others think she is dead. In fact, she is being held captive in an unknown location, and is continually told she is \"most superior\".\n\nIn ''Nevermore'', Angel is captured by The School again. After many tests, they show Angel a video. Angel starts to cry as she realizes the video is of Iggy's operation that has left him permanently blind. She watches the scientists prod and cut open Iggy's eyes until a whitecoat tells her they will be performing the same operation on her. After the operation, Angel loses her sight temporarily and nearly dies in a fire until Max and the Flock come to save her. When they escape to a 'tropical paradise', the world is being destroyed and she admits to Max she is the Voice, and she has been for years.\n\nIn ''Maximum Ride Forever'', Angel, at first distrusted by Max but eventually called her \"little prophet\", leads an army of survivors and mutants against the Remedy after being shown visions on the apocalypse the Remedy caused.\n\n===Dylan===\n'''Dylan''' is an avian-human hybrid who joins the Flock in ''Fang''. He is said to be Max's \"perfect other half\", causing Max to refer to him as \"Mr. Perfect\", although Max and Fang are quite in love when they meet. He is six foot two inches tall with a 15-foot wingspan and chocolate colored wings, and is usually described as handsome, with dark-blond hair and turquoise eyes, and is said to have a beautiful singing voice. He is in love with Max, but he was programmed by the scientists to feel that way. Because of this, he and Fang do not see eye-to-eye until the end of ''Nevermore''. He was also made in a lab, created from a clone of a boy who had died in a car accident in the country of Canada. He is 8 months old in ''Fang.'' He learns how to fly when Max teaches him by pushing him off a roof. His relationship with Max is complicated, but she does eventually start to like him. In ''Fang'' he is portrayed as somewhat meek, but appears to grow a backbone, even arguing with Max in ''Angel.'' The most notable argument in ''Angel'' starts at the beginning of the book with Dylan and Max arguing about how miserable Max has been since Fang left her. Dylan can heal himself almost instantly by placing his own saliva on his wounds and putting pressure on it. In addition, he has extremely good vision and [[clairvoyance]].\n\nIn ''Angel'', Max finds a new appreciation for Dylan, and a romance is sparked, though Max is usually confused and therefore harsh. The first time Max allows Dylan to comfort her is in the desert where they embrace. Although she is confused, she allows him to get closer and closer to her.\n\nLater, in the book ''Nevermore'', Dylan is told by a 'Voice' that he must capture Max's heart with all his might, so he takes her to a treehouse he made himself and kisses her then. Later, Fang re-appears after his own clan had been destroyed and Max realizes her mistake, choosing to be with Fang instead of a clone with programmed feelings. Dylan goes on a rampage, destroying part of a town and even attempting to kill Fang. Dylan is nowhere to be seen, so Dr. Martinez seizes her chance and whisks the original flock to a tropical paradise. Dylan appears and states that he will be there for Max when the world ends so they would die together. Max is irked but doesn't respond to him. Since a meteor is coming to demolish the planet, Dylan goes to herd mutant hybrid kids into elaborate caves. In the end, Dylan helps pull Max from the water after the apocalypse.\n\nIn ''Maximum Ride Forever'', Dylan is seemingly killed but in reality is kidnapped by the Remedy and turned into a Horseman. However, he becomes aware that the transformation was not successful as he still has free will; when tasked to kill the flock, instead of doing so, he fakes their deaths so that no other Horseman will be sent to truly kill them. Eventually, Dylan despairingly but solemnly accepts that Max will always love Fang and he cannot be with her. He decides to sacrifice himself to bring Fang back to life in order to make Max happy.\n\n===Phoenix===\n'''Phoenix''' is the daughter of Fang and Max, conceived and born in the ninth book, ''Maximum Ride Forever''. Phoenix has Fang's black hair and wings and Max's brown eyes, though her wings are more blue-ish and her eyes are light. The series ends with Phoenix receiving her first flying lesson.\n\n===Total===\n'''Total''' is a black Scottie whom Angel saves from the Institute at the end of ''The Angel Experiment''. He is described to have the characteristics of a Scottish terrier. When Total is rescued from the Institute, he is described as looking similar to Toto from The Wizard of Oz, which would make him a Cairn terrier. Total's character is not fully developed until ''School's Out Forever'', when it is discovered that he has the ability to talk. He is often humorous and dramatic, exemplified when he gets shot in the tail and isn't hurt largely, but still exaggerates the injury. Despite his dramatic nature, he can be mature when he wants to be and will not tolerate getting treated like a normal dog- even going as far as eating at the table with the rest of the flock. In the end of ''Fang'', Total marries Akila, an Alaskan Malamute whom he met in Antarctica in ''[[Maximum Ride: The Final Warning]]''. It is discovered Total thinks [[Tricia Helfer]] is hot in ''Angel'' when they are going to go to the ComicCon in San Diego. He is known to be a fan of culture, including theater and cuisine. He has the ability to jump to great heights, and eventually grows his own tiny wings. Total is very loyal to Angel because she is the one that found him in an underground lab in N.Y.C.\n\n===Akila===\n'''Akila''' is an 80-pound Alaskan Malamute with no special powers who meets Total in Antarctica in ''The Final Warning'' and becomes Total's wife in the end of ''Fang''. She belongs to Dr. Papa, one of the scientists on the boat that the flock took to Antarctica. Akila is killed by Cryenas in the final book in the series, \"Maximum Ride Forever\".\n\n=== Dr. Jeb Batchelder ===\n'''Jebediah Batchelder''' is a scientist, and part of the group (the 'School') that experimented on Max and the rest of the flock. He is 73 in the series, but that isn't confirmed by any character. He used to work at the School where the Flock was experimented on, but felt compassion for them and later broke them out and let them live with him. He lived with the Flock deep in the mountains for four years, where he taught them basic survival skills and how to fight so they can defend themselves. Max refers to Jeb as the closest thing she had ever had to a father, although later her feelings for him are mixed. Jeb then disappeared, leaving the Flock alone to fend for themselves. The Flock thought Jeb was dead, but he reappeared later in the first book. In ''The Angel Experiment'', the flock discovers Jeb back at the School when they are recaptured. This initially leads the Flock to believe that he is a traitor, but he later comes back to the Flock and helps them on numerous occasions. Jeb is Ari's and Max's biological father. Max does not trust him after discovering his identity. Jeb is shot in the sixth book, but he is shown to be making a steady recovery. Though Jeb and Dr. Martinez are Max's biological parents, there is only a professional relationship between them. Max trusts Dr. Martinez, but is usually wary of Jeb. Jeb donated his chromosomes, which were matched with those of Dr. Martinez to create Max. In ''Angel'', Jeb tells Max she needs to breed with Dylan after the world ends, and later goes missing with Max's mother. Once Max thought Jeb was the Voice in her head, but in ''The Final Warning'', he reveals he \"can do the voice, but isn't the voice\", confusing Max. Jeb keeps telling her things are tests. Throughout the entire series, Max's feelings towards Jeb are conflicted, ranging from a familial love to ultimate hatred. These feelings are ultimately challenged in ''Maximum Ride Forever'' when Max encounters Jeb helping the Remedy in Himmel. Upon realizing his part in destroying the world, Max begins strangling him but cannot bring herself to kill him; after letting him down, Jeb tazes her and threatens to inject her with the \"upgrading\" serum, but he is killed by Fang's gang who came to rescue her.\n\n=== The Erasers ===\n'''The Erasers''', created by the School in Death Valley, are half-human, half-wolf hybrids that were bred by the School to be guards, but their larger mission later involves hunting down and even killing the members of the Flock. Their powers are superhuman strength, but they also eventually gain wings that are crudely grafted onto their shoulder blades. They have a life span of about 4 years to reach maturity and approximately a year or two to hunt the Flock. Jeb's son, Ari, who was turned into an Eraser at a very young age, is one of the last to die when Itex 'retires' all of the Erasers and replaces them with the Flyboys, robotic Erasers with synthetic skin attached to their robotic structure. The Erasers are originally killed off because they 'expire' very quickly, but they make a surprise appearance in ''Fang'' when they attack all of the flock but Max and Fang, who are not at the house with the others. It is believed that when Itex was disbanded, some scientists took Eraser DNA with them, creating these new Erasers, though they are never mentioned after the events of the surprise battle. They are always armed, but rarely use their weapons after ''The Angel Experiment'' and later novels in the series.\n\n===Ari Batchelder===\n'''Ari''' is Jeb's son who was turned into an Eraser when Jeb was helping the Flock escape from the school. In ''The Angel Experiment'', he was once killed by Max in the sewers of New York but gets revived in the second book. He thought his father Jeb Batchelder didn't care about him, which is part of the reason that he hated Max out of jealousy and chased and terrorized the Flock. However, it is later confirmed that Jeb does care about Ari, because in ''The Angel Experiment'', after Max has fought with and killed Ari, Jeb cries for Ari and calls after Max, telling her that she has killed her own brother. He is Max's younger half-brother since they have the same father, Jeb. When Ari was only seven, the whitecoats used him as an experiment to see if Erasers would be stronger if they were mutated after birth. The wolf DNA turned Ari into a \"super-eraser,\" although he is always partially morphed. Ari came back to life and was grafted with wings according to ''Saving The World And Other Extreme Sports.'' According to Angel, Ari loved and hated Max at the same time. In ''Saving The World And Other Extreme Sports'' , Max and Fang get into a fight because after Ari broke them out of the School, Max was convinced that he was no longer evil. The Flock splits up: Max, Nudge, Angel, Total, and Ari go to Europe, while Fang, Iggy, and Gazzy go to Hollywood. Max and the gang go to the Itex headquarters in Germany, where there is a super-mutant named Omega. Ari tries to help Max fight him, but then his expiration date kicks in and he suddenly dies in Max's arms, only living until the age of seven. As his father creates yet another clone of him, Ari returns in Nevermore, showing up with other Erasers with the intent to take out Fang's Gang. Several times he tries to kill Fang, but in the end he is killed for good.\n\n===Dr. Hans Gunther-Hagen===\n'''Gunther-Hagen''' is a scientist the Flock meets in ''Fang,'' where he introduces Dylan to the rest of the Flock. He is the main antagonist in both ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and later ''Maximum Ride Forever'', constantly telling Max that she needs to join forces with him to save the world . He creates a lot of tension in the Flock. Max constantly makes fun of his name, calling him things like Dr. G-H, Dr. Haagen-Dazs, Dr. God, Dr. Disaster, etc. He created Dylan, wrote a book, and makes the shocking suggestion that Max and Dylan should come to live with him to Germany in order to \"breed\" (have children) or create the start of Max's \"dynasty\". He also has some special abilities such as instantly healing from illnesses and regenerating small extremities, such as fingers.\n\nHe was Dylan's caretaker until Dylan joined the Flock.\n\nIn ''Maximum Ride Forever'', he becomes known as the Remedy and builds a large underground shelter in Russia known as Himmel. He develops a serum known as \"upgrading\" which turns his subjects into \"Horsemen\", genetically improving them, making them stronger and increasing their senses but removing their free will. He allowed the meteor to strike the earth in ''Nevermore'' and kill millions of people in an attempt to eradicate the genetically \"imperfect\" in order to populate the earth with his genetically \"perfect\" creations. He uses his Horsemen to kill the imperfect mutants still living on earth, including the flock. He desperately tries to kill Max and her developing baby to keep her imperfect genes from spreading, but is then killed by Max when she drops him over the ocean.\n\n===Dr. Valencia Martinez===\n'''Dr. Valencia Martinez''' is a Hispanic veterinarian that lives in Arizona and helps Max when she (Max) is hurt in ''The Angel Experiment'' after helping Dr. Valencia's daughter, Ella, escape from bullies. When Dr. Martinez gives Max an x-ray, Max finds that there is a microchip embedded in her arm, which leads her to believe that the School is tracing the Flock with her microchip. In ''Saving The World And Other Extreme Sports,'' Max goes to Dr. Martinez to have the microchip removed, where she is put under the influence of Valium for the first time and admits her feelings for Fang. Max then loses use of her arm. Dr. Martinez is a strong-willed woman who goes to great lengths to help Max. It is later revealed that it was she who donated the egg that created Max, making her Max's mother. She also has a pet dog named Magnolia. In ''The Final Warning,'' the Flock is given the opportunity to go to Antarctica to help a group of scientists that are trying to save the world as well. In the following book, ''Max,'' Dr. Martinez is held hostage on a submarine, leading to a rescue mission by the Flock and some of the good scientists they met in Antarctica. Max trusts Dr. Martinez and trusts her judgment, which allows her to understand some things she is blind to. We later find out that Dr. Valencia Martinez was working with the white coats, and doctor Gunther-Hagen in the book ''Nevermore''. When Fang comes back after departing from Colorado, forming ''Fang's gang'', being betrayed by Kate and Star, arriving again, and being attacked by failure eraser copies of Ari, led by successful Ari copy, and Jeb, hurting Jeb, it is revealed that she was persuaded by Jeb, in a sort of spell, but still isn't to be full trusted by Angels' mind reading skills before they go to the tropical paradise islands with tree houses, used as a sanctuary made by Dr. Valencia Martinez, and Nino Pierpont, the richest man in the world, among others.  Dr. Valencia Martinez died when the large tsunami hit.\n\n===Ella Martinez===\n'''Ella Martinez''' is Dr. Martinez's other child, making her Max's half-sister. Max met her in ''The Angel Experiment'' when she saved her from bullies. Ella got away but Max was shot and had to go to Ella's house to get help. Ella is proven trustworthy. By the end of [[Nevermore: The Final Maximum Ride Adventure]], she had become a lover to Iggy. They had started flirting in ANGEL, right before DoomsDay brainwashed Ella, and briefly Iggy. Like her mother, Ella drowned below ground when the tsunami hit in Nevermore.\n\n===The Director===\n\"The Director\" or Marian Janssen was the leader of the ITEX industries. In her appearance in the third book, she posed as Max's mom, in order to get under her skin and learn her greatest secrets, to eventually eliminate all not \"advanced\" humans. Max originally dropped her from a great height, but she had sympathy for her and saved her.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment]]'' received generally positive reviews. The ''[[School Library Journal]]'' called the book an \"exciting [[science fiction|SF]] thriller that's not wholly original but still a compelling read\".<ref name=\"amazon\">[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/031615556X Amazon.com: Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment: James Patterson: Books: Editorial Reviews <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ''[[Booklist]]'' described it as \"an action-packed cross between [[Gertrude Chandler Warner]]'s ''[[Boxcar Children]]'' and Marvel Comics' ''[[X-Men]]''.<ref name=\"amazon\"/> John Ritchie of the ''ALAN Review'' wrote a negative review, saying that Patterson \"slips in his attempt to write an action-adventure series for kids\".

The series is centered on the adventures of Maximum \"Max\" Ride and her family, called the Flock, who are human-avian hybrids born with wings after being experimented on at a lab called The School. The series is a reboot James Patterson's earlier novels ''[[When the Wind Blows (James Patterson novel)|When the Wind Blows]]'' and ''[[The Lake House (novel)|The Lake House]]'', aimed at a younger audience.\n\n==Plot==\n===''[[Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment|The Angel Experiment]]''===\nThe first book in the fantasy series gives an overview of the Flock: Maximum \"Max\" Ride (the leader), Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman, and Angel, all children respectively ranging from 14 to 6 years old. They are genetically altered beings born with wings, essentially a human-avian hybrid. This book primarily focuses on the abduction of the youngest member, Angel, and the rest of the Flock's noble quest to find and save the youngest member of their family, while fighting a number of obstacles including physical ailments, natural disaster, fighting Erasers (human-wolf hybrid creatures) and the evil scientists at the experimental lab called, \"The School\".\n\n===''[[Maximum Ride: School's Out Forever|School's Out - Forever]]''===\n\nThe Flock is headed towards Washington, D.C., where they hope to find the answers to their origins. They end up being fostered by a former FBI agent and placed into a regular school system to live as \"normal kids.\" Their time here is peaceful and they experience typical teenage drama. They are later attacked by the Erasers and a new unknown enemy, and must flee again to find safety. Max finds out there has been a clone created of herself and intended for Max's destruction, Max II, with whom she must fight or flee from.\n\n===''[[Maximum Ride: Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports|Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports]]''===\n\nThe Flock must save the world from the Itexicon Corporation  who plan to destroy all genetically modified beings and destroy half of the world's population. The Flock is captured and they must find a way to escape and stop the Corporation's evil plan. There is debate among the group to decide if they want to escape from their newly found super-hero like duties and to just worry about their own needs, and the other side that feels they have a purpose in helping fight the evil in the world. Ultimately, this causes a rift and the boys of the Flock split from the girls in their disagreement, and leave without any contact.\n\n===''[[Maximum Ride: The Final Warning|The Final Warning]]''===\n\nThe Flock unites again after finding each other, and they are asked by government officials to contribute their abilities to help a team of scientist study pollution levels in the oceans around Antarctica. flies out of a government meeting set up to decide what the government officials think is best for them. Later, they go to Antarctica at Jeb Batchelder and Dr. Valencia Martinez's request, where a team of scientists needs their assistance in studying ocean pollution levels. While there, a few members of the flock are captured by the Uber Director and taken to Florida. The rest of the group makes their way to rescue them and defeat this new villain, in the midst of a hurricane. Max and Fang begin to solidify a romantic relationship with each other. \n\n===''[[MAX: A Maximum Ride Novel]]''===\n\nThe Flock is attacked by a group of bionic robots (which Max nicknames M-Geeks) at environmental awareness shows in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Mexico City]]. Later, the government enlists their help in finding out what is destroying hundreds of ships and killing millions of fish off the coast of [[Hawaii]]. Max is also looking for her mother who mysteriously disappears from the safe house. A mysterious creature mutant appears near the sub so Angel unexpectedly dives out to have a chat with it. It ends up helping the gang. During this mission, Max, Fang, and the others discover many other abilities, like breathing under water.\n\n===''[[Fang: A Maximum Ride Novel]]''===\n\nThe Flock travels to Africa where they meet Dr. Hans Gunther-Hagen, a former Itex worker, and Dylan, another human-avian hybrid designed to be Max's \"perfect other half\". Dylan joins the Flock, although they are all wary of his motive. Max and Fang are kicked out of the group by Angel who has decided that they are too focused on their personal relationship than the evils they should be fighting. Fang is taken by Dr. Hans and experimented on, he dies for a moment before Max revives him back to life. After getting back to their home, Fang decides to permanently leave the group and start his own Flock. They are all heart-broken.\n\n===''[[Angel: A Maximum Ride Novel]]''===\n\nMax finds out about an organization known as the Doomsday Group is brainwashing people and makes an interest in going to stop this group. Meanwhile, Fang starts his own gang which includes Max's clone, now called Maya. The two teams join forces in Paris, although they don't exactly get along, but they must stop the Doomsday group from killing themselves and hurting others. They devise a plan, but everything goes awry when Gazzy fails to disarm all the bombs under the gathering spot, and the bombs explode while Fang, Gazzy, and Angel are still in the blast radius. Fang and Gazzy make it out safely, but Angel is missing, leaving everyone heartbroken. Angel's epilogue reveals that she is still alive, though her whereabouts remain a mystery.\n\n===''[[Nevermore: The Final Maximum Ride Adventure]]''===\n\nThe story begins when Max and the remaining members of the flock have to go to an ordinary school. Though Max is unhappy about it, she just cannot say no to Dylan. Meanwhile, Fang's gang is caught up when they're attacked by two convoy trucks and some of them are seriously injured and Maya is killed. Fang leaves the rest of his \"gang\" and tells them to move on with their lives, and he goes back to Max with his original Flock. Dylan at this time is under an influence to kill Fang in order to save Max, and the apocalypse is near. He is unable to kill Fang, and the Flock is led by Dr. Martinez to a paradise where they will be safe from the apocalypse and Angel is there to greet them. The apocalypse has taken the form as a virus and various natural disasters, and the Flock is trying to survive. This was supposed to be the last book in the series, but it was announced later that ''Maximum Ride Forever'' would be released in 2015.\n\n===''[[Maximum Ride Forever]]''===\n\nThe ninth book in the Maximum Ride series was announced for release on January 19, 2015, but later had its release date changed to May 4, 2015, later revised to May 18, 2015. Like the previous book, it was advertised as the final book in the series. This plot begins with the Flock splitting up in this post-apocalyptic world to find survivors after the decimation of most populations of people on the planet. Many of their loved ones have died or gone missing. Through out the book they locate their loved ones and fight a new enemy called, Remedy, and his Horseman who have been going around the remaining population of Earth and killing mutants. In a final battle of good and evil, Max defeats Remedy and the Horseman, and all the survivors go into hiding. For four years, the entire army lives in the underground settlement as they let the nuclear winter pass. Once it's safe for them to leave, the mutants travel to Peru where they settle on Incan ruins. The series ends with Phoenix, Max and Fang's four-year-old child, starting her first flying lesson.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main article|List of Maximum Ride characters}}\n\n===Maximum Ride===\n'''Maximum \"Max\" Ride''' is the title character and the primary protagonist of the series. She grew in a lab. She is a 14-year-old (15 in ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and ''Nevermore'') [[Bird|avian]]-human [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] and the leader of the Flock. She plays the part of a mother or \"mamma bird\" in this case. Her hair color has differed throughout the books, being described as dark as sun-streaked brown (''[[MAX: A Maximum Ride Novel|MAX]]'') and as light as blond (''School's Out Forever'', ''[[Maximum Ride: Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports|Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports]]''). She has peachy skin and eyes \"the color of non-barfed chocolate\", according to Angel. Max is 5'8\" and weighs 97 pounds, as described in ''[[Maximum Ride: The Final Warning|The Final Warning]]''. She has a 13-foot wingspan and is half [[Hispanic]] as described in ''[[Maximum Ride: Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports|Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports]]''. Her wings are light tan, with brown spots, and cream and brown streaks. Max's powers are to fly up to 350 mph, she is the strongest of the flock. She has great leadership abilities, is a master fighter, has a voice inside her head that tells her what to do most of the time, and she develops gills at the end of ''[[MAX: A Maximum Ride Novel|MAX]]''. In ''[[MAX: A Maximum Ride Novel|MAX]]'', Max talks with Fang in the desert after talking to him about Nudge wanting to cut her wings off. Later, the Flock meets [[#Dylan|Dylan]], who, according to Dr. Hans Gunther-Hagen, is Max's \"perfect other half\". Max teaches Dylan how to fly and fight. She also notices a slight jealousy from Fang. Max begins to feel an attraction for Dylan when Fang leaves. In ''[[Angel: A Maximum Ride Novel|Angel]]'', she and Dylan, an 8 month old clone with 2% avian DNA, grow closer, confusing her feelings about Fang, who begins to grow closer to Maya, who is Max's clone.\nMax is one of the two members of the Flock who found her parents; Iggy is the other. However, she is the only one to like her parents, as Iggy leaving his after only a week or so (they wanted to put him in a freak sideshow). She is stunned when she learned that Jeb Batchelder (a \"whitecoat\" who helped them escape from the school and then raised them and then suddenly left) was her father. Dr. Valencia Martinez is her biological mother. Max trusts Dr. Martinez completely, but remains wary of Jeb. She is also close to her half-sister, Dr. Martinez's daughter Ella, who Max first meets when trying to save her from some bullies in the first book. Max dislikes Ari (Her half-brother and Jeb's son) until she learns that they're related, with whom she is constantly fighting, but then he joins her \"mini-flock\" that was created in ''[[Maximum Ride: Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports|Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports]]'' for a short (he dies trying to help.) time after rescuing them from the School where they were going to be killed.\n\n===Fang===\n'''Fang''' is 14 years old (15 in the move:'''''Maximum ride'''''). He is second-in-command of the Flock and Max's best friend (later her boyfriend). He is only four months younger than Max. Fang is able to virtually disappear by staying very still and quiet. He is somewhat stronger than the rest of the flock, often sustaining near-fatal wounds, as in books one and two. Fang almost always wears dark clothing and always seems to be sneaking up on Max. He has dark, blue/black hair and eyes with olive skin. He is believed to have DNA of a raven because of his black wings that have a purple/blue shimmer. He has a fourteen-foot wingspan. In ''The Angel Experiment'', he found out that the School took him after he was born. When his mother had him the doctors told her that he had died. Fang decided that he didn't want to find his mother, she wasn't much older than his own age when she had him. He is somewhat reserved, but cares deeply about the Flock. He is usually very silent, and seems quite mysterious, always hiding his feelings.\nHe runs a blog about the Flock's adventures that proves useful in several books, such as in ''School's Out\u2014Forever''. In ''The Angel Experiment'', Max kisses Fang when he is injured. In ''School's Out\u2014Forever'', he is seen kissing the \"Red-Haired Wonder,\" Lisa. He and Max fight about this, but afterwards they make up. In ''Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports'', he kisses Max. In ''The Final Warning'', Fang seems to like Dr. Brigid Dwyer, who worked with the Flock in their mission to Antarctica, and Max becomes jealous resulting in tension between the two. In ''Saving The World And Other Extreme Sports'', when Ari joins the flock, Fang decides to lead half of the Flock and leaves Max with her half-brother. He later comes back, reuniting at the end of an epic battle made up of an army of his blog's followers, in which Ari \"expires\". Fang leaves the Flock again at the end of ''Fang'' because of Dylan, Max's \"perfect other half\", and because Angel has predicted that Fang would be the first to die; therefore, because he knows that by dying, he would put the others in danger, he leaves. Everyone is upset by this, especially Max, but she finds a letter later that he wrote to her saying that if in 20 years, the world hasn't come to an end, he'll meet her on the cliff where they learned to fly like the hawks.\n\nIn ''Angel'', Fang becomes the leader of a new Flock (aka 'Fang's Gang') which includes Ratchet, Star, Kate, Holden, and Maya (Max's clone), who help him try to stop the Doomsday Group. When he realizes he cannot stop the Doomsday Group on his own, he enlists the help of Max's Flock. Max and Fang seem to grow apart and start to like different people. Also, Fang starts having feelings for Maya, trying to replace Max. However, he then realizes that Maya is different from Max, and begins to treat her differently, although in his heart, he still loves Max. After the planned D-day, Fang leaves with his flock, leaving Max and her flock in the rubble of Paris, searching for Angel (who is missing).\n\nIn \"Nevermore\", Fang hears the 'Voice' and comes back for Max, after breaking one of his wings. He and Max grow back together after he comes back and abandons his 'Gang'. It takes some time, but eventually they love each other again. Fang manages to kill several erasers and see Dylan kill Ari. It is after that, when Dylan attempts to kill Fang, Max really realizes that she wants to be with Fang for the rest of her life. When Doctor Martinez (Max's mother) takes them and the Flock to a paradise island, he and Max resume their previous relationship. When he and Max escape to a perfect perch, he tells her that he loves her for the first time, just before they are hit by a tsunami. When they are both rescued, Max tells Fang that she loves him as well.\n\nFang dies in \"Maximum Ride Forever\", but he is revived when Dylan sacrifices himself for him to live and Max to be happy. Fang and Max then have a baby girl named Phoenix.\n\n=== Iggy ===\n'''Iggy''' is 14 years old, six months younger than Max (15 in the last three books), and third-in-command of the Flock. He is usually sarcastic, 6'0\", has extremely pale skin, whitish-strawberry blond hair, very light icy blue eyes, and a wingspan of 14 feet. Iggy is described as very handsome, especially because of his \"unseeing, yet captivating, eyes\". He is one of the only two flock members to have met his parents, the other being Max. His real name is revealed to be '''James Griffiths'''. When he found his parents, he learned that he was kidnapped by the School when he was about 4 months old. At first, Iggy decides to leave the Flock to live with his parents, but later leaves when he learns that his parents didn't want to have him back and only wanted to use him to make money off his story. Due to the whitecoats' experiments to enhance his night vision, Iggy is effectively blind, though he can see if his surroundings are white and can identify people by feeling their fingerprints and the feel of their wings. He can also feel colors. Despite his blindness, the Flock often leave things up to him that require precision or detail, such as cooking and doctoring. His senses are also the best of the flock due to his blindness, although he occasionally suffers resentment of his blindness and the resulting dependency of the Flock it creates. He and The Gasman are best friends and have a habit of building bombs out of almost anything and blowing things up, including alarm clocks. Iggy and Ella, Max's half sister, also showed signs of growing affection towards one another in ''Angel'', which ultimately culminated in a shared kiss in ''Nevermore''.\n\n=== Nudge ===\n'''Nudge''' is 11 years old (12 in ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and ''Nevermore''), has brown skin, and has wild, curly, long, dark brown hair. Described as Max's best supporter and the peacemaker, she likes Max over Fang and can't live without her. Her wings are often said to be tawny-brown, almost cream. Her real name is revealed to be '''Monique''', and she managed to track down who she believes to be her mother because of the resemblance in skin tone, but never meets her because she is attacked by Ari. She is a \"motormouth\" as said by Max several times in the books. The Flock calls her the Nudge Channel because when she's awake it's \"all Nudge, all the time.\" She likes fashion, especially about hair, clothes, and make-up. Nudge can hack into computers with her ability to sense leftover emotions, also called psychometric, and she can draw metal towards her by will, like a magnet. Of the flock, Nudge is the one who most longs for the normality of the lives of other kids their age; in ''MAX'', when Jeb offers the Flock to stay at a day and night school, Nudge wants to stay and get her wings cut off.\n\n===The Gasman (Gazzy)===\n'''The Gasman (Gazzy)''' is 8 years old (9 in ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and ''Nevermore'') with blond hair, blue eyes, tan/light brown wings with a 10-foot wingspan. He is Angel's biological older brother, and they are the only blood related siblings of the Flock. He has a mischievous nature and makes fun of Max sometimes. He and Iggy are experts at constructing and setting off bombs and explosives, as Max states, \"You could lock the Gasman in a padded cell with some dental floss and a bowl of Jell-O, and he'd find a way to make something explode.\" It is revealed that his parents sold both him and Angel, his younger sister, to the School when they were very young. The Gasman's most useful ability is to perfectly mimic any voice. Max and Fang find a picture of baby Gazzy when they go check out what they think was Gazzy and Angel's old residence; the Flock sees the picture many times accidentally and sometimes purposefully throughout the series. He is called The Gasman because he passes gas a great deal, owing to a problem with his digestive system. Additionally, he later develops a \"skill\": he can produce large \"mushroom-shaped\" clouds of gas which stink horrendously.\n\n=== Angel ===\n'''Angel''' is 6 years old (7 in ''The Final Warning'', ''Max'', ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and ''Nevermore''), with blue eyes and curly blonde hair. Angel is also the biological sister of The Gasman (Gazzy). Her wings are pure white and are 8&nbsp;ft (9&nbsp;ft in Fang) across. She obtains seemingly random powers at random times, but her most eminent power, lasting throughout the series, is the ability to read and control minds.\n\nIn ''The Angel Experiment'', she uses her powers to convince a woman to buy her an expensive teddy bear that she names Celeste. She acquires the ability to hold her breath underwater and swim in deep water at pressures that would crush a normal human as well as change her appearance into a 'bird of paradise' form and change her skin and eye color; however, after the initial introduction, this power is never mentioned again, except when she gets trapped under a snow pile in ''The Final Warning'', but the attempt was unsuccessful. She is usually mistaken to be powerless and innocent, but she is truly extremely intelligent and dangerous. Her ability to control people's minds gives her extreme power.\n\nIn ''Fang'', Angel believes that she is the strongest of the Flock, and holds a vote, temporarily kicking Max out of the group. She also has a 'Voice' in her head, like Max, but the Flock is unaware of this. Angel is portrayed as calculating, ruthless, and unstable in ''Fang'', and has pointed a gun at Max to make enemies back off.\n\nIn ''Angel'', she seems to have calmed some of the extreme changes of her personality that occurred in ''Fang'', and helps Max to balance her feelings for Fang and Dylan. She appears to be content with her role and no longer bids for power, but advises Max, who is still suspicious of her. In the end, she volunteers to go undercover in a new evil organization (The Doomsday Group). She goes missing after she and Gazzy fail to defuse a bomb, and the others think she is dead. In fact, she is being held captive in an unknown location, and is continually told she is \"most superior\".\n\nIn ''Nevermore'', Angel is captured by The School again. After many tests, they show Angel a video. Angel starts to cry as she realizes the video is of Iggy's operation that has left him permanently blind. She watches the scientists prod and cut open Iggy's eyes until a whitecoat tells her they will be performing the same operation on her. After the operation, Angel loses her sight temporarily and nearly dies in a fire until Max and the Flock come to save her. When they escape to a 'tropical paradise', the world is being destroyed and she admits to Max she is the Voice, and she has been for years.\n\nIn ''Maximum Ride Forever'', Angel, at first distrusted by Max but eventually called her \"little prophet\", leads an army of survivors and mutants against the Remedy after being shown visions on the apocalypse the Remedy caused.\n\n===Dylan===\n'''Dylan''' is an avian-human hybrid who joins the Flock in ''Fang''. He is said to be Max's \"perfect other half\", causing Max to refer to him as \"Mr. Perfect\", although Max and Fang are quite in love when they meet. He is six foot two inches tall with a 15-foot wingspan and chocolate colored wings, and is usually described as handsome, with dark-blond hair and turquoise eyes, and is said to have a beautiful singing voice. He is in love with Max, but he was programmed by the scientists to feel that way. Because of this, he and Fang do not see eye-to-eye until the end of ''Nevermore''. He was also made in a lab, created from a clone of a boy who had died in a car accident in the country of Canada. He is 8 months old in ''Fang.'' He learns how to fly when Max teaches him by pushing him off a roof. His relationship with Max is complicated, but she does eventually start to like him. In ''Fang'' he is portrayed as somewhat meek, but appears to grow a backbone, even arguing with Max in ''Angel.'' The most notable argument in ''Angel'' starts at the beginning of the book with Dylan and Max arguing about how miserable Max has been since Fang left her. Dylan can heal himself almost instantly by placing his own saliva on his wounds and putting pressure on it. In addition, he has extremely good vision and [[clairvoyance]].\n\nIn ''Angel'', Max finds a new appreciation for Dylan, and a romance is sparked, though Max is usually confused and therefore harsh. The first time Max allows Dylan to comfort her is in the desert where they embrace. Although she is confused, she allows him to get closer and closer to her.\n\nLater, in the book ''Nevermore'', Dylan is told by a 'Voice' that he must capture Max's heart with all his might, so he takes her to a treehouse he made himself and kisses her then. Later, Fang re-appears after his own clan had been destroyed and Max realizes her mistake, choosing to be with Fang instead of a clone with programmed feelings. Dylan goes on a rampage, destroying part of a town and even attempting to kill Fang. Dylan is nowhere to be seen, so Dr. Martinez seizes her chance and whisks the original flock to a tropical paradise. Dylan appears and states that he will be there for Max when the world ends so they would die together. Max is irked but doesn't respond to him. Since a meteor is coming to demolish the planet, Dylan goes to herd mutant hybrid kids into elaborate caves. In the end, Dylan helps pull Max from the water after the apocalypse.\n\nIn ''Maximum Ride Forever'', Dylan is seemingly killed but in reality is kidnapped by the Remedy and turned into a Horseman. However, he becomes aware that the transformation was not successful as he still has free will; when tasked to kill the flock, instead of doing so, he fakes their deaths so that no other Horseman will be sent to truly kill them. Eventually, Dylan despairingly but solemnly accepts that Max will always love Fang and he cannot be with her. He decides to sacrifice himself to bring Fang back to life in order to make Max happy.\n\n===Phoenix===\n'''Phoenix''' is the daughter of Fang and Max, conceived and born in the ninth book, ''Maximum Ride Forever''. Phoenix has Fang's black hair and wings and Max's brown eyes, though her wings are more blue-ish and her eyes are light. The series ends with Phoenix receiving her first flying lesson.\n\n===Total===\n'''Total''' is a black Scottie whom Angel saves from the Institute at the end of ''The Angel Experiment''. He is described to have the characteristics of a Scottish terrier. When Total is rescued from the Institute, he is described as looking similar to Toto from The Wizard of Oz, which would make him a Cairn terrier. Total's character is not fully developed until ''School's Out Forever'', when it is discovered that he has the ability to talk. He is often humorous and dramatic, exemplified when he gets shot in the tail and isn't hurt largely, but still exaggerates the injury. Despite his dramatic nature, he can be mature when he wants to be and will not tolerate getting treated like a normal dog- even going as far as eating at the table with the rest of the flock. In the end of ''Fang'', Total marries Akila, an Alaskan Malamute whom he met in Antarctica in ''[[Maximum Ride: The Final Warning]]''. It is discovered Total thinks [[Tricia Helfer]] is hot in ''Angel'' when they are going to go to the ComicCon in San Diego. He is known to be a fan of culture, including theater and cuisine. He has the ability to jump to great heights, and eventually grows his own tiny wings. Total is very loyal to Angel because she is the one that found him in an underground lab in N.Y.C.\n\n===Akila===\n'''Akila''' is an 80-pound Alaskan Malamute with no special powers who meets Total in Antarctica in ''The Final Warning'' and becomes Total's wife in the end of ''Fang''. She belongs to Dr. Papa, one of the scientists on the boat that the flock took to Antarctica. Akila is killed by Cryenas in the final book in the series, \"Maximum Ride Forever\".\n\n=== Dr. Jeb Batchelder ===\n'''Jebediah Batchelder''' is a scientist, and part of the group (the 'School') that experimented on Max and the rest of the flock. He is 73 in the series, but that isn't confirmed by any character. He used to work at the School where the Flock was experimented on, but felt compassion for them and later broke them out and let them live with him. He lived with the Flock deep in the mountains for four years, where he taught them basic survival skills and how to fight so they can defend themselves. Max refers to Jeb as the closest thing she had ever had to a father, although later her feelings for him are mixed. Jeb then disappeared, leaving the Flock alone to fend for themselves. The Flock thought Jeb was dead, but he reappeared later in the first book. In ''The Angel Experiment'', the flock discovers Jeb back at the School when they are recaptured. This initially leads the Flock to believe that he is a traitor, but he later comes back to the Flock and helps them on numerous occasions. Jeb is Ari's and Max's biological father. Max does not trust him after discovering his identity. Jeb is shot in the sixth book, but he is shown to be making a steady recovery. Though Jeb and Dr. Martinez are Max's biological parents, there is only a professional relationship between them. Max trusts Dr. Martinez, but is usually wary of Jeb. Jeb donated his chromosomes, which were matched with those of Dr. Martinez to create Max. In ''Angel'', Jeb tells Max she needs to breed with Dylan after the world ends, and later goes missing with Max's mother. Once Max thought Jeb was the Voice in her head, but in ''The Final Warning'', he reveals he \"can do the voice, but isn't the voice\", confusing Max. Jeb keeps telling her things are tests. Throughout the entire series, Max's feelings towards Jeb are conflicted, ranging from a familial love to ultimate hatred. These feelings are ultimately challenged in ''Maximum Ride Forever'' when Max encounters Jeb helping the Remedy in Himmel. Upon realizing his part in destroying the world, Max begins strangling him but cannot bring herself to kill him; after letting him down, Jeb tazes her and threatens to inject her with the \"upgrading\" serum, but he is killed by Fang's gang who came to rescue her.\n\n=== The Erasers ===\n'''The Erasers''', created by the School in Death Valley, are half-human, half-wolf hybrids that were bred by the School to be guards, but their larger mission later involves hunting down and even killing the members of the Flock. Their powers are superhuman strength, but they also eventually gain wings that are crudely grafted onto their shoulder blades. They have a life span of about 4 years to reach maturity and approximately a year or two to hunt the Flock. Jeb's son, Ari, who was turned into an Eraser at a very young age, is one of the last to die when Itex 'retires' all of the Erasers and replaces them with the Flyboys, robotic Erasers with synthetic skin attached to their robotic structure. The Erasers are originally killed off because they 'expire' very quickly, but they make a surprise appearance in ''Fang'' when they attack all of the flock but Max and Fang, who are not at the house with the others. It is believed that when Itex was disbanded, some scientists took Eraser DNA with them, creating these new Erasers, though they are never mentioned after the events of the surprise battle. They are always armed, but rarely use their weapons after ''The Angel Experiment'' and later novels in the series.\n\n===Ari Batchelder===\n'''Ari''' is Jeb's son who was turned into an Eraser when Jeb was helping the Flock escape from the school. In ''The Angel Experiment'', he was once killed by Max in the sewers of New York but gets revived in the second book. He thought his father Jeb Batchelder didn't care about him, which is part of the reason that he hated Max out of jealousy and chased and terrorized the Flock. However, it is later confirmed that Jeb does care about Ari, because in ''The Angel Experiment'', after Max has fought with and killed Ari, Jeb cries for Ari and calls after Max, telling her that she has killed her own brother. He is Max's younger half-brother since they have the same father, Jeb. When Ari was only seven, the whitecoats used him as an experiment to see if Erasers would be stronger if they were mutated after birth. The wolf DNA turned Ari into a \"super-eraser,\" although he is always partially morphed. Ari came back to life and was grafted with wings according to ''Saving The World And Other Extreme Sports.'' According to Angel, Ari loved and hated Max at the same time. In ''Saving The World And Other Extreme Sports'' , Max and Fang get into a fight because after Ari broke them out of the School, Max was convinced that he was no longer evil. The Flock splits up: Max, Nudge, Angel, Total, and Ari go to Europe, while Fang, Iggy, and Gazzy go to Hollywood. Max and the gang go to the Itex headquarters in Germany, where there is a super-mutant named Omega. Ari tries to help Max fight him, but then his expiration date kicks in and he suddenly dies in Max's arms, only living until the age of seven. As his father creates yet another clone of him, Ari returns in Nevermore, showing up with other Erasers with the intent to take out Fang's Gang. Several times he tries to kill Fang, but in the end he is killed for good.\n\n===Dr. Hans Gunther-Hagen===\n'''Gunther-Hagen''' is a scientist the Flock meets in ''Fang,'' where he introduces Dylan to the rest of the Flock. He is the main antagonist in both ''Fang'', ''Angel'', and later ''Maximum Ride Forever'', constantly telling Max that she needs to join forces with him to save the world . He creates a lot of tension in the Flock. Max constantly makes fun of his name, calling him things like Dr. G-H, Dr. Haagen-Dazs, Dr. God, Dr. Disaster, etc. He created Dylan, wrote a book, and makes the shocking suggestion that Max and Dylan should come to live with him to Germany in order to \"breed\" (have children) or create the start of Max's \"dynasty\". He also has some special abilities such as instantly healing from illnesses and regenerating small extremities, such as fingers.\n\nHe was Dylan's caretaker until Dylan joined the Flock.\n\nIn ''Maximum Ride Forever'', he becomes known as the Remedy and builds a large underground shelter in Russia known as Himmel. He develops a serum known as \"upgrading\" which turns his subjects into \"Horsemen\", genetically improving them, making them stronger and increasing their senses but removing their free will. He allowed the meteor to strike the earth in ''Nevermore'' and kill millions of people in an attempt to eradicate the genetically \"imperfect\" in order to populate the earth with his genetically \"perfect\" creations. He uses his Horsemen to kill the imperfect mutants still living on earth, including the flock. He desperately tries to kill Max and her developing baby to keep her imperfect genes from spreading, but is then killed by Max when she drops him over the ocean.\n\n===Dr. Valencia Martinez===\n'''Dr. Valencia Martinez''' is a Hispanic veterinarian that lives in Arizona and helps Max when she (Max) is hurt in ''The Angel Experiment'' after helping Dr. Valencia's daughter, Ella, escape from bullies. When Dr. Martinez gives Max an x-ray, Max finds that there is a microchip embedded in her arm, which leads her to believe that the School is tracing the Flock with her microchip. In ''Saving The World And Other Extreme Sports,'' Max goes to Dr. Martinez to have the microchip removed, where she is put under the influence of Valium for the first time and admits her feelings for Fang. Max then loses use of her arm. Dr. Martinez is a strong-willed woman who goes to great lengths to help Max. It is later revealed that it was she who donated the egg that created Max, making her Max's mother. She also has a pet dog named Magnolia. In ''The Final Warning,'' the Flock is given the opportunity to go to Antarctica to help a group of scientists that are trying to save the world as well. In the following book, ''Max,'' Dr. Martinez is held hostage on a submarine, leading to a rescue mission by the Flock and some of the good scientists they met in Antarctica. Max trusts Dr. Martinez and trusts her judgment, which allows her to understand some things she is blind to. We later find out that Dr. Valencia Martinez was working with the white coats, and doctor Gunther-Hagen in the book ''Nevermore''. When Fang comes back after departing from Colorado, forming ''Fang's gang'', being betrayed by Kate and Star, arriving again, and being attacked by failure eraser copies of Ari, led by successful Ari copy, and Jeb, hurting Jeb, it is revealed that she was persuaded by Jeb, in a sort of spell, but still isn't to be full trusted by Angels' mind reading skills before they go to the tropical paradise islands with tree houses, used as a sanctuary made by Dr. Valencia Martinez, and Nino Pierpont, the richest man in the world, among others.  Dr. Valencia Martinez died when the large tsunami hit.\n\n===Ella Martinez===\n'''Ella Martinez''' is Dr. Martinez's other child, making her Max's half-sister. Max met her in ''The Angel Experiment'' when she saved her from bullies. Ella got away but Max was shot and had to go to Ella's house to get help. Ella is proven trustworthy. By the end of [[Nevermore: The Final Maximum Ride Adventure]], she had become a lover to Iggy. They had started flirting in ANGEL, right before DoomsDay brainwashed Ella, and briefly Iggy. Like her mother, Ella drowned below ground when the tsunami hit in Nevermore.\n\n===The Director===\n\"The Director\" or Marian Janssen was the leader of the ITEX industries. In her appearance in the third book, she posed as Max's mom, in order to get under her skin and learn her greatest secrets, to eventually eliminate all not \"advanced\" humans.

He initially started as a [[peddler]], and later became a commission agent selling cloth. After a few years, he established a free dispensary with help from his community.\n\n===Early Days of the Edhi Trust===\n\nThe spirit of the [[Edhi Foundation]] was born when Abdul Sattar Edhi was a child. At the tender age of eleven, Edhi experienced his mother becoming paralyzed and mentally ill after suffering from a major stroke. A young Edhi devoted himself to her care and took on the role of feeding, bathing, and clothing her daily while responding to any and every call and necessity she required. Her deteriorating mental and physical condition left a strong and lasting impact on Edhi's mind. As a result, he dropped out of school and strictly focused on his mother's health. Edhi's mother died when he was nineteen in 1947. Her death made him reflect on others around him who were suffering from similar illnesses. After his family moved to Pakistan later that year, Edhi established a free [[dispensary]] with the help of other community members. His vision for establishing and improving the healthcare sector in [[Pakistan]] enabled him to establish a personal welfare trust for the people called \"Edhi Trust\". With the help of public funding, Edhi Trust was able to collect [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]]200,000.<ref name=\"edhi.org\">{{cite web |url=https://edhi.org/founder-profile/|title=Founder Profile \u2013 Edhi Welfare Organization}}</ref> He expanded the trust to other medical fields and through hard work and diligence, he went on to establish a [[maternity home]] and an emergency ambulance service with the primary goal of helping those who could not help themselves. Edhi made it a habit to involve himself in every aspect of his foundation whenever possible.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/> His foundation raised money for most noble causes and eventually, the Edhi Foundation had allotted a quota for each humanitarian cause, whether it was burying abandoned corpses or aiding in disaster relief.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/>\n\nHe told [[NPR]] in 2009: \"I saw people lying on the pavement... The flu had spread in Karachi, and there was no one to treat them. So I set up benches and got medical students to volunteer. I was penniless and begged for donations on the street. And people gave. I bought this 8-by-8 room to start my work.\"<ref>Julie McCarthy, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111102319 Pakistan Philanthropist Cares For Karachi's Forgotten], NPR, 28 July 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 20, Edhi joined a [[Memon people|Memon]] charity as a volunteer. However, once he found out that the charity only attended to the needs of Memon people, he confronted his superiors to no avail, which caused him to leave to form an independent medical centre. He feared the Memon community would retaliate and possibly have him killed because of the stand he made, so he left the country in search of both safety and knowledge.

Her deteriorating mental and physical condition left a strong and lasting impact on Edhi's mind. As a result, he dropped out of school and strictly focused on his mother's health. Edhi's mother died when he was nineteen in 1947. Her death made him reflect on others around him who were suffering from similar illnesses. After his family moved to Pakistan later that year, Edhi established a free [[dispensary]] with the help of other community members. His vision for establishing and improving the healthcare sector in [[Pakistan]] enabled him to establish a personal welfare trust for the people called \"Edhi Trust\". With the help of public funding, Edhi Trust was able to collect [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]]200,000.<ref name=\"edhi.org\">{{cite web |url=https://edhi.org/founder-profile/|title=Founder Profile \u2013 Edhi Welfare Organization}}</ref> He expanded the trust to other medical fields and through hard work and diligence, he went on to establish a [[maternity home]] and an emergency ambulance service with the primary goal of helping those who could not help themselves. Edhi made it a habit to involve himself in every aspect of his foundation whenever possible.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/> His foundation raised money for most noble causes and eventually, the Edhi Foundation had allotted a quota for each humanitarian cause, whether it was burying abandoned corpses or aiding in disaster relief.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/>\n\nHe told [[NPR]] in 2009: \"I saw people lying on the pavement... The flu had spread in Karachi, and there was no one to treat them. So I set up benches and got medical students to volunteer. I was penniless and begged for donations on the street. And people gave. I bought this 8-by-8 room to start my work.\"<ref>Julie McCarthy, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111102319 Pakistan Philanthropist Cares For Karachi's Forgotten], NPR, 28 July 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 20, Edhi joined a [[Memon people|Memon]] charity as a volunteer. However, once he found out that the charity only attended to the needs of Memon people, he confronted his superiors to no avail, which caused him to leave to form an independent medical centre. He feared the Memon community would retaliate and possibly have him killed because of the stand he made, so he left the country in search of both safety and knowledge. Edhi travelled to [[Europe]] and made his way to [[London]] via [[Rome]] by asking for donations. His time in London allowed him to thoroughly examine the [[Welfare|social welfare]] programs active throughout the [[United Kingdom]], off of which he organized and laid the foundation for the rest of his charitable works.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8440920/The-day-I-met-Abdul-Sattar-Edhi-a-living-saint.html|title=The day I met Abdul Sattar Edhi, a living saint|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=2008-04-10|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=\"People have become educated, but have yet to become human.\"|author=|title=|source=Abdul Sattar Edhi<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/world/middleeast/abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-father-teresa-dies-at-88.html?nytmobile=0|title=Abdus Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's 'Father Teresa,' Dies at 88 - NYTimes.com|first=Salman|last=Masood|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=9 July 2016|date=8 July 2016}}</ref>}}\n\n===Date of Birth Controversy===\nIn his autobiography, Edhi revealed that he didn't know his actual date of birth,{{sfn|Tehmina Durrani|1996}} but according to media reports published following his death, he was born on 1 January 1928.<ref name=\"thenews.com.pk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/135894-Name-the-new-airport-after-Edhi|title=Name the new airport after Edhi|work=thenews.com.pk|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=18 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi laid to rest in Karachi|url=http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Radio Pakistan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021135535/http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|archivedate=21 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nation mourns Abdul Sattar Edhi's demise \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/344363-Nation-mourns-Abdul-Sattar-Edhis-demise|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US condoles death of Abdul Sattar Edhi|url=http://nation.com.pk/international/12-Jul-2016/us-condoles-death-of-abdul-sattar-edhi|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Nation}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Significant people born on 1st January|url=http://aaj.tv/2016/01/significant-people-born-on-1st-january/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Aaj News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dailytimes {{!}} Late Abdul Sattar Edhi's Qul held amid tight security|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/sindh/11-Jul-16/late-abdul-sattar-edhis-qul-held-amid-tight-security|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dailytimes.com.pk|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The gems world lost in 2016 \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/368092-The-gems-world-lost-in-2016|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref> In 2017, [[Google Doodle]] marked his date of birth as 28 February 1928 following which several reports emerged in favour of 28 February 1928 being his birthdate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi: Why Google honours him today|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/abdul-sattar-edhi-google-honours-angel-mercy-170227140720826.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=www.aljazeera.com|date=28 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Who was Abdul Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's humble 'Angel of Mercy' who founded a charity empire from a Karachi slum?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/02/27/who-was-abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-angel-of-mercy/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' noted \"There has been uncertainty about when his birthday is.

In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations.\n\nThere were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; ''[[Opus Anglicanum]]'' or English embroidery was already famous across Europe \u2013 a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production.\n\n==== The Bayeux Tapestry ====\n{{Main|Bayeux Tapestry}}\nOne of the most famous embroideries (it is not a tapestry) of the Medieval period is the ''[[Bayeux Tapestry]]'', which was embroidered with [[wool]] on nine linen panels and is 230 feet long. Its c. seventy scenes narrate the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book ''La Tapisserie de Bayeux'' states:\n\n{{quote|The Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]&nbsp;.... Its survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous&nbsp;...

Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], a 10th-century Spanish nun; [[Guda]], a 12th-century German nun; and [[Claricia]], a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them.\n\nIn many parts of Europe, with the [[Gregorian Reforms]] of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan [[Scandinavia]] (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female [[runemaster]], [[Gunnborga]], worked in the 11th century.<ref>Upplands runinskrifter 1, s. 307 ff.</ref>\n\n[[File:07angels-hildegard von bingen.jpg|thumb|[[Hildegard of Bingen]] ''[[Scivias]]'' I.6: The Choirs of Angels. From [http://www.abtei-st-hildegard.de/?page_id=4721 the Rupertsberg manuscript], fol. 38r.]]\nIn Germany, however, under the [[Ottonian Dynasty]], convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098\u20131179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote ''The Divine Works of a Simple Man'', ''The Meritorious Life'', sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, ''[[Scivias]]'' ''(Know the Ways of the Lord)'', which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the ''[[Scivias]]'', as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegard experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision.\n\nThe 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The [[Wife of Bath]] in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan [[guild]]s. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating ''Opus Anglicanum'', or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of [[Ma\u00eetre Honor\u00e9]] and the daughter of [[Jean le Noir (illuminator)|Jean le Noir]]. By the 13th century most [[illuminated manuscript]]s were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to [[printing]], and book illustration to the [[printmaking]] techniques of [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]], where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jefimija]] (1349-1405) a [[Serbia]]n, noblewoman, widow and [[Serbian Orthodox Church|orthodox]] nun became known not only as a poet who wrote a lament for her dead son, Uglje\u0161a, but also as a skilled needlewoman and engraver. Her lament for her beloved son which immortalized the sorrow of all mothers mourning their deceased children, was carved on the back of the [[diptych]], (two-panelled icon representing a Virgin and Child) which Teodosije, Bishop of [[Serres]], had presented as a gift to the infant Uglje\u0161a at his baptism. The piece of art, already valuable because of the gold, precious stones, and beautiful carving on its wooden panels, became priceless after Jefemija's lament was engraved on its back.<ref>{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Pavlikianov|first=Cyril|title=The Medieval Aristocracy on Mount Athos: Philological and Documentary Evidence for the Activity of Byzantine, Georgian and Slav Aristocrats and Eminent Churchmen in the Monasteries of Mount Athos from the 10th to the 15th Century|year=2001|location=Sofia|publisher=Center for Slavo-Byzantine Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twYuAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9789540715957}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 15th-century [[Venice]] the daughter of the glass artist, Angelo Barovi\u00e8r, was known to have been the artist behind a particular glass design from Venetian [[Murano]].

The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift came from the [[Counter-Reformation]] reacting against [[Protestantism]] and giving rise to a move toward [[humanism]], a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women.<ref name=\"FT\"/> In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important. Significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, ''On Famous Women'' and ''The City of Women'', illustrate this cultural change. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], a 14th-century humanist, wrote ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (Latin for ''[[On Famous Women]]'') (1335\u201359), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of [[Thamar]] (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of ''On Famous Women'', Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. [[Christine de Pizan]], a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.\n\nThe most notable of these was ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' or ''[[The Courtier]]'' by 16th-century Italian humanist [[Baldassare Castiglione]]. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters.<ref name=Heller/> The [[Cremona]]-born Anguissola was both a trailblazer and role model for future generations of women artists.<ref name=\"FT\"/> Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as [[Lavinia Fontana]] and [[Caterina van Hemessen]] began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Fontana benefited from the enlightened attitudes in her native city, [[Bologna]] where the [[Bologna university|university]] had admitted women scholars since the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"FT\"/> Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the [[Academic art|Academy]], and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training.<ref name=\"FT\"/> Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions.\n\nAlthough many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include [[Caterina dei Virgi]], [[Antonia Uccello]], and [[Suor Barbara Ragnoni]]. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter [[Lavinia Fontana]], the miniature portraitist [[Levina Teerlinc]], and the portrait painter [[Caterina van Hemessen]]. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in [[Bruges]] show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators).\n\n===Nelli's ''Last Supper''===\n[[File:Plautilla Nelli - The Last Supper (in 2019).jpg|thumb|center|500px|''The Last Supper'', a 7x2-meter oil-on-canvas, preserved in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], is the only signed work by [[Plautilla Nelli]] known to survive.]]\n\nA recently rediscovered fragile 22 foot canvas roll in [[Florence]] has turned out to be an outstanding treasure.

As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] is an example of this. She was trained by her father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. [[Luisa Rold\u00e1n]] was trained in her father's ([[Pedro Rold\u00e1n]]) sculpture workshop.\n\nWomen artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as [[Elisabetta Sirani]] created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses. One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemisia Gentileschi's ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining and avenging her own destiny. Letizia Treves, curator at London's [[National Gallery]] 2020 Gentileschi show has commented: ''\"you can't see it without thinking of [[Agostino Tassi|Tassi]] raping Gentileschi.\"''<ref>Note: The Artemisia Gentileschi exhibition at the National Gallery, London scheduled for 2020, is postponed owing to the [[Covid 19 pandemic]].</ref> The elements of the picture are ''\"balanced with such skill they speak of a painter who prioritised virtuosity over passion.\"''<ref name=\"FT\"/> While other artists, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and the more traditional woman, [[Fede Galizia]], depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. [[Still life]] emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included [[Clara Peeters]], a painter of ''banketje'' or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], the internationally renowned flower painter; and [[Rachel Ruysch]], a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including [[Giovanna Garzoni]], who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and [[Louise Moillon]], whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Angelica Kauffmann 003.jpg|thumb|[[Angelica Kauffman]], ''Literature and Painting'', 1782, [[Kenwood House]]]]\n[[File:Attributes of Music.jpg|thumb|[[Anne Vallayer-Coster]], ''Attributes of Music'', 1770]]\n[[File:Marie-Gabrielle Capet - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie-Gabrielle Capet]], 1783]]\n[[File:Ignacy Potocki.PNG|thumb|right|200px|[[Ignacy Potocki]] by [[Anna Rajecka]], 1784]]\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:Self-portrait_in_a_Straw_Hat_by_Elisabeth-Louise_Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun.jpg|[[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun|Elisabeth Vigee-Le Brun]] (1755\u20131842), ''[[Self-portrait]],'' c. 1780s, one of many she painted for sale\nImage:Self-portrait holding a portrait of her sister, by Rosalba Carriera.jpg|[[Rosalba Carriera]] (1675\u20131757), ''Self-portrait'' 1715\nFile:Ulrica pasch.jpg|[[Ulrika Pasch]], ''Self portrait'', c. 1770\nFile:Anna Dorothea Therbusch 001.jpg|[[Anna Dorothea Therbusch]], ''Self-portrait,'' 1777\nFile:Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard - Self-Portrait with Two Pupils - The Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|[[Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard]], ''Self-portrait with two pupils'', [[Marie-Gabrielle Capet]] and [[Marie-Marguerite Carreaux de Rosemond]] 1785, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Marguerite G\u00e9rard - The first steps.jpg|[[Marguerite G\u00e9rard]], ''First steps'', oil on canvas, 45.5 x 55&nbsp;cm, c. 1788\n</gallery>\nArtists from this period include, [[Rosalba Carriera]], [[Maria Cosway]], [[Marguerite G\u00e9rard]], [[Angelica Kauffman]], [[Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard]], [[Giulia Lama]], [[Mary Moser]], [[Ulrika Pasch]], [[Ad\u00e8le Romany]], [[Anna Dorothea Therbusch]], [[Anne Vallayer-Coster]], [[Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun|Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e-Le Brun]] and [[Anna Rajecka]], also known as Madame Gault de Saint-Germain.\n\nIn many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style.  The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was [[history painting]], especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. [[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun]] used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, ''Peace Bringing Back Plenty'', which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint.  She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.<ref name=Heller>Heller, Nancy G., ''Women Artists: An Illustrated History'', Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-89659-748-8}}</ref>\n\nIn England, two women, [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Mary Moser]], were founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London in 1768.  Kauffmann helped [[Maria Cosway]] enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'' by Johan Zoffany now in The [[Royal Collection]]. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=400747| title = The Royal Academicians| last = Zoffany| first = Johan| authorlink = Johann Zoffany| year = 1771\u20131772| publisher = [[Royal Collection|The Royal Collection]]|accessdate = March 20, 2007}}</ref>  The emphasis in [[Academic art]] on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists.  After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until [[Laura Knight]] in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].\n\n==19th century==\n=== Painters ===\nWomen artists of the early part of the 19th century include [[Marie-Denise Villers]], who specialized in portraiture; [[Constance Mayer]], who painted portraits and allegories; [[Marie Ellenrieder]], who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the [[Nazarenes (artists)|Nazarene]] style.\n\nIn the second half of the century, [[Emma Sandys]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman]], [[Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale]], and [[Maria Zambaco]]<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/biography/p012261.htm Maria Zambaco] Retrieved June 15, 2010</ref> were women artists of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement.

The British Government School of Design, which later became the [[Royal College of Art]], admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a \"Female School\" which was treated somewhat differently, with \"life\"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour.\n\nThe Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the [[Slade School of Art]] from the 1870s, were more liberal.  By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities.

Some [[art historian]]s such as [[Daphne Haldin]] have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished.<ref>{{cite journal | last= Drummond Charig | first= Frankie | date= 4 April 2016 | title= Daphne Haldin's Archive and the 'Dictionary of Women Artists' | url=  http://www.britishartstudies.ac.uk/issues/issue-index/issue-2/still-invisible#018 | journal= British Art Studies | publisher= [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale Center for British Art]] | issue= 2 | doi=10.17658/issn.2058-5462/issue-02/still-invisible/018 | access-date=  28 May 2016}}</ref> Figures like [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist [[cultural icon|icons]]. The [[Guerilla Girls]], an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were \"the conscience of the art world.\" They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change. In 1996, [[Catherine de Zegher]] curated an exhibition of 37 great women artists from the twentieth century. The exhibition, ''Inside the Visible'', that travelled from the ICA in Boston to the National Museum for Women in the Arts in Washington, the Whitechapel in London and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, included artists' works from the 1930s through the 1990s featuring [[Claude Cahun]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Charlotte Salomon]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Nancy Spero]], [[Francesca Woodman]], [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Mona Hatoum]] among others.\n\n===Ceramics===\n[[File:New East window of St Martin's in the Fields - geograph.org.uk - 1072810.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shirazeh Houshiary]], East window [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], London]]\nThe re-emergence in the late 19th-century of the creation of ceramic art objects in [[Japan]] and Europe has become known as ''[[Studio pottery]]'', although it encompasses sculpture and also [[tessera]]e, the [[mosaic]] cubes which go back to [[Persia]] in the third millennium BCE. Several influences contributed to the emergence of studio pottery: art pottery in the work of the [[Martin Brothers]] and [[William Moorcroft (potter)|William Moorcroft]], the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], the [[Bauhaus]] and the rediscovery of traditional artisan pottery and the excavation of large quantities of [[Song dynasty|Song]] pottery in China.<ref name=cooper/>\n\nLeading trends in British studio pottery in the 20th century are represented by both men and women: [[Bernard Leach]], [[William Staite Murray]], [[Dora Billington]], [[Lucie Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]]. Leach (1887\u20131979) established a style of pottery, the [[ethical pot]], strongly influenced by Chinese, Korean, Japanese and medieval English forms. His style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th century. Leach's influence was disseminated in particular by his ''A Potter's Book''<ref>Leach, Bernard. ''A Potter\u2019s Book'', Faber and Faber, 1988. {{ISBN|0-571-04927-3}}</ref> and the apprentice system he ran at his pottery in [[St Ives, Cornwall]].\n\nOther ceramic artists exerted an influence through their positions in art schools. [[Dora Billington]] (1890\u20131968) studied at Hanley School of Art, worked in the pottery industry and became head of pottery at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]]. She worked in media that Leach did not, e.g. [[tin-glazed]] earthenware, and influenced potters such as [[William R. Newland (potter)|William Newland]], [[Katherine Pleydell-Bouverie]] and [[Margaret Hine]].<ref name=watson>Oliver Watson, ''Studio Pottery'', London: Phaidon Press, 1993</ref><ref>Julian Stair, \"Dora Billington\", ''Crafts'', 154, September/October 1998</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, a new generation of potters, influenced by the [[Camberwell School of Art]] and the [[Central School of Art and Design]] including, [[Alison Britton]], [[Ruth Duckworth]] and [[Elizabeth Fritsch]] who began to experiment\\abstract ceramic objects, varied surface and glaze effects to critical acclaim. Elizabeth Fritsch has work represented in major collections and museums worldwide. Moreover, the reputation of British ceramisists has attracted talent from around the world and released notable artists in the field. They include: [[India]]n [[Nirmala Patwardhan]], [[Kenya]]n, [[Magdalene Odundo]] and Iranian, [[Homa Vafaie Farley]].\n\nAs in Britain, pottery was integral to the [[United States]] [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Charles Fergus Binns]], who was the first director of the [[New York State College of Ceramics|New York State School of Clay-Working and Ceramics]] at [[Alfred University]], was an important influence. Some potters in the United&nbsp;States adopted the approach from emerging studio pottery movements in Britain and Japan. Worldwide and European artists coming to the United States have contributed to the public appreciation of ceramics as art, and included [[Marguerite Wildenhain]], [[Maija Grotell]], [[Susi Singer]] and [[Otto Natzler|Gertrude and Otto Natzler]]. Significant [[studio potters]] in the United States include [[Otto and Vivika Heino]], [[Beatrice Wood]] and [[Amber Aguirre]].\n\nMeanwhile, in the reducing primeval forests of the [[African Great Lakes region]] in the [[Rift Valley lakes|Rift Valley]], there is a people clinging to their foraging ancestral way of life. They are the [[Great Lakes Twa|Batwa]], among the most marginalised people in the world, whose womenfolk (and the occasional man) continue the centuries-old custom of making pottery which has been used as barter with the peasants and pastoralists of the region.

In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations.\n\nThere were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; ''[[Opus Anglicanum]]'' or English embroidery was already famous across Europe \u2013 a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production.\n\n==== The Bayeux Tapestry ====\n{{Main|Bayeux Tapestry}}\nOne of the most famous embroideries (it is not a tapestry) of the Medieval period is the ''[[Bayeux Tapestry]]'', which was embroidered with [[wool]] on nine linen panels and is 230 feet long. Its c. seventy scenes narrate the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book ''La Tapisserie de Bayeux'' states:\n\n{{quote|The Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]&nbsp;.... Its survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous&nbsp;... Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating.<ref>Sylvette Lemagnen, Preface, p. 9; {{cite book |last1=Musset  |first1=Lucien |last2=Rex |first2=Richard (translator) |title=La Tapisserie de Bayeux: \u0153uvre d'art et document historique |trans-title=The Bayeux Tapestry |type=annotated edition |edition=First |date=1 November 2005 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd |location=Woodbridge, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-84383-163-1 |page=272 }}</ref>}}\n\n=== The High Middle Ages ===\nIn the 14th century, a royal workshop is documented, based at the [[Tower of London]], and there may have been other earlier arrangements. Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], a 10th-century Spanish nun; [[Guda]], a 12th-century German nun; and [[Claricia]], a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them.\n\nIn many parts of Europe, with the [[Gregorian Reforms]] of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan [[Scandinavia]] (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female [[runemaster]], [[Gunnborga]], worked in the 11th century.<ref>Upplands runinskrifter 1, s. 307 ff.</ref>\n\n[[File:07angels-hildegard von bingen.jpg|thumb|[[Hildegard of Bingen]] ''[[Scivias]]'' I.6: The Choirs of Angels. From [http://www.abtei-st-hildegard.de/?page_id=4721 the Rupertsberg manuscript], fol. 38r.]]\nIn Germany, however, under the [[Ottonian Dynasty]], convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098\u20131179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote ''The Divine Works of a Simple Man'', ''The Meritorious Life'', sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, ''[[Scivias]]'' ''(Know the Ways of the Lord)'', which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the ''[[Scivias]]'', as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegard experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision.\n\nThe 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The [[Wife of Bath]] in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan [[guild]]s. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating ''Opus Anglicanum'', or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of [[Ma\u00eetre Honor\u00e9]] and the daughter of [[Jean le Noir (illuminator)|Jean le Noir]]. By the 13th century most [[illuminated manuscript]]s were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to [[printing]], and book illustration to the [[printmaking]] techniques of [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]], where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jefimija]] (1349-1405) a [[Serbia]]n, noblewoman, widow and [[Serbian Orthodox Church|orthodox]] nun became known not only as a poet who wrote a lament for her dead son, Uglje\u0161a, but also as a skilled needlewoman and engraver. Her lament for her beloved son which immortalized the sorrow of all mothers mourning their deceased children, was carved on the back of the [[diptych]], (two-panelled icon representing a Virgin and Child) which Teodosije, Bishop of [[Serres]], had presented as a gift to the infant Uglje\u0161a at his baptism. The piece of art, already valuable because of the gold, precious stones, and beautiful carving on its wooden panels, became priceless after Jefemija's lament was engraved on its back.<ref>{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Pavlikianov|first=Cyril|title=The Medieval Aristocracy on Mount Athos: Philological and Documentary Evidence for the Activity of Byzantine, Georgian and Slav Aristocrats and Eminent Churchmen in the Monasteries of Mount Athos from the 10th to the 15th Century|year=2001|location=Sofia|publisher=Center for Slavo-Byzantine Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twYuAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9789540715957}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 15th-century [[Venice]] the daughter of the glass artist, Angelo Barovi\u00e8r, was known to have been the artist behind a particular glass design from Venetian [[Murano]].

The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift came from the [[Counter-Reformation]] reacting against [[Protestantism]] and giving rise to a move toward [[humanism]], a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women.<ref name=\"FT\"/> In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important. Significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, ''On Famous Women'' and ''The City of Women'', illustrate this cultural change. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], a 14th-century humanist, wrote ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (Latin for ''[[On Famous Women]]'') (1335\u201359), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of [[Thamar]] (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of ''On Famous Women'', Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. [[Christine de Pizan]], a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.\n\nThe most notable of these was ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' or ''[[The Courtier]]'' by 16th-century Italian humanist [[Baldassare Castiglione]]. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters.<ref name=Heller/> The [[Cremona]]-born Anguissola was both a trailblazer and role model for future generations of women artists.<ref name=\"FT\"/> Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as [[Lavinia Fontana]] and [[Caterina van Hemessen]] began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Fontana benefited from the enlightened attitudes in her native city, [[Bologna]] where the [[Bologna university|university]] had admitted women scholars since the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"FT\"/> Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the [[Academic art|Academy]], and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training.<ref name=\"FT\"/> Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions.\n\nAlthough many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include [[Caterina dei Virgi]], [[Antonia Uccello]], and [[Suor Barbara Ragnoni]]. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter [[Lavinia Fontana]], the miniature portraitist [[Levina Teerlinc]], and the portrait painter [[Caterina van Hemessen]]. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in [[Bruges]] show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators).\n\n===Nelli's ''Last Supper''===\n[[File:Plautilla Nelli - The Last Supper (in 2019).jpg|thumb|center|500px|''The Last Supper'', a 7x2-meter oil-on-canvas, preserved in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], is the only signed work by [[Plautilla Nelli]] known to survive.]]\n\nA recently rediscovered fragile 22 foot canvas roll in [[Florence]] has turned out to be an outstanding treasure.

As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] is an example of this. She was trained by her father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. [[Luisa Rold\u00e1n]] was trained in her father's ([[Pedro Rold\u00e1n]]) sculpture workshop.\n\nWomen artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as [[Elisabetta Sirani]] created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses. One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemisia Gentileschi's ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining and avenging her own destiny. Letizia Treves, curator at London's [[National Gallery]] 2020 Gentileschi show has commented: ''\"you can't see it without thinking of [[Agostino Tassi|Tassi]] raping Gentileschi.\"''<ref>Note: The Artemisia Gentileschi exhibition at the National Gallery, London scheduled for 2020, is postponed owing to the [[Covid 19 pandemic]].</ref> The elements of the picture are ''\"balanced with such skill they speak of a painter who prioritised virtuosity over passion.\"''<ref name=\"FT\"/> While other artists, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and the more traditional woman, [[Fede Galizia]], depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. [[Still life]] emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included [[Clara Peeters]], a painter of ''banketje'' or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], the internationally renowned flower painter; and [[Rachel Ruysch]], a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including [[Giovanna Garzoni]], who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and [[Louise Moillon]], whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Angelica Kauffmann 003.jpg|thumb|[[Angelica Kauffman]], ''Literature and Painting'', 1782, [[Kenwood House]]]]\n[[File:Attributes of Music.jpg|thumb|[[Anne Vallayer-Coster]], ''Attributes of Music'', 1770]]\n[[File:Marie-Gabrielle Capet - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie-Gabrielle Capet]], 1783]]\n[[File:Ignacy Potocki.PNG|thumb|right|200px|[[Ignacy Potocki]] by [[Anna Rajecka]], 1784]]\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:Self-portrait_in_a_Straw_Hat_by_Elisabeth-Louise_Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun.jpg|[[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun|Elisabeth Vigee-Le Brun]] (1755\u20131842), ''[[Self-portrait]],'' c. 1780s, one of many she painted for sale\nImage:Self-portrait holding a portrait of her sister, by Rosalba Carriera.jpg|[[Rosalba Carriera]] (1675\u20131757), ''Self-portrait'' 1715\nFile:Ulrica pasch.jpg|[[Ulrika Pasch]], ''Self portrait'', c. 1770\nFile:Anna Dorothea Therbusch 001.jpg|[[Anna Dorothea Therbusch]], ''Self-portrait,'' 1777\nFile:Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard - Self-Portrait with Two Pupils - The Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|[[Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard]], ''Self-portrait with two pupils'', [[Marie-Gabrielle Capet]] and [[Marie-Marguerite Carreaux de Rosemond]] 1785, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Marguerite G\u00e9rard - The first steps.jpg|[[Marguerite G\u00e9rard]], ''First steps'', oil on canvas, 45.5 x 55&nbsp;cm, c. 1788\n</gallery>\nArtists from this period include, [[Rosalba Carriera]], [[Maria Cosway]], [[Marguerite G\u00e9rard]], [[Angelica Kauffman]], [[Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard]], [[Giulia Lama]], [[Mary Moser]], [[Ulrika Pasch]], [[Ad\u00e8le Romany]], [[Anna Dorothea Therbusch]], [[Anne Vallayer-Coster]], [[Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun|Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e-Le Brun]] and [[Anna Rajecka]], also known as Madame Gault de Saint-Germain.\n\nIn many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style.  The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was [[history painting]], especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. [[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun]] used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, ''Peace Bringing Back Plenty'', which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint.  She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.<ref name=Heller>Heller, Nancy G., ''Women Artists: An Illustrated History'', Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-89659-748-8}}</ref>\n\nIn England, two women, [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Mary Moser]], were founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London in 1768.  Kauffmann helped [[Maria Cosway]] enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'' by Johan Zoffany now in The [[Royal Collection]]. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=400747| title = The Royal Academicians| last = Zoffany| first = Johan| authorlink = Johann Zoffany| year = 1771\u20131772| publisher = [[Royal Collection|The Royal Collection]]|accessdate = March 20, 2007}}</ref>  The emphasis in [[Academic art]] on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists.  After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until [[Laura Knight]] in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].\n\n==19th century==\n=== Painters ===\nWomen artists of the early part of the 19th century include [[Marie-Denise Villers]], who specialized in portraiture; [[Constance Mayer]], who painted portraits and allegories; [[Marie Ellenrieder]], who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the [[Nazarenes (artists)|Nazarene]] style.\n\nIn the second half of the century, [[Emma Sandys]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman]], [[Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale]], and [[Maria Zambaco]]<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/biography/p012261.htm Maria Zambaco] Retrieved June 15, 2010</ref> were women artists of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement.

[[Cecilia Beaux]] was an American portrait painter who also studied in France.

The British Government School of Design, which later became the [[Royal College of Art]], admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a \"Female School\" which was treated somewhat differently, with \"life\"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour.\n\nThe Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the [[Slade School of Art]] from the 1870s, were more liberal.  By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities. The Society of Female Artists (now called ''The [[Society of Women Artists]]'') was established in 1855 in London and has staged annual exhibitions since 1857, when 358 works were shown by 149 women, some using a pseudonym.<ref name=society>[http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/History.html \"History\"], ''The Society of Women Artists''.

Several influences contributed to the emergence of studio pottery: art pottery in the work of the [[Martin Brothers]] and [[William Moorcroft (potter)|William Moorcroft]], the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], the [[Bauhaus]] and the rediscovery of traditional artisan pottery and the excavation of large quantities of [[Song dynasty|Song]] pottery in China.<ref name=cooper/>\n\nLeading trends in British studio pottery in the 20th century are represented by both men and women: [[Bernard Leach]], [[William Staite Murray]], [[Dora Billington]], [[Lucie Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]]. Leach (1887\u20131979) established a style of pottery, the [[ethical pot]], strongly influenced by Chinese, Korean, Japanese and medieval English forms. His style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th century. Leach's influence was disseminated in particular by his ''A Potter's Book''<ref>Leach, Bernard. ''A Potter\u2019s Book'', Faber and Faber, 1988. {{ISBN|0-571-04927-3}}</ref> and the apprentice system he ran at his pottery in [[St Ives, Cornwall]].\n\nOther ceramic artists exerted an influence through their positions in art schools. [[Dora Billington]] (1890\u20131968) studied at Hanley School of Art, worked in the pottery industry and became head of pottery at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]]. She worked in media that Leach did not, e.g. [[tin-glazed]] earthenware, and influenced potters such as [[William R. Newland (potter)|William Newland]], [[Katherine Pleydell-Bouverie]] and [[Margaret Hine]].<ref name=watson>Oliver Watson, ''Studio Pottery'', London: Phaidon Press, 1993</ref><ref>Julian Stair, \"Dora Billington\", ''Crafts'', 154, September/October 1998</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, a new generation of potters, influenced by the [[Camberwell School of Art]] and the [[Central School of Art and Design]] including, [[Alison Britton]], [[Ruth Duckworth]] and [[Elizabeth Fritsch]] who began to experiment\\abstract ceramic objects, varied surface and glaze effects to critical acclaim. Elizabeth Fritsch has work represented in major collections and museums worldwide. Moreover, the reputation of British ceramisists has attracted talent from around the world and released notable artists in the field. They include: [[India]]n [[Nirmala Patwardhan]], [[Kenya]]n, [[Magdalene Odundo]] and Iranian, [[Homa Vafaie Farley]].\n\nAs in Britain, pottery was integral to the [[United States]] [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Charles Fergus Binns]], who was the first director of the [[New York State College of Ceramics|New York State School of Clay-Working and Ceramics]] at [[Alfred University]], was an important influence. Some potters in the United&nbsp;States adopted the approach from emerging studio pottery movements in Britain and Japan. Worldwide and European artists coming to the United States have contributed to the public appreciation of ceramics as art, and included [[Marguerite Wildenhain]], [[Maija Grotell]], [[Susi Singer]] and [[Otto Natzler|Gertrude and Otto Natzler]].

In 2001, a conference called \"Women Artists at the Millennium\" was organized at [[Princeton University]]. A book by that name was published in 2006, featuring major art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]] analysing prominent women artists such as [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Sally Mann]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Rosemarie Trockel]].

Her work shows some attributes of [[feminism]], [[minimalism]], [[surrealism]], [[Outsider Art|Art Brut]], [[pop art]], and [[abstract expressionism]], and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She describes herself as an \"obsessive artist\".

Not published by Marx during his lifetime, they were first released in 1932 by [[Philosophy in the Soviet Union|researchers in the Soviet Union]].\n\n==Context==\nThe notebooks are an early expression of Marx's analysis of economics, chiefly [[Adam Smith]], and critique of the philosophy of [[G. W. F. Hegel]]. ''Die Bewegung der Produktion'' by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz]] is also a key influence.<ref name=\"Levine\">{{cite book |last1=Levine |first1=Norman |title=Divergent Paths: The Hegelian foundations of Marx's method |date=2006 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=223}}</ref><ref name=\"Sperber\">{{cite book |last1=Sperber |first1=Jonathan |title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life |date=2013 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=144}}</ref> The notebooks cover a wide range of topics including [[private property]], [[communism]], and [[money]]. They are best known for their early expression of Marx's argument that the conditions of modern industrial societies result in the estrangement (or [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]) of wage-workers from their own work, their own products, and in turn from themselves and from each other. \n\nBecause the 1844 manuscripts show Marx's thought at the time of its early genesis, their publication, in English not until 1959,<ref>Tedman, Gary. (2004) \"Marx's 1844 manuscripts as a work of art: A hypertextual reinterpretation.\" ''Rethinking Marxism'' 16.4: 427\u2013441.</ref> has profoundly affected recent scholarship on Marx and [[Marxism]], particularly regarding the relation of Marxism to earlier work in [[German Idealism]]. The [[young Marx]] had been relatively ignored until recently, because his early works were considered more \"philosophical\" and by some as not \"scientific\" enough, that is, \"economic\" as in ''[[Das Kapital]]''. However, [[Marxist humanists]] regard this book as one of the most important texts by Marx and crucial for understanding his entire thought, and [[Marxist philosophy|Marxians]] also refer to it.\n\nIn the first manuscript in which there are extensive quotes on economics from Adam Smith,<ref>Fay, Margaret, \"The Influence of Adam Smith on Marx's Theory of Alienation\", ''Science & Society'' Vol. 47, No. 2 (Summer, 1983), pp. 129\u2013151, S&S Quarterly, Inc.</ref> [[Marx's theory of alienation|Marx exposes his theory of alienation]], which he adapted (not without changes) from [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841). He explains how, under [[capitalism]], more and more people rely on \"labour\" to live. That is, before people could rely in part on [[Nature]] itself for its \"natural needs\"; in modern society, if one wants to eat, one must work: it is only through [[money]] that one may survive. Thus, if the alienation of the worker consists in being a \"slave toward its object\", the worker is doubly alienated: \"first, he receives an object of labour, that is he finds work [as one says: 'I finally found work!'], and second, he receives means of subsistence. He thereby owes it [to labour] the possibility to exist first as a worker, second as a physical subject. The last straw of this servitude [or serfdom] is that it is only his quality as a worker that permits him to continue to conserve himself as a physical subject, and it is only as a physical subject that he can be a worker\". In other words, the worker relies on labour to gain money to be able to live; but he doesn't live, he only survives, as a worker. Labour is only used to create more wealth, instead of achieving the fulfillment of [[human nature]].\n\n== Themes ==\n\u2018Excerpt notes of 1844\u2019 also called the \u2018Paris manuscripts\u2019 are known as some of Karl Marx\u2019s earliest writings on philosophy plus economics. However, they were only published in the 1930s after the Soviet Revolution of 1917 had already taken place. He argues that the worker is alienated in four ways:\n\n# Alienation from the product he produces\n# The labour becomes impersonal\n# Alienation from nature and self\n# Alienation from other human beings\n\n=== Money and alienated man ===\nWithin classical political economy, economists lay out theories determining value in terms of precious metals or money such as silver and gold, costs of production, amount of labour embedded within a product and the, in Marx's view, chaotic process of demand and supply.\n\nMoney was invented only to overcome difficulties exchanging goods, since it was and still would be difficult to trade five oranges for half a dog. Hence money, as the empiricist [[John Stuart Mill]] says, is just the medium of exchange to be more flexible. For Marx, the problem with money consists of the fact that from being a substitute money becomes a good. It does not represent the value of a certain or several goods; instead, the value of those goods is represented by a certain amount of money. Therefore, due to its flexibility, money could purchase everything, as long as sufficiently available. The market mechanism for exchange altered and Marx claimed the market principle formula Money-Commodity-Profit (M-C-M') in contrast to the traditional formula Commodity-Money-Commodity (C-M-C) to be a perversion of the logic of market. As did [[Aristotle]], Marx argues that the market system does not serve a mere desire of exchange, but the aim of profit. To gain profits, money is to be invested and thereby becomes capital resulting in capitalism. Marx defines capital as \u201caccumulated labour\u201d.\n\nThe [[Commodity fetishism|fetishism of money]] is born. Men are evaluated in terms of their materialistic creditability. This also becomes an economic judgement of their morality. The consequence is that human individuality and morality becomes a vehicle for money. Basic human ideals completely change. The main objective of men moves towards earning as much money as possible, putting everything else in background. This enhances the formation and size of gaps between the capitalist and the labourer, and gives power to those who are wealthy. This also means that the poorer become more dependent on the rich, since they are the rich\u2019s employees. This is a rather unfortunate process for the poor, since they have to sell their labour to the capitalist and in return are being paid a wage. However, the capitalist pays lesser wage than the value added by the labourer. When he then brings the product onto the market, the labourer has to buy the product at a proportionally higher price than he can afford. Thereby it becomes impossible for the poor to build up capital and on the other hand quite easy for the capitalist to increase his. A situation of dissimulation and subservience of the poor is created.\n\nDeveloping this idea further on, the credit relationship becomes an object of trades of abuse and misuse. Reaching the state level fairly quickly it puts the state in power of financiers.\n\n=== Alienation ===\nFor Marx, alienation exists mainly because of the tyranny of money. He refers to Aristotle\u2019s [[praxis (process)|praxis]] and production, by saying that the exchange of human activity involved in the exchange of human product, is the generic activity of man. Man\u2019s conscious and authentic existence, he states, is social activity and social satisfaction.\n\nMoreover, he sees human nature in true common life, and if that is not existent as such, men create their common human nature by creating their common life. Furthermore, he argues similarly to Aristotle that authentic common life does not originate from thought but from the material base, needs and egoism. However, in Marx\u2019s view, life has to be humanly organized to allow a real form of common life, since under alienation human interaction is subordinated to a relationship between things. Hence consciousness alone is by far not enough.\n\nRelating alienation to property, Marx notes that to satisfy needs, property has to be exchanged, making it an equivalent in terms of trade and capital. This is called the labour theory of value. Property becomes very impersonal. It is an exchange value, raising it to become real value.\n\nThe cause of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] is to be found in capitalism based on private property of [[means of production]] and money. Capitalist organized labour exploits the working class. It is thrown back at animal level while at the same time the capital class gains wealth.\n\n=== Labour and wage labour ===\nSince nothing coming from nature can enter the market unaltered, exchange presupposes labour, especially [[wage labour]]. Marx is of the opinion that alienation reaches its peak once labour becomes wage labour. A capitalist hires a worker in order to be able to convert capital goods into final products. This does not imply that the product reflects the labourer\u2019s needs in any way, but he produces it by processes alien to him. Furthermore, the wages only just cover the subsistence costs of the worker and his family. Hence the market price does not in any way reflect the wage, allowing the conclusion that the value added by the worker does not go back to the worker, but instead returns to the capitalist. A person who buys with money does not directly exchange the product of their labor. The primitive barter on the other hand, only exchanges a surplus of his own products, without exchanging money, but only to satisfy his needs.\n\nThe more needs vary, the more workers have to specialize the more alienated they become towards each other. Alien needs drive the labourer to work for his only goal, which is the satisfaction of his subsistence needs, to guarantee mere existence.\n\nWith his desire to guarantee his existence, the labourer becomes even more dependent on his employer and the product.\n\nThe more human labour specialises the less human it gets. It rather develops towards commerce and seems to make man an automaton. This indicates and basically states that production causes men to behave like machines, implying that labour is completely alienated from the labouring subject as well as it is alienated from its object. Due to that, Marx regards the unity of human labour as its division, since the productive capability of cooperative labour is a function of specialization and division. He also denounces the impossibility of the labourers\u2019 self-realization.\n\nThis division of labour increases with civilization, meaning that with the introduction of money the worker no longer exchanges only his surplus, but his whole product for money.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Marxist aesthetics]]\n* ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]''\n* ''[[The Principle of Hope]]''\n* [[Young Marx]]\n* [[Marxist humanism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/preface.htm ''Economic & Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844''] (English text in HTML format)\n*[https://archive.org/details/economicphilosophicmanuscripts1844 ''Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844''] (English text in PDF format)\n*[http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Marx,+Karl/%C3%96konomisch-philosophische+Manuskripte+aus+dem+Jahre+1844 Original German text]\n*[http://gary.tedman.pagesperso-orange.fr/index.htm ''Economic & Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' by Karl Marx] (Full English text in a screen format that approximates to the original page layout of the MS)\n\n{{Marx/Engels}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:1932 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Books by Karl Marx]]\n[[Category:Communist books]]\n[[Category:Philosophical literature]]\n[[Category:Books published posthumously]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n[[File:Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Front of 1990 International Publishers edition of Marx's \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844\"]]\n{{Marxism|works}}\n\n'''''Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844''''' (also referred to as '''''The Paris Manuscripts''''')<ref>{{lang-de|\u00d6konomisch-philosophische Manuskripte aus dem Jahre 1844}} or ''{{lang|de|Pariser Manuskripte}}''.</ref> are a series of notes written between April and August 1844 by [[Karl Marx]]. Not published by Marx during his lifetime, they were first released in 1932 by [[Philosophy in the Soviet Union|researchers in the Soviet Union]].\n\n==Context==\nThe notebooks are an early expression of Marx's analysis of economics, chiefly [[Adam Smith]], and critique of the philosophy of [[G. W. F. Hegel]]. ''Die Bewegung der Produktion'' by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz]] is also a key influence.<ref name=\"Levine\">{{cite book |last1=Levine |first1=Norman |title=Divergent Paths: The Hegelian foundations of Marx's method |date=2006 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=223}}</ref><ref name=\"Sperber\">{{cite book |last1=Sperber |first1=Jonathan |title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life |date=2013 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=144}}</ref> The notebooks cover a wide range of topics including [[private property]], [[communism]], and [[money]]. They are best known for their early expression of Marx's argument that the conditions of modern industrial societies result in the estrangement (or [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]) of wage-workers from their own work, their own products, and in turn from themselves and from each other. \n\nBecause the 1844 manuscripts show Marx's thought at the time of its early genesis, their publication, in English not until 1959,<ref>Tedman, Gary. (2004) \"Marx's 1844 manuscripts as a work of art: A hypertextual reinterpretation.\" ''Rethinking Marxism'' 16.4: 427\u2013441.</ref> has profoundly affected recent scholarship on Marx and [[Marxism]], particularly regarding the relation of Marxism to earlier work in [[German Idealism]]. The [[young Marx]] had been relatively ignored until recently, because his early works were considered more \"philosophical\" and by some as not \"scientific\" enough, that is, \"economic\" as in ''[[Das Kapital]]''. However, [[Marxist humanists]] regard this book as one of the most important texts by Marx and crucial for understanding his entire thought, and [[Marxist philosophy|Marxians]] also refer to it.\n\nIn the first manuscript in which there are extensive quotes on economics from Adam Smith,<ref>Fay, Margaret, \"The Influence of Adam Smith on Marx's Theory of Alienation\", ''Science & Society'' Vol. 47, No. 2 (Summer, 1983), pp. 129\u2013151, S&S Quarterly, Inc.</ref> [[Marx's theory of alienation|Marx exposes his theory of alienation]], which he adapted (not without changes) from [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841). He explains how, under [[capitalism]], more and more people rely on \"labour\" to live. That is, before people could rely in part on [[Nature]] itself for its \"natural needs\"; in modern society, if one wants to eat, one must work: it is only through [[money]] that one may survive. Thus, if the alienation of the worker consists in being a \"slave toward its object\", the worker is doubly alienated: \"first, he receives an object of labour, that is he finds work [as one says: 'I finally found work!'], and second, he receives means of subsistence. He thereby owes it [to labour] the possibility to exist first as a worker, second as a physical subject. The last straw of this servitude [or serfdom] is that it is only his quality as a worker that permits him to continue to conserve himself as a physical subject, and it is only as a physical subject that he can be a worker\". In other words, the worker relies on labour to gain money to be able to live; but he doesn't live, he only survives, as a worker. Labour is only used to create more wealth, instead of achieving the fulfillment of [[human nature]].\n\n== Themes ==\n\u2018Excerpt notes of 1844\u2019 also called the \u2018Paris manuscripts\u2019 are known as some of Karl Marx\u2019s earliest writings on philosophy plus economics. However, they were only published in the 1930s after the Soviet Revolution of 1917 had already taken place. He argues that the worker is alienated in four ways:\n\n# Alienation from the product he produces\n# The labour becomes impersonal\n# Alienation from nature and self\n# Alienation from other human beings\n\n=== Money and alienated man ===\nWithin classical political economy, economists lay out theories determining value in terms of precious metals or money such as silver and gold, costs of production, amount of labour embedded within a product and the, in Marx's view, chaotic process of demand and supply.\n\nMoney was invented only to overcome difficulties exchanging goods, since it was and still would be difficult to trade five oranges for half a dog. Hence money, as the empiricist [[John Stuart Mill]] says, is just the medium of exchange to be more flexible. For Marx, the problem with money consists of the fact that from being a substitute money becomes a good. It does not represent the value of a certain or several goods; instead, the value of those goods is represented by a certain amount of money. Therefore, due to its flexibility, money could purchase everything, as long as sufficiently available.

He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. He was the Man of the Tournament in the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]], and one of the top performers at the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|2007 ICC World T20]], both of which India won. In a match against [[England cricket team|England]] at the 2007 World T20, he famously hit six [[Boundary (cricket)|sixes]] in one over bowled by [[Stuart Broad]] \u2014 a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two teams with [[Test cricket|Test match status]]. In the same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] match.\n\nIn 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a [[cancerous]] [[tumor]] in his left lung and underwent [[chemotherapy]] treatment in Boston and Indianapolis.<ref name=\"indianexpress.com\">{{citation|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/tumour-cancerous-yuvi-undergoes-chemo/908423/|title=\"Tumour Cancerous, Yuvi Undergoes Chemo\" \u2013 Indian Express.}}</ref> In March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April.

An all-rounder who bats left-handed in the middle order and bowls [[slow left-arm orthodox]], Yuvraj is the son of former Indian fast bowler and Punjabi actor [[Yograj Singh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.sportskeeda.com/player/yuvraj-singh|title=Yuvraj Singh in Sportskeeda |work=Sportskeeda|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> One of the greatest limited over players to play for India, Yuvraj was particularly noted for his aggressive stroke play of the ball and his fielding.\n\nYuvraj was a member of the Indian cricket team in One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2000 and 2017 and played his first Test match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. He was the Man of the Tournament in the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]], and one of the top performers at the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|2007 ICC World T20]], both of which India won. In a match against [[England cricket team|England]] at the 2007 World T20, he famously hit six [[Boundary (cricket)|sixes]] in one over bowled by [[Stuart Broad]] \u2014 a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two teams with [[Test cricket|Test match status]]. In the same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] match.\n\nIn 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a [[cancerous]] [[tumor]] in his left lung and underwent [[chemotherapy]] treatment in Boston and Indianapolis.<ref name=\"indianexpress.com\">{{citation|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/tumour-cancerous-yuvi-undergoes-chemo/908423/|title=\"Tumour Cancerous, Yuvi Undergoes Chemo\" \u2013 Indian Express.}}</ref> In March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] shortly before the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20|2012 World Twenty20]].\n\nIn 2012, Yuvraj was conferred with the [[Arjuna Award]], India's second highest sporting award by the [[Government of India]]. In 2014, he was awarded the [[Padma Shri]], India's fourth highest civilian honour. At the 2014 [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] auction [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] bought Yuvraj for an all-time high price of {{INR}}14 [[crore]] and, in 2015, the [[Delhi Daredevils]] bought him for {{INR}}16 crore making him the most expensive player ever to be sold in the IPL.\n\nOn 10 June 2019, Yuvraj announced his retirement from all forms of International cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/108416/yuvraj-singh-announces-retirement-from-international-cricket|title=Yuvraj Singh announces retirement from all forms of cricket |work=Cricbuzz |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/yuvraj-singh-retires-indian-cricket-team-world-cup-2011-hero-cancer-battle-1545861-2019-06-10|title=Yuvraj Singh, hero of India's 2011 World Cup triumph, retires from international cricket |work=India Today |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref> He last represented India in June 2017, [[Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 2017|against the West Indies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/26939331/i-decided-move-yuvraj-singh-announces-international-ipl-retirement |title='I have decided to move on' yuvraj has been retired from international cricket on 10th June 2019 probably a sad day for his fans- Yuvraj Singh announces international, IPL retirement |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=10 June 2019|date=10 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Early years and personal life==\nSingh was born in a [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]] family to [[Yograj Singh]], a former India cricketer, and Shabnam Singh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/item/188217-my-son-has-come-back-as-a-winner-says-yuvraj-singhs-father |title=My son has come back as a winner, says Yuvraj Singh's father |publisher=NDTV.com |date=6 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626064524/http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/item/188217-my-son-has-come-back-as-a-winner-says-yuvraj-singhs-father|archive-date=26 June 2012|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dani |first1=Bipin |title=Yuvraj Singh's father not pleased with Hazel Keech's reported name change |url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/sports/cricket/141216/yuvraj-singhs-father-not-pleased-with-hazel-keechs-reported-name-change.html |accessdate=9 March 2020 |work=Deccan Chronicle |date=14 December 2016 |language=en}}</ref> [[Tennis]] and [[roller skating]] were Yuvraj's favourite sports during his childhood and he was quite good at both.
