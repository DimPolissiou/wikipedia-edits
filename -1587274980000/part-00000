Drum machines may imitate [[drum kit]]s or other [[percussion instrument]]s, or produce unique sounds, such as synthesized electronic tones. Most modern drum machines allow users to program their own [[rhythm]]s and beats. Drum machines may create sounds using [[Analog synthesizer|analog synthesis]] or play prerecorded [[Sampling (music)|samples]]. Some drum machines have buttons or pads that allow the performer to play drum sounds \"live\", either on top of a programmed drum beat or as a standalone performance. Drum machines have a range of capabilities, which go from playing a short beat pattern in a loop, to being able to program or record complex song [[arrangement (music)|arrangements]] with changes of meter and style.\n\nDrum machines have had a lasting impact on [[popular music]] in the 20th century. The [[Roland TR-808]], introduced in 1980, significantly influenced the development of [[Dance music (popular)|dance music]], especially [[electronic dance music]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Its successor, the [[Roland TR-909|TR-909]], introduced in 1983, heavily influenced [[techno]] and [[House music|house music]]. The first drum machine to use samples of real drum kits, the [[Linn LM-1]], was introduced in 1980 and adopted by [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] artists including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. In the late 1990s, [[Emulator|software emulations]] began to overtake the popularity of physical drum machines housed in separate plastic or metal chassis.\n\n==History==\n===Early drum machines===\nThe first [[Program (machine)|programmable]] drum machine was invented by [[Al-Jazari]], an [[List of inventions in the medieval Islamic world|Arab engineer]] in the [[Artuqids|Artuqid Sultanate]] (modern Turkey), and described in ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'', written in 1206. His programmable musical device featured four [[automaton]] musicians, including two drummers, that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. It was a programmable drum machine where [[Wiktionary:peg|pegs]] ([[cam]]s) bump into little [[lever]]s that operated the percussion. The drummers could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.<ref name=Sharkey>[[Noel Sharkey]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629182810/http://www.shef.ac.uk/marcoms/eview/articles58/robot.html A 13th Century Programmable Robot (Archive)], [[University of Sheffield]].</ref>\n\n[[File:Joseph Schillinger and the Rhythmicon.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Rhythmicon]] (1932) and [[Joseph Schillinger]], a music educator]]\n;Rhythmicon (1930\u20131932)\nIn 1930\u201332, the innovative and hard-to-use ''[[Rhythmicon]]'' was developed by [[L\u00e9on Theremin]] at the request of [[Henry Cowell]], who wanted an instrument which could play compositions with multiple [[rhythmic unit|rhythmic patterns]], based on the [[harmonic series (music)|overtone series]], that were far too hard to perform on existing keyboard instruments. The invention could produce sixteen different rhythms, each associated with a particular [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], either individually or in any combination, including en masse, if desired. Received with considerable interest when it was publicly introduced in 1932, the Rhythmicon was soon set aside by Cowell and was virtually forgotten for decades. The next generation of rhythm machines played only pre-programmed rhythms such as [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], [[Tango (dance)|tango]], or [[bossa nova]]\n\n;Chamberlin Rhythmate (1957)\nIn 1957, Harry Chamberlin, an engineer from Iowa, created the Chamberlin Rhythmate, which allowed users to select between 14 [[tape loop]]s of drum kits and percussion instruments performing various beats. Like the [[Chamberlin keyboard]], the Rhythmate was intended for family singalongs. Around 100 units were sold.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/09/22/the-14-drum-machines-that-shaped-modern-music/|title=The 14 drum machines that shaped modern music|date=22 September 2016|work=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|access-date=21 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n;First commercial product \u2013 [[Wurlitzer]] Sideman (1959)\n[[File:Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine (inside) front view.jpg|thumb|upright|Wurlitzer Sideman (1959, inner view)]]\nIn 1959, [[Wurlitzer]] released the Sideman, which generates sounds mechanically by a rotating disc, similarly to a [[music box]]. A slider controls the tempo (between 34 and 150 beats per minute). Sounds can also be triggered individually through buttons on a control panel. The Sideman was a success and drew criticism from musicians' unions, which ruled that it could only be used in cocktail lounges if the keyboardist was paid the wages of three musicians. Wurlitzer ceased production of the Sideman in 1969.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Raymond Scott (1960\u20131963)\nIn 1960, [[Raymond Scott]] constructed the ''Rhythm Synthesizer'' and, in 1963, a drum machine called ''Bandito the Bongo Artist''.

It was a floor-type machine with built-in speaker, and featuring a keyboard for the manual play, in addition to the multiple automatic rhythm patterns. Its price was comparable with the average annual income of Japanese at that time.<ref name=DoncaMatic/>\n\nThen, their effort was focused on the improvement of reliability and performance, along with the size reduction and the cost down. Unstable vacuum tube circuit was replaced with reliable transistor circuit on Donca-Matic DC-11 in mid-1960s, and in 1966, bulky mechanical-wheel was also replaced with compact transistor circuit on [[List of Korg products#1960s|Donca-Matic DE-20]] and DE-11. In 1967, Mini Pops MP-2 was developed as an option of [[Yamaha Electone]] (electric organ), and Mini Pops was established as a series of the compact desktop rhythm machine.

It offered 16 preset patterns, and four buttons to manually play each instrument sound ([[cymbal]], [[claves]], [[cowbell]] and [[bass drum]]). The rhythm patterns could also be cascaded together by pushing multiple rhythm buttons simultaneously, and the possible combination of rhythm patterns were more than a hundred (on the later models of Rhythm Ace, the individual volumes of each instrument could be adjusted with the small knobs or faders). The FR-1 was adopted by the [[Hammond organ|Hammond Organ Company]] for incorporation within their latest organ models.

The first major pop song to use a drum machine was \"[[Saved by the Bell (song)|Saved by the Bell]]\" by [[Robin Gibb]], which reached #2 in Britain in 1969. Drum machine tracks were also heavily used on the [[Sly & the Family Stone]] album ''There's a Riot Goin' On'', released in 1971. Sly & the Family Stone was the first group to have a number #1 pop single that used a drum machine: that single was \"[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-sly-stone-drum-machine-tracks-20141105-column.html|title=New release gathers Sly Stone's drum machine tracks of '69-'70|first=Randall|last=Roberts|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> \n\nThe German [[krautrock]] band [[Can (band)|Can]] also used a drum machine on their song \"[[Peking O]]\". The 1972 [[Timmy Thomas]] single \"[[Why Can't We Live Together]]\"/\"Funky Me\" featured a distinctive use of a drum machine and keyboard arrangement on both tracks. Another early example of electronic drums used by a rock group, is [[Obscured by Clouds]] by [[Pink Floyd]], from early in 1972. The first album on which a drum machine produced all the percussion was [[Kingdom Come (British band)|Kingdom Come]]'s ''[[Journey (Kingdom Come album)|Journey]]'', recorded in November 1972 using a Bentley Rhythm Ace. French singer-songwriter [[L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9]] mixed a drum machine with a [[symphonic orchestra]] in the song \"Je t'aimais bien, tu sais...\" in his album ''[[L'Espoir (album)|L'Espoir]]'', released in 1974. [[Miles Davis]]' live band began to utilize a drum machine in 1974 (played by percussionist [[James Mtume]]), which can be heard on [[Dark Magus]] (1977). [[Osamu Kitajima]]'s [[Progressive rock|progressive]] [[psychedelic rock]] album ''[[Benzaiten]]'' (1974) also utilized drum machines, and one of the album's contributors, [[Haruomi Hosono]],<ref>{{Discogs release|1303605|Osamu Kitajima \u2013 Benzaiten}}</ref> would later start the [[electronic music]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (as \"Yellow Magic Band\") in 1977.<ref name=\"discogs_paraiso\">{{Discogs release|1188801|Harry Hosono And The Yellow Magic Band \u2013 Paraiso}}</ref>\n\n===Drum sound synthesis===\n<!-- Unrelated image possibly confuse readers : [[File:GMStandardDrumMap.gif|thumb|right|GM Standard Drum Map]] -->\n\nA key difference between such early machines and more modern equipment is that they use [[synthesizer|sound synthesis]] rather than [[Digital data|digital]] [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in order to generate their sounds. For example, a [[snare drum]] or [[maraca]] sound would typically be created using a burst of [[white noise]] whereas a [[bass drum]] sound would be made using [[sine wave]]s or other basic [[waveform]]s. This meant that while the resulting sound was not very close to that of the real instrument, each model tended to have a unique character.

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] bought one of the very first LM-1s and used it on nearly all of his most popular albums, including ''[[1999 (Prince album)|1999]]'' and ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]''.\n\nMany of the drum sounds on the LM-1 were composed of two chips that were triggered at the same time, and each voice was individually tunable with individual outputs. Due to memory limitations, a [[crash cymbal]] sound was not available except as an expensive third-party modification. A cheaper version of the LM-1 was released in 1982 called the [[LinnDrum]]. Priced at $2,995, not all of its voices were tunable, but crash cymbal was included as a standard sound. Like its predecessor the LM-1, it featured swappable sound chips. The LinnDrum can be heard on records such as [[The Cars]]' ''Heartbeat City'' and [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s soundtrack for the film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.\n\nIt was feared the LM-1 would put every session drummer in Los Angeles out of work and it caused many of L.A.'s top session drummers ([[Jeff Porcaro]] is one example) to purchase their own drum machines and learn to program them themselves in order to stay employed.

less common, partly supplanted by general-purpose hardware samplers controlled by sequencers (built-in or external), software-based sequencing and sampling and the use of loops, and [[music workstation]]s with integrated sequencing and drum sounds. TR-808 and other digitized drum machine sounds can be found in archives on the Internet. However, traditional drum machines are still being made by companies such as Roland Corporation (under the name [[Boss Corporation|Boss]]), [[Zoom (audio company)|Zoom]], [[Korg]] and [[Alesis]], whose [[Alesis SR-16|SR-16]] drum machine has remained popular since it was introduced in 1991.\n\nThere are percussion-specific [[sound module]]s that can be triggered by pickups, [[trigger pad]]s, or through MIDI. These are called [[Electronic drum|drum modules]]; the Alesis D4 and Roland TD-8 are popular examples. Unless such a sound module also features a sequencer, it is, strictly speaking, not a drum machine.\n\n==Programming==\n{{See also|Music sequencer}}\n[[File:Four to the floor Roland TR-707.jpg|thumb|[[Four on the floor (music)|4-on-the-floor]] on [[Roland TR-707]]]]\n\nProgramming of drum machines varies from product to product.  On most products, it can be done in '''real time''': the user creates drum patterns by pressing the trigger pads as though a [[drum kit]] were being played; or using '''step-sequencing''': the pattern is built up over time by adding individual sounds at certain points by placing them, as with the TR-808 and TR-909, along a 16-step bar. For example, a generic [[Four on the floor (music)|4-on-the-floor]] dance pattern could be made by placing a closed high hat on the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th steps, then a kick drum on the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th steps, and a clap or snare on the 5th and 13th. This pattern could be varied in a multitude of ways to obtain [[Fill (music)|fills]], [[Breakdown (music)|break-downs]] and other elements that the programmer sees fit, which in turn could be sequenced with '''song-sequence''' \u2014 essentially the drum machine plays back the programmed patterns from memory in an order the programmer has chosen. The machine will [[Quantization (music)|quantize]] entries that are slightly off-beat in order to make them exactly in time.\n\nIf the drum machine has [[MIDI]] connectivity, then one could program the drum machine with a computer or another MIDI device.\n\n==Comparison with live drumming==\nWhile drum machines have been used much in popular music since the 1980s, \"...scientific studies show there are certain aspects of human-created rhythm that machines cannot replicate, or can only replicate poorly\" such as the \"feel\" of human drumming and the ability of a human drummer to respond to changes in a song as it is being played live onstage.<ref name=\"Music.mic\">{{cite web |url=http://mic.com/articles/113504/science-shows-why-drum-machines-will-never-replace-live-drummers |title=Science shows why drum machines will never replace live drummers|last1= Barnes|first1=Tom |date=23 March 2015 |website=mic.com |publisher=Music.mic |access-date=20 September 2015|quote=}}</ref> Human drummers also have the ability to make slight variations in their playing, such as playing \"ahead of the beat\" or \"behind the beat\" for sections of a song, in contrast to a drum machine that plays a pre-programmed rhythm. As well, human drummers play a \"tremendously wide variety of rhythmic variations\" that drum machines cannot reproduce.<ref name=\"Music.mic\"/>\n\n==Labor costs==\nDrum machines developed out of a need to create drum beats when a drum kit was not available. Increasingly, drum machines and drum programming are used by major record labels to undercut the costly expense of studio drummers.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1   = D Arditi\n |title     = Digital Downsizing: The Effects of Digital Music Production on Labor\n |journal      = Journal of Popular Music Studies\n |volume     = 26\n |issue     = 4\n |pages     = 503\u2013520\n |doi     = 10.1111/jpms.12095\n |year     = 2014\n |hdl     = 10106/27051\n|hdl-access     = free\n }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Electronic drum]]\n*[[Groovebox]] &thinsp;(generic groove machines)\n*[[Music sequencer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://drum-machines-history.blogspot.co.uk\n\n{{Drum beats}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum Machine}}\n[[Category:Drum machines|*]]\n[[Category:Music sequencers]]\n[[Category:Electronic musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Drums]]\n[[Category:Arab inventions]]\n[[Category:Turkish inventions]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the early \"drum machine\" computers that used a rotating cylinder as their main memory|drum memory}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|article|date=April 2007}}\n{{Original research|section|date=May 2008}}\n}}\n[[File:BOSS Dr.Rhythm DR-3.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A BOSS DR-3 Dr. Rhythm drum machine]]\nA '''drum machine''' is an [[electronic musical instrument]] that creates percussion sounds, drum beats, and patterns. Drum machines may imitate [[drum kit]]s or other [[percussion instrument]]s, or produce unique sounds, such as synthesized electronic tones. Most modern drum machines allow users to program their own [[rhythm]]s and beats. Drum machines may create sounds using [[Analog synthesizer|analog synthesis]] or play prerecorded [[Sampling (music)|samples]]. Some drum machines have buttons or pads that allow the performer to play drum sounds \"live\", either on top of a programmed drum beat or as a standalone performance. Drum machines have a range of capabilities, which go from playing a short beat pattern in a loop, to being able to program or record complex song [[arrangement (music)|arrangements]] with changes of meter and style.\n\nDrum machines have had a lasting impact on [[popular music]] in the 20th century. The [[Roland TR-808]], introduced in 1980, significantly influenced the development of [[Dance music (popular)|dance music]], especially [[electronic dance music]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Its successor, the [[Roland TR-909|TR-909]], introduced in 1983, heavily influenced [[techno]] and [[House music|house music]]. The first drum machine to use samples of real drum kits, the [[Linn LM-1]], was introduced in 1980 and adopted by [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] artists including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. In the late 1990s, [[Emulator|software emulations]] began to overtake the popularity of physical drum machines housed in separate plastic or metal chassis.\n\n==History==\n===Early drum machines===\nThe first [[Program (machine)|programmable]] drum machine was invented by [[Al-Jazari]], an [[List of inventions in the medieval Islamic world|Arab engineer]] in the [[Artuqids|Artuqid Sultanate]] (modern Turkey), and described in ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'', written in 1206. His programmable musical device featured four [[automaton]] musicians, including two drummers, that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. It was a programmable drum machine where [[Wiktionary:peg|pegs]] ([[cam]]s) bump into little [[lever]]s that operated the percussion. The drummers could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.<ref name=Sharkey>[[Noel Sharkey]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629182810/http://www.shef.ac.uk/marcoms/eview/articles58/robot.html A 13th Century Programmable Robot (Archive)], [[University of Sheffield]].</ref>\n\n[[File:Joseph Schillinger and the Rhythmicon.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Rhythmicon]] (1932) and [[Joseph Schillinger]], a music educator]]\n;Rhythmicon (1930\u20131932)\nIn 1930\u201332, the innovative and hard-to-use ''[[Rhythmicon]]'' was developed by [[L\u00e9on Theremin]] at the request of [[Henry Cowell]], who wanted an instrument which could play compositions with multiple [[rhythmic unit|rhythmic patterns]], based on the [[harmonic series (music)|overtone series]], that were far too hard to perform on existing keyboard instruments. The invention could produce sixteen different rhythms, each associated with a particular [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], either individually or in any combination, including en masse, if desired. Received with considerable interest when it was publicly introduced in 1932, the Rhythmicon was soon set aside by Cowell and was virtually forgotten for decades. The next generation of rhythm machines played only pre-programmed rhythms such as [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], [[Tango (dance)|tango]], or [[bossa nova]]\n\n;Chamberlin Rhythmate (1957)\nIn 1957, Harry Chamberlin, an engineer from Iowa, created the Chamberlin Rhythmate, which allowed users to select between 14 [[tape loop]]s of drum kits and percussion instruments performing various beats.

Another early example of electronic drums used by a rock group, is [[Obscured by Clouds]] by [[Pink Floyd]], from early in 1972. The first album on which a drum machine produced all the percussion was [[Kingdom Come (British band)|Kingdom Come]]'s ''[[Journey (Kingdom Come album)|Journey]]'', recorded in November 1972 using a Bentley Rhythm Ace. French singer-songwriter [[L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9]] mixed a drum machine with a [[symphonic orchestra]] in the song \"Je t'aimais bien, tu sais...\" in his album ''[[L'Espoir (album)|L'Espoir]]'', released in 1974.

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] bought one of the very first LM-1s and used it on nearly all of his most popular albums, including ''[[1999 (Prince album)|1999]]'' and ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]''.\n\nMany of the drum sounds on the LM-1 were composed of two chips that were triggered at the same time, and each voice was individually tunable with individual outputs. Due to memory limitations, a [[crash cymbal]] sound was not available except as an expensive third-party modification. A cheaper version of the LM-1 was released in 1982 called the [[LinnDrum]]. Priced at $2,995, not all of its voices were tunable, but crash cymbal was included as a standard sound. Like its predecessor the LM-1, it featured swappable sound chips. The LinnDrum can be heard on records such as [[The Cars]]' ''Heartbeat City'' and [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s soundtrack for the film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.\n\nIt was feared the LM-1 would put every session drummer in Los Angeles out of work and it caused many of L.A.'s top session drummers ([[Jeff Porcaro]] is one example) to purchase their own drum machines and learn to program them themselves in order to stay employed.

less common, partly supplanted by general-purpose hardware samplers controlled by sequencers (built-in or external), software-based sequencing and sampling and the use of loops, and [[music workstation]]s with integrated sequencing and drum sounds. TR-808 and other digitized drum machine sounds can be found in archives on the Internet. However, traditional drum machines are still being made by companies such as Roland Corporation (under the name [[Boss Corporation|Boss]]), [[Zoom (audio company)|Zoom]], [[Korg]] and [[Alesis]], whose [[Alesis SR-16|SR-16]] drum machine has remained popular since it was introduced in 1991.\n\nThere are percussion-specific [[sound module]]s that can be triggered by pickups, [[trigger pad]]s, or through MIDI. These are called [[Electronic drum|drum modules]]; the Alesis D4 and Roland TD-8 are popular examples. Unless such a sound module also features a sequencer, it is, strictly speaking, not a drum machine.\n\n==Programming==\n{{See also|Music sequencer}}\n[[File:Four to the floor Roland TR-707.jpg|thumb|[[Four on the floor (music)|4-on-the-floor]] on [[Roland TR-707]]]]\n\nProgramming of drum machines varies from product to product.  On most products, it can be done in '''real time''': the user creates drum patterns by pressing the trigger pads as though a [[drum kit]] were being played; or using '''step-sequencing''': the pattern is built up over time by adding individual sounds at certain points by placing them, as with the TR-808 and TR-909, along a 16-step bar. For example, a generic [[Four on the floor (music)|4-on-the-floor]] dance pattern could be made by placing a closed high hat on the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th steps, then a kick drum on the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th steps, and a clap or snare on the 5th and 13th. This pattern could be varied in a multitude of ways to obtain [[Fill (music)|fills]], [[Breakdown (music)|break-downs]] and other elements that the programmer sees fit, which in turn could be sequenced with '''song-sequence''' \u2014 essentially the drum machine plays back the programmed patterns from memory in an order the programmer has chosen. The machine will [[Quantization (music)|quantize]] entries that are slightly off-beat in order to make them exactly in time.\n\nIf the drum machine has [[MIDI]] connectivity, then one could program the drum machine with a computer or another MIDI device.\n\n==Comparison with live drumming==\nWhile drum machines have been used much in popular music since the 1980s, \"...scientific studies show there are certain aspects of human-created rhythm that machines cannot replicate, or can only replicate poorly\" such as the \"feel\" of human drumming and the ability of a human drummer to respond to changes in a song as it is being played live onstage.<ref name=\"Music.mic\">{{cite web |url=http://mic.com/articles/113504/science-shows-why-drum-machines-will-never-replace-live-drummers |title=Science shows why drum machines will never replace live drummers|last1= Barnes|first1=Tom |date=23 March 2015 |website=mic.com |publisher=Music.mic |access-date=20 September 2015|quote=}}</ref> Human drummers also have the ability to make slight variations in their playing, such as playing \"ahead of the beat\" or \"behind the beat\" for sections of a song, in contrast to a drum machine that plays a pre-programmed rhythm. As well, human drummers play a \"tremendously wide variety of rhythmic variations\" that drum machines cannot reproduce.<ref name=\"Music.mic\"/>\n\n==Labor costs==\nDrum machines developed out of a need to create drum beats when a drum kit was not available.

Many of his observations were made during his stay on the island of [[Lesbos]], including especially his descriptions of the [[marine biology]] of the Pyrrha lagoon, now the [[Kalloni#Bay and lagoon|Gulf of Kalloni]]. His theory is based on [[Hylomorphism|his concept of form]], which derives from but is markedly unlike [[Plato]]'s [[theory of Forms]].\n\nThe theory describes five major biological processes, namely [[metabolism]], [[temperature regulation]], [[information processor|information processing]], [[embryogenesis]], and [[inheritance (biology)|inheritance]]. Each was defined in some detail, in some cases sufficient to enable modern biologists to create mathematical models of the [[mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] described. Aristotle's method, too, resembled the style of science used by modern biologists when exploring a new area, with systematic data collection, discovery of patterns, and inference of possible causal explanations from these. He did not perform experiments in the modern sense, but made observations of living animals and carried out dissections. He names some 500 species of bird, mammal, and fish; and he distinguishes dozens of insects and other invertebrates. He describes the internal anatomy of over a hundred animals, and dissected around 35 of these.\n\nAristotle's writings on biology, the first in the [[history of science]], are scattered across several books, forming about a quarter of his writings that have survived. The main biology texts were the ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', ''[[Movement of Animals]]'', ''[[Progression of Animals]]'', ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', and ''[[On the Soul]]'', as well as the lost drawings of ''The Anatomies'' which accompanied the ''History''.\n\nApart from his pupil, [[Theophrastus]], who wrote a matching ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'', no research of comparable scope was carried out in  [[ancient Greece]], though [[Hellenistic]] medicine in Egypt continued Aristotle's inquiry into the mechanisms of the human body. Aristotle's biology was influential in the [[medieval]] Islamic world. Translation of Arabic versions and commentaries into Latin brought knowledge of Aristotle back into Western Europe, but the only biological work widely taught in medieval universities was ''On the Soul''. The association of his work with medieval [[scholasticism]], as well as errors in his theories, caused [[Early Modern]] scientists such as [[Galileo]] and [[William Harvey]] to reject Aristotle. Criticism of his errors and secondhand reports continued for centuries. He has found better acceptance among [[zoology|zoologists]], and some of his long-derided observations in [[marine biology]] have been found in modern times to be true.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Aristotle spent some 20 years at [[Plato's academy]] in [[Classical Athens|Athens]].]]\n\n===Aristotle's background===\n[[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BC) studied at [[Plato's Academy]] in [[Classical Athens|Athens]], remaining there for about 20 years. Like [[Plato]], he sought [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] in his [[philosophy]], but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably of the [[natural history]] of the island of [[Lesbos]], where he spent about two years, and the [[marine biology|marine life]] in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=14}} This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on [[zoology]] was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lycaeum]], where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work.<ref name=Lennox>{{cite web |last1=Lennox |first1=James |title=Aristotle's Biology |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-biology/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=28 November 2014 |date=27 July 2011}}</ref> Aristotle's pupil [[Theophrastus]] later wrote a similar book on [[botany]], [[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|''Enquiry into Plants'']].<ref>{{cite book | title=Ancient Natural History: Histories of Nature | publisher=Routledge | author=French, Roger | year=1994 | pages=92\u201399 | isbn=0-415-11545-0}}</ref>\n\n===Aristotelian forms===\n[[File:M\u00e1scara (24328025622).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Aristotle argued by analogy with a [[woodcarving]] that a thing takes its form both from its design and from the material used.]]\n{{main|Hylomorphism}}\n\nAristotle's biology is constructed on the basis of [[Hylomorphism|his theory of form]], which is derived from Plato's [[theory of Forms]], but significantly different from it. Plato's Forms were eternal and fixed, being \"blueprints in the mind of God\".{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88\u201390}} Real things in the world could, in Plato's view, at best be approximations to these perfect Forms. Aristotle heard Plato's view and developed it into a set of three biological concepts. He uses the same Greek word, {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}} (''eidos''), to mean first of all the set of visible features that uniquely characterised a kind of animal. Aristotle used the word \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (g\u00e9nos) to mean a kind.{{efn|The English and [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] Latin [[genus]] derive from this, and have related meanings.}} For example, the kind of animal called a [[bird]] has feathers, a beak, wings, a hard-shelled egg, and warm blood.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88\u201390}}\n\nAristotle further noted that there are many bird forms within the bird kind \u2013 [[crane (bird)|crane]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[crow]]s, [[bustard]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrows]], and so on, just as there are many forms of [[fish]]es within the fish kind. He sometimes called these ''atoma eid\u0113'', indivisible forms.{{efn|In modern terms, these roughly correspond to [[species]], and some texts use that translation. Aristotle did not formulate a definition resembling that of a modern species, however, and some of his forms are other taxa such as genera or families.}} [[Human]] is one of these indivisible forms: Socrates and the rest of us are all different individually, but we all have human form.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88\u201390}}\n\nFinally, Aristotle observed that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information.{{efn|From Latin ''[[wikt:informo|informo]]'', I form, give shape to.}} Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a [[woodcarving]]. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its ''eidos'' or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.{{efn|In modern terms, this implies a [[formal language|symbolic system]].

The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul. Plants had a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth. Animals had both a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation. Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=370\u2013373}}<ref>Aristotle, ''[[De Anima]]'' II 3</ref>{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=46}}{{-}}\n\n===Processes===\n\n====Metabolism====\n[[File:Aristotle's metabolism.png|thumb|300px|'''Metabolism''': Leroi's [[open system (systems theory)|open system]] model.

The metabolic system for live-bearing tetrapods{{efn|Corresponding to [[mammals]].}} described in the ''Parts of Animals'' can be modelled as an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]], a branching tree of flows of material through the body.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}\n\nThe system worked as follows. The incoming material, food, enters the body and is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the [[fire (element)|element fire]] is released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood is made into [[fat]], whether soft [[suet]] or hard lard. Some fat from all around the body is made into [[semen]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261\u2013284}}\n\nAll the tissues are in Aristotle's view completely uniform parts with no internal structure of any kind; a cartilage for example was the same all the way through, not [[Atomism|subdivided into atoms]] as [[Democritus]] (c. 460\u2013c. 370 BC) had argued.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=79\u201380, 143\u2013145}} The uniform parts can be arranged on a scale of Aristotelian qualities, from the coldest and driest, such as hair, to the hottest and wettest, such as milk.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261\u2013284}}\n\nAt each stage of metabolism, residual materials are excreted as faeces, urine, and bile.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261\u2013284}}\n\n====Temperature regulation====\n[[File:Aristotle's heart temperature model.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Temperature regulation''': Leroi's model based on ''Youth and Old Age, Life and Death'' 26.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261\u2013284}}]]\n\nAristotle's account of temperature regulation sought to explain how an animal maintained a steady temperature and the continued oscillation of the thorax needed for breathing. The system of regulation of temperature and breathing described in ''Youth and Old Age, Life and Death'' 26 is sufficiently detailed to permit modelling as a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] (one that maintains a desired property by opposing disturbances to it), with a few assumptions such as a desired temperature to compare the actual temperature against.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=403\u2013404}}\n\nThe system worked as follows. Heat is constantly lost from the body. Food products reach the heart and are processed into new blood, releasing fire during metabolism, which raises the blood temperature too high. That raises the heart temperature, causing lung volume to increase, in turn raising the airflow at the mouth. The cool air brought in through the mouth reduces the heart temperature, so the lung volume accordingly decreases, restoring the temperature to normal.{{efn|In modern terms, this is [[homeostasis]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=176\u2013177}}}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=403\u2013404}}\n\nThe mechanism only works if the air is cooler than the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=403\u2013404}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=King |first1=R.

It sought to explain how changes in the world led to appropriate behaviour in the animal.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}\n\nThe system worked as follows. The animal's [[sense organ]] is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual change in the animal's [[sensorium|seat of sensation]], which Aristotle believed was the heart, not as we now think the [[brain]]. This in turn causes a change in the heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration in the heat of the heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}\n\nThere is thus a causal chain which transmits information from a sense organ to an organ capable of making decisions, and onwards to a motor organ. In this respect, the model is analogous to a modern understanding of information processing such as in [[sensory-motor coupling]].<ref name=Corcilius>{{cite journal |last1=Corcilius |first1=Klaus |last2=Gregoric |first2=Pavel |title=Aristotle's Model of Animal Motion |journal=Phronesis |date=2013 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=52\u201397 |doi=10.1163/15685284-12341242}}</ref>{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}\n\n====Inheritance====\n[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Inheritance''': model of transmission of movements from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|form]] from the father.

If the semen is hot enough to overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; but if it is too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus [[particulate inheritance|particulate]] (definitely one trait or another), as in [[Mendelian genetics]], unlike the [[Hippocratic]] model which was continuous and [[blending inheritance|blending]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215\u2013221}}\n\nThe child's sex can be influenced by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so if a man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.{{efn|Thus features are, in modern terms, [[sex-linked]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215\u2013221}}}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215\u2013221}}{{-}}\n\n====Embryogenesis====\n[[File:Panum Bird's egg dissected to show embryo within.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Embryogenesis''': Aristotle saw the chick embryo's heart beating. 19th century drawing by [[Peter Panum]]]]\n\nAristotle's model of [[embryogenesis]] sought to explain how the inherited parental characteristics cause the formation and development of an embryo.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=197\u2013200}}\n\nThe system worked as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how [[rennet]] (an [[enzyme]] from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in [[cheesemaking]]. This forms the embryo; it is then developed by the action of the ''pneuma'' (literally, breath or spirit) in the semen. The ''pneuma'' first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg.

Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an [[elephant]] has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a [[mouse]]. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier.

Many of his observations were made during his stay on the island of [[Lesbos]], including especially his descriptions of the [[marine biology]] of the Pyrrha lagoon, now the [[Kalloni#Bay and lagoon|Gulf of Kalloni]]. His theory is based on [[Hylomorphism|his concept of form]], which derives from but is markedly unlike [[Plato]]'s [[theory of Forms]].\n\nThe theory describes five major biological processes, namely [[metabolism]], [[temperature regulation]], [[information processor|information processing]], [[embryogenesis]], and [[inheritance (biology)|inheritance]]. Each was defined in some detail, in some cases sufficient to enable modern biologists to create mathematical models of the [[mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] described. Aristotle's method, too, resembled the style of science used by modern biologists when exploring a new area, with systematic data collection, discovery of patterns, and inference of possible causal explanations from these. He did not perform experiments in the modern sense, but made observations of living animals and carried out dissections. He names some 500 species of bird, mammal, and fish; and he distinguishes dozens of insects and other invertebrates. He describes the internal anatomy of over a hundred animals, and dissected around 35 of these.\n\nAristotle's writings on biology, the first in the [[history of science]], are scattered across several books, forming about a quarter of his writings that have survived. The main biology texts were the ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', ''[[Movement of Animals]]'', ''[[Progression of Animals]]'', ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', and ''[[On the Soul]]'', as well as the lost drawings of ''The Anatomies'' which accompanied the ''History''.\n\nApart from his pupil, [[Theophrastus]], who wrote a matching ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'', no research of comparable scope was carried out in  [[ancient Greece]], though [[Hellenistic]] medicine in Egypt continued Aristotle's inquiry into the mechanisms of the human body. Aristotle's biology was influential in the [[medieval]] Islamic world. Translation of Arabic versions and commentaries into Latin brought knowledge of Aristotle back into Western Europe, but the only biological work widely taught in medieval universities was ''On the Soul''. The association of his work with medieval [[scholasticism]], as well as errors in his theories, caused [[Early Modern]] scientists such as [[Galileo]] and [[William Harvey]] to reject Aristotle. Criticism of his errors and secondhand reports continued for centuries. He has found better acceptance among [[zoology|zoologists]], and some of his long-derided observations in [[marine biology]] have been found in modern times to be true.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Aristotle spent some 20 years at [[Plato's academy]] in [[Classical Athens|Athens]].]]\n\n===Aristotle's background===\n[[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BC) studied at [[Plato's Academy]] in [[Classical Athens|Athens]], remaining there for about 20 years. Like [[Plato]], he sought [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] in his [[philosophy]], but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably of the [[natural history]] of the island of [[Lesbos]], where he spent about two years, and the [[marine biology|marine life]] in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=14}} This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on [[zoology]] was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lycaeum]], where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work.<ref name=Lennox>{{cite web |last1=Lennox |first1=James |title=Aristotle's Biology |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-biology/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=28 November 2014 |date=27 July 2011}}</ref> Aristotle's pupil [[Theophrastus]] later wrote a similar book on [[botany]], [[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|''Enquiry into Plants'']].<ref>{{cite book | title=Ancient Natural History: Histories of Nature | publisher=Routledge | author=French, Roger | year=1994 | pages=92\u201399 | isbn=0-415-11545-0}}</ref>\n\n===Aristotelian forms===\n[[File:M\u00e1scara (24328025622).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Aristotle argued by analogy with a [[woodcarving]] that a thing takes its form both from its design and from the material used.]]\n{{main|Hylomorphism}}\n\nAristotle's biology is constructed on the basis of [[Hylomorphism|his theory of form]], which is derived from Plato's [[theory of Forms]], but significantly different from it. Plato's Forms were eternal and fixed, being \"blueprints in the mind of God\".{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88\u201390}} Real things in the world could, in Plato's view, at best be approximations to these perfect Forms. Aristotle heard Plato's view and developed it into a set of three biological concepts. He uses the same Greek word, {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}} (''eidos''), to mean first of all the set of visible features that uniquely characterised a kind of animal. Aristotle used the word \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (g\u00e9nos) to mean a kind.{{efn|The English and [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] Latin [[genus]] derive from this, and have related meanings.}} For example, the kind of animal called a [[bird]] has feathers, a beak, wings, a hard-shelled egg, and warm blood.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88\u201390}}\n\nAristotle further noted that there are many bird forms within the bird kind \u2013 [[crane (bird)|crane]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[crow]]s, [[bustard]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrows]], and so on, just as there are many forms of [[fish]]es within the fish kind. He sometimes called these ''atoma eid\u0113'', indivisible forms.{{efn|In modern terms, these roughly correspond to [[species]], and some texts use that translation. Aristotle did not formulate a definition resembling that of a modern species, however, and some of his forms are other taxa such as genera or families.}} [[Human]] is one of these indivisible forms: Socrates and the rest of us are all different individually, but we all have human form.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88\u201390}}\n\nFinally, Aristotle observed that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information.{{efn|From Latin ''[[wikt:informo|informo]]'', I form, give shape to.}} Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a [[woodcarving]]. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its ''eidos'' or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.{{efn|In modern terms, this implies a [[formal language|symbolic system]]. [[Armand Marie Leroi|Armand Leroi]] notes that biologists will at once think in this context of the [[nucleotide]] \"letters\" of [[DNA]] which give form to organisms.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88\u201390}}}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88\u201390}}\n\n==System==\n\n===Soul as system===\n[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Soul#Aristotle|structure of the souls]] of plants, animals, and humans, according to Aristotle, where humans are unique in having all three types of soul.]]\n{{main|Soul#Aristotle|On the Soul}}\n\nAs analysed by the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Armand Marie Leroi|Armand Leroi]], Aristotle's biology included five major interlocking [[biological process|processes]]:{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=370\u2013373}}\n\n# a [[metabolism|metabolic]] process, whereby animals take in matter, change its qualities, and distribute these to use to grow, live, and reproduce\n# a cycle of [[temperature regulation]], whereby animals [[homeostasis|maintain a steady state]], but which progressively [[ageing|fails in old age]]\n# an [[information processor|information processing]] model whereby animals receive [[sensory system|sensory]] information, alter it in the [[sensorium|seat of sensation]],{{efn|Like the ancient Egyptians, Aristotle believed that the [[sensorium|seat of the rational and sensitive souls]] was the heart, not the brain{{sfn|Mason|1962|page=45}}}} and use it [[motor system|to drive movements]] of the limbs. He thus separated sensation from thought, unlike all previous philosophers except [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].{{sfn|Guthrie|1981|page=348}}\n# the process of [[inheritance (biology)|inheritance]].\n# the processes of [[embryonic development]] and of [[spontaneous generation]]\n\nThe five processes formed [[Soul#Aristotle|what Aristotle called the soul]]: it was not something extra, but the system consisting exactly of these mechanisms. The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul. Plants had a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth. Animals had both a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation. Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=370\u2013373}}<ref>Aristotle, ''[[De Anima]]'' II 3</ref>{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=46}}{{-}}\n\n===Processes===\n\n====Metabolism====\n[[File:Aristotle's metabolism.png|thumb|300px|'''Metabolism''': Leroi's [[open system (systems theory)|open system]] model. Food is converted to the body's uniform parts and excreted residues.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}]]\n\nAristotle's account of metabolism sought to explain how food was processed by the body to provide both heat and the materials for the body's construction and maintenance. The metabolic system for live-bearing tetrapods{{efn|Corresponding to [[mammals]].}} described in the ''Parts of Animals'' can be modelled as an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]], a branching tree of flows of material through the body.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}\n\nThe system worked as follows. The incoming material, food, enters the body and is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the [[fire (element)|element fire]] is released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood is made into [[fat]], whether soft [[suet]] or hard lard. Some fat from all around the body is made into [[semen]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261\u2013284}}\n\nAll the tissues are in Aristotle's view completely uniform parts with no internal structure of any kind; a cartilage for example was the same all the way through, not [[Atomism|subdivided into atoms]] as [[Democritus]] (c. 460\u2013c. 370 BC) had argued.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=79\u201380, 143\u2013145}} The uniform parts can be arranged on a scale of Aristotelian qualities, from the coldest and driest, such as hair, to the hottest and wettest, such as milk.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261\u2013284}}\n\nAt each stage of metabolism, residual materials are excreted as faeces, urine, and bile.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261\u2013284}}\n\n====Temperature regulation====\n[[File:Aristotle's heart temperature model.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Temperature regulation''': Leroi's model based on ''Youth and Old Age, Life and Death'' 26.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400\u2013401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261\u2013284}}]]\n\nAristotle's account of temperature regulation sought to explain how an animal maintained a steady temperature and the continued oscillation of the thorax needed for breathing. The system of regulation of temperature and breathing described in ''Youth and Old Age, Life and Death'' 26 is sufficiently detailed to permit modelling as a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] (one that maintains a desired property by opposing disturbances to it), with a few assumptions such as a desired temperature to compare the actual temperature against.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=403\u2013404}}\n\nThe system worked as follows. Heat is constantly lost from the body. Food products reach the heart and are processed into new blood, releasing fire during metabolism, which raises the blood temperature too high. That raises the heart temperature, causing lung volume to increase, in turn raising the airflow at the mouth. The cool air brought in through the mouth reduces the heart temperature, so the lung volume accordingly decreases, restoring the temperature to normal.{{efn|In modern terms, this is [[homeostasis]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=176\u2013177}}}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=403\u2013404}}\n\nThe mechanism only works if the air is cooler than the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=403\u2013404}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=King |first1=R.

It sought to explain how changes in the world led to appropriate behaviour in the animal.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}\n\nThe system worked as follows. The animal's [[sense organ]] is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual change in the animal's [[sensorium|seat of sensation]], which Aristotle believed was the heart, not as we now think the [[brain]]. This in turn causes a change in the heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration in the heat of the heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}\n\nThere is thus a causal chain which transmits information from a sense organ to an organ capable of making decisions, and onwards to a motor organ. In this respect, the model is analogous to a modern understanding of information processing such as in [[sensory-motor coupling]].<ref name=Corcilius>{{cite journal |last1=Corcilius |first1=Klaus |last2=Gregoric |first2=Pavel |title=Aristotle's Model of Animal Motion |journal=Phronesis |date=2013 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=52\u201397 |doi=10.1163/15685284-12341242}}</ref>{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}\n\n====Inheritance====\n[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Inheritance''': model of transmission of movements from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|form]] from the father.

The father's semen and the mother's menses have movements that encode their parental characteristics.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215\u2013221}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=50}} The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define [[Aristotle#Aristotle's epistemology|the form or ''eidos'']] of the species, while the movements of both the father's and the mother's uniform parts define features other than the form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215\u2013221}}\n\nAristotle's theory has some symmetry, as semen movements carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is hot enough to overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; but if it is too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus [[particulate inheritance|particulate]] (definitely one trait or another), as in [[Mendelian genetics]], unlike the [[Hippocratic]] model which was continuous and [[blending inheritance|blending]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215\u2013221}}\n\nThe child's sex can be influenced by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so if a man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.{{efn|Thus features are, in modern terms, [[sex-linked]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215\u2013221}}}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215\u2013221}}{{-}}\n\n====Embryogenesis====\n[[File:Panum Bird's egg dissected to show embryo within.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Embryogenesis''': Aristotle saw the chick embryo's heart beating. 19th century drawing by [[Peter Panum]]]]\n\nAristotle's model of [[embryogenesis]] sought to explain how the inherited parental characteristics cause the formation and development of an embryo.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=197\u2013200}}\n\nThe system worked as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how [[rennet]] (an [[enzyme]] from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in [[cheesemaking]]. This forms the embryo; it is then developed by the action of the ''pneuma'' (literally, breath or spirit) in the semen. The ''pneuma'' first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The ''pneuma'' then makes the other organs develop.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=197\u2013200}}\n\n==Method==\n{{further|History of scientific method}}\n\nAristotle has been called unscientific{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369\u2013373}} by philosophers from [[Francis Bacon]] onwards{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369\u2013373}} for at least two reasons: his scientific style,{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=365\u2013368}} and his use of [[Scientific explanation|explanation]]. His explanations are in turn made cryptic by his complicated [[Four causes|system of causes]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369\u2013373}} However, these charges need to be considered in the light of what was known in his own time.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369\u2013373}} His systematic gathering of data, too, is obscured by the lack of modern methods of presentation, such as tables of data: for example, the whole of ''[[History of Animals]]'' Book VI is taken up with a list of observations of the life histories of birds that \"would now be summarized in a single table in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' \u2013 and in the Online Supplementary Information at that\".{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=397}}\n\n===Scientific style===\n[[File:Two of Aristotle's Growth Laws.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals, including that [[brood size]] decreases with body mass, whereas [[gestation]] period increases.

In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=365\u2013368}}\n\nFrom the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of [[biological rules|rules]] relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals{{efn|Excluding the [[Cetacea]] (whales and dolphins) and [[Chiroptera]] (bats).}}) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an [[elephant]] has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a [[mouse]]. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier.

''Columbo'' then aired less frequently on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1989 to 2003.\n\nThe character and show, created by [[Richard Levinson]] and [[William Link]], popularized the [[inverted detective story]] format, which begins by showing the commission of the crime and its perpetrator; the plot therefore usually has no \"[[whodunit]]\" element, and instead revolves around how a perpetrator known to the audience will finally be caught and exposed (sometimes referred to as a \"howcatchem\").\n\nColumbo is a shrewd but inelegant [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] homicide detective whose trademarks include his rumpled beige raincoat, unassuming demeanor, frequent cigar smoking, old [[Peugeot 403]], unseen wife (whom he mentions regularly), and [[catchphrase]] \"Just one more thing.\" His suspects are often affluent members of [[high society (social class)|high society]] who try to carefully cover their tracks. Initially dismissive of Columbo's [[circumstantial speech]] and apparent ineptitude, they become increasingly unsettled as his pestering behavior leads him to tease out incriminating evidence. His relentless approach often leads to [[self-incrimination]] or an outright confession by the suspect.\n\nEpisodes of ''Columbo'' are between 70 and 98 minutes long, and have been broadcast in 44 countries.

''Columbo'' then aired less regularly on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] beginning in 1989 under the umbrella of ''The ABC Mystery Movie''.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC MYSTERY MOVIE, THE: COLUMBO: COLUMBO GOES TO THE GUILLOTINE (TV)|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?item=T:16910|publisher=The Paley Center For Media|access-date=September 10, 2013}}</ref> The last episode was broadcast in 2003 as part of ''ABC Thursday Night at the Movies''.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC THURSDAY NIGHT AT THE MOVIES: COLUMBO: COLUMBO LIKES THE NIGHTLIFE (TV)|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?item=B:75207|publisher=The Paley Center For Media|access-date=September 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn almost every episode the audience sees the crime unfold at the beginning and knows the identity of the culprit, typically an affluent member of society. Once Columbo enters the story (he rarely appears in the first act), viewers watch him solve the case by sifting through the contradictions between the truth and the version presented to him by the killer(s). This style of mystery is sometimes referred to as a \"[[howcatchem]]\", in contrast to the traditional [[whodunit]]. In structural analysis terms, the majority of the narrative is therefore [[Detective d\u00e9nouement|d\u00e9nouement]], a feature normally reserved for the very end of a story. Episodes tend to be driven by their characters, the audience observing the criminal's reactions to Columbo's increasingly intrusive presence. The explanation for the crime and its method having played out as part of the narrative, most of the stories simply end with the criminal's reaction at being found out.\n\nIn the beginning of every episode, Columbo's genius was hidden by his frumpy, friendly and disarming demeanor, luring the killer into a false sense of security. In some cases, the killer's arrogance and dismissive attitude allow Columbo to manipulate his suspects into self-incrimination. While the details, and eventually the motivation(s), of the murderers' actions are shown to the viewer, Columbo's true thoughts and intentions are almost never revealed until close to the end of the episode (he occasionally begins to whistle the tune \"[[This Old Man]]\" as the pieces begin to fall into place). Columbo generally maintains a friendly relationship with the murderer until the end. The point at which the detective first begins to suspect the murderer is generally not revealed, although it is often fairly early on. Columbo had a duality of character; the disarming and unkempt detective and the hidden genius sleuth. The genius would sometimes starkly manifest itself through his eyes as it did when Jack Cassidy\u2019s killer escaped from the hand-cuffs in his magic show. Such moments always bode bad tidings for the killer. In some instances, such as [[Ruth Gordon]]'s avenging elderly mystery writer in \"Try and Catch Me\", [[Janet Leigh]]'s terminally ill and deluded actress in \"Forgotten Lady\", [[Donald Pleasence]]'s elegant [[Winemaker#Vintner|vintner]] in \"Any Old Port in a Storm\", and [[Johnny Cash]]'s enserfed singer in \"Swan Song\", the killer is more sympathetic than the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27997/columbo-mystery-movie-collection-1989|title=DVD Talk|publisher=DVD Talk|access-date=June 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nEach case is generally concluded in a similar style, with Columbo dropping any pretense of uncertainty and sharing details of his conclusion of the killer's guilt. Following the killer's reaction, the episode generally ends with the killer confessing or quietly submitting to arrest. There are few attempts to deceive the viewer or provide a twist in the tale. One convoluted exception is \"Last Salute to the Commodore\", where [[Robert Vaughn]] is seen elaborately disposing of a body, but is proved later to have been covering for his alcoholic wife, whom he mistakenly thought to be the murderer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074329/trivia?item=qt1835800|title=Quotes from Columbo (TV Series) Last Salute to the Commodore (1976)}}</ref> Sometimes, Columbo sets up the murderer with a trick designed to elicit a confession. An example occurs in \"Dagger of the Mind\", in which Columbo flips an evidentiary pearl into the victim's umbrella, bringing about incriminating activity from [[Richard Basehart]] and [[Honor Blackman]]. Oddly, the [[Hallmark Channel]]'s replay of the episode (2020) edits out the revealing scene, thus completely altering the meaning of the ending of the episode.\n\n==Development and character profile==\n{{See also|Columbo (character)}}\n[[File:Case Study House No. 22.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Stahl House]] served as the filming location of the first ''Columbo'' pilot \"Prescription: Murder\" with guest stars Gene Barry, Nina Foch and William Windom.]]\nThe character of Columbo was created by the writing team of [[Richard Levinson]] and [[William Link]], who said that Columbo was partially inspired by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s  ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' character Porfiry Petrovich<ref name=\"latimes1\">{{Cite journal |last=Sachs |first=Mark |date=2003-01-28 |title=Dostoevsky, a touch of Columbo |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/28/entertainment/et-tips28 |journal=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}</ref> as well as [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s humble cleric-detective [[Father Brown]]. Other sources claim Columbo's character is also influenced by Inspector Fichet from the French suspense-thriller film ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'' (1955).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950217/REVIEWS/502170302/1023|title=''Sun Times'' reviews|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|access-date=June 27, 2011|date=February 17, 1995}}</ref>\n\nThe character first appeared in a 1960 episode of the television-anthology series ''The Chevy Mystery Show,'' titled \"Enough Rope\". This was adapted by Levinson and Link from their short story \"May I Come In,\" which had been published as \"Dear Corpus Delicti\" in an issue of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]''. The short story did not include Columbo as a character.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawidziak|first=Mark|title=The Columbo phile : a casebook|year=1989|publisher=Mysterious P.|location=New York|isbn=0-89296-376-X|pages=20}}</ref> The first actor to portray Columbo, character actor [[Bert Freed]], was a stocky character actor with a thatch of grey hair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/10/20/columbo-peter-falk-boxed-set/1637909/|title=Columbo: The Complete Series available in 34-disc set|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref>\n\nFreed's Columbo wore a rumpled suit and smoked a cigar, but he otherwise had few of the other now-familiar Columbo mannerisms. However, the character is still recognizably Columbo, and uses some of the same methods of misdirecting and distracting his suspects. During the course of the show, the increasingly frightened murderer brings pressure from the district attorney's office to have Columbo taken off the case, but the detective fights back with his own contacts.\n\nAlthough Freed received third billing, he wound up with almost as much screen time as the killer and appeared immediately after the first commercial. This delayed entry of the character into the narrative of the screen play became a defining characteristic of the structure of the Columbo series.  This teleplay is available for viewing in the archives of the [[Paley Center for Media]] in New York City and Los Angeles.\n\nLevinson and Link then adapted the TV drama into the stage play ''Prescription: Murder.'' This was first performed at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco on January 2, 1962, with [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Oscar]]-winning character actor [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] in the role of Columbo. Mitchell was 70 years old at the time. The stage production starred [[Joseph Cotten]] as the murderer and [[Agnes Moorehead]] as the victim. Mitchell died of cancer while the play was touring in out-of-town tryouts; Columbo was his last role.\n\n[[File:NBC Mystery Movie stars 1975 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The NBC Mystery Movie]]'' program worked on a rotating basis \u2013 one per month from each of its shows.

Bottom right: [[Rock Hudson]] in ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'']]\nIn 1968, the same play was made into a two-hour television movie that aired on NBC. The writers suggested [[Lee J. Cobb]] and [[Bing Crosby]] for the role of Columbo, but Cobb was unavailable and Crosby turned it down because he felt it would take too much time away from the golf links. Director Richard Irving convinced Levinson and Link that Falk, who excitedly said he \"would kill to play that cop\", could pull it off even though he was much younger than the writers had in mind.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawidziak|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Dawidziak|title=The Columbo Phile: A Casebook|year=1989|publisher=Mysterious Press|location=New York|isbn=0-89296-376-X|pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nOriginally a one-off TV-Movie-of-the-Week, ''Prescription: Murder'' has Falk's Columbo pitted against a psychiatrist ([[Gene Barry]]). In this movie, the psychiatrist gives the new audience a perfect description of Columbo's character. Due to the success of this film, NBC requested that a pilot for a potential series be made to see if the character could be sustained on a regular basis, leading to the 1971 hour and a half film, ''Ransom for a Dead Man'', with [[Lee Grant]] playing the killer. The popularity of the second film prompted the creation of a regular series on NBC, that premiered in the fall of 1971 as part of ''[[The NBC Mystery Movie]]'' [[wheel series]] rotation: ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'', and other [[whodunit]]s. In the episode ''Murder by the Book'', hardcore Columbo fans may notice the killer signing a paperback book titled, ''Prescription: Murder.''\n\nAccording to ''TV Guide'', the original plan was that a new ''Columbo'' episode would air every week, but as a motion picture star, Peter Falk refused to commit to such an arduous schedule, which would have meant shooting an episode every five days. The network arranged for the ''Columbo'' segments to air once a month on Wednesday nights. The high quality of  ''Columbo'', ''McMillan & Wife'', and ''McCloud'' was due in large part to the extra time spent on each episode. The term ''[[Wheel series|wheel show]]'' was coined to describe this format, and additional such series were attempted by NBC, but the astounding success of ''The NBC Mystery Movie'' series was not repeated.\n\n''Columbo'' was an immediate hit in the [[Nielsen ratings]] and Falk won an [[Emmy Award]] for his role in the show's first season. In its second year the ''Mystery Movie'' series was moved to Sunday nights, where it then remained during its seven-season run. The show became the anchor of NBC's Sunday night line up. ''Columbo'' aired regularly from 1971\u201378 on NBC. After its cancellation by NBC in 1978, ''Columbo'' was revived on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] between 1989 and 2003 in several new seasons and a few made-for-TV movie \"specials\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1466074/companycredits | title = Columbo (1971\u20132003) Company Credits | access-date = June 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nColumbo's wardrobe was personally provided by Peter Falk; they were his own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in ''Prescription: Murder''. Falk would often [[ad libitum|ad lib]] his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets for a piece of evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine.<ref name=JustOneMoreThing>{{cite book |last= Falk | first= Peter | date= August 24, 2007 | title= Just One More Thing |publisher= Da Capo Press | isbn= 978-0-7867-1939-6}}</ref> According to Levinson, the catchphrase \"one more thing\" was conceived when he and Link were writing the play:  \"we had a scene that was too short, and we had already had Columbo make his exit.  We were too lazy to retype the scene, so we had him come back and say, 'Oh, just one more thing . . .'

In 2007, he claimed he had chosen a script for one last Columbo episode, \"Columbo: Hear No Evil\". The script was renamed \"Columbo's Last Case\". ABC declined the project. In response, producers for the series announced that they were attempting to shop the project to foreign production companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2007/03/27/2007-03-27_with_aging_falk_columbo_looks_like_close.html|title=With aging Falk, 'Columbo' looks like a closed case|work=Daily News|location=New York|date=March 27, 2007|access-date=June 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/plaindealer/mark_dawidziak/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/1178008739327380.xml&coll=2|title=A mystery Columbo can't seem to crack|publisher=Cleveland.com|access-date=June 27, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607095946/http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/plaindealer/mark_dawidziak/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fentertainment%2F1178008739327380.xml&coll=2|archivedate=June 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, Falk was diagnosed with [[dementia]] in late 2007.<ref name=\"mail\">{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=David|title='Peter Falk's dementia means he no longer remembers Columbo,' admits actor's doctor in court hearing over his care|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1190283/Peter-Falks-dementia-means-longer-remembers-Columbo-admits-doctor-court-hearing.html|access-date=January 2, 2011|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=June 2, 2009|location=London}}</ref> During a 2009 court trial over Falk's care, Dr Stephen Read stated that the actor's condition had deteriorated so badly that Falk could no longer remember playing a character named Columbo, nor could he identify who Columbo was.<ref name=\"mail\" /> Falk died on June 23, 2011, aged 83.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/peter-falk-star-of-columbo-dies-at-83/2011/06/24/AG58mJjH_story.html ''Washington Post'' &nbsp;June 24, 2011] Retrieved March&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2016</ref><ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/columbo-star-peter-falk-dies-83/story?id=13922090 ABC news, June 24, 2011] Retrieved March 6, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/59425%7C123907/Peter-Falk/ TCM.com] Retrieved March 6, 2016</ref>\n\n== Contributors ==\n=== Guest Stars ===\nThe show featured many guest stars as murderers, with [[Robert Culp]], [[Jack Cassidy]], [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[William Shatner]] as the only actors to play more than one murderer.\n* [[Robert Culp]] as Carl Brimmer (Episode: ''Death Lends a Hand''), Paul Hanlon (Episode: ''The Most Crucial Game''), and Dr. Bart Keppel (Episode: ''Double Exposure'')\n* [[Jack Cassidy]] as Ken Franklin (Episode: ''Murder by the Book''), Riley Greenleaf (Episode: ''Publish or Perish''), and The Great Santini (Episode: ''Now You See Him...'')\n* [[John Cassavetes]] as Alex Benedict (Episode: ''Etude in Black'')\n* [[Johnny Cash]] as Tommy Brown (Episode: ''Swan Song'')\n* [[Dick Van Dyke]] as Paul Galesko (Episode: ''Negative Reaction'')\n* [[Ray Milland]] as Jarvis Goodland (Episode: ''The Greenhouse Jungle'')\n* [[Jose Ferrer]] as Dr. Marshall Cahill (Episode: ''Mind Over Mayhem'')\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Adrian Carsini (Episode: ''Any Old Port in a Storm'')\n* [[Louis Jourdan]] as Paul Gerard (Episode: ''Murder Under Glass\")\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Lauren Staton (Episode: ''It's All in the Game'')\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Leslie Williams (Episode: ''Ransom for a Dead Man'')\n* [[Ruth Gordon]] as Abigail Mitchell (Episode: ''Try and Catch Me'')\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Nora Chandler (Episode: ''Requiem for a Falling Star'')\n* [[Martin Landau]] as Dexter/Norman Paris (Episode: Double Shock'')\n* [[William Shatner]] as Ward Fowler (Episode: ''Fade in to Murder''), Fielding Chase (Episode: ''Butterfly in Shades of Grey'')\n* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Dr. Barry Mayfield (Episode: ''A Stitch in Crime'')\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Maj.

[[Jonathan Demme]] directed the seventh-season episode \"Murder Under Glass\". [[Jonathan Latimer]] was also a writer. Actor [[Ben Gazzara]], a friend of Falk's, directed the episodes \"A Friend in Deed\" (1974) and \"Troubled Waters\" (1975).\n\nFalk himself directed the last episode of the first season, \"Blueprint for Murder\". Actor [[Nicholas Colasanto]], best known for playing Coach on ''[[Cheers]]'', directed two episodes, \"Swan Song\" with [[Johnny Cash]], and \"\u00c9tude in Black\".\n\n[[Patrick McGoohan]] directed five episodes (including three of the four in which he played the murderer) and wrote and produced two. [[Vincent McEveety]] was a frequent director, and homage was paid to him by a humorous mention of a character with his surname in the episode \"Undercover\" (which he directed).\n\nTwo episodes, \"No Time to Die\" and \"Undercover\", were based on the [[87th Precinct]] novels by [[Ed McBain]],<ref name=\"Ed McBain's Columbo\">{{cite web | work = Columbo site | publisher = Free UK | url= http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/mcbain.htm | title = Ed McBain's Columbo}}</ref> and thus do not strictly follow the standard Columbo/inverted detective story format.\n\n=== Score composers ===\n''Columbo'' episodes contain a variety of music that contributes to the uniqueness of each. The score becomes of particular importance during turning points of the plots. \"The Mystery Movie Theme\" by [[Henry Mancini]], written for ''[[The NBC Mystery Movie]]'' series, was used extensively in the whole of 38 episodes, from 1971 to 1977.  Unlike the other elements of the ''Mystery Movie'' wheel, ''Columbo'' never had an official theme as such, although some composers, such as [[Dick DeBenedictis]] and [[Gil Mell\u00e9]], did write their own signature pieces. Several composers created original music for the series, which was often used along with \"The Mystery Movie Theme\":\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Dick DeBenedictis]] (23 episodes, 1972\u20132003)\n* [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Patrick Williams]] (9 episodes, 1977\u201392)\n* [[Bernardo Segall]] (10 episodes, 1974\u201376)\n* [[Billy Goldenberg]] (7 episodes, 1971\u201374)\n* [[Gil Mell\u00e9]] (4 episodes, 1971\u201372)\n* [[Jeff Alexander]] (1 episode, 1975)\n* [[Oliver Nelson]] (1 episode, 1972)\n* [[Dave Grusin]] (1 episode, 1968)\n* [[Robert Prince (composer)|Bob Prince]] (1 episode, 1977)\n* [[Jonathan Tunick]] (1 episode, 1978)\n* [[John Cacavas]] (3 episodes, 1989\u201391)\n* [[James Di Pasquale]] (2 episodes, 1990)\n* [[Steve Dorff]] (2 episodes, 1991)\n* [[Dennis Dreith]] (1 episode, 1990)\n* [[Richard Markowitz]] (1 episode, 1990)\n* [[David Michael Frank]] (1 episode, 1990)\n* [[Ken Jordan (musician)|Ken Jordan]] (1 episode, 2003)\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeries Music department included:\n* [[Henry Mancini]]&nbsp;\u2014 composer: \"Mystery Movie\" theme / \"Sunday Mystery Movie\" theme (38 episodes, 1971\u201377)\n* [[Hal Mooney]]&nbsp;\u2014 music supervisor (27 episodes, 1972\u201376)\n* [[Mike Post]]&nbsp;\u2014 composer: \"Mystery Movie\" theme (9 episodes, 1989\u201390)\n\n[[Patrick Williams (composer)|Patrick Williams]] received two [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series in 1978 (for \"Try and Catch Me\") and 1989 (for \"Murder, Smoke and Shadows\"). [[Billy Goldenberg]] was nominated in the same category in 1972 for \"Lady in Waiting\".\n\n''Columbo'' also featured an unofficial signature tune, the children's song \"[[This Old Man]]\". It was introduced in the episode \"Any Old Port in a Storm\" in 1973 and the detective can be heard humming or whistling it often in subsequent films. [[Peter Falk]] admitted that it was a melody he personally enjoyed and one day it became a part of his character.<ref>{{cite web|title=Columbo Sounds & Themes|url = http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/theme.htm |access-date = February 13, 2012}}</ref> The tune was also used in various score arrangements throughout the three decades of the series, including opening and closing credits. A version of it, titled \"Columbo\", was created by one of the show's composers, [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Patrick Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/columbo.html |title = Columbo |publisher=Classic themes |access-date=June 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n''Columbo'' received numerous awards and nominations from 1971 to 2005, including 13 [[Emmy Award|Emmys]], two [[Golden Globe Award]]s, two [[Edgar Award]]s and a [[TV Land Award]] nomination in 2005 for [[Peter Falk]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Columbo\" (1971)|url=https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt1466074/awards|work=imdb.com|publisher=IMDb|access-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Awards and nominations\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"black\" |<span style=\"color:white;\">'''Primetime Emmy Awards'''</span>\n|-\n!

''Columbo'' then aired less frequently on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1989 to 2003.\n\nThe character and show, created by [[Richard Levinson]] and [[William Link]], popularized the [[inverted detective story]] format, which begins by showing the commission of the crime and its perpetrator; the plot therefore usually has no \"[[whodunit]]\" element, and instead revolves around how a perpetrator known to the audience will finally be caught and exposed (sometimes referred to as a \"howcatchem\").\n\nColumbo is a shrewd but inelegant [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] homicide detective whose trademarks include his rumpled beige raincoat, unassuming demeanor, frequent cigar smoking, old [[Peugeot 403]], unseen wife (whom he mentions regularly), and [[catchphrase]] \"Just one more thing.\" His suspects are often affluent members of [[high society (social class)|high society]] who try to carefully cover their tracks. Initially dismissive of Columbo's [[circumstantial speech]] and apparent ineptitude, they become increasingly unsettled as his pestering behavior leads him to tease out incriminating evidence. His relentless approach often leads to [[self-incrimination]] or an outright confession by the suspect.\n\nEpisodes of ''Columbo'' are between 70 and 98 minutes long, and have been broadcast in 44 countries. The 1971 episode \"Murder by the Book\", directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], was ranked No. 16 on ''[[TV Guide]]'s [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|100 Greatest Episodes of All Time]]''<ref>{{cite magazine|year=1997|title=Special Collectors' Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time|magazine=TV Guide}}</ref> and in 1999, the magazine ranked Lt.

Once Columbo enters the story (he rarely appears in the first act), viewers watch him solve the case by sifting through the contradictions between the truth and the version presented to him by the killer(s). This style of mystery is sometimes referred to as a \"[[howcatchem]]\", in contrast to the traditional [[whodunit]]. In structural analysis terms, the majority of the narrative is therefore [[Detective d\u00e9nouement|d\u00e9nouement]], a feature normally reserved for the very end of a story. Episodes tend to be driven by their characters, the audience observing the criminal's reactions to Columbo's increasingly intrusive presence. The explanation for the crime and its method having played out as part of the narrative, most of the stories simply end with the criminal's reaction at being found out.\n\nIn the beginning of every episode, Columbo's genius was hidden by his frumpy, friendly and disarming demeanor, luring the killer into a false sense of security. In some cases, the killer's arrogance and dismissive attitude allow Columbo to manipulate his suspects into self-incrimination. While the details, and eventually the motivation(s), of the murderers' actions are shown to the viewer, Columbo's true thoughts and intentions are almost never revealed until close to the end of the episode (he occasionally begins to whistle the tune \"[[This Old Man]]\" as the pieces begin to fall into place). Columbo generally maintains a friendly relationship with the murderer until the end. The point at which the detective first begins to suspect the murderer is generally not revealed, although it is often fairly early on. Columbo had a duality of character; the disarming and unkempt detective and the hidden genius sleuth. The genius would sometimes starkly manifest itself through his eyes as it did when Jack Cassidy\u2019s killer escaped from the hand-cuffs in his magic show. Such moments always bode bad tidings for the killer. In some instances, such as [[Ruth Gordon]]'s avenging elderly mystery writer in \"Try and Catch Me\", [[Janet Leigh]]'s terminally ill and deluded actress in \"Forgotten Lady\", [[Donald Pleasence]]'s elegant [[Winemaker#Vintner|vintner]] in \"Any Old Port in a Storm\", and [[Johnny Cash]]'s enserfed singer in \"Swan Song\", the killer is more sympathetic than the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27997/columbo-mystery-movie-collection-1989|title=DVD Talk|publisher=DVD Talk|access-date=June 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nEach case is generally concluded in a similar style, with Columbo dropping any pretense of uncertainty and sharing details of his conclusion of the killer's guilt. Following the killer's reaction, the episode generally ends with the killer confessing or quietly submitting to arrest. There are few attempts to deceive the viewer or provide a twist in the tale. One convoluted exception is \"Last Salute to the Commodore\", where [[Robert Vaughn]] is seen elaborately disposing of a body, but is proved later to have been covering for his alcoholic wife, whom he mistakenly thought to be the murderer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074329/trivia?item=qt1835800|title=Quotes from Columbo (TV Series) Last Salute to the Commodore (1976)}}</ref> Sometimes, Columbo sets up the murderer with a trick designed to elicit a confession. An example occurs in \"Dagger of the Mind\", in which Columbo flips an evidentiary pearl into the victim's umbrella, bringing about incriminating activity from [[Richard Basehart]] and [[Honor Blackman]].

Other sources claim Columbo's character is also influenced by Inspector Fichet from the French suspense-thriller film ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'' (1955).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950217/REVIEWS/502170302/1023|title=''Sun Times'' reviews|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|access-date=June 27, 2011|date=February 17, 1995}}</ref>\n\nThe character first appeared in a 1960 episode of the television-anthology series ''The Chevy Mystery Show,'' titled \"Enough Rope\". This was adapted by Levinson and Link from their short story \"May I Come In,\" which had been published as \"Dear Corpus Delicti\" in an issue of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]''. The short story did not include Columbo as a character.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawidziak|first=Mark|title=The Columbo phile : a casebook|year=1989|publisher=Mysterious P.|location=New York|isbn=0-89296-376-X|pages=20}}</ref> The first actor to portray Columbo, character actor [[Bert Freed]], was a stocky character actor with a thatch of grey hair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/10/20/columbo-peter-falk-boxed-set/1637909/|title=Columbo: The Complete Series available in 34-disc set|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref>\n\nFreed's Columbo wore a rumpled suit and smoked a cigar, but he otherwise had few of the other now-familiar Columbo mannerisms. However, the character is still recognizably Columbo, and uses some of the same methods of misdirecting and distracting his suspects. During the course of the show, the increasingly frightened murderer brings pressure from the district attorney's office to have Columbo taken off the case, but the detective fights back with his own contacts.\n\nAlthough Freed received third billing, he wound up with almost as much screen time as the killer and appeared immediately after the first commercial. This delayed entry of the character into the narrative of the screen play became a defining characteristic of the structure of the Columbo series.  This teleplay is available for viewing in the archives of the [[Paley Center for Media]] in New York City and Los Angeles.\n\nLevinson and Link then adapted the TV drama into the stage play ''Prescription: Murder.'' This was first performed at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco on January 2, 1962, with [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Oscar]]-winning character actor [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] in the role of Columbo. Mitchell was 70 years old at the time. The stage production starred [[Joseph Cotten]] as the murderer and [[Agnes Moorehead]] as the victim. Mitchell died of cancer while the play was touring in out-of-town tryouts; Columbo was his last role.\n\n[[File:NBC Mystery Movie stars 1975 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The NBC Mystery Movie]]'' program worked on a rotating basis \u2013 one per month from each of its shows.

Bottom right: [[Rock Hudson]] in ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'']]\nIn 1968, the same play was made into a two-hour television movie that aired on NBC. The writers suggested [[Lee J. Cobb]] and [[Bing Crosby]] for the role of Columbo, but Cobb was unavailable and Crosby turned it down because he felt it would take too much time away from the golf links. Director Richard Irving convinced Levinson and Link that Falk, who excitedly said he \"would kill to play that cop\", could pull it off even though he was much younger than the writers had in mind.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawidziak|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Dawidziak|title=The Columbo Phile: A Casebook|year=1989|publisher=Mysterious Press|location=New York|isbn=0-89296-376-X|pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nOriginally a one-off TV-Movie-of-the-Week, ''Prescription: Murder'' has Falk's Columbo pitted against a psychiatrist ([[Gene Barry]]). In this movie, the psychiatrist gives the new audience a perfect description of Columbo's character. Due to the success of this film, NBC requested that a pilot for a potential series be made to see if the character could be sustained on a regular basis, leading to the 1971 hour and a half film, ''Ransom for a Dead Man'', with [[Lee Grant]] playing the killer. The popularity of the second film prompted the creation of a regular series on NBC, that premiered in the fall of 1971 as part of ''[[The NBC Mystery Movie]]'' [[wheel series]] rotation: ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'', and other [[whodunit]]s. In the episode ''Murder by the Book'', hardcore Columbo fans may notice the killer signing a paperback book titled, ''Prescription: Murder.''\n\nAccording to ''TV Guide'', the original plan was that a new ''Columbo'' episode would air every week, but as a motion picture star, Peter Falk refused to commit to such an arduous schedule, which would have meant shooting an episode every five days. The network arranged for the ''Columbo'' segments to air once a month on Wednesday nights. The high quality of  ''Columbo'', ''McMillan & Wife'', and ''McCloud'' was due in large part to the extra time spent on each episode. The term ''[[Wheel series|wheel show]]'' was coined to describe this format, and additional such series were attempted by NBC, but the astounding success of ''The NBC Mystery Movie'' series was not repeated.\n\n''Columbo'' was an immediate hit in the [[Nielsen ratings]] and Falk won an [[Emmy Award]] for his role in the show's first season. In its second year the ''Mystery Movie'' series was moved to Sunday nights, where it then remained during its seven-season run. The show became the anchor of NBC's Sunday night line up. ''Columbo'' aired regularly from 1971\u201378 on NBC. After its cancellation by NBC in 1978, ''Columbo'' was revived on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] between 1989 and 2003 in several new seasons and a few made-for-TV movie \"specials\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1466074/companycredits | title = Columbo (1971\u20132003) Company Credits | access-date = June 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nColumbo's wardrobe was personally provided by Peter Falk; they were his own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in ''Prescription: Murder''. Falk would often [[ad libitum|ad lib]] his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets for a piece of evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine.<ref name=JustOneMoreThing>{{cite book |last= Falk | first= Peter | date= August 24, 2007 | title= Just One More Thing |publisher= Da Capo Press | isbn= 978-0-7867-1939-6}}</ref> According to Levinson, the catchphrase \"one more thing\" was conceived when he and Link were writing the play:  \"we had a scene that was too short, and we had already had Columbo make his exit.  We were too lazy to retype the scene, so we had him come back and say, 'Oh, just one more thing . . .'

In 2007, he claimed he had chosen a script for one last Columbo episode, \"Columbo: Hear No Evil\". The script was renamed \"Columbo's Last Case\". ABC declined the project. In response, producers for the series announced that they were attempting to shop the project to foreign production companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2007/03/27/2007-03-27_with_aging_falk_columbo_looks_like_close.html|title=With aging Falk, 'Columbo' looks like a closed case|work=Daily News|location=New York|date=March 27, 2007|access-date=June 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/plaindealer/mark_dawidziak/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/1178008739327380.xml&coll=2|title=A mystery Columbo can't seem to crack|publisher=Cleveland.com|access-date=June 27, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607095946/http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/plaindealer/mark_dawidziak/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fentertainment%2F1178008739327380.xml&coll=2|archivedate=June 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, Falk was diagnosed with [[dementia]] in late 2007.<ref name=\"mail\">{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=David|title='Peter Falk's dementia means he no longer remembers Columbo,' admits actor's doctor in court hearing over his care|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1190283/Peter-Falks-dementia-means-longer-remembers-Columbo-admits-doctor-court-hearing.html|access-date=January 2, 2011|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=June 2, 2009|location=London}}</ref> During a 2009 court trial over Falk's care, Dr Stephen Read stated that the actor's condition had deteriorated so badly that Falk could no longer remember playing a character named Columbo, nor could he identify who Columbo was.<ref name=\"mail\" /> Falk died on June 23, 2011, aged 83.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/peter-falk-star-of-columbo-dies-at-83/2011/06/24/AG58mJjH_story.html ''Washington Post'' &nbsp;June 24, 2011] Retrieved March&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2016</ref><ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/columbo-star-peter-falk-dies-83/story?id=13922090 ABC news, June 24, 2011] Retrieved March 6, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/59425%7C123907/Peter-Falk/ TCM.com] Retrieved March 6, 2016</ref>\n\n== Contributors ==\n=== Guest Stars ===\nThe show featured many guest stars as murderers, with [[Robert Culp]], [[Jack Cassidy]], [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[William Shatner]] as the only actors to play more than one murderer.\n* [[Robert Culp]] as Carl Brimmer (Episode: ''Death Lends a Hand''), Paul Hanlon (Episode: ''The Most Crucial Game''), and Dr. Bart Keppel (Episode: ''Double Exposure'')\n* [[Jack Cassidy]] as Ken Franklin (Episode: ''Murder by the Book''), Riley Greenleaf (Episode: ''Publish or Perish''), and The Great Santini (Episode: ''Now You See Him...'')\n* [[John Cassavetes]] as Alex Benedict (Episode: ''Etude in Black'')\n* [[Johnny Cash]] as Tommy Brown (Episode: ''Swan Song'')\n* [[Dick Van Dyke]] as Paul Galesko (Episode: ''Negative Reaction'')\n* [[Ray Milland]] as Jarvis Goodland (Episode: ''The Greenhouse Jungle'')\n* [[Jose Ferrer]] as Dr. Marshall Cahill (Episode: ''Mind Over Mayhem'')\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Adrian Carsini (Episode: ''Any Old Port in a Storm'')\n* [[Louis Jourdan]] as Paul Gerard (Episode: ''Murder Under Glass\")\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Lauren Staton (Episode: ''It's All in the Game'')\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Leslie Williams (Episode: ''Ransom for a Dead Man'')\n* [[Ruth Gordon]] as Abigail Mitchell (Episode: ''Try and Catch Me'')\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Nora Chandler (Episode: ''Requiem for a Falling Star'')\n* [[Martin Landau]] as Dexter/Norman Paris (Episode: Double Shock'')\n* [[William Shatner]] as Ward Fowler (Episode: ''Fade in to Murder''), Fielding Chase (Episode: ''Butterfly in Shades of Grey'')\n* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Dr. Barry Mayfield (Episode: ''A Stitch in Crime'')\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Maj.

[[Jonathan Demme]] directed the seventh-season episode \"Murder Under Glass\". [[Jonathan Latimer]] was also a writer. Actor [[Ben Gazzara]], a friend of Falk's, directed the episodes \"A Friend in Deed\" (1974) and \"Troubled Waters\" (1975).\n\nFalk himself directed the last episode of the first season, \"Blueprint for Murder\". Actor [[Nicholas Colasanto]], best known for playing Coach on ''[[Cheers]]'', directed two episodes, \"Swan Song\" with [[Johnny Cash]], and \"\u00c9tude in Black\".\n\n[[Patrick McGoohan]] directed five episodes (including three of the four in which he played the murderer) and wrote and produced two. [[Vincent McEveety]] was a frequent director, and homage was paid to him by a humorous mention of a character with his surname in the episode \"Undercover\" (which he directed).\n\nTwo episodes, \"No Time to Die\" and \"Undercover\", were based on the [[87th Precinct]] novels by [[Ed McBain]],<ref name=\"Ed McBain's Columbo\">{{cite web | work = Columbo site | publisher = Free UK | url= http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/mcbain.htm | title = Ed McBain's Columbo}}</ref> and thus do not strictly follow the standard Columbo/inverted detective story format.\n\n=== Score composers ===\n''Columbo'' episodes contain a variety of music that contributes to the uniqueness of each. The score becomes of particular importance during turning points of the plots. \"The Mystery Movie Theme\" by [[Henry Mancini]], written for ''[[The NBC Mystery Movie]]'' series, was used extensively in the whole of 38 episodes, from 1971 to 1977.  Unlike the other elements of the ''Mystery Movie'' wheel, ''Columbo'' never had an official theme as such, although some composers, such as [[Dick DeBenedictis]] and [[Gil Mell\u00e9]], did write their own signature pieces. Several composers created original music for the series, which was often used along with \"The Mystery Movie Theme\":\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Dick DeBenedictis]] (23 episodes, 1972\u20132003)\n* [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Patrick Williams]] (9 episodes, 1977\u201392)\n* [[Bernardo Segall]] (10 episodes, 1974\u201376)\n* [[Billy Goldenberg]] (7 episodes, 1971\u201374)\n* [[Gil Mell\u00e9]] (4 episodes, 1971\u201372)\n* [[Jeff Alexander]] (1 episode, 1975)\n* [[Oliver Nelson]] (1 episode, 1972)\n* [[Dave Grusin]] (1 episode, 1968)\n* [[Robert Prince (composer)|Bob Prince]] (1 episode, 1977)\n* [[Jonathan Tunick]] (1 episode, 1978)\n* [[John Cacavas]] (3 episodes, 1989\u201391)\n* [[James Di Pasquale]] (2 episodes, 1990)\n* [[Steve Dorff]] (2 episodes, 1991)\n* [[Dennis Dreith]] (1 episode, 1990)\n* [[Richard Markowitz]] (1 episode, 1990)\n* [[David Michael Frank]] (1 episode, 1990)\n* [[Ken Jordan (musician)|Ken Jordan]] (1 episode, 2003)\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeries Music department included:\n* [[Henry Mancini]]&nbsp;\u2014 composer: \"Mystery Movie\" theme / \"Sunday Mystery Movie\" theme (38 episodes, 1971\u201377)\n* [[Hal Mooney]]&nbsp;\u2014 music supervisor (27 episodes, 1972\u201376)\n* [[Mike Post]]&nbsp;\u2014 composer: \"Mystery Movie\" theme (9 episodes, 1989\u201390)\n\n[[Patrick Williams (composer)|Patrick Williams]] received two [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series in 1978 (for \"Try and Catch Me\") and 1989 (for \"Murder, Smoke and Shadows\"). [[Billy Goldenberg]] was nominated in the same category in 1972 for \"Lady in Waiting\".\n\n''Columbo'' also featured an unofficial signature tune, the children's song \"[[This Old Man]]\". It was introduced in the episode \"Any Old Port in a Storm\" in 1973 and the detective can be heard humming or whistling it often in subsequent films. [[Peter Falk]] admitted that it was a melody he personally enjoyed and one day it became a part of his character.<ref>{{cite web|title=Columbo Sounds & Themes|url = http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/theme.htm |access-date = February 13, 2012}}</ref> The tune was also used in various score arrangements throughout the three decades of the series, including opening and closing credits.

{"title_page": "Pysanka", "text_new": "{{short description|Egg decorating tradition in Slavic countries}}\nA '''pysanka''' ({{lang-uk|\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430}}, plural: ''pysanky'') is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Easter egg]], decorated with traditional [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] folk designs using a [[wax-resist]] method.  The word ''pysanka'' comes from the verb ''pysaty'', \"to write\" or \"to [[inscribe]]\", as the designs are not painted on, but written (inscribed) with [[beeswax]].\n\nMany other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups decorate eggs using wax resist for [[Easter]]. These include the [[Belarusians]] (\u043f\u0456\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430, ''pisanka''), [[Bulgarians]] (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043e \u044f\u0439\u0446\u0435, ''pisano yaytse''), [[Rusyns|Carpatho-Rusyns]] (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u044b, ''pysank\u0177''), [[Croats]] (''[[Croatian pisanica|pisanica]]''), [[Czechs]] (''kraslice''), [[Hungarians]] (''h\u00edmestoj\u00e1s''), [[Lithuanians]] (''margutis''), [[Poles]] (''[[Polish pisanka|pisanka]]''), [[Romanians]] (''ou\u0103 vopsite'', ''\u00eencondeiate'' or ''\u00eempistrite''), [[Serbs]] (''pisanica''), [[Slovaks]] (''kraslica''), [[Slovenes]] (''pirhi'', ''pisanice,'' or ''remenke'') and [[Sorbs]] (''jejka pisa\u0107'').\n\n[[File:Pysanky2011.JPG|thumb|400px|A mix of modern, diasporan and traditional Ukrainian pysanky]]\n\n== Types of decorated Ukrainian eggs ==\n''Pysanka'' is often taken to mean any type of decorated egg, but it specifically refers to an egg created by the written-wax batik method and utilizing traditional folk motifs and designs.  Several other types of decorated eggs are seen in Ukrainian tradition, and these vary throughout the [[Ukrainian historical regions|regions of Ukraine]].\n* ''Krashanky'' \u2013from ''krasyty'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438), \"to decorate\"\u2013 are boiled eggs [[dyed]] a single color (with vegetable dyes, traditionally onion skin), and are blessed and eaten at Easter.\n* ''Pysanky'' \u2013from ''pysaty'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to write\"\u2013 are raw eggs created with the wax-resist method ([[Resist dyeing]]). The designs are \"written\" in hot wax with a pinhead or a special [[stylus]] called a ''pysachok'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0447\u043e\u043a) or a ''kistka'' (\u043a\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430) which has a small funnel attached to hold a small amount of liquid wax. The word that is used to describe the egg actually comes from the Ukrainian verb ''pysaty'', which means \"to write\".  Wooden eggs and beaded eggs are often referred to as \"pysanky\" because they mimic the decorative style of pysanky in a different medium.\n* ''Krapanky'' \u2013from ''krapka'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430), \"a dot\"\u2013 are raw eggs decorated using the wax-resist method, but with only dots as ornamentation (no symbols or other drawings). They are traditionally created by dripping molten wax from a beeswax candle onto an egg. They can be considered the simplest version of a pysanka, or a \"proto-pysanka.\"\n* ''Dryapanky'' \u2013from ''dryapaty'' (\u0434\u0440\u044f\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to scratch\"\u2013 are created by scratching the surface of a dyed egg to reveal the white [[animal shell|shell]] below.\n* ''Malyovanky'' \u2013from ''malyuvaty'' (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to paint\"\u2013 are created by [[painting]] a design with a brush using oil or water color paints.

The sun was important \u2013 it warmed the earth and thus was a source of all life. Eggs decorated with nature symbols became an integral part of spring rituals, serving as benevolent talismans.\n\nIn pre-Christian times, Dazhboh was one of the major deities in the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]]; birds were the sun god's chosen creations, for they were the only ones who could get near him. Humans could not catch the birds, but they did manage to obtain the eggs the birds laid. Thus, the eggs were magical objects, a source of life.  The egg was also honored during rite-of-Spring festivals&ndash;&ndash;it represented the rebirth of the earth. The long, hard winter was over; the earth burst forth and was reborn just as the egg miraculously burst forth with life. The egg therefore, was believed to have special powers.<ref>Manko, Vira.

Cultic ceramic eggs have been discovered in excavations near the village of Luka Vrublivets'ka, during excavations of a [[Trypillian]] site (5th to 3rd millennium BC). These eggs were ornamented, and in the form of \u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0456 (torokhkal'tsi; rattles containing a small stone with which to scare evil spirits away).<ref>\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u041c.\u0410. \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u043f\u0438\u0441   \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u0417\u043d\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f-\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u00bb,  2008</ref>\n\nSimilarly, no actual pysanky from the [[Kievan Rus']] period exist, but stone, clay and bone versions do, and have been excavated in many sites throughout Ukraine. Most common are ceramic eggs decorated with a horsetail plant (\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430 ''sosonka'') pattern in yellow and bright green against a dark background. More than 70 such eggs have been excavated throughout Ukraine, many of them from graves of children and adults. They are thought to be representations of real decorated eggs.\n\nThese ceramic eggs were common in Kievan Rus', and had a characteristic style.  They were slightly smaller than life size (2.5 by 4&nbsp;cm, or 1 by 1.6&nbsp;inches), and were created from reddish pink clays by the spiral method.  The majolica glazed eggs had a brown, green or yellow background, and showed interwoven yellow and green stripes. The eggs made in large cities like [[Kiev]] and [[Chernihiv]], which had workshops that produced clay tile and bricks; these tiles (and pysanky) were not only used locally, but were exported to Poland, and to several Scandinavian and Baltic countries.<ref>Tkachuk, Mary et al.

The pysanka was written on a goose egg, which was discovered largely intact, and the design is that of a wave pattern. The second oldest known pysanka was excavated in [[Baturyn]] in 2008, and dates to the end of the 17th century.  Baturyn was Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazepa]]'s capital, and it was razed in 1708 by the armies of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]].  A complete (but crushed) pysanka was discovered, a chicken egg shell with geometric designs against a blue-gray background.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0443\u043a \u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u044f.  \u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c 23-07-2008</ref> The pysanka is currently being reconstructed; when completed, it will allow us to see what sort of ornamentation was in use in pre-1708 Ukraine.\n\n== Legends ==\n\nThe [[Hutsuls]]&ndash;&ndash;a group of Rusyns who live in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] around western Ukraine&ndash;&ndash;believe that the fate of the world depends upon the pysanka. As long as the egg writing custom continues, the world will exist. If, for any reason,  this custom is abandoned, evil&ndash;&ndash;in the shape of a horrible serpent who is forever chained to a cliff&ndash;&ndash; will overrun the world. Each year the serpent sends out his minions to see how many pysanky have been written. If the number is low the serpent's chains are loosened and he is free to wander the earth causing havoc and destruction. If, on the other hand, the number of pysanky has increased, the chains are tightened and good triumphs over evil for yet another year.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People) \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb, 1993</ref> \n \nNewer legends blended folklore and Christian beliefs and firmly attached the egg to the Easter celebration. One legend concerns the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. It tells of the time Mary gave eggs to the soldiers at the cross. She entreated them to be less cruel to her son and she wept. The tears of Mary fell upon the eggs, spotting them with dots of brilliant color.\n\nAnother legend tells of when [[Mary Magdalene]] went to the sepulchre to anoint the body of Jesus. She had with her a basket of eggs to serve as a repast. When she arrived at the sepulchre and uncovered the eggs, the pure white shells had miraculously taken on a rainbow of colors.\n\nA common legend tells of Simon the peddler, who helped Jesus carry his cross on the way to Calvary.  He had left his goods at the side of the road, and, when he returned, the eggs had all turned into intricately decorated pysanky.\n\n== Superstitions and folk beliefs ==\n\nMany superstitions were attached to pysanky.  Pysanky were thought to protect households from evil spirits, catastrophe, lightning and fires.  Pysanky with spiral motifs were the most powerful, as the demons and other unholy creatures would be trapped within the spirals forever. A blessed pysanka could be used to find demons hidden in the dark corners of your house.\n \nPysanky held powerful magic, and had to be disposed of properly, lest a witch get a hold of one.  She could use the shell to gather dew, and use the gathered dew to dry up a cow's milk.  The witch could also use bits of the eggshell to poke people and sicken them.  The eggshell had to be ground up very finely (and fed to chickens to make them good egg layers) or broken into pieces and tossed into a running stream.\n\nThe cloth used to dry pysanky was powerful, too, and could be used to cure skin diseases. And it was considered very bad luck to trample on a pysanka\u2014God would punish anyone who did with a variety of illnesses.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People)  \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb,  1993</ref>\n\nThere were superstitions regarding the colors and designs on the pysanky. One old Ukrainian myth centered on the wisdom of giving older people gifts of pysanky with darker colors and/or rich designs, for their life has already been filled.  Similarly, it is appropriate to give young people pysanky with white as the predominant color because their life is still a blank page. Girls would often give pysanky to young men they fancied, and include heart motifs.  It was said, though, that a girl should never give her boyfriend a pysanky that has no design on the top and bottom of the egg, as this might signify that the boyfriend would soon lose his hair.\n\n== Writing pysanky ==\n[[File:Unfinished pysanka.jpg|thumb|An unfinished pysanka ready for the black bath of dye. It bears the Ukrainian Easter greeting: \"Christ is risen!\"]]\n[[File:UkieStyluses.jpg|thumb|A variety of [[canting|styluses]], from traditional to modern]]\n\nEach region, each village, and almost every family in Ukraine had its own special ritual, its own symbols, meanings and secret formulas for dyeing eggs.  These customs were preserved faithfully and passed down from mother to daughter through generations.  The custom of decorating pysanky was observed with greatest care, and a pysanka, after receiving the Easter blessing, was held to have great powers as a talisman.\n\nPysanky were traditionally made during the last week of Lent, Holy Week in the Orthodox and Greek ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate]]) Catholic calendars. (Both faiths are represented in Ukraine, and both still celebrate Easter by the [[Julian calendar]].) They were made by the women of the family.  During the middle of the Lenten season, women began putting aside eggs, those that were most perfectly shaped and smooth, and ideally, the first laid eggs of young hens. There had to be a rooster, as only fertilized eggs could be used.  (If non-fertile eggs were used, there would be no fertility in the home.)\n\nThe dyes were prepared from dried plants, roots, bark, berries and insects ([[Polish cochineal|cochineal]]).  Yellow was obtained from the flowers of the [[Genista tinctoria|woadwaxen]], and gold from onion skins.  Red could be extracted from [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] or cochineal, and dark green and violet from the husks of sunflower seeds and the berries and bark of the elderberry bush.  Black dye was made from walnut husks.  The dyes were prepared in secret, using recipes handed down from mother to daughter.  Sometimes chemical dyes (of unusual or difficult colors) were purchased from peddlers along with [[alum]], a [[mordant]] that helped the [[natural dye]]s adhere better to eggshells.\n\nA [[canting|stylus]], known as a pysachok, pysak, pysal'tse, or kystka (kistka), depending on region, was prepared. A piece of thin brass was wrapped around a needle, forming a hollow cone.  This was attached to a small stick (willow was preferred) with wire or horsehair.  In the Lemko regions a simple pin or nail inserted onto the end of a stick was used instead (drop-pull technique).\n\nThe pysanky were made at night, when the children were asleep.  The women in the family gathered together, said the appropriate prayers, and went to work.  It was done in secret&ndash;&ndash;the patterns and color combinations were handed down from mother to daughter and carefully guarded.\n\nPysanky were made using a wax resist (batik) method. [[Beeswax]] was heated in a small bowl on the large family stove (\u043f\u0456\u0447), and the styluses were dipped into it.  The molten wax was applied to the white egg with a writing motion; any bit of shell covered with wax would be sealed, and remain white.  Then the egg was dyed yellow, and more wax applied, and then orange, red, purple, black.  (The dye sequence was always light to dark).  Bits of shell covered with wax remained that color.  After the final color, usually red, brown or black, the wax was removed by heating the egg in the stove and gently wiping off the melted wax, or by briefly dipping the egg into boiling water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HR6mT6nEIsb5ggf8ovSZAQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Where Easter Eggs Rival The Rainbow.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1944, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\nBoiled eggs were not used, as pysanky were generally written on raw or, less commonly, baked eggs (pecharky).  Boiled eggs were [[red Easter eggs|dyed red for Easter]], using an onion skin dye, and called \"krashanky\".  The number of colors on an egg was usually limited, as natural dyes had very long dyeing times, sometimes hours.  Pysanky would be written\u2013and dyed\u2013in batches.\n\nAlternatively, in ethnic Lemko and Boiko areas, as well as Nadsiannia, the drop pull method was also utilized. A pinhead was dipped into molten wax and then applied to the shell of the egg. Simple drops were made, or there was an additional pulling motion, which would create teardrop or comma shapes. These drops were used to create patterns and designs.  Dyeing and wax removal proceeded as with traditional pysanky.\n\nPysanky continue to be made in modern times; while many traditional aspects have been preserved, new technologies are in evidence.  Aniline dyes have largely replaced natural dyes.  Styluses are now made with modern materials.  Traditional styluses are still made from brass and wood, but those made with more modern plastic handles are gaining in popularity. An electric version of the stylus has been commercially available since the 1970s, with the cone becoming a metal reservoir which keeps the melted beeswax at a constant temperature and holds a much larger amount than a traditional stylus.  These newer styluses (whether electric or not) also sport machined heads, with sizes or the opening ranging from extra-extra-fine to extra-heavy.\n\n== Sharing pysanky ==\n[[File:EasterInLvov2.jpg|thumb|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[priest]] blessing Easter baskets in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]]]\nPysanky are typically made to be given to family members and respected outsiders. To give a pysanka is to give a symbolic gift of life, which is why the egg must remain whole. Furthermore, the design, a combination of the motifs and colors on a traditional folk pysanka, has a deep, symbolic meaning. Traditionally, a pysanka given with its symbolic meaning in mind, be it wishes of protection, fecundity, or love. Typically, pysanky were displayed prominently in a public room of the house.\n\nIn a large family, by Holy Thursday, 60 or more eggs would have been completed by the women of the house. (The more daughters a family had, the more pysanky would be produced.) The eggs would then be taken to the church on Easter Sunday to be blessed, after which they were given away. Here is a partial list of how the pysanky would be used:\n\n# One or two would be given to the priest.\n# Three or four were taken to the cemetery and placed on graves of the family.\n# Ten or twenty were given to children or godchildren.\n# Ten or twelve were exchanged by the unmarried girls with the eligible men in the community.\n# Several were saved to place in the coffin of loved ones who might die during the year.\n# Several were saved to keep in the home for protection from fire, lightning and storms.\n# Two or three were placed in the mangers of cows and horses to ensure safe calving and colting and a good milk supply for the young.\n# At least one egg was placed beneath the bee hive to ensure good production of honey.\n# One was saved for each grazing animal to be taken out to the fields with the shepherds in the spring.\n# Several pysanky were placed in the nests of hens to encourage the laying of eggs.\n\nEveryone from the youngest to the oldest received a pysanka for Easter.  Young people were given pysanky with bright designs; dark pysanky were given to older people.\n\nA bowl full of pysanky was invariably kept in every home.  It served not only as a colorful display, but also as protection from all dangers.  Some of the eggs were emptied, and a bird\u2019s head made of wax or dough and wings and tail-feathers of folded paper were attached.  These \u201cdoves\u201d were suspended before icons in commemoration of the birth of Christ, when a dove came down from heaven and soared over the child Jesus.\n\n== Symbolism in pysanky ==\n[[File:A basket full of Hutsul pysanky.JPG|thumb|200px|A basket full of Hutsul pysanky]]\n\nA great variety of ornamental motifs are found on pysanky.  Because of the egg\u2019s fragility, few ancient examples of pysanky have survived.  However, similar design motifs occur in pottery, woodwork, metalwork, [[Ukrainian embroidery]] and other folk arts,<ref>Selivachov, Mykhailo. Folk Designs of Ukraine Doncaster, Australia: Bayda Books, 1995</ref> many of which have survived.\n\nThe symbols which decorated pysanky underwent a process of adaptation over time. In pre-Christian times these symbols imbued an egg with magical powers to ward off evil spirits, banish winter, guarantee a good harvest and bring a person good luck. After 988, when Christianity became the state religion of Ukraine, the interpretation of many of the symbols began to change, and the pagan motifs were reinterpreted in a Christian light.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, pysanky have been created more for decorative reasons than for the purposes of magic, especially among the Diaspora, as belief in most such rituals and practices has fallen by the wayside in a more modern, scientific era.  Additionally, the Ukrainian diaspora has reinterpreted meanings and created their own new symbols and interpretations of older ones.<ref>\nLesiv, Mariya .

Folklorica, Journal of the Slavic and East European Folkore Association. Vol 12 (2007)</ref>\n\nThe names and meaning of various symbols and design elements vary from region to region, and even from village to village.  Similar symbols can have totally different interpretations in different places. There are several thousand different motifs in Ukrainian folk designs.  They can be grouped into several families. Keep in mind that these talismanic meanings applied to traditional folk pysanky with traditional designs, not to modern original creations.\n\n=== Geometric ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Polissia.svg|120px|thumbnail|Sorokoklyn from [[Polissia]]]]\nThe most popular pysanka designs are geometric figures. The egg itself is most often divided by straight lines into squares, triangles and other shapes. These shapes are then filled with other forms and designs. These are also among the most ancient symbols, with the \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0442\u043e (resheto, sieve) motif dating back to Paleolithic times. Other ancient geometric symbols are agricultural in nature: triangles, which symbolized clouds or rain; quadrilaterals, especially those with a resheto design in them, symbolized a ploughed field; dots stood for seeds.\n\nGeometric symbols used quite commonly on pysanky today.  The triangle is said to symbolize the Holy Trinity; in ancient times it symbolized other trinities: the elements of air, fire and water, the family (man, woman and child) or the cycle of life (birth, life, and death).  Diamonds, a type of quadrilateral, are sometimes said to symbolize knowledge. Curls/spirals are ancient symbols of the Zmiya/Serpent, and are said to have a meaning of defense or protection. The spiral is said to be protective against the \"\u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\";  an evil spirit which happens to enter a house will be drawn into the spiral and trapped there. Dots, which can represent seeds, stars or cuckoo birds\u2019 eggs (a symbol of spring), are popularly said to be the tears of the blessed Virgin. Hearts are also sometimes seen, and, as in other cultures, they represent love.\n[[File:Meander Motif on a Ukrainian Pysanka.JPG|thumb|200px|A meander motif on a traditional pysanka]]\nOne interesting adaptation of the geometric design is not a symbol per se but a division of the egg called \"forty triangles\" (actually 48) or \"Sorokoklyn (forty wedges).\" Its ancient meaning is not known, but is often said to represent the forty days of lent, the forty martyrs, the forty days that Christ spent in the desert, or the forty life tasks of married couples.\n\n==== Eternity bands ====\nEternity bands or meanders are composed of waves, lines or ribbons; such a line is called a \"bezkonechnyk.\"  A line without end is said to represent immortality.  Waves, however, are a water symbol, and thus a symbol of the Zmiya/Serpent, the ancient water god.  Waves are therefore considered an agricultural symbol, because it is rain that ensures good crops.\n\n===Berehynia===\n[[File:Berehynia Pysanka.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a berehynia motif]]\nThe goddess motif is an ancient one, and most commonly found in pysanky from Polissia or Western Podillia. The berehynia was believed to be the source of life and death. On the one hand, she is a life giving mother, the creator of heaven and all living things, and the mistress of heavenly water (rain), upon which the world relies for fertility and fruitfulness. On the other hand, she was the merciless controller of destinies.\n\nThe goddess is sometimes depicted with arms upraised, and the arms vary in number but are always in pairs: 2, 4 or 6. This is similar to the appearance of the Christian Oranta. Pysanky with this motif were called \u201cbohyn\u2019ky\u201d (\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438, little goddesses) or \u201czhuchky\u201d (\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0438, beetles), the latter because they are similar in appearance to the Cyrillic letter \u0416 (zh).  Sometimes the berehynia has become abstracted, and is represented by a plant\u2014vazon\u2014the tree of life. Her arms become the branches and flowers, and she is firmly rooted in a flowerpot.\n\nThe most common depiction of the great goddess is a composition containing \u201ckucheri\u201d (curls). The berehynia may be seen perched on a curl, or a curl may be given wings; the symbol may be doubled, end-to-end. There is usually a crown on the berehynia\u2019s head. These compositions are given the folk names of \u201cqueen,\u201d \u201cprincess,\u201d \"rooster,\" \u201cscythe,\u201d \u201cdrake,\u201d or simply \u201cwings.\"\n\n=== Christian symbols ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Church Motif.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a church motif]]\nThe only true traditional Christian symbol, and not one adapted from an earlier pagan one, is the church. Stylized churches are often found on pysanky from Hutsul regions (including parts of Bukovyna). Church parts are usually in threes: three stories/roofs, three towers, three openings (windows, doors). Sometimes only the bell tower (dzvinytsia) is depicted.\n\nCrosses are fairly common, although most of those found on traditional pysanky are not Ukrainian (Byzantine) crosses. The crosses most commonly depicted are of the simple \"Greek\" cross type, with arms of equal lengths. This type of cross predates Christianity, and is a sun symbol (an abstracted representation of the solar bird); it is sometimes combined with the star (ruzha) motif. The \"cross crosslet\" type of cross, one in which the ends of each arm are crossed, is frequently seen, particularly on Hutsul and Bukovynian pysanky.\n\nOther adapted religious symbols include a triangle with a circle in the center, denoting the eye of God, and one known as the \"hand of god.\"\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the commercially produced folk pysanky of the Carpathians, especially [[Kosmach]], have begun displaying more Christian symbols.  The lower arm of the cross in older designs is often lengthened to appear more Christian, even if it throws off the symmetry of the design. [[Crucifix]]es are sometimes seen. Pysanky are being written with depictions of Easter baskets on them, including a [[Paska (bread)|paska]] and candle. [[Doves as symbols|White doves]], symbols of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], are also more frequently seen; doves are usually depicted in flight, while other wild birds are traditionally shown perched.\n\n=== Phytomorphic (plant) motifs ===\n\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Priashivshchyna 01.svg|thumbnail|150px|Floral ornaments from [[Lemkivshchyna]]]]\nThe most common motifs found on pysanky are those associated with plants and their parts (flowers and fruit). Women who wrote pysanky drew their inspiration from the world of nature, depicting flowers, trees, fruits, leaves and whole plants in a highly stylized (not realistic) fashion. Such ornaments symbolized the rebirth of nature after winter, and pysanky were written with plant motifs to guarantee a good harvest. A most popular floral design is a plant in a vase of standing on its own, which symbolized the tree of life and was a highly abstracted version of the berehynia (great goddess).\n\nPysanky created by the [[mountain people]] of the Hutsul region of Ukraine often showed a stylized fir tree branch, a symbol of youth and eternal life. Trees, in general, symbolized strength, renewal, creation, growth; as with animal motifs, the parts (leaves, branches) had the same symbolic meaning as the whole.  The oak tree was a sacred to the ancient god Perun, the most powerful of the pagan Slavic pantheon, and thus oak leaves symbolized strength.\n\nPussy willow branches are sometimes depicted on pysanky; in Ukraine, the pussy willow replaces the palm leaf on Palm Sunday.  This is not a common motif, though, and may be a more recent addition.\n\nTwo very popular plant motifs on modern diasporan pysanky are poppies and wheat; these motifs are never seen on traditional pysanky, and are purely a modern invention.\n\n==== Flowers ====\n[[File:Ruzha (Ukrainian Pysanka).JPG|thumb|200px|A Ukrainian pysanka with a ruzha (eight pointed star) motif]]\nFlowers are a common pysanka motif. They can be divided into two types: specific botanical types, and non-specific.\n\nSpecific botanical types include sunflowers, daisies, violets, carnations, periwinkle and lily-of the-valley. These flowers are represented with identifying features that make them recognizable. Carnations will have a serrated edge to the petals, the flowers of the lily of the valley will be arrayed along a stem, periwinkle will have three or four leaves (periwinkle is represented by its leaves, not its flowers, on pysanky).\n\nThere are also flower motifs called orchids and tulips, but these are not botanical names.  They are actually the names given to fantastical flowers, as neither of these flowers was commonly found in Ukraine until modern times. The names reflected the exoticism of the designs.\n[[File:Vazon (Tree of Life).JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional Ukrainian pysanka from Bukovyna region, with a vazon motif]]\nNon-specific flowers are much more common, and consist of the ruzha and others. The ruzha (or rozha) is named after the mallow flower, although it does not resemble one, and is another name given to the eight-pointed star motif.  A ruzha can be full, empty, compound, divided or even crooked. It is a sun sign. Other non-specific types often have hyphenated names: potato-flower, strawberry-flower, etc.  They are usually simple arrangements of petals, six or more, and bear little resemblance to the plant they are named for.\n\n====Vazon/Tree of Life====\nThe \u201ctree of life\u201d motif is widely used in traditional pysanky designs. It can be represented in many ways. Sometimes it appears as two deer on either side of a pine tree. More often it manifests as a flower pot (\u201cvazon\u201d), filled with leaves and flowers.  The pot itself is usually a rectangle, triangle or a rhomboid (symbolic of the earth), and is covered with dots (seeds) and dashes (water). Many branches grow out of it, in a symmetric fashion, with leaves and flowers. This plant is a berehynia (goddess) symbol, with the branches representing the many arms of the mother goddess.\n\n==== Fruit ====\nFruit is not a common motif on pysanky, but is sometimes represented. Apples, plums and cherries are depicted on traditional pysanky. Currants and viburnum (kalyna) berries are sometimes seen, too. These motifs are probably related to fecundity. Grapes are seen more often, as they have been transformed from an agricultural motif to a religious one, representing the Holy Communion.\n\n=== Scevomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Rake Motifs.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with rake motifs]]\nScevomorphic designs are the second-largest group of designs, and are representations of man-made agricultural objects. These symbols are very common, as Ukraine was a highly agricultural society, and drew many of its positive images from field and farm. Some of these symbols are actually related to agriculture; others have older meanings, but were renamed in more recent times based on their appearance.\n\nCommon symbols include the ladder (symbolizing [[prayer]]s going up to heaven) and the sieve/resheto (a plowed field, or perhaps the separation of good and evil).\n\nRakes and combs are often depicted; both are meant to invoke a good harvest. Both are rain symbols. The body of the rake (sometimes depicted as a triangle) is the cloud, and the teeth symbolize rain drops. (Note: these combs are not hair combs, but agricultural implements.)\n\nWindmills, a variation on the broken cross (swastika) motif, are actually sun symbols, not agricultural symbols. The movement of the cross echoes the movement of the sun across the sky.\n\n=== Zoomorphic (animal) motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky -- Teeth of wolf from Odessa.svg|thumbnail|150px|Wolf's teeth [[Odessa]]]]\nAlthough animal motifs are not as popular as plant motifs, they are nevertheless found on pysanky, especially those of the people of the Carpathian Mountains. Animal depicted on pysanky include both wild animals (deer, birds, fish) and domesticated ones (rams, horses, poultry).  As with plants, animals were depicted in the abstract, highly stylized, and not with realistic detail.\n\nHorses were popular ornaments because they symbolized strength and endurance, as well as wealth and prosperity. They also had a second meaning as a sun symbol: in some versions of pagan mythology, the sun was drawn across the sky by the steeds of Dazhboh, the sun god. Similarly, deer designs were fairly common as they were intended to bring prosperity and long life; in other versions of the myth, it was the stag who carried the sun across the sky on his antlers.  Rams are symbols of leadership, strength, dignity, and perseverance.\n\nSometime women simply drew parts of animals; these symbols were probably a sort of shorthand, endowed with all the attributes of the animal represented. Ducks\u2019 necks, goose feet, rabbits\u2019 ears, rams\u2019 horns, wolves\u2019 teeth, bear claws, and bulls\u2019 eyes can all be found on pysanky.  One cannot be sure, however, if these symbols were actually meant to represent animals, or were renamed centuries later because of their appearance.\n\n==== Birds ====\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Birds.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with bird motifs]]\nBirds were considered the harbingers of spring, thus they were a commonplace pysanka motif.  Birds of all kinds are the messengers of the sun and heaven. Birds are always shown perched, at rest, never flying (except for swallows and, in more recent times, white doves carrying letters). Roosters are symbols of masculinity, or the coming of dawn, and hens represent fertility.\n\nBirds were almost always shown in full profile, stylized, but with characteristic features of the species. Partial representations of some birds&ndash;&ndash;mostly domestic fowl&ndash;&ndash;are often seen on pysanky. Bird parts (eyes, feet, beaks, combs, feathers) are said carry the same meaning as the entire bird. Thus hen's feet represent fertility and the rooster's comb signifies masculinity.\n\n==== Insects ====\nInsects are only rarely depicted on pysanky. Highly stylized spiders (and occasionally their webs) are the most common on folk pysanky, and symbolize perseverance. Beetles are sometimes seen, but rarely look anything like a beetle. What they do resemble, somewhat, is the letter \u0416, as in their Ukrainian name \"\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043e\u043a.\" Other insects are sometimes seen on modern, diasporan pysanky, most commonly butterflies and bees, but seem to be a modern innovation.  In Onyshchuk's \"Symbolism of the Ukrainian Pysanka\" she depicts pysanky with a butterfly motif, but the original design, recorded by Kulzhynsky in 1899, was labeled as being swallows' tails.\n\n==== Fish ====\n[[File:Spirals Zmiya.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with spirals]]\nThe fish, originally a symbol of health, eventually came to symbolize Jesus Christ, the \"fisher of men.\"  In old Ukrainian fairy tales, the fish often helped the hero to win his fight with evil. In the Greek alphabet \u201cfish\u201d ([[ichthys]]) is an [[acrostic]] of \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior,\u201d and it became a secret symbol used by the early Christians.  The fish represents abundance, as well as Christian interpretations of baptism, sacrifice, the powers of regeneration, and Christ himself.\n\n==== Serpent ====\n\nAnother ancient symbol is that of the \u0437\u043c\u0456\u044f or serpent, the ancient god of water and earth.  The serpent could be depicted in several ways: as an \"S\" or sigma, as a curl or spiral, or as a wave. When depicted as a sigma, the zmiya often wears a crown. Depictions of the serpent can be found on Neolithic Trypillian pottery. The serpent symbol on a ''pysanka'' is said to bring protection from catastrophe.  Spirals were particularly strong talismans, as an evil spirit, upon entering the house, would be drawn into the spiral and trapped there.\n\n=== Cosmomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Pysanka with Swastika motif.jpg|thumb|150px|Traditional pysanka with a swastika (svarha) motif]]\nAmong the oldest and most important symbols of pysanky is the sun, and the simplest rendering of the sun is a closed circle with or without rays. Pysanky from all regions of Ukraine depict an eight-sided star, the most common depiction of the sun; this symbol is also called a \"ruzha.\"  Six- or seven-sided stars can also be seen, but much less commonly.\n\nThe sun can also appear as a flower or a \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 (three leaf). The [[swastika]], called in Ukrainian a \"svarha,\" is sometimes referred to as a \"broken cross\" or \"ducks\u2019 necks.\" It represented the sun in pagan times: the movement of the arms around the cross represented the movement of the sun across the sky. The Slavic pagans also believed that the sun did not rise on its own, but was carried across the sky by a stag (or, in some versions, a horse).  The deer and horses often found on Hutsul pysanky are solar symbols.\n\nPysanky with sun motifs were said to have been especially powerful, because they could protect their owner from sickness, bad luck and the evil eye.  In Christian times the sun symbol is said to represent life, warmth, and the love and the Christian God.\n\nOther cosmomorphic symbols are less commonly seen.  The moon is sometimes depicted as a circle with a cross inside it; it is begged to shed its light at night to help the traveller, and to chase away evil powers from the household. Stars are sometimes represented as dots.\n\n== Color symbolism ==\n\nIt is not only motifs on pysanky which carried symbolic weight: colors also had significance. Although the earliest pysanky were often simply two-toned, and many folk designs still are, some believed that the more colors there were on a decorated egg, the more magical power it held. A multi-colored egg could thus bring its owner better luck and a better fate.\n\nThe color palette of traditional pysanky was fairly limited, and based on natural dyes. Yellow, red/orange, green, brown and black were the predominant colors. With the advent of aniline dyes in the 1800s, small amounts of blue and purple were sometimes added. It is important to note that the meanings below are generalizations; different regions interpreted colors differently.<ref name=\"manko folk\"/>\n\n* '''Red''' - is probably the oldest symbolic color, and has many meanings. It represents life-giving blood, and often appears on pysanky with nocturnal and heavenly symbols. It represents love and joy, and the hope of marriage.  It is also associated with the sun. \n* '''Black''' - is a particularly sacred color, and is most commonly associated with the \"other world,\" but not in a negative sense.\n* '''Yellow''' - symbolized the moon and stars and also, agriculturally, the harvest. \n* '''Blue''' - Represented blue skies or the air, and good health.\n* '''White''' - Signified purity,  birth, light, rejoicing, virginity.\n* '''Green''' - the color of new life in the spring. Green represents the resurrection of nature, and the riches of vegetation.\n* '''Brown''' - represents the earth.\n\nSome color combinations had specific meanings, too:\n\n* '''Black and white''' - mourning,  respect for the souls of the dead.\n* '''Black and red''' - this combination was perceived as \"harsh and frightful,\" and very disturbing.  It is common in Podillya, where both serpent motifs and goddess motifs were written with this combination. \n* '''Four or more colors''' - the family's happiness, prosperity, love, health and achievements.\n\nAs with symbols, these talismanic meanings of colors applied to traditional pysanky with traditional designs, and not to modern decorative pysanky.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Pysanka}}\n* [[Pysanka Museum]]\n* [[Easter egg]]\n* [[Egg decorating in Slavic culture]]\n* [[Pisanka (Polish)|Pisanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|pysanka}}\n* [http://pysanka.museum/ Pysanka Museum]\n* [http://www.pysanky.info/Voropay/Voropay.html Customs and Traditions]\n* [http://www.allthingsukrainian.com/Class/PysankyClassVideos.html Pysanka Writing Videos]\n* [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/view/3782/3620 Pysanka Ethnography]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{National symbols of Ukraine}}\n\n[[Category:Visual arts media]]\n[[Category:Handicrafts]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Slavic Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Spring traditions]]\n[[Category:Eggs in culture]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian traditions]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian design]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Ukraine]]\n\n[[da:P\u00e5ske\u00e6g]]\n[[de:Osterei]]\n[[fr:\u0152uf de P\u00e2ques]]\n[[io:Paskala ovo]]\n[[nl:Paasei]]\n[[nn:P\u00e5skeegg]]\n[[pt:Pessanka]]\n[[sl:Pirh]]\n[[fi:P\u00e4\u00e4si\u00e4ismuna]]\n[[sv:P\u00e5sk\u00e4gg]]\n[[zh:\u590d\u6d3b\u8282\u5f69\u86cb]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Egg decorating tradition in Slavic countries}}\nA '''pysanka''' ({{lang-uk|\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430}}, plural: ''pysanky'') is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Easter egg]], decorated with traditional [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] folk designs using a [[batik|wax-resist]] method.  The word ''pysanka'' comes from the verb ''pysaty'', \"to write\" or \"to [[inscribe]]\", as the designs are not painted on, but written (inscribed) with [[beeswax]].\n\nMany other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups decorate eggs using wax resist for [[Easter]].

Several other types of decorated eggs are seen in Ukrainian tradition, and these vary throughout the [[Ukrainian historical regions|regions of Ukraine]].\n* ''Krashanky'' \u2013from ''krasyty'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438), \"to decorate\"\u2013 are boiled eggs [[dyed]] a single color (with vegetable dyes, traditionally onion skin), and are blessed and eaten at Easter.\n* ''Pysanky'' \u2013from ''pysaty'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to write\"\u2013 are raw eggs created with the wax-resist method ([[Resist dyeing]]). The designs are \"written\" in hot wax with a pinhead or a special [[stylus]] called a ''pysachok'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0447\u043e\u043a) or a ''kistka'' (\u043a\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430) which has a small funnel attached to hold a small amount of liquid wax. The word that is used to describe the egg actually comes from the Ukrainian verb ''pysaty'', which means \"to write\".  Wooden eggs and beaded eggs are often referred to as \"pysanky\" because they mimic the decorative style of pysanky in a different medium.\n* ''Krapanky'' \u2013from ''krapka'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430), \"a dot\"\u2013 are raw eggs decorated using the wax-resist method, but with only dots as ornamentation (no symbols or other drawings). They are traditionally created by dripping molten wax from a beeswax candle onto an egg. They can be considered the simplest version of a pysanka, or a \"proto-pysanka.\"\n* ''Dryapanky'' \u2013from ''dryapaty'' (\u0434\u0440\u044f\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to scratch\"\u2013 are created by scratching the surface of a dyed egg to reveal the white [[animal shell|shell]] below.\n* ''Malyovanky'' \u2013from ''malyuvaty'' (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to paint\"\u2013 are created by [[painting]] a design with a brush using oil or water color paints.

The sun was important \u2013 it warmed the earth and thus was a source of all life. Eggs decorated with nature symbols became an integral part of spring rituals, serving as benevolent talismans.\n\nIn pre-Christian times, Dazhboh was one of the major deities in the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]]; birds were the sun god's chosen creations, for they were the only ones who could get near him. Humans could not catch the birds, but they did manage to obtain the eggs the birds laid. Thus, the eggs were magical objects, a source of life.  The egg was also honored during rite-of-Spring festivals&ndash;&ndash;it represented the rebirth of the earth. The long, hard winter was over; the earth burst forth and was reborn just as the egg miraculously burst forth with life. The egg therefore, was believed to have special powers.<ref>Manko, Vira.

Cultic ceramic eggs have been discovered in excavations near the village of Luka Vrublivets'ka, during excavations of a [[Trypillian]] site (5th to 3rd millennium BC). These eggs were ornamented, and in the form of \u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0456 (torokhkal'tsi; rattles containing a small stone with which to scare evil spirits away).<ref>\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u041c.\u0410. \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u043f\u0438\u0441   \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u0417\u043d\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f-\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u00bb,  2008</ref>\n\nSimilarly, no actual pysanky from the [[Kievan Rus']] period exist, but stone, clay and bone versions do, and have been excavated in many sites throughout Ukraine. Most common are ceramic eggs decorated with a horsetail plant (\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430 ''sosonka'') pattern in yellow and bright green against a dark background. More than 70 such eggs have been excavated throughout Ukraine, many of them from graves of children and adults. They are thought to be representations of real decorated eggs.\n\nThese ceramic eggs were common in Kievan Rus', and had a characteristic style.  They were slightly smaller than life size (2.5 by 4&nbsp;cm, or 1 by 1.6&nbsp;inches), and were created from reddish pink clays by the spiral method.  The majolica glazed eggs had a brown, green or yellow background, and showed interwoven yellow and green stripes. The eggs made in large cities like [[Kiev]] and [[Chernihiv]], which had workshops that produced clay tile and bricks; these tiles (and pysanky) were not only used locally, but were exported to Poland, and to several Scandinavian and Baltic countries.<ref>Tkachuk, Mary et al.

The pysanka was written on a goose egg, which was discovered largely intact, and the design is that of a wave pattern. The second oldest known pysanka was excavated in [[Baturyn]] in 2008, and dates to the end of the 17th century.  Baturyn was Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazepa]]'s capital, and it was razed in 1708 by the armies of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]].  A complete (but crushed) pysanka was discovered, a chicken egg shell with geometric designs against a blue-gray background.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0443\u043a \u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u044f.  \u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c 23-07-2008</ref> The pysanka is currently being reconstructed; when completed, it will allow us to see what sort of ornamentation was in use in pre-1708 Ukraine.\n\n== Legends ==\n\nThe [[Hutsuls]]&ndash;&ndash;a group of Rusyns who live in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] around western Ukraine&ndash;&ndash;believe that the fate of the world depends upon the pysanka. As long as the egg writing custom continues, the world will exist. If, for any reason,  this custom is abandoned, evil&ndash;&ndash;in the shape of a horrible serpent who is forever chained to a cliff&ndash;&ndash; will overrun the world. Each year the serpent sends out his minions to see how many pysanky have been written. If the number is low the serpent's chains are loosened and he is free to wander the earth causing havoc and destruction. If, on the other hand, the number of pysanky has increased, the chains are tightened and good triumphs over evil for yet another year.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People) \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb, 1993</ref> \n \nNewer legends blended folklore and Christian beliefs and firmly attached the egg to the Easter celebration. One legend concerns the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. It tells of the time Mary gave eggs to the soldiers at the cross. She entreated them to be less cruel to her son and she wept. The tears of Mary fell upon the eggs, spotting them with dots of brilliant color.\n\nAnother legend tells of when [[Mary Magdalene]] went to the sepulchre to anoint the body of Jesus. She had with her a basket of eggs to serve as a repast. When she arrived at the sepulchre and uncovered the eggs, the pure white shells had miraculously taken on a rainbow of colors.\n\nA common legend tells of Simon the peddler, who helped Jesus carry his cross on the way to Calvary.  He had left his goods at the side of the road, and, when he returned, the eggs had all turned into intricately decorated pysanky.\n\n== Superstitions and folk beliefs ==\n\nMany superstitions were attached to pysanky.  Pysanky were thought to protect households from evil spirits, catastrophe, lightning and fires.  Pysanky with spiral motifs were the most powerful, as the demons and other unholy creatures would be trapped within the spirals forever. A blessed pysanka could be used to find demons hidden in the dark corners of your house.\n \nPysanky held powerful magic, and had to be disposed of properly, lest a witch get a hold of one.  She could use the shell to gather dew, and use the gathered dew to dry up a cow's milk.  The witch could also use bits of the eggshell to poke people and sicken them.  The eggshell had to be ground up very finely (and fed to chickens to make them good egg layers) or broken into pieces and tossed into a running stream.\n\nThe cloth used to dry pysanky was powerful, too, and could be used to cure skin diseases. And it was considered very bad luck to trample on a pysanka\u2014God would punish anyone who did with a variety of illnesses.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People)  \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb,  1993</ref>\n\nThere were superstitions regarding the colors and designs on the pysanky. One old Ukrainian myth centered on the wisdom of giving older people gifts of pysanky with darker colors and/or rich designs, for their life has already been filled.  Similarly, it is appropriate to give young people pysanky with white as the predominant color because their life is still a blank page. Girls would often give pysanky to young men they fancied, and include heart motifs.  It was said, though, that a girl should never give her boyfriend a pysanky that has no design on the top and bottom of the egg, as this might signify that the boyfriend would soon lose his hair.\n\n== Writing pysanky ==\n[[File:Unfinished pysanka.jpg|thumb|An unfinished pysanka ready for the black bath of dye. It bears the Ukrainian Easter greeting: \"Christ is risen!\"]]\n[[File:UkieStyluses.jpg|thumb|A variety of [[canting|styluses]], from traditional to modern]]\n\nEach region, each village, and almost every family in Ukraine had its own special ritual, its own symbols, meanings and secret formulas for dyeing eggs.  These customs were preserved faithfully and passed down from mother to daughter through generations.  The custom of decorating pysanky was observed with greatest care, and a pysanka, after receiving the Easter blessing, was held to have great powers as a talisman.\n\nPysanky were traditionally made during the last week of Lent, Holy Week in the Orthodox and Greek ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate]]) Catholic calendars. (Both faiths are represented in Ukraine, and both still celebrate Easter by the [[Julian calendar]].) They were made by the women of the family.  During the middle of the Lenten season, women began putting aside eggs, those that were most perfectly shaped and smooth, and ideally, the first laid eggs of young hens. There had to be a rooster, as only fertilized eggs could be used.  (If non-fertile eggs were used, there would be no fertility in the home.)\n\nThe dyes were prepared from dried plants, roots, bark, berries and insects ([[Polish cochineal|cochineal]]).  Yellow was obtained from the flowers of the [[Genista tinctoria|woadwaxen]], and gold from onion skins.  Red could be extracted from [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] or cochineal, and dark green and violet from the husks of sunflower seeds and the berries and bark of the elderberry bush.  Black dye was made from walnut husks.  The dyes were prepared in secret, using recipes handed down from mother to daughter.  Sometimes chemical dyes (of unusual or difficult colors) were purchased from peddlers along with [[alum]], a [[mordant]] that helped the [[natural dye]]s adhere better to eggshells.\n\nA [[canting|stylus]], known as a pysachok, pysak, pysal'tse, or kystka (kistka), depending on region, was prepared. A piece of thin brass was wrapped around a needle, forming a hollow cone.  This was attached to a small stick (willow was preferred) with wire or horsehair.  In the Lemko regions a simple pin or nail inserted onto the end of a stick was used instead (drop-pull technique).\n\nThe pysanky were made at night, when the children were asleep.  The women in the family gathered together, said the appropriate prayers, and went to work.  It was done in secret&ndash;&ndash;the patterns and color combinations were handed down from mother to daughter and carefully guarded.\n\nPysanky were made using a wax resist (batik) method. [[Beeswax]] was heated in a small bowl on the large family stove (\u043f\u0456\u0447), and the styluses were dipped into it.  The molten wax was applied to the white egg with a writing motion; any bit of shell covered with wax would be sealed, and remain white.  Then the egg was dyed yellow, and more wax applied, and then orange, red, purple, black.  (The dye sequence was always light to dark).  Bits of shell covered with wax remained that color.  After the final color, usually red, brown or black, the wax was removed by heating the egg in the stove and gently wiping off the melted wax, or by briefly dipping the egg into boiling water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HR6mT6nEIsb5ggf8ovSZAQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Where Easter Eggs Rival The Rainbow.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1944, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\nBoiled eggs were not used, as pysanky were generally written on raw or, less commonly, baked eggs (pecharky).  Boiled eggs were [[red Easter eggs|dyed red for Easter]], using an onion skin dye, and called \"krashanky\".  The number of colors on an egg was usually limited, as natural dyes had very long dyeing times, sometimes hours.  Pysanky would be written\u2013and dyed\u2013in batches.\n\nAlternatively, in ethnic Lemko and Boiko areas, as well as Nadsiannia, the drop pull method was also utilized. A pinhead was dipped into molten wax and then applied to the shell of the egg. Simple drops were made, or there was an additional pulling motion, which would create teardrop or comma shapes. These drops were used to create patterns and designs.  Dyeing and wax removal proceeded as with traditional pysanky.\n\nPysanky continue to be made in modern times; while many traditional aspects have been preserved, new technologies are in evidence.  Aniline dyes have largely replaced natural dyes.  Styluses are now made with modern materials.  Traditional styluses are still made from brass and wood, but those made with more modern plastic handles are gaining in popularity. An electric version of the stylus has been commercially available since the 1970s, with the cone becoming a metal reservoir which keeps the melted beeswax at a constant temperature and holds a much larger amount than a traditional stylus.  These newer styluses (whether electric or not) also sport machined heads, with sizes or the opening ranging from extra-extra-fine to extra-heavy.\n\n== Sharing pysanky ==\n[[File:EasterInLvov2.jpg|thumb|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[priest]] blessing Easter baskets in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]]]\nPysanky are typically made to be given to family members and respected outsiders. To give a pysanka is to give a symbolic gift of life, which is why the egg must remain whole. Furthermore, the design, a combination of the motifs and colors on a traditional folk pysanka, has a deep, symbolic meaning. Traditionally, a pysanka given with its symbolic meaning in mind, be it wishes of protection, fecundity, or love. Typically, pysanky were displayed prominently in a public room of the house.\n\nIn a large family, by Holy Thursday, 60 or more eggs would have been completed by the women of the house. (The more daughters a family had, the more pysanky would be produced.) The eggs would then be taken to the church on Easter Sunday to be blessed, after which they were given away. Here is a partial list of how the pysanky would be used:\n\n# One or two would be given to the priest.\n# Three or four were taken to the cemetery and placed on graves of the family.\n# Ten or twenty were given to children or godchildren.\n# Ten or twelve were exchanged by the unmarried girls with the eligible men in the community.\n# Several were saved to place in the coffin of loved ones who might die during the year.\n# Several were saved to keep in the home for protection from fire, lightning and storms.\n# Two or three were placed in the mangers of cows and horses to ensure safe calving and colting and a good milk supply for the young.\n# At least one egg was placed beneath the bee hive to ensure good production of honey.\n# One was saved for each grazing animal to be taken out to the fields with the shepherds in the spring.\n# Several pysanky were placed in the nests of hens to encourage the laying of eggs.\n\nEveryone from the youngest to the oldest received a pysanka for Easter.  Young people were given pysanky with bright designs; dark pysanky were given to older people.\n\nA bowl full of pysanky was invariably kept in every home.  It served not only as a colorful display, but also as protection from all dangers.  Some of the eggs were emptied, and a bird\u2019s head made of wax or dough and wings and tail-feathers of folded paper were attached.  These \u201cdoves\u201d were suspended before icons in commemoration of the birth of Christ, when a dove came down from heaven and soared over the child Jesus.\n\n== Symbolism in pysanky ==\n[[File:A basket full of Hutsul pysanky.JPG|thumb|200px|A basket full of Hutsul pysanky]]\n\nA great variety of ornamental motifs are found on pysanky.  Because of the egg\u2019s fragility, few ancient examples of pysanky have survived.  However, similar design motifs occur in pottery, woodwork, metalwork, [[Ukrainian embroidery]] and other folk arts,<ref>Selivachov, Mykhailo. Folk Designs of Ukraine Doncaster, Australia: Bayda Books, 1995</ref> many of which have survived.\n\nThe symbols which decorated pysanky underwent a process of adaptation over time. In pre-Christian times these symbols imbued an egg with magical powers to ward off evil spirits, banish winter, guarantee a good harvest and bring a person good luck. After 988, when Christianity became the state religion of Ukraine, the interpretation of many of the symbols began to change, and the pagan motifs were reinterpreted in a Christian light.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, pysanky have been created more for decorative reasons than for the purposes of magic, especially among the Diaspora, as belief in most such rituals and practices has fallen by the wayside in a more modern, scientific era.  Additionally, the Ukrainian diaspora has reinterpreted meanings and created their own new symbols and interpretations of older ones.<ref>\nLesiv, Mariya .

Folklorica, Journal of the Slavic and East European Folkore Association. Vol 12 (2007)</ref>\n\nThe names and meaning of various symbols and design elements vary from region to region, and even from village to village.  Similar symbols can have totally different interpretations in different places. There are several thousand different motifs in Ukrainian folk designs.  They can be grouped into several families. Keep in mind that these talismanic meanings applied to traditional folk pysanky with traditional designs, not to modern original creations.\n\n=== Geometric ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Polissia.svg|120px|thumbnail|Sorokoklyn from [[Polissia]]]]\nThe most popular pysanka designs are geometric figures. The egg itself is most often divided by straight lines into squares, triangles and other shapes. These shapes are then filled with other forms and designs. These are also among the most ancient symbols, with the \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0442\u043e (resheto, sieve) motif dating back to Paleolithic times. Other ancient geometric symbols are agricultural in nature: triangles, which symbolized clouds or rain; quadrilaterals, especially those with a resheto design in them, symbolized a ploughed field; dots stood for seeds.\n\nGeometric symbols used quite commonly on pysanky today.  The triangle is said to symbolize the Holy Trinity; in ancient times it symbolized other trinities: the elements of air, fire and water, the family (man, woman and child) or the cycle of life (birth, life, and death).  Diamonds, a type of quadrilateral, are sometimes said to symbolize knowledge. Curls/spirals are ancient symbols of the Zmiya/Serpent, and are said to have a meaning of defense or protection. The spiral is said to be protective against the \"\u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\";  an evil spirit which happens to enter a house will be drawn into the spiral and trapped there. Dots, which can represent seeds, stars or cuckoo birds\u2019 eggs (a symbol of spring), are popularly said to be the tears of the blessed Virgin. Hearts are also sometimes seen, and, as in other cultures, they represent love.\n[[File:Meander Motif on a Ukrainian Pysanka.JPG|thumb|200px|A meander motif on a traditional pysanka]]\nOne interesting adaptation of the geometric design is not a symbol per se but a division of the egg called \"forty triangles\" (actually 48) or \"Sorokoklyn (forty wedges).\" Its ancient meaning is not known, but is often said to represent the forty days of lent, the forty martyrs, the forty days that Christ spent in the desert, or the forty life tasks of married couples.\n\n==== Eternity bands ====\nEternity bands or meanders are composed of waves, lines or ribbons; such a line is called a \"bezkonechnyk.\"  A line without end is said to represent immortality.  Waves, however, are a water symbol, and thus a symbol of the Zmiya/Serpent, the ancient water god.  Waves are therefore considered an agricultural symbol, because it is rain that ensures good crops.\n\n===Berehynia===\n[[File:Berehynia Pysanka.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a berehynia motif]]\nThe goddess motif is an ancient one, and most commonly found in pysanky from Polissia or Western Podillia. The berehynia was believed to be the source of life and death. On the one hand, she is a life giving mother, the creator of heaven and all living things, and the mistress of heavenly water (rain), upon which the world relies for fertility and fruitfulness. On the other hand, she was the merciless controller of destinies.\n\nThe goddess is sometimes depicted with arms upraised, and the arms vary in number but are always in pairs: 2, 4 or 6. This is similar to the appearance of the Christian Oranta. Pysanky with this motif were called \u201cbohyn\u2019ky\u201d (\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438, little goddesses) or \u201czhuchky\u201d (\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0438, beetles), the latter because they are similar in appearance to the Cyrillic letter \u0416 (zh).  Sometimes the berehynia has become abstracted, and is represented by a plant\u2014vazon\u2014the tree of life. Her arms become the branches and flowers, and she is firmly rooted in a flowerpot.\n\nThe most common depiction of the great goddess is a composition containing \u201ckucheri\u201d (curls). The berehynia may be seen perched on a curl, or a curl may be given wings; the symbol may be doubled, end-to-end. There is usually a crown on the berehynia\u2019s head. These compositions are given the folk names of \u201cqueen,\u201d \u201cprincess,\u201d \"rooster,\" \u201cscythe,\u201d \u201cdrake,\u201d or simply \u201cwings.\"\n\n=== Christian symbols ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Church Motif.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a church motif]]\nThe only true traditional Christian symbol, and not one adapted from an earlier pagan one, is the church. Stylized churches are often found on pysanky from Hutsul regions (including parts of Bukovyna). Church parts are usually in threes: three stories/roofs, three towers, three openings (windows, doors). Sometimes only the bell tower (dzvinytsia) is depicted.\n\nCrosses are fairly common, although most of those found on traditional pysanky are not Ukrainian (Byzantine) crosses. The crosses most commonly depicted are of the simple \"Greek\" cross type, with arms of equal lengths. This type of cross predates Christianity, and is a sun symbol (an abstracted representation of the solar bird); it is sometimes combined with the star (ruzha) motif. The \"cross crosslet\" type of cross, one in which the ends of each arm are crossed, is frequently seen, particularly on Hutsul and Bukovynian pysanky.\n\nOther adapted religious symbols include a triangle with a circle in the center, denoting the eye of God, and one known as the \"hand of god.\"\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the commercially produced folk pysanky of the Carpathians, especially [[Kosmach]], have begun displaying more Christian symbols.  The lower arm of the cross in older designs is often lengthened to appear more Christian, even if it throws off the symmetry of the design. [[Crucifix]]es are sometimes seen. Pysanky are being written with depictions of Easter baskets on them, including a [[Paska (bread)|paska]] and candle. [[Doves as symbols|White doves]], symbols of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], are also more frequently seen; doves are usually depicted in flight, while other wild birds are traditionally shown perched.\n\n=== Phytomorphic (plant) motifs ===\n\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Priashivshchyna 01.svg|thumbnail|150px|Floral ornaments from [[Lemkivshchyna]]]]\nThe most common motifs found on pysanky are those associated with plants and their parts (flowers and fruit). Women who wrote pysanky drew their inspiration from the world of nature, depicting flowers, trees, fruits, leaves and whole plants in a highly stylized (not realistic) fashion. Such ornaments symbolized the rebirth of nature after winter, and pysanky were written with plant motifs to guarantee a good harvest. A most popular floral design is a plant in a vase of standing on its own, which symbolized the tree of life and was a highly abstracted version of the berehynia (great goddess).\n\nPysanky created by the [[mountain people]] of the Hutsul region of Ukraine often showed a stylized fir tree branch, a symbol of youth and eternal life. Trees, in general, symbolized strength, renewal, creation, growth; as with animal motifs, the parts (leaves, branches) had the same symbolic meaning as the whole.  The oak tree was a sacred to the ancient god Perun, the most powerful of the pagan Slavic pantheon, and thus oak leaves symbolized strength.\n\nPussy willow branches are sometimes depicted on pysanky; in Ukraine, the pussy willow replaces the palm leaf on Palm Sunday.  This is not a common motif, though, and may be a more recent addition.\n\nTwo very popular plant motifs on modern diasporan pysanky are poppies and wheat; these motifs are never seen on traditional pysanky, and are purely a modern invention.\n\n==== Flowers ====\n[[File:Ruzha (Ukrainian Pysanka).JPG|thumb|200px|A Ukrainian pysanka with a ruzha (eight pointed star) motif]]\nFlowers are a common pysanka motif. They can be divided into two types: specific botanical types, and non-specific.\n\nSpecific botanical types include sunflowers, daisies, violets, carnations, periwinkle and lily-of the-valley. These flowers are represented with identifying features that make them recognizable. Carnations will have a serrated edge to the petals, the flowers of the lily of the valley will be arrayed along a stem, periwinkle will have three or four leaves (periwinkle is represented by its leaves, not its flowers, on pysanky).\n\nThere are also flower motifs called orchids and tulips, but these are not botanical names.  They are actually the names given to fantastical flowers, as neither of these flowers was commonly found in Ukraine until modern times. The names reflected the exoticism of the designs.\n[[File:Vazon (Tree of Life).JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional Ukrainian pysanka from Bukovyna region, with a vazon motif]]\nNon-specific flowers are much more common, and consist of the ruzha and others. The ruzha (or rozha) is named after the mallow flower, although it does not resemble one, and is another name given to the eight-pointed star motif.  A ruzha can be full, empty, compound, divided or even crooked. It is a sun sign. Other non-specific types often have hyphenated names: potato-flower, strawberry-flower, etc.  They are usually simple arrangements of petals, six or more, and bear little resemblance to the plant they are named for.\n\n====Vazon/Tree of Life====\nThe \u201ctree of life\u201d motif is widely used in traditional pysanky designs. It can be represented in many ways. Sometimes it appears as two deer on either side of a pine tree. More often it manifests as a flower pot (\u201cvazon\u201d), filled with leaves and flowers.  The pot itself is usually a rectangle, triangle or a rhomboid (symbolic of the earth), and is covered with dots (seeds) and dashes (water). Many branches grow out of it, in a symmetric fashion, with leaves and flowers. This plant is a berehynia (goddess) symbol, with the branches representing the many arms of the mother goddess.\n\n==== Fruit ====\nFruit is not a common motif on pysanky, but is sometimes represented. Apples, plums and cherries are depicted on traditional pysanky. Currants and viburnum (kalyna) berries are sometimes seen, too. These motifs are probably related to fecundity. Grapes are seen more often, as they have been transformed from an agricultural motif to a religious one, representing the Holy Communion.\n\n=== Scevomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Rake Motifs.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with rake motifs]]\nScevomorphic designs are the second-largest group of designs, and are representations of man-made agricultural objects. These symbols are very common, as Ukraine was a highly agricultural society, and drew many of its positive images from field and farm. Some of these symbols are actually related to agriculture; others have older meanings, but were renamed in more recent times based on their appearance.\n\nCommon symbols include the ladder (symbolizing [[prayer]]s going up to heaven) and the sieve/resheto (a plowed field, or perhaps the separation of good and evil).\n\nRakes and combs are often depicted; both are meant to invoke a good harvest. Both are rain symbols. The body of the rake (sometimes depicted as a triangle) is the cloud, and the teeth symbolize rain drops. (Note: these combs are not hair combs, but agricultural implements.)\n\nWindmills, a variation on the broken cross (swastika) motif, are actually sun symbols, not agricultural symbols. The movement of the cross echoes the movement of the sun across the sky.\n\n=== Zoomorphic (animal) motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky -- Teeth of wolf from Odessa.svg|thumbnail|150px|Wolf's teeth [[Odessa]]]]\nAlthough animal motifs are not as popular as plant motifs, they are nevertheless found on pysanky, especially those of the people of the Carpathian Mountains. Animal depicted on pysanky include both wild animals (deer, birds, fish) and domesticated ones (rams, horses, poultry).  As with plants, animals were depicted in the abstract, highly stylized, and not with realistic detail.\n\nHorses were popular ornaments because they symbolized strength and endurance, as well as wealth and prosperity. They also had a second meaning as a sun symbol: in some versions of pagan mythology, the sun was drawn across the sky by the steeds of Dazhboh, the sun god. Similarly, deer designs were fairly common as they were intended to bring prosperity and long life; in other versions of the myth, it was the stag who carried the sun across the sky on his antlers.  Rams are symbols of leadership, strength, dignity, and perseverance.\n\nSometime women simply drew parts of animals; these symbols were probably a sort of shorthand, endowed with all the attributes of the animal represented. Ducks\u2019 necks, goose feet, rabbits\u2019 ears, rams\u2019 horns, wolves\u2019 teeth, bear claws, and bulls\u2019 eyes can all be found on pysanky.  One cannot be sure, however, if these symbols were actually meant to represent animals, or were renamed centuries later because of their appearance.\n\n==== Birds ====\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Birds.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with bird motifs]]\nBirds were considered the harbingers of spring, thus they were a commonplace pysanka motif.  Birds of all kinds are the messengers of the sun and heaven. Birds are always shown perched, at rest, never flying (except for swallows and, in more recent times, white doves carrying letters). Roosters are symbols of masculinity, or the coming of dawn, and hens represent fertility.\n\nBirds were almost always shown in full profile, stylized, but with characteristic features of the species. Partial representations of some birds&ndash;&ndash;mostly domestic fowl&ndash;&ndash;are often seen on pysanky. Bird parts (eyes, feet, beaks, combs, feathers) are said carry the same meaning as the entire bird. Thus hen's feet represent fertility and the rooster's comb signifies masculinity.\n\n==== Insects ====\nInsects are only rarely depicted on pysanky. Highly stylized spiders (and occasionally their webs) are the most common on folk pysanky, and symbolize perseverance. Beetles are sometimes seen, but rarely look anything like a beetle. What they do resemble, somewhat, is the letter \u0416, as in their Ukrainian name \"\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043e\u043a.\" Other insects are sometimes seen on modern, diasporan pysanky, most commonly butterflies and bees, but seem to be a modern innovation.  In Onyshchuk's \"Symbolism of the Ukrainian Pysanka\" she depicts pysanky with a butterfly motif, but the original design, recorded by Kulzhynsky in 1899, was labeled as being swallows' tails.\n\n==== Fish ====\n[[File:Spirals Zmiya.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with spirals]]\nThe fish, originally a symbol of health, eventually came to symbolize Jesus Christ, the \"fisher of men.\"  In old Ukrainian fairy tales, the fish often helped the hero to win his fight with evil. In the Greek alphabet \u201cfish\u201d ([[ichthys]]) is an [[acrostic]] of \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior,\u201d and it became a secret symbol used by the early Christians.  The fish represents abundance, as well as Christian interpretations of baptism, sacrifice, the powers of regeneration, and Christ himself.\n\n==== Serpent ====\n\nAnother ancient symbol is that of the \u0437\u043c\u0456\u044f or serpent, the ancient god of water and earth.  The serpent could be depicted in several ways: as an \"S\" or sigma, as a curl or spiral, or as a wave. When depicted as a sigma, the zmiya often wears a crown. Depictions of the serpent can be found on Neolithic Trypillian pottery. The serpent symbol on a ''pysanka'' is said to bring protection from catastrophe.  Spirals were particularly strong talismans, as an evil spirit, upon entering the house, would be drawn into the spiral and trapped there.\n\n=== Cosmomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Pysanka with Swastika motif.jpg|thumb|150px|Traditional pysanka with a swastika (svarha) motif]]\nAmong the oldest and most important symbols of pysanky is the sun, and the simplest rendering of the sun is a closed circle with or without rays. Pysanky from all regions of Ukraine depict an eight-sided star, the most common depiction of the sun; this symbol is also called a \"ruzha.\"  Six- or seven-sided stars can also be seen, but much less commonly.\n\nThe sun can also appear as a flower or a \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 (three leaf). The [[swastika]], called in Ukrainian a \"svarha,\" is sometimes referred to as a \"broken cross\" or \"ducks\u2019 necks.\" It represented the sun in pagan times: the movement of the arms around the cross represented the movement of the sun across the sky. The Slavic pagans also believed that the sun did not rise on its own, but was carried across the sky by a stag (or, in some versions, a horse).  The deer and horses often found on Hutsul pysanky are solar symbols.\n\nPysanky with sun motifs were said to have been especially powerful, because they could protect their owner from sickness, bad luck and the evil eye.  In Christian times the sun symbol is said to represent life, warmth, and the love and the Christian God.\n\nOther cosmomorphic symbols are less commonly seen.  The moon is sometimes depicted as a circle with a cross inside it; it is begged to shed its light at night to help the traveller, and to chase away evil powers from the household. Stars are sometimes represented as dots.\n\n== Color symbolism ==\n\nIt is not only motifs on pysanky which carried symbolic weight: colors also had significance. Although the earliest pysanky were often simply two-toned, and many folk designs still are, some believed that the more colors there were on a decorated egg, the more magical power it held. A multi-colored egg could thus bring its owner better luck and a better fate.\n\nThe color palette of traditional pysanky was fairly limited, and based on natural dyes. Yellow, red/orange, green, brown and black were the predominant colors. With the advent of aniline dyes in the 1800s, small amounts of blue and purple were sometimes added. It is important to note that the meanings below are generalizations; different regions interpreted colors differently.<ref name=\"manko folk\"/>\n\n* '''Red''' - is probably the oldest symbolic color, and has many meanings. It represents life-giving blood, and often appears on pysanky with nocturnal and heavenly symbols. It represents love and joy, and the hope of marriage.  It is also associated with the sun. \n* '''Black''' - is a particularly sacred color, and is most commonly associated with the \"other world,\" but not in a negative sense.\n* '''Yellow''' - symbolized the moon and stars and also, agriculturally, the harvest. \n* '''Blue''' - Represented blue skies or the air, and good health.\n* '''White''' - Signified purity,  birth, light, rejoicing, virginity.\n* '''Green''' - the color of new life in the spring. Green represents the resurrection of nature, and the riches of vegetation.\n* '''Brown''' - represents the earth.\n\nSome color combinations had specific meanings, too:\n\n* '''Black and white''' - mourning,  respect for the souls of the dead.\n* '''Black and red''' - this combination was perceived as \"harsh and frightful,\" and very disturbing.  It is common in Podillya, where both serpent motifs and goddess motifs were written with this combination. \n* '''Four or more colors''' - the family's happiness, prosperity, love, health and achievements.\n\nAs with symbols, these talismanic meanings of colors applied to traditional pysanky with traditional designs, and not to modern decorative pysanky.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Pysanka}}\n* [[Pysanka Museum]]\n* [[Easter egg]]\n* [[Egg decorating in Slavic culture]]\n* [[Pisanka (Polish)|Pisanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|pysanka}}\n* [http://pysanka.museum/ Pysanka Museum]\n* [http://www.pysanky.info/Voropay/Voropay.html Customs and Traditions]\n* [http://www.allthingsukrainian.com/Class/PysankyClassVideos.html Pysanka Writing Videos]\n* [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/view/3782/3620 Pysanka Ethnography]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{National symbols of Ukraine}}\n\n[[Category:Visual arts media]]\n[[Category:Handicrafts]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Slavic Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Spring traditions]]\n[[Category:Eggs in culture]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian traditions]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian design]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Ukraine]]\n\n[[da:P\u00e5ske\u00e6g]]\n[[de:Osterei]]\n[[fr:\u0152uf de P\u00e2ques]]\n[[io:Paskala ovo]]\n[[nl:Paasei]]\n[[nn:P\u00e5skeegg]]\n[[pt:Pessanka]]\n[[sl:Pirh]]\n[[fi:P\u00e4\u00e4si\u00e4ismuna]]\n[[sv:P\u00e5sk\u00e4gg]]\n[[zh:\u590d\u6d3b\u8282\u5f69\u86cb]]\n", "name_user": "MysticDjinn", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed erroneous link.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pysanka"}
