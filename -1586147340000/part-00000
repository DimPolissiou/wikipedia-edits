As fluid containing particles or cells is drawn through each microchannel, each particle causes a brief change to the electrical resistance of the liquid.  The counter detects these changes in electrical resistance.\n\n==Coulter principle==\n\nThe ''Coulter principle'' states that particles pulled through an orifice, concurrent with an [[electric current]], produce a change in [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] that is proportional to the volume of the particle traversing the orifice. This pulse in impedance originates from the displacement of electrolyte caused by the particle. The Coulter principle was named for its inventor, [[Wallace H. Coulter]].  The principle has found commercial success in the medical industry, particularly in [[hematology]], where it can be applied to count and size the various cells that make up whole blood.\n\nCells, being poorly conductive particles, alter the effective cross-section of the conductive microchannel. If these particles are less conductive than the surrounding liquid medium, the electrical resistance across the channel increases, causing the electric current passing across the channel to briefly decrease. By monitoring such pulses in electric current, the number of particles for a given volume of fluid can be counted. The size of the electric current change is related to the size of the particle, enabling a particle size distribution to be measured, which can be correlated to mobility, surface charge, and concentration of the particles.\n\nThe Coulter counter is a vital constituent of today's hospital laboratory. Its primary function being the quick and accurate analysis of [[complete blood count]]s (often referred to as CBC).   The CBC is used to determine the number or proportion of white and red blood cells in the body.  Previously, this procedure involved preparing a blood cell stain and manually counting each type of cell under a [[microscope]], a process that typically took a half-hour.\n\nCoulter counters have a wide variety of applications including paint, ceramics, glass, molten metals and food manufacture.  They are also routinely employed for quality control.\n\nA Coulter counter played an important role in the development of the first ever cell sorter, and was involved in the early days of the development of [[flow cytometry]]. Even today, some flow cytometers utilize the Coulter principle to provide highly accurate information about cell size and count.\n\nMany investigators have designed a variety of devices based on the Coulter principle, and generated peer-reviewed publications featuring data generated by these devices.

Wallace H. Coulter was awarded US Patent #2,656,508, ''Means for Counting Particles Suspended in a Fluid''.  The Coulter principle is most commonly employed in a Coulter counter, which is an analytical instrument designed for a specific task such as counting cells.  However, there are numerous other ways to implement the Coulter principle. Several of these have been attempted, some with commercial success, and some purely for academic research.  To date, the most commercially successful application of the Coulter principle is in hematology, where it is used to obtain information about patients\u2019 blood cells.\n\n[[File:Model A COULTER COUNTER from Advertisement.jpg|thumb|The first commercial Coulter counter]]\nThe Coulter principle relies on the fact that particles moving in an electric field cause measurable disturbances in that field.  The magnitudes of these disturbances are proportional to the size of the particles in the field.  Coulter identified several requirements necessary for practical application of this phenomenon.  First, the particles should be suspended in a conducting liquid.  Second, the electrical field should be physically constricted so that the movement of particles in the field causes detectable changes in the current.  Finally, the particles should be dilute enough so that only one at a time passes through the physical constriction, preventing an artifact known as coincidence.\n\nWhile the Coulter principle can be implemented in a variety of designs, there are two that have become the most commercially relevant.  These include an aperture format and a flow cell format. The Figure above shows several other geometries that Coulter patented.\n\n=== Aperture format ===\nThe aperture format is used in most commercial Coulter counters.  In this set up, an orifice of defined size is created in a jewel disk using special manufacturing processes.  The resulting aperture is then embedded in the wall of a glass tube.  The product of this process is commonly referred to as an aperture tube.  While in use, the aperture tube is placed in a liquid so that the jewel disk is completely submerged and the tube can fill with liquid. Electrodes are positioned both inside and outside the aperture tube, which allows current to flow through the aperture.  A pump is used to create a vacuum at the top of the tube, which draws the liquid through the aperture.  Samples to be analyzed are then slowly added to the conducting liquid surrounding the aperture tube.  At the start of the experiment, the electric field is turned on and the pump begins to draw the dilute suspension through the aperture.  The resulting data are collected by recording the electrical pulses generated as the particles traverse the aperture.\n\nWhile the basic physical set-up of the aperture format is consistent in every Coulter counter,  the amount and quality of data varies greatly as a function of the signal processing circuitry implemented.  For example, amplifiers with lower noise thresholds and greater dynamic range can increase the sensitivity of the system.  Similarly, digital pulse height analyzers with variable bin widths provide much higher resolution data as opposed to analog analyzers with fixed bins.  Further, combining a COULTER COUNTER\u00ae with a digital computer allows capture of many electrical pulse characteristics, while analog counters typically store a much more limited amount of information about each pulse.\n\n=== Flow cell format ===\nThe flow cell format is most commonly implemented in hematology instruments, and sometimes flow cytometers.  In this format, electrodes are embedded at either end of a flow channel and the electric field is applied through the channel.  This format has several advantages as opposed to the aperture format.  This arrangement allows for continuous sample analysis whereas the aperture format is single-batch format.  Further, the use of a flow cell lends itself to addition of a sheath flow, which keeps particles centered in the middle of the flow channel.   This allows  measurements to be performed simultaneously, such as probing the object with a laser.  The major disadvantages of the flow cell format are that it is much more expensive to manufacture and is typically fixed to one channel width, whereas the aperture format offers a wide variety of aperture sizes.\n\n== Experimental considerations ==\n\n=== Coincidence ===\nAnomalous electrical pulses can be generated if the concentration of sample is so high that multiple particles enter the aperture simultaneously.  This situation is known as coincidence.  This occurs because there is no way to ensure that a single large pulse is the result of a single large particle or multiple small particles entering the aperture at once.  To prevent this situation, samples must be fairly dilute.\n\n=== Particle path ===\nThe shape of the generated electrical pulse varies with the particle path through the aperture.  Shoulders and other artifacts can occur because the electric field density varies across the diameter of the aperture.  This variance is a result of both the physical constriction of the electric field and also the fact that the liquid velocity varies as a function of radial location in the aperture.  In the flow cell format, this effect is minimized since sheath flow ensures each particle travels an almost identical path through the flow cell.  In the aperture format, signal processing algorithms can be used to correct for artifacts resulting from particle path.\n\n=== Conductive particles ===\nConductive particles are a common concern for individuals considering the Coulter principle.  While this topic raises interesting scientific questions, practically, it rarely affects the results of an experiment.  This is because the conductivity difference between most conductive materials and ions in liquid (referred to as the discharge potential) is so great that most conductive materials act as insulators in a Coulter counter. The voltage necessary to break down this potential barrier is referred to as the breakdown voltage.  For those highly conductive materials that present a problem, the voltage used during a Coulter experiment should be reduced below the breakdown potential (which can be determined empirically).\n\n=== Porous particles ===\nThe Coulter principle measures the volume of an object, since the disturbance in the electric field is proportional to the volume of electrolyte displaced from the aperture.  This leads to some confusion amongst those who are used to optical measurements from microscopes or other systems that only view two dimensions and also show the  boundaries of an object.  The Coulter principle, on the other hand measures three dimensions and the volume displaced by an object.  It is most useful to think of sponges; even though a wet sponge may appear very large, it will displace significantly less liquid than a solid brick of the same dimensions.\n\n=== Direct current and alternating current ===\nThe Coulter counter as invented by Wallace Coulter applies a [[direct current]] (DC) in order to count particles (cells), and produces electrical pulses of amplitude dependent on the size of cells. The cells can be modeled as [[electrical insulator]]s surrounded by a conductive liquid which block a portion of the electrical path thus increasing the measured [[electrical resistance|resistance]] momentarily. This is the most common measuring system using the Coulter principle.\n\nSubsequent inventions were able to extend the information obtained by using [[alternating current]] (AC) in order to probe the [[complex numbers|complex]] [[electrical impedance#Complex impedance|electrical impedance]] of the cells rather than just their size<ref>{{cite journal\n | last1 = Youchun Xu\n | last2 = XinwuXie\n | last3 = Yong Duan\n | last4 = Lei Wang\n | last5 = Zhen Cheng\n | last6 = Jing Cheng\n | title = A review of impedance measurements of whole cells\n | journal = Biosensors and Bioelectronics\n | volume = 77\n | pages = 824-836\n | date = 15 March 2016\n | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566315304917?via%3Dihub\n | doi = 10.1016/j.bios.2015.10.027}}</ref>. The cell may then be approximately modeled as an insulating [[cell membrane]], surrounding the cell's [[cytoplasm]] which is conductive. The thinness of the cell membrane creates an [[electrical capacitance]] between the cytoplasm and the electrolyte surrounding the cell. The electrical impedance may then be measured at one or another AC frequency. At low frequencies (well below 1&nbsp;[[MHz]]) the impedance is similar to the DC resistance. However higher frequencies, in the MHz range, probe the thickness of the cell membrane (which determines its capacitance). At much higher frequencies (well above 10&nbsp;MHz) however, the impedance of the membrane capacitance drops to the point where the larger contribution to the measured impedance is from the cytoplasm itself (the membrane is essentially \"shorted out\"). Using different frequencies the apparatus thus becomes much more than a counter of cells, also being sensitive to the internal structure and composition of the cells.\n\n== Major applications ==\n[[File:Coulter-counter_hg.jpg|thumb|Coulter counter manufactured by Coulter Electronics Ltd., England (1960th)]]\n\n=== Hematology ===\nThe most successful and important application of the Coulter principle is in the characterization of human blood cells.  The technique has been used to diagnose a variety of diseases, and is the standard method for obtaining red blood cell counts (RBCs) and white blood cell counts (WBCs) as well as several other common parameters. When combined with other technologies such as fluorescence tagging and light scattering, the Coulter principle can help produce a detailed profile of patients\u2019 blood cells.\n\n=== Cell count and size ===\nIn addition to clinical counting of blood cells (cell diameters of ~6-10 micrometres, typically), the Coulter principle has established itself as the most reliable laboratory method for counting a wide variety of cells, ranging from bacteria (< 1 micrometre in size), fat cells (~400 micrometre), plant cell aggregates (>~1200 micrometre), and stem cell embryoid bodies (~900 micrometre). \n\n=== Particle characterization ===\nThe Coulter principle has proved useful for applications well beyond cellular studies.  The fact that it individually measures particles, is independent of any optical properties, is extremely sensitive, and is very reproducible has appeal to a wide variety of fields. Consequently, the Coulter principle has been adapted to the nanoscale to produce a novel nanoparticle characterization technique called [[Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing]], or TRPS. TRPS enables high-fidelity analysis of a diverse set of nanoparticles, including (but not limited to): functionalized [[nanomedicine|drug delivery nanoparticles]], Virus-like particles ([[Virus-like particle|VLPs]]), [[liposome]]s, [[Exosome (vesicle)|exosomes]], [[Polymersome|polymeric nanoparticles]], [[microbubbles]].[[File:Coulter_counter.jpg|thumb|Coulter counter Model ZK]]\n\n<br />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hemocytometer]]\n*[[Flow cytometry]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Coulter counters}}\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20080424022037/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/coulter.html\n*{{Patent|US|2656508|''Means for counting particles suspended in a fluid''}}, October 20, 1953, Wallace H.

As fluid containing particles or cells is drawn through each microchannel, each particle causes a brief change to the electrical resistance of the liquid.  The counter detects these changes in electrical resistance.\n\n==Coulter principle==\n\nThe ''Coulter principle'' states that particles pulled through an orifice, concurrent with an [[electric current]], produce a change in [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] that is proportional to the volume of the particle traversing the orifice. This pulse in impedance originates from the displacement of electrolyte caused by the particle. The Coulter principle was named for its inventor, [[Wallace H. Coulter]].  The principle has found commercial success in the medical industry, particularly in [[hematology]], where it can be applied to count and size the various cells that make up whole blood.\n\nCells, being poorly conductive particles, alter the effective cross-section of the conductive microchannel. If these particles are less conductive than the surrounding liquid medium, the electrical resistance across the channel increases, causing the electric current passing across the channel to briefly decrease. By monitoring such pulses in electric current, the number of particles for a given volume of fluid can be counted. The size of the electric current change is related to the size of the particle, enabling a particle size distribution to be measured, which can be correlated to mobility, surface charge, and concentration of the particles.\n\nThe Coulter Counter is a vital constituent of today's hospital laboratory. Its primary function being the quick and accurate analysis of [[complete blood count]]s (often referred to as CBC).   The CBC is used to determine the number or proportion of white and red blood cells in the body.  Previously, this procedure involved preparing a blood cell stain and manually counting each type of cell under a [[microscope]], a process that typically took a half-hour.\n\nCoulter Counters have a wide variety of applications including paint, ceramics, glass, molten metals and food manufacture.  They are also routinely employed for quality control.\n\nA Coulter counter played an important role in the development of the first ever cell sorter, and was involved in the early days of the development of [[flow cytometry]].  Even today, some flow cytometers utilize the Coulter Principle to provide highly accurate information about cell size and count.\n\nMany investigators have designed a variety of devices based on the Coulter Principle, and generated peer-reviewed publications featuring data generated by these devices.  A few of these devices have also been commercialized.  All implementations of the Coulter Principle feature trade offs between sensitivity, noise shielding, solvent compatibility, speed of measurement, sample volume, dynamic range, and reliability of device manufacture.\n\n==Development ==\n[[File:Coulter geometries.png|thumb|Coulter patented several different implementations of the Coulter Principle.

True electronic bulletin board systems arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which first came online on February 16, 1978.  Before long, most major cities had more than one BBS running on [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari Corporation|Atari]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]], and similar [[personal computer]]s. The IBM PC was introduced in 1981, and subsequent models of both Mac computers and PCs were used throughout the 1980s.  Multiple modems, followed by specialized telecommunication hardware, allowed many users to be online simultaneously. [[Compuserve]], [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] and [[AOL]] were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s.

The term is an analogy to the concept of [[viral infections]], which can spread rapidly from person to person. In a social media context, content or websites that are \"viral\" (or which \"go viral\") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, [[magazine]]s, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}</ref> When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[retweet]]ed over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.\n\n=== Bots ===\nSocial media can enable companies to get in the form of greater market share and increased audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Castronovo|first=Cristina|date=2012|title=Social Media in Alternative Marketing Communication Model|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Development & Competitivness|volume=6|pages=117\u2013136}}</ref> [[Internet bot]]s have been developed which facilitate social media marketing.

The authors sampled over 632 girls and boys from the ages of 12\u201316 from Spain in an effort to confirm their beliefs.

Users of Facebook generally use their profile to reflect that they are a \"normal\" person. Social media was found to uphold gender stereotypes both feminine and masculine. The researchers also noted that the traditional stereotypes are often upheld by boys more so than girls. The authors described how neither stereotype was entirely positive, but most people viewed masculine values as more positive.\n\n===Cognition and memory===\nAccording to writer Christine Rosen in \"Virtual Friendship, and the New Narcissism,\" many social media sites encourage status-seeking.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/virtual-friendship-and-the-new-narcissism |title=Virtual Friendship and the New Narcissism |work=The New Atlantis |accessdate=2016-02-29 |author=Rosen, Christine}}</ref> According to Rosen, the practice and definition of \"friendship\" changes in virtuality. Friendship in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron.\" Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who \"recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'\"\nCritic Nicholas G.

At the same time, concerns have been raised about possible links between heavy social media use and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and even the issues of [[cyberbullying]], online [[harassment]] and \"[[Internet troll|trolling]]\".

This finding was consistent with other studies that found people with high social comparison orientation make more social comparisons once on social media.\n\nPeople compare their own lives to the lives of their friends through their friends' posts. People are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interest. Often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. This can lead to depression and other self-esteem issues as well as decrease their satisfaction of life as they feel if their life is not exciting enough to put online it is not as good as their friends or family.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hawi | first1 = N.S. | last2 = Samaha | first2 = M. | year = 2017 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nazir_Hawi/publication/306048463_The_Relations_Among_Social_Media_Addiction_Self-Esteem_and_Life_Satisfaction_in_University_Students/links/59efa4b6a6fdcce2096dc335/The-Relations-Among-Social-Media-Addiction-Self-Esteem-and-Life-Satisfaction-in-University-Students.pdf |title=The Relations Among Social Media Addiction, Self-Esteem, and Life Satisfaction in University Students]| journal = Social Science Computer Review | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 576\u2013586 | doi = 10.1177/0894439316660340 }}</ref>\n\nStudies have shown that self comparison on social media can have dire effects on physical and mental health because they give us the ability to seek approval and compare ourselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Stefanone, M.A. |author2=Lackaff, D. |author3=Rosen, D. |date=2011 |title=Contingencies of Self-Worth and Social-Networking-Site Behavior |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/cas/communication/files/Stefanone/Stefanone_cyberpsych.2011.pdf |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=14 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=41\u20139 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2010.0049 |pmid=21329442 }}</ref> Social media has both a practical usage- to connect us with others, but also can lead to fulfillment of gratification.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Quan-Haase |first=Anabel |last2=Young |first2=Alyson L.|date=September 14, 2010|title=Uses and Gratifications of Social Media: A Comparison of Facebook and Instant Messaging |journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society |language=en |volume=30|issue=5|pages=350\u2013361 |doi=10.1177/0270467610380009|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8423ac0b397329ad53605d1e8e1cdd5f9b4cade8 }}</ref> In fact, one study suggests that because a critical aspect of social networking sites involve spending hours, if not months customizing a personal profile, and encourage a sort of social currency based on likes, followers and comments- they provide a forum for persistent \"appearance conversations\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/children-teens-media-and-body-image# |title=Children, Teens, Media, and Body Image |website=Common Sense Media|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}</ref> These appearance centered conversations that forums like Facebook, Instagram among others provide can lead to feelings of disappointment in looks and personality when not enough likes or comments are achieved.

Ambivalence refers to a user's confusion about the benefits she can get from using a social media site. Emotional exhaustion refers to the stress a user has when using a social media site. Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance. This study provides an instrument to measure the burnout a user can experience, when his or her social media \"friends\" are generating an overwhelming amount of useless information (e.g., \"what I had for dinner\", \"where I am now\").\n\n====Adolescents====\nExcessive use of digital technology, like social media, by adolescents can cause disruptions in their physical and mental health, in sleeping patterns, their weight and levels of exercise and notably in their academic performance. Research has continued to demonstrate that long hours spent on mobile devices have shown a positive relationship with an increase in teenagers' BMI and a lack of physical activity.

With the introduction of social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information. Hashtags can be used when people want to advocate for a movement, store content or tweets from a movement for future use, and allow other social media users to contribute to a discussion about a certain movement by using existing hashtags.

There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=Jos\u00e9 Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |accessdate=2018-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Privacy===\n[[Privacy concerns with social networking services|Privacy]] rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,<ref name=Auer2001/> by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.<ref name=Jones/> Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share, and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=May 21, 2013 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}</ref> Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.\n\nThere are arguments that \"privacy is dead\" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.\n\nAccording to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, \"1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]\" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily, and has been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media is a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=October 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref> The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it.

As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. Many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. Some schools permit students to use [[smartphone]]s or [[tablet computer]]s in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research. Using Facebook in class allows for integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal \"[[back channel]]\"), and extend discussion outside of class time.\n\n===Censorship by governments===\n{{Main|Internet censorship}}\n[[File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg|thumb|Banner in [[Bangkok]], observed on June 30, 2014, informing the Thai public that 'like' or 'share' activity on social media may land them in jail]]\n\nSocial media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity.

How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook,\u201d the media plays a large role in shaping people's perceptions of specific social networking sites. When looking at the site [[Myspace|MySpace]], after adults started to realize how popular the sight was becoming with teens, news media became heavily concerned with teen participation and the potential dangers they faced using the site. As a result, teens avoided joining the site because of the associated risks (e.g. child predators and lack of control) and parents began to publicly denounce the site. Ultimately, the site was labeled as dangerous, and many were detracted from interacting with the site. As boyd also describes, when [[Facebook]] initially launched in 2004, it solely targeted college students and access was intentionally limited. Facebook started as a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-only social networking site before expanding to all other [[Ivy League]] schools. It then made its way to other top universities and ultimately to a wider range of schools. Because of its origins, some saw Facebook as an \u201celite\u201d social networking site. While it was very open and accepting to some, it seemed to outlaw and shun out most others who didn't fit that \u201celite\u201d categorization. These narratives propagated by the media influenced the large movement of teenage users from one social networking site to another.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race After the Internet|last=boyd|first=danah|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Nakamura|editor-first=Lisa|location=|pages=203\u2013222|chapter=White Flight in Networked Publics?

According to [[Andreas Kaplan]], mobile social media applications can be differentiated among four types:<ref name='mobileKaplan' />\n\n# ''Space-timers'' (location and time sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance mostly for one specific location at one specific point in time (e.g. [[Facebook Places]] [[WhatsApp]]; [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]])\n# ''Space-locators'' (only location sensitive): Exchange of messages, with relevance for one specific location, which is tagged to a certain place and read later by others (e.g. [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]]; [[Qype]], [[Tumblr]], [[Fishbrain]])\n# ''Quick-timers'' (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media [[mobile apps]] to increase immediacy (e.g. posting [[Twitter]] messages or [[Facebook]] status updates)\n# ''Slow-timers'' (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to [[mobile devices]] (e.g. watching a [[YouTube]] video or reading/editing a [[Wikipedia]] article)\n\n==Elements and function==\n\n===Viral content===\nSome social media sites have potential for content posted there to spread ''[[Viral phenomenon|virally]]'' over social networks. The term is an analogy to the concept of [[viral infections]], which can spread rapidly from person to person. In a social media context, content or websites that are \"viral\" (or which \"go viral\") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, [[magazine]]s, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}</ref> When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[retweet]]ed over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.\n\n=== Bots ===\nSocial media can enable companies to get in the form of greater market share and increased audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Castronovo|first=Cristina|date=2012|title=Social Media in Alternative Marketing Communication Model|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Development & Competitivness|volume=6|pages=117\u2013136}}</ref> [[Internet bot]]s have been developed which facilitate social media marketing.

At the same time, younger Americans (especially those ages 18 to 24) stand out for embracing a variety of platforms and using them frequently. Some 78% of 18 - 24-year-old youngsters use Snapchat, and a sizeable majority of these users (71%) visit the platform multiple times per day. Similarly, 71% of Americans in this age group now use Instagram and close to half (45%) are Twitter users. However, Facebook remains the primary platform for most Americans. Roughly two-thirds of U.S. adults (68%) now report that they are Facebook users, and roughly three-quarters of those users access Facebook on a daily basis.

In many ways, mainstream [[journalist]]s have maintained an authoritative voice as the storytellers of the American past. Their documentary style narratives, detailed exposes, and their positions in the present make them prime sources for public memory. Specifically, news media journalists have shaped collective memory on nearly every major national event \u2013 from the deaths of social and political figures to the progression of political hopefuls. Journalists provide elaborate descriptions of commemorative events in U.S. history and contemporary popular cultural sensations. Many Americans learn the significance of historical events and political issues through news media, as they are presented on popular news stations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pajala |first1=Mary |year=2012 |title=Television as an Archive of Memory? |journal=Critical Studies in Television |volume=5 |issue=2|pages=133\u2013145 |doi=10.7227/cst.5.2.16}}</ref> However, journalistic influence is growing less important, whereas social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Twitter]], provide a constant supply of alternative news sources for users.\n\nAs [[social networking]] becomes more popular among older and younger generations, sites such as Facebook and YouTube, gradually undermine the traditionally authoritative voices of news media.

In contrast girls generally post more images that include themselves, friends and things they have emotional ties to, which the researchers attributed that to the higher emotional intelligence of girls at a younger age. The authors sampled over 632 girls and boys from the ages of 12\u201316 from Spain in an effort to confirm their beliefs.

Users of Facebook generally use their profile to reflect that they are a \"normal\" person. Social media was found to uphold gender stereotypes both feminine and masculine. The researchers also noted that the traditional stereotypes are often upheld by boys more so than girls. The authors described how neither stereotype was entirely positive, but most people viewed masculine values as more positive.\n\n===Cognition and memory===\nAccording to writer Christine Rosen in \"Virtual Friendship, and the New Narcissism,\" many social media sites encourage status-seeking.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/virtual-friendship-and-the-new-narcissism |title=Virtual Friendship and the New Narcissism |work=The New Atlantis |accessdate=2016-02-29 |author=Rosen, Christine}}</ref> According to Rosen, the practice and definition of \"friendship\" changes in virtuality. Friendship in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron.\" Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who \"recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'\"\nCritic Nicholas G.

Some users have experienced threats of violence online and have feared these threats manifesting themselves offline. At the same time, concerns have been raised about possible links between heavy social media use and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and even the issues of [[cyberbullying]], online [[harassment]] and \"[[Internet troll|trolling]]\".

This finding was consistent with other studies that found people with high social comparison orientation make more social comparisons once on social media.\n\nPeople compare their own lives to the lives of their friends through their friends' posts. People are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interest. Often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. This can lead to depression and other self-esteem issues as well as decrease their satisfaction of life as they feel if their life is not exciting enough to put online it is not as good as their friends or family.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hawi | first1 = N.S. | last2 = Samaha | first2 = M. | year = 2017 | title = [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nazir_Hawi/publication/306048463_The_Relations_Among_Social_Media_Addiction_Self-Esteem_and_Life_Satisfaction_in_University_Students/links/59efa4b6a6fdcce2096dc335/The-Relations-Among-Social-Media-Addiction-Self-Esteem-and-Life-Satisfaction-in-University-Students.pdf The Relations Among Social Media Addiction, Self-Esteem, and Life Satisfaction in University Students] | url = | journal = Social Science Computer Review | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 576\u2013586 | doi = 10.1177/0894439316660340 }}</ref>\n\nStudies have shown that self comparison on social media can have dire effects on physical and mental health because they give us the ability to seek approval and compare ourselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Stefanone, M.A. |author2=Lackaff, D. |author3=Rosen, D. |date=2011 |title=Contingencies of Self-Worth and Social-Networking-Site Behavior |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/cas/communication/files/Stefanone/Stefanone_cyberpsych.2011.pdf |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=14 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=41\u20139 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2010.0049 |pmid=21329442 }}</ref> Social media has both a practical usage- to connect us with others, but also can lead to fulfillment of gratification.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Quan-Haase |first=Anabel |last2=Young |first2=Alyson L.|date=September 14, 2010|title=Uses and Gratifications of Social Media: A Comparison of Facebook and Instant Messaging |journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society |language=en |volume=30|issue=5|pages=350\u2013361 |doi=10.1177/0270467610380009|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8423ac0b397329ad53605d1e8e1cdd5f9b4cade8 }}</ref> In fact, one study suggests that because a critical aspect of social networking sites involve spending hours, if not months customizing a personal profile, and encourage a sort of social currency based on likes, followers and comments- they provide a forum for persistent \"appearance conversations\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/children-teens-media-and-body-image# |title=Children, Teens, Media, and Body Image |website=Common Sense Media|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}</ref> These appearance centered conversations that forums like Facebook, Instagram among others provide can lead to feelings of disappointment in looks and personality when not enough likes or comments are achieved.

Ambivalence refers to a user's confusion about the benefits she can get from using a social media site. Emotional exhaustion refers to the stress a user has when using a social media site. Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance. This study provides an instrument to measure the burnout a user can experience, when his or her social media \"friends\" are generating an overwhelming amount of useless information (e.g., \"what I had for dinner\", \"where I am now\").\n\n====Adolescents====\nExcessive use of digital technology, like social media, by adolescents can cause disruptions in their physical and mental health, in sleeping patterns, their weight and levels of exercise and notably in their academic performance. Research has continued to demonstrate that long hours spent on mobile devices have shown a positive relationship with an increase in teenagers' BMI and a lack of physical activity. Moreover, excessive internet usage has been linked to lower grades compared to users who do not spend an excessive amount of time online, even with a control over age, gender, race, parent education and personal contentment factors that may affect the study.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11920-014-0472-x|pmid = 25070673|title = Adolescents and the Internet: What Mental Health Clinicians Need to Know|journal = Current Psychiatry Reports|volume = 16|issue = 9|pages = 472|year = 2014|last1 = Rafla|first1 = Malak|last2 = Carson|first2 = Nicholas J|last3 = Dejong|first3 = Sandra M}}</ref>  In a recent study, it was found that time spent on Facebook has a strong negative relationship with overall GPA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Junco|first=Reynol|date=September 2011|title=Too Much Face and Not Enough Books|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211001932|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=28|pages=|via=}}</ref> The use of multiple social media platforms is more strongly associated with depression and anxiety among young adults than time spent online.

With the introduction of social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information. Hashtags can be used when people want to advocate for a movement, store content or tweets from a movement for future use, and allow other social media users to contribute to a discussion about a certain movement by using existing hashtags.

There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=Jos\u00e9 Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |accessdate=2018-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Privacy===\n[[Privacy concerns with social networking services|Privacy]] rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,<ref name=Auer2001/> by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.<ref name=Jones/> Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share, and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=May 21, 2013 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}</ref> Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.\n\nThere are arguments that \"privacy is dead\" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.\n\nAccording to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, \"1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]\" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily, and has been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media is a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=October 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref> The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it.

One German study, published in 2017, investigated a correlation between extensive use of the social networking site and narcissism; the results were published in the journal PLoS One.

As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. Many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. Some schools permit students to use [[smartphone]]s or [[tablet computer]]s in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research. Using Facebook in class allows for integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal \"[[back channel]]\"), and extend discussion outside of class time.\n\n===Censorship by governments===\n{{Main|Internet censorship}}\n[[File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg|thumb|Banner in [[Bangkok]], observed on June 30, 2014, informing the Thai public that 'like' or 'share' activity on social media may land them in jail]]\n\nSocial media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity.

How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook,\u201d the media plays a large role in shaping people's perceptions of specific social networking sites. When looking at the site [[Myspace|MySpace]], after adults started to realize how popular the sight was becoming with teens, news media became heavily concerned with teen participation and the potential dangers they faced using the site. As a result, teens avoided joining the site because of the associated risks (e.g. child predators and lack of control) and parents began to publicly denounce the site. Ultimately, the site was labeled as dangerous, and many were detracted from interacting with the site. As boyd also describes, when [[Facebook]] initially launched in 2004, it solely targeted college students and access was intentionally limited. Facebook started as a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-only social networking site before expanding to all other [[Ivy League]] schools. It then made its way to other top universities and ultimately to a wider range of schools. Because of its origins, some saw Facebook as an \u201celite\u201d social networking site. While it was very open and accepting to some, it seemed to outlaw and shun out most others who didn't fit that \u201celite\u201d categorization. These narratives propagated by the media influenced the large movement of teenage users from one social networking site to another.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race After the Internet|last=boyd|first=danah|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Nakamura|editor-first=Lisa|location=|pages=203\u2013222|chapter=White Flight in Networked Publics?

Samoilovich worked on the S-6 mainly in their spare time. To obtain the necessary resources, the S-6 project was submitted to the authorities as part of modernization of the [[Sukhoi T-58]] (Sukhoi's prototype designation for the [[Sukhoi Su-15]]).<ref name=Antonov>{{cite book |last1=Antonov |first1=Vladimir |last2=Gordon |first2=Yefim |last3=Gordyukov |first3=Nikolai |last4=Yakovlev |first4=Vladimir |last5=Zenkin |first5=Vyacheslav |last6=Carruth |first6=Lenox |last7=Miller |first7=Jay |title=OKB Sukhoi : a history of the design bureau and its aircraft |date=1996 |publisher=Midland Publishing |location=Earl Shilton |isbn=9781857800128 |edition=1st |page=177}}</ref>\n\n== Parameters ==\nThe S-6 was to be equipped with the Puma Weapon Computer System, which would include the 'Orion' pulse doppler radar and 'Relief' monopulse ground mapping radar, later incorporated into the Su-24. Powered by 2x {{cvt|46.1|kN|0}} [[Tumansky R-21F-300]] (modified [[Tumansky R-11F-300]]), the S-6 would theoretically have been capable of a maximum speed of {{cvt|1400|km/h|mph kn|0}} at sea level and {{cvt|2500|km/h|mph kn|0}} at high altitude.\n\t\nThe starting point for the aircraft was the Su-15U, with the weapons system officer seated in the rear cockpit, relieving the pilot of responsibility for the weapon systems. Airbrakes were to have benn sited either side of the fin with a brake parachute housed at the extreme rear end of the ventral spine, running the entire length of the fuselage aft of the canopy. \n\t\nThe S-6 was to have a two-wheel nose landing gear and single-wheeled main landing gear, retracting into the fuselage. The large nose with slightly flattened sides housed the gound mapping radar and terrain following radar, with a shovel-shaped combined laser / infrared sensor, which also included the data transmission for the anti-radar weapons like the Ch-24, mounted below and behind the radome on a forward swept pylon. The most striking visual feature of the S-6 design, however, was its rectangular air intakes, which were raked rearwards from the lower lips.\n\t\n===T-58M===\nAssessment of a full-scale model and development of subsystems (notably the Puma-S weapon system), revealed that the requirements in terms of range, weapon loading and field aerodrome capability could only be met by the S-6 when fitted with [[RATOG]], but still outshone the competition for Mikoyan Guryevitch with their project based on the MiG-25.\n\t\nThe military then demanded a larger weapon load, which led Sukhoi to propose a less advanced derivative of the T-58 as the T-58M, which had four weapon stations on the fuselage versus the S-6's single weapon station. Due to the greater weight, the main landing gear of the T-58M was equipped with two wheels to operate on unpaved runways. The T-58M was to have had an extended fuselage, twin wheel main landing gear, the same radar system as the S-6, a continuous spine from the cockpit to the brake screen container under the rudder and half-round air inlets with adjustable diffuser cones, resembling the [[Lavochkin La-250]].\n\t\nHowever, the T-58M also failed to meet military demands for maximum speed and weight on the one hand and STOL capability for operation on semi-prepared runways. Also, the required performance of the radar system could not be met due to the limitations of the fuselage cross-section / antenna size. At that time, the use of vertical jet engines in East and West seemed a promising solution to shorten take-off and landing distances. Suchoi's experience with the technology demonstrator T-58VD (a T-58 prototype equipped with three [[Rybinsk RD-36-35]] lift-jets), led them to improve STOL performance with lift engines, widening the fuselage and in turn, allowing a larger radome to accommodate a larger radar antennae. The sensor attached to the pylon under the radome on the S-6 could now be installed in the nose and the widened fuselage also gave the opportunity for a side by side cockpit, increasing the efficiency of the crew.\n\t\n===T-6===\nIn a progression from the S-6 and T-58M the prototype fixed-wing [[Sukhoi T-6-1]] was built, with rectangular air inlets, similar to the [[Sukhoi Su-24]] and lift-jets in the fuselage. Sukhoi's good experiences with development of the [[Sukhoi Su-7IG]] with variable-sweep wings, led them to fit swing-wings on the T-6 due to the overall better trade-off with weight, and fuel consumption, resulting in the T-6-2 prototypes of the production Su-24.\n\n== Armament ==\t\nThe S-6 was to have a [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23]] cannon, two weapon stations on each wing, one on the fuselage centre-lineand two more under the rear fuselage. The outboard pylons and the centre-line pylon would have been plumbed for drop-tanks. The rear fuselage stations were only usable for booster rockets or unguided free-fall bombs. Proposed weapons were conventional free-fall bombs, heavy unguided air-to-surface missiles, [[S-5 rocket|S-5]]  multiple rocket pods, Kh-24 anti-radar missiles, and tactical nuclear weapons, up to a maximum weapon load of {{cvt|3000|kg|0}}.\n\n==References== \t\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\t\n* {{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Yefim |title=Sukhoi Su-24 Fencer : Soviet swing-wing bomber |date=2005 |publisher=Aerofax |location=Hinkley |isbn=9781857802023 |pages=6\u20138 |edition=1st}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Yefim |last2=Komissarov |first2=Dmitriy |title=Sukhoi Su-24 : tactical bomber |date=2015 |publisher=Crecy Publishing |location=Hinkley |isbn=9781857803709 |pages=10\u201314 |edition=1st}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Sukhoi S-6}}\n\n* [http://www.secretprojects.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,901.msg10976.html#msg10976   Drawings & Pictures of S-6 in Weblog]\n\n{{Sukhoi aircraft}}\n\n[[Category:1970s Soviet bomber aircraft]]\n", "text_old": "{{mergeto|Sukhoi Su-24|discuss=Talk:Sukhoi Su-24#Merger proposal|date=March 2020}}{{refimprove|date=March 2020}}\n{|{{Infobox aircraft begin\n |name= S-6\n |image= Sukhoi S-6 nose.jpg\n |caption= Model of the proposed S-6\n}}{{Infobox aircraft type\t\n |type= All-weather [[attack aircraft]]\n |manufacturer= [[Sukhoi]]\t\n |designer= Yevgeny Felsner and Oleg S.

The T-58M was to have had an extended fuselage, twin wheel main landing gear, the same radar system as the S-6, a continuous spine from the cockpit to the brake screen container under the rudder and half-round air inlets with adjustable diffuser cones, resembling the [[Lavochkin La-250]].\n\t\nHowever, the T-58M also failed to meet military demands for maximum speed and weight on the one hand and STOL capability for operation on semi-prepared runways. Also, the required performance of the radar system could not be met due to the limitations of the fuselage cross-section / antenna size. At that time, the use of vertical jet engines in East and West seemed a promising solution to shorten take-off and landing distances. Suchoi's experience with the technology demonstrator T-58VD (a T-58 prototype equipped with three [[Rybinsk RD-36-35]] lift-jets), led them to improve STOL performance with lift engines, widening the fuselage and in turn, allowing a larger radome to accommodate a larger radar antennae. The sensor attached to the pylon under the radome on the S-6 could now be installed in the nose and the widened fuselage also gave the opportunity for a side by side cockpit, increasing the efficiency of the crew.\n\t\n===T-6===\nIn a progression from the S-6 and T-58M the prototype fixed-wing [[Sukhoi T-6-1]] was built, with rectangular air inlets, similar to the [[Sukhoi Su-24]] and lift-jets in the fuselage. Sukhoi's good experiences with development of the [[Sukhoi Su-7IG]] with variable-sweep wings, led them to fit swing-wings on the T-6 due to the overall better trade-off with weight, and fuel consumption, resulting in the T-6-2 prototypes of the production Su-24.\n\n== Armament ==\t\nThe S-6 was to have a [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23]] cannon, two weapon stations on each wing, one on the fuselage centre-lineand two more under the rear fuselage. The outboard pylons and the centre-line pylon would have been plumbed for drop-tanks. The rear fuselage stations were only usable for booster rockets or unguided free-fall bombs. Proposed weapons were conventional free-fall bombs, heavy unguided air-to-surface missiles, [[S-5 rocket|S-5]]  multiple rocket pods, Kh-24 anti-radar missiles, and tactical nuclear weapons, up to a maximum weapon load of {{cvt|3000|kg|0}}.\n\n==References== \t\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\t\n* {{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Yefim |title=Sukhoi Su-24 Fencer : Soviet swing-wing bomber |date=2005 |publisher=Aerofax |location=Hinkley |isbn=9781857802023 |pages=6-8 |edition=1st}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Yefim |last2=Komissarov |first2=Dmitriy |title=Sukhoi Su-24 : tactical bomber |date=2015 |publisher=Crecy Publishing |location=Hinkley |isbn=9781857803709 |pages=10-14 |edition=1st}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Sukhoi S-6}}\n\n* [http://www.secretprojects.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,901.msg10976.html#msg10976   Drawings & Pictures of S-6 in Weblog]\n\n{{Sukhoi aircraft}}\n\n[[Category:1970s Soviet bomber aircraft]]\n", "name_user": "Anomalocaris", "label": "safe", "comment": "|} on its own line; dashes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_S-6"}

First elected president of the [[French Second Republic]] in [[1848 French presidential election|1848]], he seized power in 1851, when he could not constitutionally be re-elected, and became the [[emperor of the French]]. He founded the [[Second French Empire]] and was its only emperor until the defeat of the French army and his capture by [[Prussia]] and its allies in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. He worked to modernize the French economy, rebuilt the center of Paris, expanded the [[French overseas empire]], and engaged in the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Second Italian War of Independence]].\n\nNapoleon III commissioned a grand [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|reconstruction of Paris]] carried out by his prefect of the Seine, [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]], and launched similar public works projects in [[Marseille]], [[Lyon]] and other French cities. Napoleon III modernized the French banking system, expanded and consolidated the French railway system, and made the French merchant marine the second largest in the world. He promoted the building of the [[Suez Canal]] and established modern agriculture, which ended famines in France and made France an agricultural exporter. Napoleon III negotiated the 1860 [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier free trade agreement]] with Britain and similar agreements with France's other European trading partners. Social reforms included giving French workers the right to strike and the right to organize. The first women students were admitted at the Sorbonne and educational opportunities for women were increased, as did the list of required subjects in public schools.\n\nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world. He was a supporter of [[popular sovereignty]] and of [[nationalism]]. In Europe, he allied with Britain and defeated Russia in the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u201356). His regime assisted [[Italian unification]] by defeating the Austrian Empire in the [[Franco-Austrian War]] and later annexed [[Savoy]] and the [[County of Nice]] as its deferred reward. At the same time, his forces defended the [[Papal States]] against annexation by Italy.  He was also favorable towards the union of the Danubian Principalities (24th of January 1859), which resulted in the establishment of the modern state of [[Romania]]. Napoleon III doubled the area of the [[French overseas empire]] in Asia, the Pacific and Africa. On the other hand, the [[French intervention in Mexico]], which aimed to create a [[Second Mexican Empire]] under French protection, ended in total failure.\n\nFrom 1866, Napoleon had to face the mounting power of Prussia as its Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] sought German unification under Prussian leadership. In July 1870, Napoleon entered the Franco-Prussian War without allies and with inferior military forces. The French army was rapidly defeated and Napoleon III was captured at the [[Battle of Sedan]]. The [[French Third Republic]] was proclaimed in Paris and Napoleon went into exile in England, where he died in 1873.\n\n==Childhood and family==\n\n===Early life===\nCharles-Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, later known as Louis Napoleon and then Napoleon III, was born in Paris on the night of 19\u201320 April 1808. His father was [[Louis Bonaparte]], the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who made Louis the [[Kingdom of Holland|King of Holland]] from 1806 until 1810. His mother was [[Hortense de Beauharnais]], the only daughter of Napoleon's wife [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]] by her first marriage to [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]].\n\nAs empress, Jos\u00e9phine proposed the marriage as a way to produce an heir for the Emperor, who agreed, as Jos\u00e9phine was by then infertile.<ref>Bresler, 1999, p. 20</ref> Louis married Hortense when he was twenty-four and she was nineteen. They had a difficult relationship and only lived together for brief periods. Their first son [[Napol\u00e9on Charles Bonaparte]] died in 1807 and\u2014though separated and parents of a healthy second son, [[Napol\u00e9on-Louis Bonaparte]]\u2014they decided to have a third child. They resumed their marriage for a brief time in Toulouse in July 1807, and Louis was born prematurely, two weeks short of nine months. Louis Napoleon's enemies, including [[Victor Hugo]], spread the gossip that he was the child of a different man, but most historians agree today that he was the legitimate son of Louis Bonaparte<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 21\u201324</ref><ref>Milza, 2006, p. 15</ref> (see [[Napoleon III of France#Ancestry|ancestry]]).<ref>Bresler, 1999, p. 37</ref>\n\nCharles-Louis was baptized at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] on 5 November 1810, with Emperor Napoleon serving as his godfather and [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Empress Marie-Louise]] as his godmother. His father stayed away, once again separated from Hortense. At the age of seven, Louis Napoleon visited his uncle at the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris. Napoleon held him up to the window to see the soldiers parading in the courtyard of the Carousel below. He last saw his uncle with the family at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], shortly before Napoleon departed for the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 26</ref>\n\nAll members of the [[Bonaparte dynasty]] were forced into exile after the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo and the [[Bourbon Restoration]] of monarchy in France. Hortense and Louis Napoleon moved from [[Aix-les-Bains|Aix]] to [[Bern]] to [[Baden-Baden|Baden]], and finally to a lakeside house at [[Arenenberg]] in the Swiss canton of [[Thurgau]]. He received some of his education in Germany at the [[gymnasium school]] at [[Augsburg]], Bavaria. As a result, for the rest of his life, his French had a slight but noticeable German accent. His tutor at home was [[Philippe Le Bas]], an ardent republican and the son of a revolutionary and close friend of [[Robespierre]]. Le Bas taught him French history and radical politics.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 39\u201342</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:LouisBonaparte Holland.jpg|[[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the King of Holland, and father of Napoleon III\nFile:Reine de Hollande et son fils.jpg|[[Hortense de Beauharnais]] (1783\u20131837), mother to Louis Napoleon in 1808\nFile:Schloss Arenenberg mit Kapelle und Napoleonmuseum.jpg|The lakeside house at [[Arenenberg]], Switzerland, where Louis Napoleon spent much of his youth and exile\n</gallery>\n\n===Romantic revolutionary (1823\u20131835)===\nWhen Louis Napoleon was fifteen, Hortense moved to Rome, where the Bonapartes had a villa. He passed his time learning Italian, exploring the ancient ruins, and learning the arts of seduction and romantic affairs, which he used often in his later life. He became friends with the French Ambassador, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Chateaubriand]], the father of romanticism in French literature, with whom he remained in contact for many years. He was reunited with his older brother [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte|Napoleon Louis]], and together they became involved with the [[Carbonari]], secret revolutionary societies fighting Austria's domination of northern Italy. In the spring of 1831, when he was twenty-three, the Austrian and papal governments launched an offensive against the Carbonari, and the two brothers, wanted by the police, were forced to flee. During their flight, Napoleon-Louis contracted measles and, on 17 March 1831, died in his brother's arms.<ref>Bresler, 1999, pp. 94\u201395</ref> Hortense joined her son and together they evaded the police and Austrian army and finally reached the French border.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 58\u201372</ref>\n\nHortense and Louis Napoleon travelled incognito to Paris, where the old regime of King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] had just fallen and been replaced by the more liberal regime of King [[Louis Philippe I]]. They arrived in Paris on 23 April 1831, and took up residence under the name \"Hamilton\" in the Hotel du Holland on [[Place Vend\u00f4me]]. Hortense wrote an appeal to the King, asking to stay in France, and Louis Napoleon offered to volunteer as an ordinary soldier in the French Army. The new King agreed to meet secretly with Hortense; Louis Napoleon had a fever and did not join them. The King finally agreed that Hortense and Louis Napoleon could stay in Paris as long as their stay was brief and incognito. Louis-Napoleon was told that he could join the French Army if he would simply change his name, something he indignantly refused to do. Hortense and Louis Napoleon remained in Paris until 5 May, the tenth anniversary of the death of Napoleon Bonaparte. The presence of Hortense and Louis Napoleon in the hotel had become known, and a public demonstration of mourning for the Emperor took place on Place Vend\u00f4me in front of their hotel. The same day, Hortense and Louis Napoleon were ordered to leave Paris. They went to Britain briefly, and then back into exile in Switzerland.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 72\u201377</ref>\n\n==Early adult years==\n\n===Bonapartist succession and philosophy of Bonapartism===\nEver since the fall of Napoleon in 1815, a [[Bonapartist]] movement had existed in France,  hoping to return a Bonaparte to the throne. According to the law of succession established by Napoleon I, the claim passed first to his own son, declared \"King of Rome\" at birth by his father. This heir, known by Bonapartists as [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was living in virtual imprisonment at the court of [[Vienna]] under the title Duke of Reichstadt. Next in line was Napoleon I's eldest brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (1768\u20131844), followed by [[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), but neither Joseph nor Louis had any interest in re-entering public life. When the Duke of Reichstadt died in 1832, Louis Napoleon became the ''de facto'' heir of the dynasty and the leader of the Bonapartist cause.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nIn exile with his mother in Switzerland, he enrolled in the Swiss Army, trained to become an officer, and wrote a manual of artillery (his uncle Napoleon Bonaparte had become famous as an artillery officer). Louis Napoleon also began writing about his political philosophy \u2013 for as [[H. A. L. Fisher]] suggested, \"the programme of the Empire was not the improvisation of a vulgar adventurer\" but the result of deep reflection on the Napoleonic political philosophy and on how to adjust it to the changed domestic and international scenes.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/bonapartismsixle00fishiala|title= Bonapartism, six lectures delivered in the University of London|last= Fisher|first= Herbert Albert Laurens|publisher= Clarendon Press|year= 1908|isbn= |location= Oxford|page= [https://archive.org/details/bonapartismsixle00fishiala/page/87 87]}}</ref> He published his ''R\u00eaveries politiques'' or \"political dreams\" in 1833 at the age of 25, followed in 1834 by ''Consid\u00e9rations politiques et militaires sur la Suisse'' (\"Political and military considerations about Switzerland\"), followed in 1839 by ''Les Id\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes'' (\"Napoleonic Ideas\"), a compendium of his political ideas which was published in three editions and eventually translated into six languages. He based his doctrine upon two ideas: universal suffrage and the primacy of the national interest. He called for a \"monarchy which procures the advantages of the Republic without the inconveniences\", a regime \"strong without despotism, free without anarchy, independent without conquest\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 61\u201362\n</ref>\n\n===Failed coup, and exile in London (1836\u20131840)===\n[[File:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1836.JPG|thumb|Louis Napoleon at the time of his failed coup in 1836]]\n\"I believe,\" Louis Napoleon wrote, \"that from time to time, men are created whom I call volunteers of providence, in whose hands are placed the destiny of their countries. I believe I am one of those men. If I am wrong, I can perish uselessly. If I am right, then providence will put me into a position to fulfill my mission.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 68</ref> He had seen the popular enthusiasm for Napoleon Bonaparte when he was in Paris, and he was convinced that, if he marched to Paris, as Napoleon Bonaparte had done in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]], France would rise up and join him. He began to plan a coup against King Louis-Philippe.\n\n[[File:Soul\u00e8vement Strasbourg Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1836.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis Napoleon launching his failed coup in Strasbourg in 1836]]\nHe planned for his uprising to begin in [[Strasbourg]]. The colonel of a regiment was brought over to the cause. On 29 October 1836, Louis Napoleon arrived in Strasbourg, in the uniform of an artillery officer, and rallied the regiment to his side. The [[prefecture]] was seized, and the [[prefect]] arrested. Unfortunately for Louis-Napoleon, the general commanding the garrison escaped and called in a loyal regiment, which surrounded the mutineers. The mutineers surrendered and Louis-Napoleon fled back to Switzerland.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 97\u2013100</ref>\n\n===Travel===\nKing Louis-Philippe demanded that the Swiss government return Louis Napoleon to France, but the Swiss pointed out that he was a Swiss soldier and citizen, and refused to hand him over. Louis-Philippe responded by sending an army to the Swiss border. Louis Napoleon thanked his Swiss hosts, and voluntarily left the country. The other mutineers were put on trial in [[Alsace]], and were all acquitted.\n\nLouis Napoleon traveled first to London, then to Brazil, and then to New York. He moved into a hotel, where he met the elite of New York society and the writer [[Washington Irving]]. While he was traveling to see more of the United States, he received word that his mother was very ill. He hurried as quickly as he could back to Switzerland. He reached Arenenberg in time to be with his mother on 5 October 1837, when she died. She was finally buried in [[Reuil]], in France, next to her mother, on 11 January 1838, but Louis Napoleon could not attend, because he was not allowed into France.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 107\u201308</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon returned to London for a new period of exile in October 1838. He had inherited a large fortune from his mother and took a house with seventeen servants and several of his old friends and fellow conspirators. He was received by London society and met the political and scientific leaders of the day, including [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Michael Faraday]]. He also did considerable research into the economy of Britain. He strolled in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], which he later used as a model when he created the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\n===Second coup, prison, escape and exile (1840\u20131848)===\n\nLiving in the comfort of London, he had not given up the dream of returning to France to seize power. In the summer of 1840 he bought weapons and uniforms and had proclamations printed, gathered a contingent of about sixty armed men, hired a ship called the ''Edinburgh-Castle'', and on 6 August 1840, sailed across the [[English Channel|Channel]] to the port of [[Boulogne]]. The attempted coup turned into an even greater fiasco than the Strasbourg mutiny. The mutineers were stopped by the customs agents, the soldiers of the garrison refused to join, the mutineers were surrounded on the beach, one was killed and the others arrested. Both the British and French press heaped ridicule on Louis-Napoleon and his plot. The newspaper ''Le Journal des D\u00e9bats'' wrote, \"this surpasses comedy. One doesn't kill crazy people, one just locks them up.\" He was put on trial, where, despite an eloquent defense of his cause, he was sentenced to life in prison in the fortress of [[Ham, Somme|Ham]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] department of northern France.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 122\u201333</ref>\n\n===Activities===\nThe register of the fortress Ham for 7 October 1840 contained a concise description of the new prisoner: \"Age: thirty-two years. Height: one meter sixty-six. Hair and eyebrows: chestnut. Eyes: Gray and small. Nose: large. Mouth: ordinary. Beard: brown. Moustache: blond. Chin: pointed. Face: oval. Complexion: pale. Head: sunken in his shoulders, and large shoulders. Back: bent. Lips: thick.\"<ref>Quoted in S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 81</ref> He had a mistress named \u00c9l\u00e9onore Vergeot, a young woman from the nearby town, who gave birth to two of his children.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 83</ref>\n\nWhile in prison, he wrote poems, political essays, and articles on diverse topics. He contributed articles to regional newspapers and magazines in towns all over France, becoming quite well known as a writer. His most famous book was ''L'extinction du pauperisme'' (1844), a study of the causes of poverty in the French industrial working class, with proposals to eliminate it. His conclusion: \"The working class has nothing, it is necessary to give them ownership. They have no other wealth than their own labor, it is necessary to give them work that will benefit all....they are without organization and without connections, without rights and without a future; it is necessary to give them rights and a future and to raise them in their own eyes by association, education, and discipline.\" He proposed various practical ideas for creating a banking and savings system that would provide credit to the working class, and to establish agricultural colonies similar to the kibutzes later founded in Israel.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 89. Translated by D. Siefkin</ref> This book was widely reprinted and circulated in France, and played an important part in his future electoral success.\n\nHe was busy in prison, but also unhappy and impatient. He was aware that the popularity of Napoleon Bonaparte was steadily increasing in France; the Emperor was the subject of heroic poems, books and plays. Huge crowds had gathered in Paris on 15 December 1840 when the [[Retour des cendres|remains of Napoleon]] Bonaparte were returned with great ceremony to Paris and handed over to Louis Napoleon's old enemy, King Louis-Philippe, while Louis Napoleon could only read about it in prison. On 25 May 1846, with the assistance of his doctor and other friends on the outside, he disguised himself as a laborer carrying lumber, and walked out of the prison. His enemies later derisively called him \"Badinguet\", the name of the laborer whose identity he had assumed. A carriage was waiting to take him to the coast and then by boat to England. A month after his escape, his father Louis died, making Louis Napoleon the clear heir to the Bonaparte dynasty.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 93</ref>\n\n===Return and early affairs===\nHe quickly resumed his place in British society. He lived on King Street in St James's, London, went to the theatre and hunted, renewed his acquaintance with Benjamin Disraeli, and met [[Charles Dickens]]. He went back to his studies at the British Museum. He had an affair with the actress [[Rachel (actress)|Rachel]], the most famous French actress of the period, during her tours to Britain. More important for his future career, he had an affair with the wealthy heiress [[Harriet Howard]] (1823\u20131865). They met in 1846, soon after his return to Britain. They began to live together, she took in his two illegitimate children and raised them with her own son, and she provided financing for his political plans so that, when the moment came, he could return to France.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte \u00e0 Boulogne (D\u00e9barquement en Ao\u00fbt 1840).JPG|Louis Napoleon's 1840 attempt to lead an uprising against Louis-Philippe ended in fiasco and ridicule.

He spoke rarely in the Assembly, but, because of his name, had enormous popularity in the country.]]\n\nIn February 1848, Louis Napoleon learned that the [[French Revolution of 1848]] had broken out, and that Louis-Philippe, faced with opposition within his government and army, had abdicated. Believing that his time had finally come, he set out for Paris on 27 February, departing England on the same day that Louis-Philippe left France for his own exile in England. When he arrived in Paris, he found that the Second Republic had been declared, led by a Provisional Government headed by a Commission led by [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], and that different factions of republicans, from conservatives to those on the far left, were competing for power. He wrote to Lamartine announcing his arrival, saying that he \"was without any other ambition than that of serving my country\". Lamartine wrote back politely but firmly, asking Louis-Napoleon to leave Paris \"until the city is more calm, and not before the elections for the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]\". His close advisors urged him to stay and try to take power, but he wanted to show his prudence and loyalty to the Republic; while his advisors remained in Paris, he returned to London on 2 March 1848 and watched events from there.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 102</ref>\n\nHe did not run in the first elections for the National Assembly, held in April 1848, but three members of the Bonaparte family, [[Jerome Bonaparte|J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], [[Pierre Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], and [[Prince Lucien Murat|Lucien Murat]] were elected; the name Bonaparte still had political power. In the next elections, on 4 June, where candidates could run in multiple departments, he was elected in four different departments; in Paris, he was among the top five candidates, just after the conservative leader [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. His followers were mostly on the left, from the peasantry and working class. His pamphlet on \"The Extinction of Pauperism\" was widely circulated in Paris, and his name was cheered with those of the socialist candidates [[Armand Barb\u00e8s|Barb\u00e8s]] and [[Louis Blanc]].<ref>'S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 105</ref>\n\nThe [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] leaders of the provisional government, Lamartine and [[Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Cavaignac|Cavaignac]], considered arresting him as a dangerous revolutionary, but once again he outmaneuvered them. He wrote to the President of the Provisional Government: \"I believe I should wait to return to the heart of my country, so that my presence in France will not serve as a pretext to the enemies of the Republic.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 106</ref>\n\nIn June 1848, the [[June Days Uprising]] broke out in Paris, led by the far left, against the conservative majority in the National Assembly. Hundreds of barricades appeared in the working-class neighborhoods. General Cavaignac, the leader of the army, first withdrew his soldiers from Paris to allow the insurgents to deploy their barricades, and then returned with overwhelming force to crush the uprising; from 24 to 26 June, there were battles in the streets of the working class districts of Paris. An estimated five thousand insurgents were killed at the barricades, fifteen thousand were arrested, and four thousand deported.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 108\u201309</ref>\n\nHis absence from Paris meant that Louis Napoleon was not connected either with the uprising, or with the brutal repression that had followed. He was still in London on 17\u201318 September, when the elections for the National Assembly were held, but he was a candidate in thirteen departments. He was elected in five departments; in Paris, he received 110,000 votes of the 247,000 cast, the highest number of votes of any candidate. He returned to Paris on 24 September, and this time he took his place in the National Assembly. In seven months, he had gone from a political exile in London to a highly visible place in the National Assembly, as the government finished the [[French Constitution of 1848|new Constitution]] and prepared for the first election ever of a President of the French Republic.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 182</ref>\n\n===Presidential election of 1848===\n{{further|French presidential election, 1848}}\n[[File:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte pr\u00e9sident.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Louis Napoleon captured 74.2 percent of votes cast in the first French direct presidential elections in 1848.]]\nThe new constitution of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], drafted by a commission including [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], called for a strong executive and a president elected by popular vote through universal male suffrage, rather than chosen by the National Assembly.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 111</ref> The [[1848 French presidential election|elections]] were scheduled for 10\u201311 December 1848. Louis Napoleon promptly announced his candidacy. There were four other candidates for the post: General Cavaignac, who had led the suppression of the June uprisings in Paris; Lamartine, the poet-philosopher and leader of the provisional government; [[Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin]], the leader of the socialists; and [[Raspail]], the leader of the far left wing of the socialists.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 182\u201390</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon established his campaign headquarters and residence at the Hotel du Rhin on [[Place Vend\u00f4me]]. He was accompanied by his companion, Harriet Howard, who gave him a large loan to help finance his campaign. He rarely went to the sessions of the National Assembly and rarely voted. He was not a gifted orator; he spoke slowly, in a monotone, with a slight German accent from his Swiss education. His opponents sometimes ridiculed him, one comparing him to \"a turkey who believes he's an eagle\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 115</ref>\n\nHis campaign appealed to both the left and right. His election manifesto proclaimed his support for \"religion, family, property, the eternal basis of all social order\". But it also announced his intent \"to give work to those unoccupied; to look out for the old age of the workers; to introduce in industrial laws those improvements which don't ruin the rich, but which bring about the well-being of each and the prosperity of all\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 125</ref>\n\nHis campaign agents, many of them veterans from Napoleon Bonaparte's army, raised support for him around the country. Louis Napoleon won the grudging endorsement of the conservative leader [[Adolphe Thiers]], who believed he could be the most easily controlled; Thiers called him \"of all the candidates, the least bad\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 123</ref> He won the backing of ''L'Evenement'', the newspaper of Victor Hugo, which declared, \"We have confidence in him; he carries a great name.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 124</ref> His chief opponent, General Cavaignac, expected that Louis Napoleon would come in first, but that he would receive less than fifty percent of the vote, which would mean the election would go to the National Assembly, where Cavaignac was certain to win.\n\nThe elections were held on 10\u201311 December. Results were announced on 20 December. Louis Napoleon was widely expected to win, but the size of his victory surprised almost everyone. He won 5,572,834 votes, or 74.2 percent of votes cast, compared with 1,469,156 for Cavaignac. The socialist Ledru-Rollin received 376,834; the extreme left candidate Raspail 37,106, and the poet Lamartine only 17,000 votes. Louis Napoleon won the support of all segments of the population: the peasants unhappy with rising prices; unemployed workers; small businessmen who wanted prosperity and order; and intellectuals such as Victor Hugo. He won the votes of 55.6 percent of all registered voters, and won in all but four of France's departments.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 189\u201390</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Election france 1848.jpg|The 1848 presidential campaign pitted Louis Napoleon against General Cavaignac, the Minister of Defense of the Provisional Government, and the leaders of the socialists.\nFile:Extinction du Paup\u00e9risme par Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1.jpeg|Louis Napoleon's essay, \"The Extinction of Pauperism\", advocating reforms to help the working class, was widely circulated during the 1848 election campaign.\n</gallery>\n\n===Prince-President (1848\u20131851)===\nLouis Napoleon moved his residence to the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] at the end of December 1848 and immediately hung a portrait of his mother in the boudoir and a portrait of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, in his coronation robes, in the grand salon. Adolphe Thiers recommended that he wear clothing of \"democratic simplicity,\" but, following the model of his uncle, he chose instead the uniform of the General-in-Chief of the National Guard, and chose the title of \"Prince-President\".<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 194\">Milza, 2006, p. 194</ref>\n[[File:AdolpheThiersParNadarjpeg.jpg|thumb|[[Adolphe Thiers]] (1797\u20131877), leader of the conservative republicans in the National Assembly, reluctantly supported Louis Napoleon in the 1848 elections and became his bitter opponent during the Second Republic.]]\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois-Vincent Raspail 01.jpg|thumb|[[Fran\u00e7ois-Vincent Raspail]], leader of the left wing of the socialist deputies in the Second Republic, who led an attempt to overthrow Louis Napoleon's government in March 1849]]\nHe also made his first venture into foreign policy, in Italy, where as a youth he had joined in the patriotic uprising against the Austrians. The previous government had sent an expeditionary force to Rome to help restore the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal authority]] of [[Pope Pius IX]], who was being threatened by the troops of the Italian republicans [[Mazzini]] and [[Garibaldi]]. The French troops came under fire from Garibaldi's soldiers. The Prince-President, without consulting his ministers, ordered his soldiers to fight if needed in support of the Pope. This was very popular with French Catholics, but infuriated the republicans, who supported Garibaldi.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 194\"/> To please the radical republicans, he asked the Pope to introduce liberal reforms and the ''[[Code Napoleon]]'' to the [[Papal States]]. To gain support from the Catholics, he approved the ''[[Loi Falloux]]'' in 1851, which restored a greater role for the Catholic Church in the French educational system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger Price|title=Napol\u00e9on III and the Second Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqd6MdOYZkwC&pg=PA16|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=16|isbn=978-0203134245}}</ref>\n\nElections were held for the [[1849 French legislative election|National Assembly on 13\u201314 May 1849]], only a few months after Louis Napoleon had become President, and were largely won by a coalition of conservative republicans\u2014which Catholics and monarchists called \"The [[Party of Order]]\"\u2014led by Adolphe Thiers. The socialists and \"red\" republicans, led by Ledru-Rollin and Raspail, also did well, winning two hundred seats. The moderate republicans, in the middle, did very badly, taking just 70-80 seats. The Party of Order had a clear majority, enough to block any initiatives of Louis Napoleon.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 208\u201309</ref>\n\nOn 11 June 1849 the socialists and radical republicans made [[French demonstration of 15 May 1848|an attempt to seize power]]. Ledru-Rollin, from his headquarters in the [[Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers|Conservatory of Arts and Professions]], declared that Louis Napoleon was no longer President and called for a general uprising. A few barricades appeared in the working-class neighborhoods of Paris. Louis Napoleon acted swiftly, and the uprising was short-lived. Paris was declared in a state of siege, the headquarters of the uprising was surrounded, and the leaders arrested. Ledru-Rollin fled to England, Raspail was arrested and sent to prison, the republican clubs were closed, and their newspapers closed down.\n\nThe National Assembly, now without the left republicans and determined to keep them out forever, proposed a new election law that placed restrictions on universal male suffrage, imposing a three-year residency requirement. This new law excluded 3.5 of 9 million French voters, the voters that the leader of the Party of Order, Adolphe Thiers, scornfully called \"the vile multitude\".<ref>Cobban, p. 155</ref> This new election law was passed in May 1850 by a majority of 433 to 241, putting the National Assembly on a direct collision course with the Prince-President.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ronald Aminzade|title=Ballots and Barricades: Class Formation and Republican Politics in France, 1830\u20131871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTbybLDLPiAC&pg=PA299|year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=299|isbn=978-0691028712}}</ref> Louis Napoleon broke with the Assembly and the conservative ministers opposing his projects in favour of the dispossessed. He secured the support of the army, toured the country making populist speeches that condemned the Assembly, and presented himself as the protector of universal male suffrage. He demanded that the law be changed, but his proposal was defeated in the Assembly by a vote of 355 to 348.<ref>Cobban, p. 156</ref>\n\nAccording to the Constitution of 1848, he had to step down at the end of his term, so Louis Napoleon sought a constitutional amendment to allow him to succeed himself, arguing that four years were not enough to fully implement his political and economic program. He toured the country and gained support from many of the regional governments and many within the Assembly. The vote in July 1851 was 446 to 278 in favor of changing the law and allowing him to run again, but this was short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Stevens Cabot Abbott|title=The history of Napoleon III., emperor of the French|publisher=B.B.

His half-brother Morny and a few close advisors quietly began to organize [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They brought Major General [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud]], a former captain from the [[French Foreign Legion]] and a commander of French forces in Algeria, and other officers from the French army in North Africa, to provide military backing for the coup. The date set for the coup was 2 December, the anniversary of the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] and the anniversary of the [[coronation of Napoleon I|coronation of Louis Napoleon's uncle Napoleon I]]. On the night of 1\u20132 December, Saint Arnaud's soldiers quietly occupied the national printing office, the [[Palais Bourbon]], newspaper offices, and the strategic points in the city. In the morning, Parisians found posters around the city announcing the dissolution of the National Assembly, the restoration of universal suffrage, new elections, and a state of siege in Paris and the surrounding departments. Sixteen members of the National Assembly were arrested in their homes. When about 220 deputies of the moderate right gathered at the city hall of the [[10th arrondissement of Paris|10th arrondissement]], they were also arrested.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 255</ref> On 3 December, writer [[Victor Hugo]] and a few other republicans tried to organize an opposition to the coup. A few barricades appeared, and about 1,000 insurgents came out in the streets, but the army moved in force with 30,000 troops and the uprisings were swiftly crushed, with the killing of an estimated 300 to 400 opponents of the coup.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 261</ref> There were also small uprisings in the more militant red republican towns in the south and center of France, but these were all put down by 10 December.<ref>Cobban, pp. 157\u201358</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon followed the [[self-coup]] by a period of repression of his opponents, aimed mostly at the red republicans. About 26,000 people were arrested, including 4,000 in Paris alone. The 239 inmates who were judged most severely were sent to the penal colony in [[Cayenne]].<ref>Cobban, p. 158</ref> 9,530 followers were sent to [[French Algeria]], 1,500 were expelled from France, and another 3,000 were given forced residence away from their homes.<ref>Cobban and Milza</ref> Soon afterwards, a commission of revision freed 3,500 of those sentenced. In 1859, the remaining 1800 prisoners and exiles were amnestied, with the exception of the republican leader Ledru-Rollin, who was released from prison but required to leave the country.<ref>Cobban, p 158</ref>\n\nStrict press censorship was enacted by a decree from 17 February 1852.

Work began on [[French Constitution of 1852|the new document]] in 1852. It was officially prepared by a committee of eighty experts, but was actually drafted by a small group of the Prince-President's inner circle. Under the new constitution, Louis-Napoleon was automatically reelected as president. Under Article Two, the president could now serve an unlimited number of 10-year terms. He alone was given the authority to declare war, sign treaties, form alliances and initiate laws. The Constitution re-established universal male [[suffrage]], and also retained a National Assembly, but with reduced authority.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 277</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon's government imposed new authoritarian measures to control dissent and reduce the power of the opposition. One of his first acts was to settle scores with his old enemy, King Louis-Philippe, who had sent him to prison for life, and who had died in 1850. A decree on 23 January 1852 forbade the late King's family to own property in France and annulled the inheritance he had given to his children before he became King.\n\nThe National Guard, whose members had sometimes joined anti-government demonstrations, was re-organized and largely used only in parades. Government officials were required to wear uniforms at official formal occasions. The Minister of Education was given the power to dismiss professors at the universities and review the content of their courses. Students at the universities were forbidden to wear beards, seen as a symbol of republicanism.<ref name=\"Milsa, Pierre pg. 279\">Milza, 2006, p. 279</ref>\n\n[[File:Gustave Le Gray, Louis-Napol\u00e9on, Prince-President of the Republic, 1852.jpg|thumb|Photographic portrait of Louis Napoleon (1852) by [[Gustave Le Gray]]]]\nAn election was held for a new National Assembly on 29 February 1852, and all the resources of the government were used on behalf of the candidates backing the Prince-President. Of eight million eligible voters, 5,200,000 votes went to the official candidates and 800,000 to opposition candidates. About one third of the eligible voters abstained. The new Assembly included a small number of opponents of Louis Napoleon, including 17 monarchists, 18 conservatives, two liberal democrats, three republicans and 72 independents.<ref>Milsa, 2006, p. 279</ref>\n\nDespite now holding all governing power in the nation, Louis Napoleon was not content with being an authoritarian president. The ink had barely dried on the new, severely authoritarian constitution when he set about making himself emperor. Following the election, the Prince-President went on a triumphal national tour. In Marseille, he laid the cornerstone of a new cathedral, a new stock exchange, and a chamber of commerce. In Bordeaux, on 9 October 1852, he gave his principal speech:\n:Some people say the Empire is war. I say the Empire is peace. Like the Emperor I have many conquests to make\u2026 Like him I wish \u2026 to draw into the stream of the great popular river those hostile side-currents which lose themselves without profit to anyone. We have immense unplowed territories to cultivate; roads to open; ports to dig; rivers to be made navigable; canals to finish, a railway network to complete. We have, in front of Marseille, a vast kingdom to assimilate into France. We have all the great ports of the west to connect with the American continent by modern communications, which we still lack. We have ruins to repair, false gods to tear down, truths which we need to make triumph. This is how I see the Empire, if the Empire is re-established. These are the conquests I am considering, and you around me, who, like me, want the good of our country, you are my soldiers.\"<ref>Speech of 9 October in Bordeaux, published in ''Le Moniteur''.

During his reign, the railway network of France expanded from 3&nbsp;500 kilometers to 20&nbsp;000 kilometers.]]\n[[File:Printemps haussmann1.JPG|thumb|Among the commercial innovations encouraged by Napoleon III were the first department stores. [[Bon March\u00e9]] opened in 1852, followed by Au Printemps in 1865.]]\n\nOne of the first priorities of Napoleon III was the modernization of the French economy, which had fallen far behind that of the United Kingdom and some of the German states. Political economics had long been a passion of the Emperor. While in Britain, he had visited factories and railway yards, and in prison, he had studied and written about the sugar industry and policies to reduce poverty. He wanted the government to play an active, not a passive, role in the economy. In 1839, he had written: \"Government is not a necessary evil, as some people claim; it is instead the benevolent motor for the whole social organism.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 468</ref> He did not advocate the government getting directly involved in industry. Instead, the government took a very active role in building the infrastructure for economic growth; stimulating the stock market and investment banks to provide credit; building railways, ports, canals and roads; and providing training and education. He also opened up French markets to foreign goods, such as railway tracks from England, forcing French industry to become more efficient and more competitive.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 467\u201369</ref>\n\nThe period was favorable for industrial expansion. The gold rushes in [[California Gold Rush|California]] and [[Victorian gold rush|Australia]] increased the European money supply. In the early years of the Empire, the economy also benefited from the coming of age of those born during the baby boom of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] period.<ref>{{harvnb|Plessis|1989|pp=60\u201361}}</ref> The steady rise of prices caused by the increase of the money supply encouraged company promotion and investment of capital.\n\nBeginning in 1852, Napoleon III encouraged the creation of new banks, such as [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier]], which sold shares to the public and provided loans to both private industry and to the government. [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] was founded in 1863 and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] in 1864. These banks provided the funding for Napoleon III's major projects, from railway and canals to the rebuilding of Paris.\n\nIn 1851, France had only 3,500 kilometers of railway, compared with 10,000 kilometers in England and 800 kilometers in [[Belgium]], a country one-twentieth the size of France. Within days of the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851, Napoleon III's Minister of Public Works launched a project to build a railway line around Paris, connecting the different independent lines coming into Paris from around the country. The government provided guarantees for loans to build new lines and urged railway companies to consolidate. There were 18 railway companies in 1848 and six at the end of the Empire. By 1870, France had 20,000 kilometers of railway linked to the French ports and to the railway systems of the neighbouring countries that carried over 100 million passengers a year and transported the products of France's new steel mills, mines and factories.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 471\u201374</ref>\n\n====Development of steamships and early reconstruction on Paris====\n[[File:Travaux nocturnes des constructions de la rue de Rivoli, \u00e9clair\u00e9s par la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique.jpg|thumb|Enormous public works projects reconstructed the center of Paris. Here, work to extend the Rue de Rivoli continues at night by electric light (1854).]]\n\nNew shipping lines were created and ports rebuilt in [[Marseille]] and [[Le Havre]], which connected France by sea to the US, Latin America, North Africa and the Far East. During the Empire, the number of steamships tripled, and by 1870, France possessed the second-largest maritime fleet in the world after England.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 475</ref> Napoleon III backed the greatest maritime project of the age, the construction of the [[Suez Canal]] between 1859 and 1869. The canal project was funded by shares on the [[Paris Bourse|Paris stock market]] and led by a former French diplomat, [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. It was opened by the Empress [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Eug\u00e9nie]] with a performance of [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Aida]].''<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 474</ref>\n\nThe rebuilding of central Paris also encouraged commercial expansion and innovation. The first department store, [[Bon March\u00e9]], opened in Paris in 1852 in a modest building and expanded rapidly, its income increasing from 450,000 francs a year to 20 million. Its founder, [[Aristide Boucicaut]], commissioned a new glass and iron building designed by [[Louis-Charles Boileau]] and [[Gustave Eiffel]] that opened in 1869 and became the model for the modern [[department store]]. Other department stores quickly appeared: [[Printemps|Au Printemps]] in 1865 and [[La Samaritaine]] in 1870. They were soon imitated around the world.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 486</ref>\n\nNapoleon III's program also included reclaiming farmland and reforestation. One such project in the [[Gironde|Gironde department]] drained and reforested 10,000 square kilometers (3,900 square miles) of moorland, creating the [[Landes forest]], the largest maritime pine forest in Europe.\n\n===Reconstruction of Paris (1854\u20131870)===\n{{Main|Haussmann's renovation of Paris}}\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - Avenue de l'Opera - Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts Reims.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra]], one of the new boulevards created by Napoleon III. The new buildings on the boulevards were required to be all of the same height and same basic facade design, and all faced with cream coloured stone, giving the city center its distinctive harmony.]]\nNapoleon III began his regime by launching a series of enormous public works projects in Paris, hiring tens of thousands of workers to improve the sanitation, water supply and traffic circulation of the city. To direct this task, he named a new prefect of the [[Seine department]], [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], and gave him extraordinary powers to rebuild the center of the city. He installed a large map of Paris in a central position in his office, and he and Haussmann planned the new Paris.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice (2009), ''Les jardins du Baron Haussmann'', p. 15</ref>\n\nThe population of Paris had doubled since 1815, with neither an increase in its area nor a development of its structure of very narrow medieval streets and alleys.\n\nTo accommodate the growing population and those who would be forced from the center by the construction of new boulevards and squares, Napoleon III issued a decree in 1860 to [[Municipal annexation|annex]] eleven [[Communes of France|communes]] (municipalities) on the outskirts of Paris and increase the number of [[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]] (city boroughs) from twelve to twenty. Paris was thus enlarged to its modern boundaries with the exception of the two major city parks ([[Bois de Boulogne]] and [[Bois de Vincennes]]) that only became part of the French capital in 1920.\n\nFor the duration of Napoleon III's reign and a decade afterwards, most of Paris was an enormous construction site. His hydraulic chief engineer, [[Eug\u00e8ne Belgrand]], built a new aqueduct to bring clean water from the [[Vanne (river)|Vanne River]] in the [[Champagne (province)|Champagne region]], and a new huge reservoir near the future [[Parc Montsouris]]. These two works increased the water supply of Paris from 87,000 to 400,000 cubic meters of water a day.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice (2009), ''Les jardins du Baron Haussmann'' p. 21</ref> Hundreds of kilometers of pipes distributed the water throughout the city, and a second network, using the less-clean water from the [[Ourcq]] and the [[Seine]], washed the streets and watered the new park and gardens. He completely rebuilt the [[Paris sewers]] and installed miles of pipes to distribute gas for thousands of new [[streetlight]]s along the Paris streets.<ref>Milza, 2006</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1854, in the center of the city, Haussmann's workers tore down hundreds of old buildings and constructed new avenues to connect the central points of the city. Buildings along these avenues were required to be the same height, constructed in a architectural similar style, and be faced with cream-coloured stone to create the signature look of Paris boulevards.\n\nNapoleon III built two new railway stations: the [[Gare de Lyon]] (1855) and the [[Gare du Nord]] (1865). He completed [[Les Halles]], the great cast iron and glass pavilioned produce market in the center of the city, and built a new municipal hospital, the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu, Paris|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]], in the place of crumbling medieval buildings on the [[Ile de la Cit\u00e9]]. The signature architectural landmark was the [[Paris Opera]], the largest theater in the world, designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] to crown the center of Napoleon III's new Paris.<ref>Ayers, Andrew (2004). ''The Architecture of Paris''. Stuttgart; London: Edition Axel Menges. {{ISBN|978-3-930698-96-7}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon III also wanted to build new parks and gardens for the recreation and relaxation of the Parisians, particularly those in the new neighbourhoods of the expanding city.<ref name=\"Jarrasse, Dominique 2007\">Jarrasse, Dominique (2007), ''Grammaire des jardins parisiens'', Parigramme</ref>\n\nNapoleon III's new parks were inspired by his memories of the parks in London, especially [[Hyde Park (London)|Hyde Park]], where he had strolled and promenaded in a carriage while in exile; but he wanted to build on a much larger scale. Working with Haussmann and [[Jean-Charles Alphand]], the engineer who headed the new Service of Promenades and Plantations, he laid out a plan for four major parks at the cardinal points of the compass around the city. Thousands of workers and gardeners began to dig lakes, build cascades, plant lawns, flowerbeds and trees, and construct chalets and grottoes. Napoleon III transformed the [[Bois de Boulogne]] into a park (1852\u201358) to the west of Paris. To the east, he created the [[Bois de Vincennes]] (1860\u201365), and to the north, the [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]] (1865\u201367). The [[Parc Montsouris]] (1865\u201378) was created to the south.<ref name=\"Jarrasse, Dominique 2007\"/>\n\nIn addition to building the four large parks, Napoleon had the city's older parks, including the [[Parc Monceau]], formerly owned by the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans family]], and the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]], refurbished and replanted. He also created some twenty small parks and gardens in the neighbourhoods as miniature versions of his large parks. Alphand termed these small parks \"green and flowering salons\". The intention of Napoleon's plan was to have one park in each of the eighty \"quartiers\" (neighbourhoods) of Paris, so that no one was more than a ten-minute walk from such a park. The parks were an immediate success with all classes of Parisians.<ref>Jarrasse, Dominque (2007), Grammmaire des jardins Parisiens, Parigramme. p. 134</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Adolphe Yvon - Haussmann pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'Empereur le plan d'annexion des Communes.jpg|[[Baron Haussmann]] and Napoleon III make official the annexation of eleven communes around Paris to the City.

He was still attached to his companion [[Harriet Howard]], who attended receptions at the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] and traveled around France with him. He quietly sent a diplomatic delegation to approach the family of Princess [[Carola of Vasa]], the granddaughter of deposed King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]]. They declined because of his Catholic religion and the political uncertainty about his future, as did the family of [[Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]], a niece of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nLouis-Napoleon finally announced that he found the right woman: a Spaniard called [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Eug\u00e9nie du Derje de Montijo]], age 23, 20th [[Count of Teba|Countess of Teba]] and 15th Marchioness of [[Ardales]]. She received much of her education in Paris. Her beauty attracted Louis-Napoleon, who, as was his custom, tried to seduce her, but Eug\u00e9nie told him to wait for marriage. The civil ceremony took place at [[Tuileries Palace]] on 22 January 1853, and a much grander ceremony was held a few days later at the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. In 1856, Eug\u00e9nie gave birth to a son and heir-apparent, [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 199\u2013204</ref>\n\n[[File:Empress Eugenie with her son 1862.jpg|thumb|Eug\u00e9nie and the Prince Imperial in 1862]]\n\nWith an heir to the throne secured, Napoleon III resumed his \"petites distractions\" with other women. Eug\u00e9nie faithfully performed the duties of an empress, entertaining guests and accompanying the Emperor to balls, opera, and theater. She traveled to Egypt to open the [[Suez Canal]] and officially represented him whenever he traveled outside France.\n\nThough a fervent Catholic and conservative on many other issues, she strongly advocated equality for women. She pressured the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]] to give the first [[baccalaur\u00e9at|baccalaureate]] diploma to a woman and tried unsuccessfully to induce the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] to elect the writer [[George Sand]] as its first female member.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 204\u201310</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy (1852\u20131860)==\nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world as a supporter of [[popular sovereignty]] and [[nationalism]].<ref>John B.

He was, however, determined to follow a strong foreign policy to extend France's influence and warned that he would not stand by and allow another European power to threaten its neighbour.\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, he was also an advocate of a new \"principle of nationalities\" (''principe des nationalit\u00e9s'') that supported the creation of new states [[nation-state|based on nationality]], such as Italy, in place of the old multinational empires, such as the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (or [[Empire of Austria]], known since 1867 as [[Austria-Hungary]]). In this he was influenced by his uncle's policy as described in the ''M\u00e9morial de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne''. In all of his foreign policy ventures, he put the interests of France first.

[[John Thadeus Delane|John Delane]], editor of ''[[The Times]]'', visited France in January 1853 and was impressed by its military preparedness. He expressed his conviction that \"Louis-Napoleon was resolved on a forward foreign policy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/articles/palmerstons-follies-a-reply-to-the-french-threat/|title='Palmerston's Follies': a reply to the French 'threat'|last=Hicks|first=Peter|date=2016|website=NAPOLEON.org \u2013 The History Website of the Fondation Napoleon|access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref> Napoleon III was actually determined to increase the country\u2019s naval power. The first purpose-built steam-powered battleship (worryingly christened after [[French battleship Napol\u00e9on|Napoleon I]]) was launched in 1850, and the fortification of [[Cherbourg-en-Cotentin|Cherbourg]] was strengthened. This led to the extension of the breakwater of [[Alderney]] and the construction of [[Fort Clonque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/fort-clonque-7423|title=Fort Clonque Alderney, Channel Islands|date=2018|website=The Landmark Trust|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrom the start of his Empire, Napoleon III sought an alliance with Britain. He had lived there while in exile and saw Britain as a natural partner in the projects he wished to accomplish. An opportunity soon presented itself: In early 1853, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] put pressure on the weak [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] government, demanding that the [[Ottoman Empire]] give Russia a protectorate over the Christian countries of the [[Balkans]] as well as control over [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Dardanelles]]. The Ottoman Empire, backed by Britain and France, refused Russia's demands, and a joint British-French fleet was sent to support the Ottoman Empire. When Russia refused to leave the [[Romania|Romanian territories]] it had occupied, Britain and France declared war on 27 March 1854.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 382-386\">Milza, 2006, pp. 382\u201386</ref>\n\nIt took France and Britain six months to organize a full-scale military expedition to the [[Black Sea]]. The Anglo-French fleet landed thirty thousand French and twenty thousand British soldiers in the [[Crimea]] on 14 September and began to [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)|lay siege]] to the major Russian port of [[Sevastopol]]. As the siege dragged on, the French and British armies were reinforced and troops from the Kingdom of Sardinia joined them, reaching a total of 140,000 soldiers, but they suffered terribly from epidemics of [[typhus]], [[dysentery]], and [[cholera]]. During the 332 days of the siege, the French lost 95,000 soldiers, including 75,000 due to disease. The suffering of the army in the Crimea was carefully concealed from the French public by press censorship.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 388\u201389</ref>\n\n[[File:Courtine de Malakoff, 8 septembre 1855 par Adolphe Yvon.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Malakoff]], 8 September 1855]]\nThe death of Tsar Nicholas I on 2 March 1855 and his replacement by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] changed the political equation. In September, after a massive bombardment, the Anglo-French army of fifty thousand men stormed the Russian positions, and the Russians were forced to evacuate Sevastopol. Alexander II sought a political solution, and negotiations were held in Paris in the new building of the French Foreign Ministry on the [[Quai d'Orsay]], from 25 February to 8 April 1856.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 382-386\"/>\n\nThe Crimean War added three new place names to Paris: [[Pont de l'Alma|Alma]], named for the first French victory on the river of that name; [[Boulevard de S\u00e9bastopol|Sevastopol]]; and [[Malakoff]], named for a tower in the center of the Russian line [[Battle of Malakoff|captured by the French]]. The war had two important diplomatic consequences: Alexander II became an ally of France, and Britain and France were reconciled. In April 1855, Napoleon III and Eug\u00e9nie went to England and were received by the Queen; in turn, Victoria and Prince Albert visited Paris. Victoria was the first British monarch to do so in centuries.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 392\u201395</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Russia and the alliance with Britain gave France increased authority and prestige in Europe. This was the first war between European powers since the close of the Napoleonic Wars and the [[Congress of Vienna]], marking a breakdown of the alliance system that had maintained peace for nearly half a century. The war also effectively ended the [[Concert of Europe]] and the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]], or \"Waterloo Coalition,\" that the other four powers (Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain) had established. The [[Congress of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Conference of 1856]] represented a high-water mark for Napoleon's regime in foreign affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1975|p=199}}</ref> It encouraged Napoleon III to make an even bolder foreign policy venture in Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan J.

A group of conspirators threw three bombs at the royal carriage as it made its way to the opera. Eight members of the escort and bystanders were killed and over one hundred people injured. The culprits were quickly arrested. The leader was an Italian nationalist, [[Felice Orsini]], who was aided by a French surgeon [[Simon Fran\u00e7ois Bernard|Simon Bernard]]. They believed that if Napoleon III were killed, a republican revolt would immediately follow in France, and the new republican government would help all Italian states win independence from Austria and achieve national unification. Bernard was in London at the time. Since he was a political exile, the British government refused to extradite him, but Orsini was tried, convicted and executed on 13 March 1858. The bombing focused the attention of France, and particularly of Napoleon III, on the issue of Italian nationalism.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 407\u201312</ref>\n\nPart of Italy, particularly the kingdom of [[Piedmont]]-[[Sardinia]] (officially the \"Kingdom of Sardinia\"), was independent, but central Italy was still ruled by the Pope (in this era, [[Pope Pius IX and Italy|Pope Pius IX]]), while [[Venice]], [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy]] and much of the north was [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|ruled by Austria]]. Other states were [[de jure]] independent (e.g. the [[Duchy of Parma]] or the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]) but [[de facto]] totally under Austrian influence. Napoleon III had fought with the Italian patriots against the Austrians when he was young, and his sympathy was with them, but the Empress, most of his government and the Catholic Church in France supported the Pope and the existing governments. The British Government was also hostile to the idea of promoting nationalism in Italy. Despite the opposition in his government and in his own palace, Napoleon III did all that he could to support the cause of Piedmont-Sardinia. The King of Piedmont-Sardinia, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], was invited to Paris in November 1855, and given the same royal treatment as Queen Victoria.\n\n[[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Count Cavour]], the Prime Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia, came to Paris with the King and employed an unusual emissary in his efforts to win the support of Napoleon III: his beautiful young cousin, [[Virginia Oldoini, Countess of Castiglione]] (1837\u201399). As Cavour had hoped, she caught his eye and became his mistress. Between 1855 and 1857, she used the opportunity to pass messages and to plead the Italian cause.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 357\u201362</ref>\n\nIn July 1858, Napoleon arranged a secret visit by Count Cavour. They agreed to join forces and drive the Austrians from Italy. In exchange, Napoleon III asked for Savoy (the ancestral land of the King of Piedmont-Sardinia) and the then bilingual county of Nice, which had been taken from France after Napoleon's fall in 1815 and given to Piedmont-Sardinia. Cavour protested that Nice was Italian, but Napoleon responded that \"these are secondary questions. There will be time later to discuss them.\"<ref>cited in Milza, 2006, p. 414</ref>\n\nAssured of the support of Napoleon III, Count Cavour began to prepare the army of Piedmont-Sardinia for war against Austria. Napoleon III looked for diplomatic support. He approached [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], and the British Government; Britain was against the war, but agreed to remain neutral. Still facing strong opposition within his own government, Napoleon III offered to negotiate a diplomatic solution with the twenty-eight-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] in the spring of 1858. The Austrians demanded the disarmament of Piedmont-Sardinia first, and sent a fleet with thirty thousand soldiers to reinforce their garrisons in Italy. Napoleon III responded on 26 January 1859 by signing a treaty of alliance with Piedmont-Sardinia. Napoleon promised to send two hundred thousand soldiers to help one hundred thousand soldiers from Piedmont-Sardinia to force the Austrians out of northern Italy; in return, France would receive the county of Nice and Savoy provided that their populations would agree in a referendum.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 415\u201320</ref>\n\nIt was the Emperor Franz Joseph, growing impatient, who finally unleashed the war. On 23 April 1859, he sent an ultimatum to the government of Piedmont-Sardinia demanding that they stop their military preparations and disband their army. On 26 April, Count Cavour rejected the demands, and on 27 April, the Austrian army invaded Piedmont.\n\n====War in Italy \u2013 Magenta and Solferino (1859)====\n[[File:Yvon Bataille de Solferino Compiegne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Napoleon III with the French forces at the [[Battle of Solferino]], which secured the Austrian withdrawal from Italy. He was horrified by the casualties, and ended the war soon after the battle.]]\n\nNapoleon III, though he had very little military experience, decided to lead the French army in Italy himself. Part of the French army crossed over the Alps, while the other part, with the Emperor, landed in [[Genoa]] on 18 May 1859. Fortunately for Napoleon and the Piedmontese, the commander of the Austrians, General Giulay, was not very aggressive. His forces greatly outnumbered the Piedmontese army at Turin, but he hesitated, allowing the French and Piedmontese to unite their forces.\n\nNapoleon III wisely left the fighting to his professional generals. The first great battle of the war, on 4 June 1859, [[Battle of Magenta|was fought]] at the town of [[Magenta, Lombardy|Magenta]]. It was long and bloody, and the French center was exhausted and nearly broken, but the battle was finally won by a timely attack on the Austrian flank by the soldiers of General MacMahon. The Austrians had seven thousand men killed and five thousand captured, while the French forces had four thousand men killed. The battle was largely remembered because, soon after it was fought, patriotic chemists in France gave the name of the battle to their newly discovered bright purple chemical dye; the dye and the colour took the name [[magenta]].<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 425</ref>\n\nThe rest of the Austrian army was able to escape while Napoleon III and King Victor Emmanuel made a triumphal entry on 10 June into the city of [[Milan]], previously ruled by the Austrians. They were greeted by huge, jubilant crowds waving Italian and French flags.\n\nThe Austrians had been driven from Lombardy, but the army of General Giulay remained in the region of Venice. His army had been reinforced and numbered 130,000 men, roughly the same as the French and Piedmontese, though the Austrians were superior in artillery. On 24 June, the [[Battle of Solferino|second and decisive battle]] was fought at [[Solferino]]. This battle was even longer and bloodier than Magenta. In confused and often ill-directed fighting, there were approximately forty thousand casualties, including 11,500 French. Napoleon III was horrified by the thousands of dead and wounded on the battlefield. He proposed an armistice to the Austrians, which was accepted on 8 July. A formal treaty ending the war was signed on 11 July 1859.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 427\u201328</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVoSBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=Armistice+of+Villafranca#v=onepage&q=Armistice%20of%20Villafranca&f=false|title=Italy in the Age of the Risorgimento 1790\u20131870|last=Hearder|first=Harry|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317872061|location=|page=226|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCount Cavour and the Piedmontese were bitterly disappointed by the abrupt end of the war. Lombardy had been freed, but [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Venetia]] (the Venice region) was still controlled by the Austrians, and the Pope was still the ruler of Rome and Central Italy. Cavour angrily resigned his post. Napoleon III returned to Paris on 17 July, and a huge parade and celebration were held on 14 August, in front of the [[Place Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me column]], the symbol of the glory of Napoleon I. Napoleon III celebrated the day by granting a general amnesty to the political prisoners and exiles he had chased from France.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 431</ref>\n\nIn Italy, even without the French army, the process of Italian unification launched by Cavour and Napoleon III took on a momentum of its own. There were uprisings in central Italy and the Papal states, and Italian patriots, led by Garibaldi, [[Expedition of the Thousand|invaded and took over]] Sicily, which would lead to the collapse of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Napoleon III wrote to the Pope and suggested that he \"make the sacrifice of your provinces in revolt and confide them to Victor Emmanuel\". The Pope, furious, declared in a public address that Napoleon III was a \"liar and a cheat\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 260</ref> Rome and the surrounding [[Latium]] region remained in Papal hands, and therefore did not immediately become the capital of the newly created Kingdom of Italy, and Venetia was still occupied by the Austrians, but the rest of Italy had come under the rule of Victor Emmanuel.\n\nAs Cavour had promised, Savoy and the county of Nice were annexed by France in 1860 after referendums, although it is disputed how fair they were. In Nice, 25,734 voted for union with France, just 260 against, but Italians still called for its return into the 20th century. On 18 February 1861, the first Italian parliament met in Turin, and on 23 March, Victor Emmanuel was proclaimed King of Italy. Count Cavour died a few weeks later, declaring that \"Italy is made.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 434\u201341</ref>\n\nNapoleon's support for the Italian patriots and his confrontation with Pope Pius IX over who would govern Rome made him unpopular with fervent French Catholics, and even with Empress Eug\u00e9nie, who was a fervent Catholic. To win over the French Catholics and his wife, he agreed to guarantee that Rome would remain under the Pope and independent from the rest of Italy, and agreed to keep French troops there. The capital of Italy became Turin (in 1861) then Florence (in 1865), not Rome. However, in 1862, Garibaldi gathered an army to march on Rome, under the slogan, \"Rome or death\".{{sfn|Briggs|Clavin|2003|page=97}} To avoid a confrontation between Garibaldi and the French soldiers, the Italian government [[Battle of Aspromonte|sent its own soldiers]] to face them, arrested Garibaldi and put him in prison. Napoleon III sought, but was unable to find, a diplomatic solution that would allow him to withdraw French troops from Rome while guaranteeing that the city would remain under Papal control.\n[[File:CousinMontaubanCampaignOf1860.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Cousin-Montauban, Comte de Palikao|Cousin-Montauban]] leading French forces during the [[Second Opium War|Anglo-French expedition to China]]]]\n\nGaribaldi made another attempt to capture Rome in November 1867, but was defeated by the French and Papal troops near the town of [[Mentana]] on 3 November 1867.\n\nThe garrison of eight thousand French troops remained in Rome until August 1870, when they were recalled at the start of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. In September 1870, Garibaldi's soldiers finally entered Rome and made it the capital of Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 325\u201328</ref>\n\nAfter the successful conclusion of the Italian campaign and the annexation of Savoy and Nice to the territory of France, the Continental foreign policy of Napoleon III entered a calmer period. Expeditions to distant corners of the world and the expansion of the Empire replaced major changes in the map of Europe. The Emperor's health declined; he gained weight, he began to dye his hair to cover the gray, he walked slowly because of [[gout]], and in 1864, at the military camp of [[Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne]], he suffered the first medical crisis from his [[gallstones]], the ailment that killed him nine years later. He was less engaged in governing and less attentive to detail, but still sought opportunities to increase French commerce and prestige globally.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 309\u201310</ref>\n\n===Overseas empire===\n{{main|French colonial empire#Napoleon III: 1852\u20131870}}\n\n====Establishing a Mexican empire====\n[[File:Arrival of Marshal Randon in Algier-Ernest-Francis Vacherot mg 5120.jpg|thumb|Arrival of Marshal [[Jacques Louis Randon|Randon]] in [[Algiers]] in 1857]]\n\nIn 1862, Napoleon III [[French intervention in Mexico|sent troops]] to Mexico in an effort to establish an allied monarchy in the Americas, with Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] enthroned as [[Emperor of Mexico|Emperor]] [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]]. The [[Second Mexican Empire]] faced resistance from the republican government of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], however. After victory in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, the United States made clear that France would have to leave. It sent 50,000 troops under General [[Philip H. Sheridan]] to the U.S.-Mexico border and helped resupply Ju\u00e1rez. Napoleon's military was stretched very thin; he had committed 40,000 troops to Mexico, 20,000 to Rome to guard the Pope against the Italians, and another 80,000 in restive Algeria. Furthermore, Prussia, having just defeated Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, was an imminent threat. Napoleon realized his predicament and withdrew his troops from Mexico in 1866. Maximilian was overthrown and executed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Don H.

The palace was given that name because the neighbourhood in which it had been built in 1564 was previously known for its numerous mason and tiler businesses.\n\nNapoleon III's bedroom was decorated with a talisman from [[Charlemagne]] (a symbol of good luck for the Bonaparte family), while his office featured a portrait of [[Julius Caesar]] by [[Ingres]] and a large map of Paris that he used to show his ideas for the reconstruction of Paris to his prefect of the Seine department, [[Baron Haussmann]]. The Emperor's rooms were overheated and were filled with smoke, as he smoked cigarette after cigarette. The Empress occupied a suite of rooms just above his, highly decorated in the style of Louis XVI with a pink salon, a green salon and a blue salon.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 200\u201301</ref>\n\nThe court moved with the Emperor and Empress from palace to palace each year following a regular calendar. At the beginning of May, the Emperor and court moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud]] for outdoor activities in the park. In June and July, they moved with selected guests to the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] for walks in the forest and boating on the lake. In July, the court moved to thermal baths for a health cure, first to [[Plombi\u00e8res]], then to [[Vichy]], and then, after 1856, to the military camp and residence built at [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]] (nowadays: Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne), where Napoleon could take the waters and review military parades and exercises. Beginning in 1856, the Emperor and Empress spent each September in [[Biarritz]] in the [[Villa Eug\u00e9nie]], a large villa overlooking the sea.<ref>[http://thegrandhotelsoftheworld.com/palais/ \"History of the Hotel du Palais, the former Villa Eugenie\"]. Grand Hotels of the World.com</ref> They would walk on the beach or travel to the mountains, and in the evenings they would dance and sing and play cards and take part in other games and amateur theatricals and charades with their guests. In November, the court moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne]] for forest excursions, dancing and more games. Famous scientists and artists, such as [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] and Giuseppe [[Verdi]], were invited to participate in the festivities at Compi\u00e8gne.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 202\u201304</ref>\n\nAt the end of the year the Emperor and Court returned to the Tuileries Palace and gave a series of formal receptions and three or four grand balls with six hundred guests early in the new year. Visiting dignitaries and monarchs were frequently invited. During [[Carnival]], there were a series of very elaborate costume balls on the themes of different countries and different historical periods, for which guests sometimes spent small fortunes on their costumes.\n\n===Visual Arts===\n{{main|Napoleon III style|Paris during the Second Empire}}\n[[File:\u00c9douard Manet - Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|When [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and other [[avant-garde]] paintings were rejected by the [[Paris Salon]] of 1863, Napoleon III ordered that the works be displayed, so that the public could judge for themselves.]]\n\nNapoleon III had conservative and traditional taste in art: his favourite painters were [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]], who received major commissions, and whose work was purchased for state museums. At the same time, he followed public opinion, and he made an important contribution to the French [[avant-garde]]. In 1863, the jury of the [[Paris Salon]], the famous annual showcase of French painting, headed by the ultra-conservative director of the Academy of Fine Arts, Count  [[\u00c9milien de Nieuwerkerke]], refused all submissions by avant-garde artists, including those by [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Johan Jongkind]]. The artists and their friends complained, and the complaints reached Napoleon III. His office issued a statement: \"Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition.

He restored the [[fl\u00e8che]], or spire, of the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], which had been partially destroyed and desecrated during the [[French Revolution]]. In 1855, he completed the restoration, begun in 1845, of the stained glass windows of the [[Sainte-Chapelle]], and in 1862, he declared it a national historical monument. In 1853, he approved and provided funding for Viollet-le-Duc's restoration of the medieval town of [[Carcassonne]]. He also sponsored Viollet-le-Duc's restoration of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]] and the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], In 1862, he closed the prison which had occupied the Abbey of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]] since the French Revolution, where many important political prisoners had been held, so it could be restored and opened to the public.\n\n==Social and economic policies==\n\n===Social policy and reforms===\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Napoleon III launched a series of social reforms aimed at improving the life of the working class. He began with small projects, such as opening up two clinics in Paris for sick and injured workers, a program of legal assistance to those unable to afford it, and subsidies to companies that built low-cost housing for their workers. He outlawed the practice of employers taking possession of or making comments in the work document that every employee was required to carry; negative comments meant that workers were unable to get other jobs. In 1866, he encouraged the creation of a state insurance fund to help workers or peasants who became disabled, and to help their widows and families.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 314</ref>\n\nTo help the working class, Napoleon III offered a prize to anyone who could develop an inexpensive substitute for butter; the prize was won by the French chemist [[Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s]], who in 1869 patented a product he named oleomargarine, later shortened simply to [[margarine]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 313</ref>\n\n====Rights to strike and organize (1864\u20131866)====\n\nHis most important social reform was the 1864 law that gave French workers the right to strike, which had been forbidden since 1810. In 1866, he added to this an \"Edict of Tolerance,\" which gave factory workers the right to organize. He issued a decree regulating the treatment of apprentices, limited working hours on Sundays and holidays, and removed from the [[Napoleonic Code]] the infamous article 1781, which said that the declaration of the employer, even without proof, would be given more weight by the court than the word of the employee.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 314\u201317</ref>\n\n====Education for girls and women, and school reform (1861\u20131869)====\n[[File:J.V Daubi\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|In 1861, through the direct intervention of the Emperor and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie, [[Julie-Victoire Daubi\u00e9]] became the first woman to receive a [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] diploma.]]\n\nNapoleon III and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie worked to give girls and women greater access to public education.

Secondary schools began to teach philosophy, which had been banned by the previous regime at the request of the Catholic church. For the first time, public schools in France began to teach contemporary history, modern languages, art, gymnastics and music. The results of the school reforms were dramatic: in 1852, over 40 percent of army conscripts in France were unable to read or write, yet by 1869, the number had dropped to 25 percent. The rate of illiteracy among both girls and boys dropped to 32 percent.\n<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 592\"/>\n\nAt the university level, Napoleon III founded new faculties in [[Marseille]], [[Douai]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Clermont-Ferrand]] and [[Poitiers]] and founded a network of research institutes of higher studies in the sciences, history, and economics. These also were criticized by the Catholic Church. The Cardinal-Archbishop of Rouen, [[Henri-Marie-Gaston Boisnormand de Bonnechose|Monseigneur Bonnechose]], wrote, \"True science is religious, while false science, on the other hand, is vain and prideful; being unable to explain God, it rebels against him.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 598</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\n\n====Lower tariffs and the opening of French markets (1860)====\nOne of the centerpieces of the economic policy of Napoleon III was the lowering of tariffs and the opening of French markets to imported goods. He had been in Britain in 1846 when Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] had lowered tariffs on imported grains, and he had seen the benefits to British consumers and the British economy. However, he faced bitter opposition from many French industrialists and farmers, who feared British competition. Convinced he was right, he sent his chief economic advisor, [[Michel Chevalier]], to London to begin discussions, and secretly negotiated a [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty|new commercial agreement]] with Britain, calling for the gradual lowering of tariffs in both countries. He signed the treaty, without consulting with the Assembly, on 23 January 1860. Four hundred of the top industrialists in France came to Paris to protest, but he refused to yield. Industrial tariffs on such products as steel rails for railways were lowered first; tariffs on grains were not lowered until June 1861. Similar agreements were negotiated with the Netherlands, Italy, and France's other neighbors. France's industries were forced to modernize and become more efficient to compete with the British, as Napoleon III had intended. Commerce between the countries surged.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 241\u201343</ref>\n\n====Economic expansion and social change====\nBy the 1860s, the huge state investment in railways, infrastructure and fiscal policies of Napoleon III had brought dramatic changes to the French economy and French society. French people travelled in greater numbers, more often and farther than they had ever travelled before. The opening of the first public school libraries by Napoleon III and the opening by [[Louis Hachette]] of the first bookstores in Napoleon's new train stations led to the wider circulation of books around France.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 304</ref>\n\nDuring the Empire, industrial production increased by 73 percent, growing twice as rapidly as that of the United Kingdom, though its total output remained lower. From 1850 to 1857, the French economy grew at a pace of five percent a year and exports grew by sixty percent between 1855 and 1869.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe pp. 306-307\">S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 306\u201307</ref>\n\nFrench agricultural production increased by sixty percent, spurred by new farming techniques taught at the agricultural schools started in each [[Departments of France|Department]] by Napoleon III, and new markets opened by the railways. The threat of famine, which for centuries had haunted the French countryside, receded. The last recorded famine in France was in 1855.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe pp. 306-307\"/>\n\nDuring the Empire, the migration of the rural population to the cities increased. The portion of the population active in agriculture dropped from 61 percent in 1851 to 54 percent in 1870.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe p. 309\">S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 309</ref>\n\nThe average salary of French workers grew by 45 percent during the Second Empire, but only kept up with price inflation. On the other hand, more French people than ever were able to save money; the number of bank accounts grew from 742,889 in 1852 to 2,079,141 in 1870.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe p. 309\"/>\n\n====Growing opposition and liberal concessions (1860\u20131870)====\nDespite the economic progress the country had made, domestic opposition to Napoleon III was slowly growing, particularly in the ''[[Corps l\u00e9gislatif]]'' (Parliament). The republicans on the left had always opposed him, believing he had usurped power and suppressed the Republic. The conservative Catholics were increasingly unhappy, because he had abandoned the Pope in his struggle to retain political control of the Papal States and had built up a public education system that was a rival to the Catholic system. Many businessmen, particularly in the metallurgical and textile industries, were unhappy, because he had reduced the tariffs on British products, putting the British products in direct competition with their own. The members of Parliament were particularly unhappy with him for dealing with them only when he needed money. When he had liberalized trade with England, he had not even consulted them.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 345\u201346</ref>\n\nNapoleon's large-scale program of public works, and his expensive foreign policy, had created rapidly mounting government debts; the annual deficit was about 100 million gold-francs, and the cumulative debt had reached nearly 1,000 million gold-francs (1 billion in US readings). The Emperor needed to restore the confidence of the business world and to involve the legislature and have them share responsibility.\n[[File:Alexandre Cabanel 002.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III in 1865]]\n[[File:Ten centimes 1855.JPG|thumb|Ten [[centime]] coin, 1855]]\nOn 24 December 1861, Napoleon III, against the opposition of his own ministers, issued a decree announcing that the legislature would have greater powers. The Senate and the Assembly could, for the first time, give a response to the Emperor's program, ministers were obliged to defend their programs before the Assembly, and the right of [[Deputy (France)|Deputies]] to amend the programs was enlarged. On 1 February 1861, further reforms were announced: Deputies could speak from the tribune, not just from their seats, and a stenographic record would be made and published of each session. Another even more important reform was announced on 31 December 1861: the budget of each ministry would be voted section by section, not in a block, and the government could no longer spend money by special decree when the legislature was not in session. He did retain the right to change the budget estimates section by section.\n\nThe Deputies quickly took advantage of their new rights; the Emperor's Italian policy was bitterly condemned in Parliament, and anti-government amendments by the pro-Catholic deputies were defeated by votes of 158 to 91 in the ''Corps l\u00e9gislatif'' and 79 to 61 in the Senate.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 346\u201347</ref>\n\nIn the legislative elections of 31 May 1863, the pro-government candidates received 5,308,000 votes, while the opposition received 1,954,000 votes, three times more than in the previous elections. The rural departments still voted for Napoleon III's candidates, but in Paris, 63 percent of the votes went to anti-government republican candidates, with similar numbers in all the large cities. The new Assembly contained a large opposition block ranging from Catholics outraged by the Papal policies to [[Legitimists]], [[Orl\u00e9anist]]s, [[protectionism|protectionists]] and republicans, armed with new powers given to them by the Emperor himself.<ref>Alain Plessis, ''The Rise and Fall of the Second Empire, 1852\u20131871'' (1988)</ref><ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 568\u201369</ref>\n\nDespite the opposition in the legislature, Napoleon III's reforms remained popular in the rest of the country. A new [[1870 French constitutional referendum|plebiscite was held in 1870]], on this text: \"The people approve the liberal reforms added to the Constitution since 1860 by the Emperor, with the agreement of the legislative bodies and ratified by the Senate on April 20, 1870.\" Napoleon III saw this as a referendum on his rule as Emperor: \"By voting yes,\" he wrote, \"you will chase away the threat of revolution; you will place the nation on a solid base of order and liberty, and you will make it easier to pass on the Crown to my son.\" When the votes were counted, Napoleon III had lost Paris and the other big cities but decisively won the rest of the country. The final vote was 7,336,434 votes yes, 1,560,709 votes no, and 1,900,000 abstentions. [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], the leader of the republican opposition, wrote in despair, \"We were crushed. The Emperor is more popular than ever.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 370</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n\n===Declining health and rise of Prussia===\nThrough the 1860s, the health of the Emperor steadily worsened. It had been damaged by his six years in prison at Ham; he had chronic pains in his legs and feet, particularly when it was cold, and as a result, he always lived and worked in overheated rooms and offices. He smoked heavily. He distrusted doctors, disregarded medical advice and attributed any problems simply to \"rheumatism\", for which he regularly visited the hot springs at [[Vichy]] and other spas. It became difficult for him to ride a horse, and he was obliged to walk slowly, often with a cane. From 1869 onwards, the crises of his urinary tract were treated with [[opium]], which made him seem lethargic and apathetic. His writing became hard to read and his voice weak. In the spring of 1870, he was visited by an old friend from England, [[James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]]. Malmesbury found him to be \"terribly changed and very ill\".<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 449</ref>\n\nThe health problems of the Emperor were kept secret by the government, which feared that, if his condition became public, the opposition would demand his abdication. One newspaper, the ''Courrier de la Vienne'', was warned by the censors to stop publishing articles which had \"a clear and malicious intent to spread, contrary to the truth, alarms about the health of the Emperor\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 338</ref>\n\nAt the end of June 1870, a specialist in the problems of urinary tracts, [[Germain S\u00e9e]], was finally summoned to examine him. S\u00e9e reported that the Emperor was suffering from a [[gallstone]]. On 2 July, four eminent French doctors, N\u00e9laton, Ricord, Fauvel and Corvisart, examined him and confirmed the diagnosis. They were reluctant to operate, however, because of the high risk (gallstone operations did not become relatively safe until the 1880s) and because of the Emperor's weakness. Before anything further could be done, however, France was in the middle of a diplomatic crisis.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 450</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, [[Prussia]] appeared on the horizon as a new rival to French power in Europe. Its chancellor, [[Otto von Bismarck]], had ambitions for Prussia to lead a [[German unification|unified Germany]]. In May 1862, Bismarck came to Paris on a diplomatic mission and met Napoleon III for the first time. They had cordial relations. On 30 September 1862, however, in Munich, Bismarck declared, in a famous speech: \"It is not by speeches and votes of the majority that the great questions of our period will be settled, as one believed in 1848, but by [[Blood and Iron (speech)|iron and blood]].\" Bismarck saw Austria and France as the main obstacles to his ambitions, and he set out to divide and defeat them.\n\n===Search for allies, and war between Austria and Prussia===\n\nIn the winter and spring of 1864, when the [[North German Confederation]] (and southern German allies) [[Second Schleswig War|invaded and occupied]] the German-speaking provinces of [[Denmark]] ([[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]), Napoleon III recognized the threat that a unified Germany would pose to France, and he looked for allies to challenge Germany, without success.\n\nThe British government was suspicious that Napoleon wanted to take over Belgium and Luxembourg, felt secure with its powerful navy, and did not want any military engagements on the European continent at the side of the French.\n\nThe Russian government was also suspicious of Napoleon, whom it believed had encouraged Polish nationalists to [[January Uprising|rebel against Russian rule]] in 1863. Bismarck and Prussia, on the other hand, had offered assistance to Russia to help crush the Polish patriots.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 376\u201377</ref>\n\nIn October 1865, Napoleon had a cordial meeting with Bismarck at [[Biarritz]]. They discussed Venetia, Austria's remaining province in Italy. Bismarck told Napoleon that Germany had no secret arrangement to give Venetia to Italy, and Napoleon assured him in turn that France had no secret understanding with Austria. Bismarck hinted vaguely that, in the event of a war between Austria and Prussia, French neutrality would be rewarded with some sort of territory as a compensation. Napoleon III had Luxembourg in mind.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 649</ref>\n\nIn 1866, relations between Austria and Prussia worsened and Bismarck demanded the expulsion of Austria from the German Confederation. Napoleon and his foreign minister, [[Drouyn de Lhuys]], expected a long war and an eventual Austrian victory. Napoleon III felt he could extract a price from both Prussia and Austria for French neutrality. On 12 June 1866, France signed a secret treaty with Austria, guaranteeing French neutrality in a Prussian-Austrian war. In exchange, in the event of an Austrian victory, Austria would give Venetia to France and would also create a new independent German state on the Rhine, which would become an ally of France. At the same time, Napoleon proposed a secret treaty with Bismarck, promising that France would remain neutral in a war between Austria and Prussia. In the event of a Prussian victory, France would recognize Prussia's annexation of smaller German states, and France, in exchange, would receive a portion of German territory, the [[Palatinate region]] north of Alsace. Bismarck, rightly confident of success due to the modernization of the [[Prussian Army]], summarily rejected Napoleon's offer.\n\nOn 15 June, the Prussian Army invaded [[Saxony]], an ally of Austria. On 2 July, Austria asked Napoleon to arrange an armistice between Italy, which had allied itself with Prussia, and Austria, in exchange for which France would receive Venetia. But on 3 July, the Prussian army crushed the Austrian army at the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] in [[Bohemia]]. The way to Vienna was open for the Prussians, and Austria asked for an armistice. The armistice was signed on 22 July; Prussia annexed the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], the [[Electorate of Hesse-Kassel]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]] and the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], with a combined population of four million people.<ref name=\"Girard, 1986, p. 380\">Girard, 1986, p. 380</ref>\n\nThe Austrian defeat was followed by a new crisis in the health of Napoleon III. [[Marshal Canrobert]], who saw him on 28 July, wrote that the Emperor \"was pitiful to see. He could barely sit up in his armchair, and his drawn face expressed at the same time moral anguish and physical pain.\"<ref name=\"Girard, 1986, p. 380\"/>\n\n===Luxembourg Crisis===\n{{Main|Luxembourg Crisis}}\nNapoleon III still hoped to receive some compensation from Prussia for French neutrality during the war. His foreign minister, Drouyn, asked Bismarck for the Palatinate region on the Rhine, which belonged to Bavaria, and for the demilitarization of Luxembourg, which was the site of a [[Fortress of Luxembourg|formidable fortress]] staffed by a strong Prussian garrison in accordance with international treaties. Napoleon's senior advisor [[Eug\u00e8ne Rouher]] increased the demands, asking that Prussia accept the annexation by France of Belgium and of Luxembourg.\n\nLuxembourg had regained its [[de jure]] independence in 1815 as a [[grand duchy]]. However, it was in [[personal union]] with the Netherlands. King [[William III of the Netherlands]], who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, desperately needed money and was prepared to sell the Grand Duchy to France. Bismarck swiftly intervened and showed the British ambassador a copy of Napoleon's demands; as a result, he put pressure on William III to refuse to sell Luxembourg to France. France was forced to renounce any claim to Luxembourg in the [[Treaty of London (1867)]]. Napoleon III gained nothing for his efforts but the demilitarization of the Luxembourg fortress.<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1975|p=203}}</ref>\n\n===Failure to increase the size of the French army===\nDespite his failing health, Napoleon III could see that the Prussian Army, combined with the armies of Bavaria and the other German states, would be a formidable enemy. In 1866, Prussia, with a population of 22 million, had been able to mobilize an army of 700,000 men, while France, with a population of 26 million, had an army of only 385,000 men, of whom 140,000 were in Algeria, Mexico, and Rome.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 387</ref> In the autumn of 1867, Napoleon III proposed a form of universal military service similar to the Prussian system to increase the size of the French Army, if needed, to 1 million. His proposal was opposed by many French officers, such as [[Marshal Randon]], who preferred a smaller, more professional army; he said: \"This proposal will only give us recruits; it's soldiers we need.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 389</ref> It was also strongly opposed by the republican opposition in the French parliament, who denounced the proposal as a militarization of French society. The republican deputy, [[\u00c9mile Ollivier]], who later became Napoleon's prime minister, declared: \"The armies of France, which I always considered too large, are now going to be increased to an exorbitant size. Why? What is the necessity? Where is the danger? Who is threatening us? ...If France were to disarm, the Germans would know how to convince their governments to do the same. \"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 392</ref> Facing almost certain defeat in the parliament, Napoleon III withdrew the proposal. It was replaced in January 1868 by a much more modest project to create a ''garde mobile'', or reserve force, to support the army.\n<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Howard|title=The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870\u20131871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2wEeRuei6AC|year=1981|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=30, 38\u201339|isbn=9780203993057}}</ref>\n\n===A last search for allies===\nNapoleon III was overconfident in his military strength and went into war even after he failed to find any allies who would support a war to stop German unification.<ref>James D. Morrow, \"Arms versus Allies: Trade-offs in the Search for Security.\" ''International Organization'' 47.2 (1993): 207\u201333. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706889 online]</ref>\n \nFollowing the defeat of Austria, Napoleon resumed his search for allies against Prussia. In April 1867, he proposed an alliance, defensive and offensive, with Austria. If Austria joined France in a victorious war against Prussia, Napoleon promised that Austria could form a new confederation with the southern states of Germany and could annex [[Silesia]], while France took for its part the left bank of the [[Rhine River]]. But the timing of Napoleon's offer was poorly chosen; Austria was in the process of a [[Ausgleich|major internal reform]], creating a new twin monarchy structure with two components, one being the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] and the other being the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nNapoleon's attempt to install the archduke Maximilian, the brother of the Austrian Emperor, in Mexico was just coming to its disastrous conclusion; the French troops had just been withdrawn from Mexico in February 1867, and the unfortunate Maximilian would be captured, judged and shot by a firing squad on 19 June. Napoleon III made these offers again in August 1867, on a visit to offer condolences for the death of Maximilian, but the proposal was not received with enthusiasm.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 45\u201346</ref>\n\n[[File:Adolphe Yvon - Portrait of Napoleon III - Walters 3795.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Napoleon III in 1868 by [[Adolphe Yvon]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher= The Walters Art Museum |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/597|title= Portrait of Napoleon III}}</ref>]]\nNapoleon III also made one last attempt to persuade Italy to be his ally against Prussia. Italian King Victor Emmanuel was personally favorable to a better relationship with France, remembering the role that Napoleon III had played in achieving Italian unification, but Italian public opinion was largely hostile to France; on 3 November 1867, French and Papal soldiers had fired upon the Italian patriots of Garibaldi, when he tried to capture Rome. Napoleon presented a proposed treaty of alliance on 4 June 1869, the anniversary of the joint French-Italian victory at Magenta. The Italians responded by demanding that France withdraw its troops who were protecting the Pope in Rome. Given the opinion of fervent French Catholics, this was a condition Napoleon III could not accept.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nWhile Napoleon III was having no success finding allies, Bismarck signed secret military treaties with the southern German states, who promised to provide troops in the event of a war between Prussia and France. In 1868, Bismarck signed an accord with Russia that gave Russia liberty of action in the Balkans in exchange for neutrality in the event of a war between France and Prussia. This treaty put additional pressure on Austria, which also had interests in the Balkans, not to ally itself with France. Bismarck also reached out to the liberal government of [[William Gladstone]] in London, offering to protect the neutrality of Belgium against a French threat. The British Foreign Office under [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]] mobilized the British fleet, to dissuade France against any aggressive moves against Belgium. In any war between France and Prussia, France would be entirely alone.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 47\u201348</ref>\n\nBismarck thought that French vanity would lead to war; he exploited that vanity in the [[Ems Dispatch]] in July 1870. France took the bait and declared war on Prussia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alison Kitson|title=Germany 1858\u20131990: Hope, Terror and Revival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwyp6RYFNhsC&pg=PA1870|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=1870|isbn=978-0199134175}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, French politician [[Adolphe Thiers]] (who became President of the French Republic in 1871) accused Napoleon III of erroneous foreign policy: \"There is no mistake that can be made\".<ref>History of the XIX century (1848-1871). In 5 volumes. Under the editorship of professors of Lavisse and Rambaud. Second edition. Volume 5. Part 1. \u2013 M. p. 182</ref> Napoleon III and France in the summer of 1870, however, made a serious mistake when France declared war on Prussia. This allowed Bismarck and Prussia to present the war to the world as defensive, although Prussia and Bismarck had aggressive plans, and they soon became known in relation to the annexation of the French provinces of Alsace and [[Lorraine]].\n\n===Hohenzollern candidacy and the Ems telegram===\n{{Main|Ems Dispatch}}\nIn his memoirs, written long after the war, Bismarck wrote, \"I always considered that a war with France would naturally follow a war against Austria... I was convinced that the gulf which was created over time between the north and the south of Germany could not be better overcome than by a national war against the neighbouring people who were aggressive against us. I did not doubt that it was necessary to make a French-German war before the general reorganization of Germany could be realized.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 394</ref> As the summer of 1870 approached, pressure mounted on Bismarck to have a war with France as quickly as possible. In [[Bavaria]], the largest of the southern German states, unification with (mostly Protestant) Prussia was being opposed by the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Patriotic Party]], which favoured a confederacy of (Catholic) Bavaria with (Catholic) Austria. German Protestant public opinion was on the side of unification with Prussia.\n\nIn France, patriotic sentiment was also growing. On 8 May 1870, French voters had overwhelmingly supported Napoleon III's program in a national plebiscite, with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no, an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869. The Emperor was less popular in Paris and the big cities, but highly popular in the French countryside. Napoleon had named a new foreign minister, Antoine Agenor, [[Agenor, duc de Gramont|the Duke de Gramont]], who was hostile to Bismarck. The Emperor was weak and ill, but the more extreme Bonapartists were prepared to show their strength against the republicans and monarchists in the parliament.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 47\u201350</ref>\n[[File:LeopoldHS.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern]]]]\n\nIn July 1870, Bismarck found a cause for a war in an old dynastic dispute. In September 1868, Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] had been overthrown and exiled to France. The new government of Spain considered several candidates, including [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern]], a cousin of [[William I, German Emperor|King Wilhelm I]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. At the end of 1869, Napoleon III had let it be known to the Prussian king and his Chancellor Bismarck that a Hohenzollern prince on the throne of Spain would not be acceptable to France. King Wilhelm had no desire to enter into a war against Napoleon III and did not pursue the subject further. At the end of May, however, Bismarck wrote to the father of Leopold, asking him to put pressure on his son to accept the candidacy to be King of Spain. Leopold, solicited by both his father and Bismarck, agreed.\n\nThe news of Leopold's candidacy, published 2 July 1870, aroused fury in the French parliament and press. The government was attacked by both the republicans and monarchist opposition, and by the ultra-Bonapartists, for its weakness against Prussia. On 6 July, Napoleon III held a meeting of his ministers at the ch\u00e2teau of Saint-Cloud and told them that Prussia must withdraw the Hohenzollern candidacy or there would be a war. He asked [[Edmond Le Boeuf|Marshal Leboeuf]], the chief of staff of the French army, if the army was prepared for a war against Prussia. Leboeuf responded that the French soldiers had a rifle superior to the Prussian rifle, that the French artillery was commanded by an elite corps of officers, and that the army \"would not lack a button on its [[puttees]]\". He assured the Emperor that the French army could have four hundred thousand men on the Rhine in less than fifteen days.<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 52</ref>\n\nKing Wilhelm I did not want to be seen as the instigator of the war; he had received messages urging restraint from Emperor Alexander II, Queen Victoria, and the [[Leopold II of Belgium|King of the Belgians]]. On 10 July, he told Leopold's father that his candidacy should be withdrawn. Leopold resisted the idea, but finally agreed on the 11th, and the withdrawal of the candidacy was announced on the 12th, a diplomatic victory for Napoleon. On the evening of the 12th, after meeting with the Empress and with his foreign minister, Gramont, he decided to push his success a little further; he would ask King Wilhelm to guarantee the Prussian government would never again make such a demand for the Spanish throne.\n\nThe French Ambassador to Prussia, Count [[Vincent Benedetti]], was sent to the German spa resort of [[Bad Ems]], where the Prussian King was staying. Benedetti met with the King on 13 July in the park of the ch\u00e2teau. The King told him courteously that he agreed fully with the withdrawal of the Hohenzollern candidacy, but that he could not make promises on behalf of the government for the future. He considered that the matter was closed. As he was instructed by Gramont, Benedetti asked for another meeting with the King to repeat the request, but the King politely, yet firmly, refused. Benedetti returned to Paris and the affair seemed finished. However, Bismarck edited the official dispatch of the meeting to make it appear that both sides had been hostile: \"His majesty the King,\" the dispatch read, \"refused to meet again with the French ambassador, and let him know, through an aide-de-camp of service, that His Majesty had nothing more to say to the Ambassador.\" This version was communicated to governments, and the next day was in the French press.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nThe [[Ems telegram]] had exactly the effect that Bismarck had intended. Once again, public opinion in France was inflamed. \"This text produced the effect of a red flag to the Gallic bull,\" Bismarck later wrote. Gramont, the French foreign minister, declared that he felt \"he had just received a slap.\" The leader of the conservatives in parliament, Thiers, spoke for moderation, arguing that France had won the diplomatic battle and there was no reason for war, but he was drowned out by cries that he was a traitor and a Prussian. Napoleon's new prime minister, [[\u00c9mile Ollivier]], declared that France had done all that it could humanly and honourably do to prevent the war, and that he accepted the responsibility \"with a light heart\". A crowd of 15\u201320,000 persons, carrying flags and patriotic banners, marched through the streets of Paris, demanding war. On 19 July 1870, a declaration of war was sent to the Prussian government.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 57\u201359</ref>\n\n===Defeat in the Franco-Prussian War===\n[[File:Place de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|At the outbreak of the war, crowds gathered on the Place de la Bastille, chanting \"To Berlin!\"]]\n\nWhen France entered the war, there were patriotic demonstrations in the streets of Paris, with crowds singing ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and chanting \"To Berlin! To Berlin!\" But Napoleon was melancholic. He told General Lepic that he expected the war to be \"long and difficult\", and wondered, \"Who knows if we'll come back?\" He told [[Jacques Louis Randon|Marshal Randon]] that he felt too old for a military campaign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 473</ref> Despite his ill health, Napoleon decided to go with the army to the front as commander in chief, as he had done during the successful Italian campaign. On 28 July, he departed Saint-Cloud by train for the front. He was accompanied by the 14-year-old Prince Imperial in the uniform of the army, by his military staff, and by a large contingent of chefs and servants in livery. He was pale and visibly in pain. The Empress remained in Paris as the [[Regent]], as she had done on other occasions when the Emperor was out of the country.\n\nThe mobilization of the French army was chaotic. Two hundred thousand soldiers converged on the German frontier, along a front of 250 kilometers, choking all the roads and railways for miles. Officers were unable to find their units, and units were unable to find their officers. General [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke]] and the German army, with experience mobilizing in the war against Austria, were able to efficiently move three armies of 518,000 men to a more concentrated front of just 120 kilometers. In addition, the German soldiers were backed by a substantial reserve of the [[Landwehr]] (Territorial defence), with 340,000 men, and an additional reserve of 400,000 territorial guards. The French army arrived at the frontier equipped with maps of Germany, but without maps of France\u2014where the actual fighting took place\u2014and without a specific plan of what it was going to do.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nOn 2 August, Napoleon and the Prince Imperial accompanied the army as it made a tentative crossing of the German border toward the city of [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]. The French won a minor skirmish and advanced no further. Napoleon III, very ill, was unable to ride his horse and had to support himself by leaning against a tree. In the meantime, the Germans had assembled a much larger army opposite Alsace and Lorraine than the French had expected or were aware of. On 4 August 1870, the Germans attacked with overwhelming force against a French division in Alsace at the [[Battle of Wissembourg (1870)|Battle of Wissembourg]] (German: Weissenburg), forcing it to retreat. On 5 August, the Germans defeated another French Army at the [[Battle of Spicheren]] in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]].\n\nOn 6 August, 140,000 Germans attacked 35,000 French soldiers at the [[Battle of W\u00f6rth]]; the French lost 19,200 soldiers killed, wounded and captured, and were forced to retreat. The French soldiers fought bravely, and French cavalry and infantry attacked the German lines repeatedly, but the Germans had superior logistics, communications, and leadership. The decisive weapon was the new German [[C64 (field gun)|Krupp six pound field gun]], which had a steel barrel, was loaded by the breech, had a longer range, had a higher rate of fire, and was more accurate than the bronze muzzle-loading French cannons. The Krupp guns caused terrible casualties in the French ranks.<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 61</ref>\n\nWhen the news of the French defeats reached Paris on 7 August, it was greeted with disbelief and dismay. Prime Minister Ollivier and the chief of staff of the army, Marshal [[Edmond Le Boeuf]], both resigned. The Empress Eug\u00e9nie took it upon herself as the Regent to name a new government. She chose General [[Cousin-Montauban]], better known as the Count of Palikao, seventy-four years old, the former commander of the French expeditionary force to China, as her new prime minister. The Count of Palikao named Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]], the commander of the French forces in Lorraine, as the new military commander. Napoleon III proposed returning to Paris, realizing that he was doing no good for the army. The Empress, in charge of the government responded by telegraph, \"Don't think of coming back, unless you want to unleash a terrible revolution. They will say you quit the army to flee the danger.\" The Emperor agreed to remain with the army.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 80\u201381</ref> With the Empress directing the country, and Bazaine commanding the army, the Emperor no longer had any real role to play. At the front, the Emperor told Marshal Leboeuf, \"we've both been dismissed.\"<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 81</ref>\n\nOn 18 August 1870, the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], the biggest battle of the war, took place in Lorraine between the Germans and the army of Marshal Bazaine. The Germans suffered 20,000 casualties and the French 12,000, but the Germans emerged as the victors, as Marshal Bazaine's army, with 175,000 soldiers, six divisions of cavalry and five hundred cannons, was trapped inside the fortifications of Metz, unable to move.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 92\">Milza, 2009, p. 92</ref>\n\nNapoleon was at [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]] with the army of Marshal [[Patrice de MacMahon]]. MacMahon, Marshal Bazaine, and the count of Palikao, with the Empress in Paris, all had different ideas on what the army should do next, and the Emperor had to act as a referee among them. The Emperor and MacMahon proposed moving their army closer to Paris to protect the city, but on 17 August Bazaine telegraphed to the Emperor: \"I urge you to renounce this idea, which seems to abandon the Army at Metz... Couldn't you make a powerful diversion toward the Prussian corps, which are already exhausted by so many battles? The Empress shares my opinion.\" Napoleon III wrote back, \"I yield to your opinion.\"<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 480</ref> The Emperor sent the Prince Imperial back to Paris for his safety, and went with the weary army in the direction of Metz. The Emperor, riding in an open carriage, was jeered, sworn at and insulted by demoralized soldiers.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 92\"/>\n\nThe direction of movement of MacMahon's army was supposed to be secret, but it was published in the French press and thus was quickly known to the German general staff. Moltke, the German commander, ordered two Prussian armies marching toward Paris to turn towards MacMahon's army. On 30 August, one corps of MacMahon's army was attacked by the Germans at [[Beaumont, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Beaumont]], losing five hundred men and forty cannons. MacMahon, believing he was ahead of the Germans, decided to stop and reorganize his forces at the fortified city of [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]], in the [[Ardennes]] close to the Belgian border.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 482</ref>\n\n====Battle of Sedan and capitulation====\n{{Further|Battle of Sedan (1870)}}\n[[File:The fallen emperor and triumphant statesman talked together.jpg|thumb|Bismarck with Napoleon III after his capitulation]]\n\nThe Battle of Sedan was a total disaster for the French\u2014the army surrendered to the Prussians and Napoleon himself was made a prisoner of war.<ref>Alan Strauss-Schom, ''The Shadow Emperor: A Biography of Napoleon III'' (2018) pp. 404\u201318.</ref> MacMahon arrived at Sedan with one hundred thousand soldiers, not knowing that two German armies were closing in on the city (one from the west and one from the east), blocking any escape. The Germans arrived on 31 August, and by 1 September, occupied the heights around Sedan, placed batteries of artillery, and began to shell the French positions below. At five o'clock in the morning on 1 September, a German shell seriously wounded MacMahon in the hip. Sedan soon came under bombardment from seven hundred German guns.<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 708\">Milza, 2006, p. 708</ref> MacMahon's replacement, General [[Emmanuel F\u00e9lix de Wimpffen|Wimpffen]], launched a series of valiant cavalry attacks to try to break the German encirclement, with no success. During the battle and bombardment, the French lost seventeen thousand killed or wounded and twenty-one thousand captured.\n\nAs the German shells rained down on the French positions, Napoleon III wandered aimlessly in the open around the French positions. One officer of his military escort was killed and two more received wounds. A doctor accompanying him wrote in his notebook, \"If this man has not come here to kill himself, I don't know what he has come to do. I have not seen him give an order all morning.\"<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 708\"/>\n\nFinally, at one o'clock in the afternoon, Napoleon emerged from his [[daydream|reverie]] and ordered a white flag hoisted above the citadel. He then had a message sent to the Prussian King, who was at Sedan with his army: \"Monsieur my brother, not being able to die at the head of my troops, nothing remains for me but to place my sword in the hands of Your Majesty.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 709</ref>\n\nAfter the war, when accused of having made a \"shameful surrender\" at Sedan, he wrote: \n\n{{bquote|Some people believe that, by burying ourselves under the ruins of Sedan, we would have better served my name and my dynasty. It's possible. Nay, to hold in my hand the lives of thousands of men and not to make a sign to save them was something that was beyond my capacity....my heart refused these sinister grandeurs.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 79</ref>}}\n\nAt six o'clock in the morning on 2 September, in the uniform of a general and accompanied by four generals from his staff, Napoleon was taken to the German headquarters at [[Donchery]]. He expected to see King William, but instead he was met by Bismarck and the German commander, General von Moltke. They dictated the terms of the surrender to Napoleon. Napoleon asked that his army be disarmed and allowed to pass into Belgium, but Bismarck refused. They also asked Napoleon to sign the preliminary documents of a peace treaty, but Napoleon refused, telling them that the French government headed by the Regent, Empress Eug\u00e9nie, would need to negotiate any peace agreement. The Emperor was then taken to the Chateau at Bellevue near {{interlanguage link|Fr\u00e9nois (Ardennes)|fr|Fr\u00e9nois (Ardennes)}}, where the Prussian King visited him. Napoleon told the King that he had not wanted the war, but that public opinion had forced him into it. The Prussian king politely agreed.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} That evening, from the Chateau, Napoleon wrote to the Empress Eug\u00e9nie: \n\n{{bquote|It is impossible for me to say what I have suffered and what I am suffering now...I would have preferred death to a capitulation so disastrous, and yet, under the present circumstances, it was the only way to avoid the butchering of sixty thousand people. If only all my torments were concentrated here! I think of you, our son, and our unhappy country.<ref>\nMilza, 2006, p. 710\n</ref>}}\n\n====Aftermath====\nThe news of the capitulation reached Paris on 3 September, confirming the rumors that were already circulating in the city. When the news was given to the Empress that the Emperor and the army were prisoners, she reacted by shouting at the Emperor's personal aide, \"No! An Emperor does not capitulate! He is dead!...They are trying to hide it from me. Why didn't he kill himself! Doesn't he know he has dishonored himself?!\".<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 711</ref> Later, when hostile crowds formed near the palace, and the staff began to flee, the Empress slipped out with one of her entourage and sought sanctuary with her American dentist, who took her to [[Deauville]]. From there, on 7 September, she took the yacht of a British official to England. On 4 September, a group of republican deputies, led by [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], gathered at the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]] in Paris and proclaimed the return of the Republic and the creation of a [[Government of National Defence]].

But by this time, Metz had already fallen, leaving Napoleon without a power basis. Bismarck did not see much chance for a restored empire as Napoleon would look like a marionette of the enemy to the French people.<ref>David Wetzel: ''A Duel of Nations.

Bonapartist candidates participated in the first elections for the National Assembly on 8 February, but won only five seats. On 1 March, the newly elected assembly officially declared the removal of the Emperor from power and placed all the blame for the French defeat squarely on him.<ref name=\"Louis Girard p. 488\"/> When peace was arranged between France and Germany, Bismarck released Napoleon. He decided to go into exile in England.

Strode bought Camden Place in 1860 and spent large sums of money transforming it into a French chateau. Strode had also received money from the Emperor, possibly to buy Camden Place and maintain it as a [[Retreat (survivalism)|bolt hole]].<ref>[http://www.chislehurst-society.org.uk/Pages/About/People/NapoleonIII.html Napoleon III of France<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNapoleon passed his time writing and designing a stove which would be more energy efficient. In the summer of 1872, his health began to worsen. Doctors recommended surgery to remove his gallstones. After two operations, he became very seriously ill.

It was based on stability and balance of powers, whereas Napoleon attempted to rearrange the world map to France's favour even when it involved radical and potentially revolutionary changes in politics.

[[Victor Hugo]] portrayed him as \"Napoleon the Small\" (''[[Napol\u00e9on le Petit]]''), a mere mediocrity, in contrast with Napoleon I \"The Great\", presented as a military and administrative genius. In France, such arch-opposition from the age's central literary figure, whose attacks on Napoleon III were obsessive and powerful, made it impossible for a very long time to assess his reign objectively. [[Karl Marx]], in ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', famously mocked Napoleon III by saying \"Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historical facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.\" Napoleon III has often been seen as an authoritarian but ineffectual leader who brought France into dubious, and ultimately disastrous, foreign military adventures.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen E.

His greatest achievements came in material improvements, in the form of  a grand railway network that facilitated commerce and tied the nation together and centered it on Paris. He is given high credits for the rebuilding of Paris with broad boulevards, striking public buildings, and very attractive residential districts for upscale Parisians. He promoted French business and exports. In international policy, he tried to emulate his uncle, with numerous imperial ventures around the world, as well as wars in Europe. He badly mishandled the threat from Prussia and found himself without allies in the face of overwhelming force.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''[France: 1815 to the Present'' (1963) online p. 275]</ref>\n\nHistorians have also praised his attention to the fate of the working classes and poor people. His book ''Extinction du paup\u00e9risme'' (\"Extinction of pauperism\"), which he wrote while imprisoned at the Fort of Ham in 1844, contributed to his popularity among the working classes and thus his election in 1848. Throughout his reign, the emperor worked to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, on occasion breaching the 19th-century economic orthodoxy of freedom and [[laissez-faire]] and using state resources or interfering in the market. Among other things, the Emperor granted the right to strike to French workers in 1864, despite intense opposition from corporate lobbies.\n\n===Screen===\n\nOn screen Napoleon has been portrayed by:\n* [[Walter Kingsford]] in \n**''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'' (1936)\n**''[[A Dispatch from Reuter's]]'' (1940)\n* [[Frank Vosper]] in ''[[Spy of Napoleon]]'' (1936)\n* [[Guy Bates Post]] in \n**''[[Maytime (1937 film)|Maytime]]'' (1937) \n**''[[The Mad Empress]]'' (1939)\n* [[Leon Ames (actor)|Leon Ames]] in ''[[Suez (film)|Suez]]'' (1938)\n* [[Claude Rains]] in ''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]'' (1939) \n* [[Walter Franck]] in ''[[Bismarck (1940 film)|Bismarck]]'' (1940)\n* [[Jerome Cowan]] in ''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' (1943)\n* David Bond in ''[[The Sword of Monte Cristo]]'' (1951)\n* [[Siegfried Wischnewski]] in ''[[Maximilian von Mexiko]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|title=Maximilian von Mexiko|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379886/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n* Robert Dumont in ''[[Those Years]]'' (Spanish: ''Aquellos a\u00f1os'', 1973).<ref>{{cite web|title=Aquellos a\u00f1os|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193724/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n* Julian Sherrier in ''[[Edward the Seventh]]'' (1975)\n* [[Nick Jameson]] in ''[[The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer]]'' (1998)\n* [[Erwin Steinhauer]] in ''[[Sisi (miniseries)|Sisi]]'' (2009).<ref>{{cite web|title=Sisi|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442136/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon III also plays a small but crucial role in ''[[April and the Extraordinary World]]'' (2015).\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* 20 April 1808 \u2013 9 July 1810: His Imperial and Royal Highness Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on of France, Prince of Holland\n* 20 April 1808 \u2013 20 December 1848: His Imperial Highness Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on of France\n* 20 December 1848 \u2013 2 December 1852: His Imperial Highness The Prince-President of the French Republic (\"''{{lang|fr|Son Altesse Imp\u00e9riale le Prince-President}}''\")\n* 2 December 1852 \u2013 1 March 1871: His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French\n* 1 March 1871 \u2013 9 January 1873: His Imperial Majesty Napol\u00e9on III{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nHis full title as emperor was: \"Napoleon the Third, [[By the Grace of God]] and the will of the [[Second French Empire|Nation]], [[Emperor of the French]]\".<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/napoleon.htm#naptitles \"Napol\u00e9on's Titles\"].

I]], was the first [[president of France]] from 1848 to 1852, and the last [[French monarch]] from 1852 to 1870. First elected president of the [[French Second Republic]] in [[1848 French presidential election|1848]], he seized power in 1851, when he could not constitutionally be re-elected, and became the [[emperor of the French]]. He founded the [[Second French Empire]] and was its only emperor until the defeat of the French army and his capture by [[Prussia]] and its allies in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. He worked to modernize the French economy, rebuilt the center of Paris, expanded the [[French overseas empire]], and engaged in the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Second Italian War of Independence]].\n\nNapoleon III commissioned a grand [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|reconstruction of Paris]] carried out by his prefect of the Seine, [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]], and launched similar public works projects in [[Marseille]], [[Lyon]] and other French cities. Napoleon III modernized the French banking system, expanded and consolidated the French railway system, and made the French merchant marine the second largest in the world. He promoted the building of the [[Suez Canal]] and established modern agriculture, which ended famines in France and made France an agricultural exporter. Napoleon III negotiated the 1860 [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier free trade agreement]] with Britain and similar agreements with France's other European trading partners. Social reforms included giving French workers the right to strike and the right to organize. The first women students were admitted at the Sorbonne and educational opportunities for women were increased, as did the list of required subjects in public schools.\n\nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world. He was a supporter of [[popular sovereignty]] and of [[nationalism]]. In Europe, he allied with Britain and defeated Russia in the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u201356). His regime assisted [[Italian unification]] by defeating the Austrian Empire in the [[Franco-Austrian War]] and later annexed [[Savoy]] and the [[County of Nice]] as its deferred reward. At the same time, his forces defended the [[Papal States]] against annexation by Italy.  He was also favorable towards the union of the Danubian Principalities (24th of January 1859), which resulted in the establishment of the modern state of [[Romania]]. Napoleon III doubled the area of the [[French overseas empire]] in Asia, the Pacific and Africa. On the other hand, the [[French intervention in Mexico]], which aimed to create a [[Second Mexican Empire]] under French protection, ended in total failure.\n\nFrom 1866, Napoleon had to face the mounting power of Prussia as its Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] sought German unification under Prussian leadership. In July 1870, Napoleon entered the Franco-Prussian War without allies and with inferior military forces. The French army was rapidly defeated and Napoleon III was captured at the [[Battle of Sedan]]. The [[French Third Republic]] was proclaimed in Paris and Napoleon went into exile in England, where he died in 1873.\n\n==Childhood and family==\n\n===Early life===\nCharles-Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, later known as Louis Napoleon and then Napoleon III, was born in Paris on the night of 19\u201320 April 1808. His father was [[Louis Bonaparte]], the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who made Louis the [[Kingdom of Holland|King of Holland]] from 1806 until 1810. His mother was [[Hortense de Beauharnais]], the only daughter of Napoleon's wife [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]] by her first marriage to [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]].\n\nAs empress, Jos\u00e9phine proposed the marriage as a way to produce an heir for the Emperor, who agreed, as Jos\u00e9phine was by then infertile.<ref>Bresler, 1999, p. 20</ref> Louis married Hortense when he was twenty-four and she was nineteen. They had a difficult relationship and only lived together for brief periods. Their first son [[Napol\u00e9on Charles Bonaparte]] died in 1807 and\u2014though separated and parents of a healthy second son, [[Napol\u00e9on-Louis Bonaparte]]\u2014they decided to have a third child. They resumed their marriage for a brief time in Toulouse in July 1807, and Louis was born prematurely, two weeks short of nine months. Louis Napoleon's enemies, including [[Victor Hugo]], spread the gossip that he was the child of a different man, but most historians agree today that he was the legitimate son of Louis Bonaparte<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 21\u201324</ref><ref>Milza, 2006, p. 15</ref> (see [[Napoleon III of France#Ancestry|ancestry]]).<ref>Bresler, 1999, p. 37</ref>\n\nCharles-Louis was baptized at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] on 5 November 1810, with Emperor Napoleon serving as his godfather and [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Empress Marie-Louise]] as his godmother. His father stayed away, once again separated from Hortense. At the age of seven, Louis Napoleon visited his uncle at the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris. Napoleon held him up to the window to see the soldiers parading in the courtyard of the Carousel below. He last saw his uncle with the family at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], shortly before Napoleon departed for the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 26</ref>\n\nAll members of the [[Bonaparte dynasty]] were forced into exile after the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo and the [[Bourbon Restoration]] of monarchy in France. Hortense and Louis Napoleon moved from [[Aix-les-Bains|Aix]] to [[Bern]] to [[Baden-Baden|Baden]], and finally to a lakeside house at [[Arenenberg]] in the Swiss canton of [[Thurgau]]. He received some of his education in Germany at the [[gymnasium school]] at [[Augsburg]], Bavaria. As a result, for the rest of his life, his French had a slight but noticeable German accent. His tutor at home was [[Philippe Le Bas]], an ardent republican and the son of a revolutionary and close friend of [[Robespierre]]. Le Bas taught him French history and radical politics.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 39\u201342</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:LouisBonaparte Holland.jpg|[[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the King of Holland, and father of Napoleon III\nFile:Reine de Hollande et son fils.jpg|[[Hortense de Beauharnais]] (1783\u20131837), mother to Louis Napoleon in 1808\nFile:Schloss Arenenberg mit Kapelle und Napoleonmuseum.jpg|The lakeside house at [[Arenenberg]], Switzerland, where Louis Napoleon spent much of his youth and exile\n</gallery>\n\n===Romantic revolutionary (1823\u20131835)===\nWhen Louis Napoleon was fifteen, Hortense moved to Rome, where the Bonapartes had a villa. He passed his time learning Italian, exploring the ancient ruins, and learning the arts of seduction and romantic affairs, which he used often in his later life. He became friends with the French Ambassador, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Chateaubriand]], the father of romanticism in French literature, with whom he remained in contact for many years. He was reunited with his older brother [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte|Napoleon Louis]], and together they became involved with the [[Carbonari]], secret revolutionary societies fighting Austria's domination of northern Italy. In the spring of 1831, when he was twenty-three, the Austrian and papal governments launched an offensive against the Carbonari, and the two brothers, wanted by the police, were forced to flee. During their flight, Napoleon-Louis contracted measles and, on 17 March 1831, died in his brother's arms.<ref>Bresler, 1999, pp. 94\u201395</ref> Hortense joined her son and together they evaded the police and Austrian army and finally reached the French border.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 58\u201372</ref>\n\nHortense and Louis Napoleon travelled incognito to Paris, where the old regime of King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] had just fallen and been replaced by the more liberal regime of King [[Louis Philippe I]]. They arrived in Paris on 23 April 1831, and took up residence under the name \"Hamilton\" in the Hotel du Holland on [[Place Vend\u00f4me]]. Hortense wrote an appeal to the King, asking to stay in France, and Louis Napoleon offered to volunteer as an ordinary soldier in the French Army. The new King agreed to meet secretly with Hortense; Louis Napoleon had a fever and did not join them. The King finally agreed that Hortense and Louis Napoleon could stay in Paris as long as their stay was brief and incognito. Louis-Napoleon was told that he could join the French Army if he would simply change his name, something he indignantly refused to do. Hortense and Louis Napoleon remained in Paris until 5 May, the tenth anniversary of the death of Napoleon Bonaparte. The presence of Hortense and Louis Napoleon in the hotel had become known, and a public demonstration of mourning for the Emperor took place on Place Vend\u00f4me in front of their hotel. The same day, Hortense and Louis Napoleon were ordered to leave Paris. They went to Britain briefly, and then back into exile in Switzerland.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 72\u201377</ref>\n\n==Early adult years==\n\n===Bonapartist succession and philosophy of Bonapartism===\nEver since the fall of Napoleon in 1815, a [[Bonapartist]] movement had existed in France,  hoping to return a Bonaparte to the throne. According to the law of succession established by Napoleon I, the claim passed first to his own son, declared \"King of Rome\" at birth by his father. This heir, known by Bonapartists as [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was living in virtual imprisonment at the court of [[Vienna]] under the title Duke of Reichstadt. Next in line was Napoleon I's eldest brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (1768\u20131844), followed by [[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), but neither Joseph nor Louis had any interest in re-entering public life. When the Duke of Reichstadt died in 1832, Louis Napoleon became the ''de facto'' heir of the dynasty and the leader of the Bonapartist cause.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nIn exile with his mother in Switzerland, he enrolled in the Swiss Army, trained to become an officer, and wrote a manual of artillery (his uncle Napoleon Bonaparte had become famous as an artillery officer). Louis Napoleon also began writing about his political philosophy \u2013 for as [[H. A. L. Fisher]] suggested, \"the programme of the Empire was not the improvisation of a vulgar adventurer\" but the result of deep reflection on the Napoleonic political philosophy and on how to adjust it to the changed domestic and international scenes.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/bonapartismsixle00fishiala|title= Bonapartism, six lectures delivered in the University of London|last= Fisher|first= Herbert Albert Laurens|publisher= Clarendon Press|year= 1908|isbn= |location= Oxford|page= [https://archive.org/details/bonapartismsixle00fishiala/page/87 87]}}</ref> He published his ''R\u00eaveries politiques'' or \"political dreams\" in 1833 at the age of 25, followed in 1834 by ''Consid\u00e9rations politiques et militaires sur la Suisse'' (\"Political and military considerations about Switzerland\"), followed in 1839 by ''Les Id\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes'' (\"Napoleonic Ideas\"), a compendium of his political ideas which was published in three editions and eventually translated into six languages. He based his doctrine upon two ideas: universal suffrage and the primacy of the national interest. He called for a \"monarchy which procures the advantages of the Republic without the inconveniences\", a regime \"strong without despotism, free without anarchy, independent without conquest\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 61\u201362\n</ref>\n\n===Failed coup, and exile in London (1836\u20131840)===\n[[File:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1836.JPG|thumb|Louis Napoleon at the time of his failed coup in 1836]]\n\"I believe,\" Louis Napoleon wrote, \"that from time to time, men are created whom I call volunteers of providence, in whose hands are placed the destiny of their countries. I believe I am one of those men. If I am wrong, I can perish uselessly. If I am right, then providence will put me into a position to fulfill my mission.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 68</ref> He had seen the popular enthusiasm for Napoleon Bonaparte when he was in Paris, and he was convinced that, if he marched to Paris, as Napoleon Bonaparte had done in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]], France would rise up and join him. He began to plan a coup against King Louis-Philippe.\n\n[[File:Soul\u00e8vement Strasbourg Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1836.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis Napoleon launching his failed coup in Strasbourg in 1836]]\nHe planned for his uprising to begin in [[Strasbourg]]. The colonel of a regiment was brought over to the cause. On 29 October 1836, Louis Napoleon arrived in Strasbourg, in the uniform of an artillery officer, and rallied the regiment to his side. The [[prefecture]] was seized, and the [[prefect]] arrested. Unfortunately for Louis-Napoleon, the general commanding the garrison escaped and called in a loyal regiment, which surrounded the mutineers. The mutineers surrendered and Louis-Napoleon fled back to Switzerland.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 97\u2013100</ref>\n\n===Travel===\nKing Louis-Philippe demanded that the Swiss government return Louis Napoleon to France, but the Swiss pointed out that he was a Swiss soldier and citizen, and refused to hand him over. Louis-Philippe responded by sending an army to the Swiss border. Louis Napoleon thanked his Swiss hosts, and voluntarily left the country. The other mutineers were put on trial in [[Alsace]], and were all acquitted.\n\nLouis Napoleon traveled first to London, then to Brazil, and then to New York. He moved into a hotel, where he met the elite of New York society and the writer [[Washington Irving]]. While he was traveling to see more of the United States, he received word that his mother was very ill. He hurried as quickly as he could back to Switzerland. He reached Arenenberg in time to be with his mother on 5 October 1837, when she died. She was finally buried in [[Reuil]], in France, next to her mother, on 11 January 1838, but Louis Napoleon could not attend, because he was not allowed into France.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 107\u201308</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon returned to London for a new period of exile in October 1838. He had inherited a large fortune from his mother and took a house with seventeen servants and several of his old friends and fellow conspirators. He was received by London society and met the political and scientific leaders of the day, including [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Michael Faraday]]. He also did considerable research into the economy of Britain. He strolled in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], which he later used as a model when he created the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\n===Second coup, prison, escape and exile (1840\u20131848)===\n\nLiving in the comfort of London, he had not given up the dream of returning to France to seize power. In the summer of 1840 he bought weapons and uniforms and had proclamations printed, gathered a contingent of about sixty armed men, hired a ship called the ''Edinburgh-Castle'', and on 6 August 1840, sailed across the [[English Channel|Channel]] to the port of [[Boulogne]]. The attempted coup turned into an even greater fiasco than the Strasbourg mutiny. The mutineers were stopped by the customs agents, the soldiers of the garrison refused to join, the mutineers were surrounded on the beach, one was killed and the others arrested. Both the British and French press heaped ridicule on Louis-Napoleon and his plot. The newspaper ''Le Journal des D\u00e9bats'' wrote, \"this surpasses comedy. One doesn't kill crazy people, one just locks them up.\" He was put on trial, where, despite an eloquent defense of his cause, he was sentenced to life in prison in the fortress of [[Ham, Somme|Ham]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] department of northern France.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 122\u201333</ref>\n\n===Activities===\nThe register of the fortress Ham for 7 October 1840 contained a concise description of the new prisoner: \"Age: thirty-two years. Height: one meter sixty-six. Hair and eyebrows: chestnut. Eyes: Gray and small. Nose: large. Mouth: ordinary. Beard: brown. Moustache: blond. Chin: pointed. Face: oval. Complexion: pale. Head: sunken in his shoulders, and large shoulders. Back: bent. Lips: thick.\"<ref>Quoted in S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 81</ref> He had a mistress named \u00c9l\u00e9onore Vergeot, a young woman from the nearby town, who gave birth to two of his children.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 83</ref>\n\nWhile in prison, he wrote poems, political essays, and articles on diverse topics. He contributed articles to regional newspapers and magazines in towns all over France, becoming quite well known as a writer. His most famous book was ''L'extinction du pauperisme'' (1844), a study of the causes of poverty in the French industrial working class, with proposals to eliminate it. His conclusion: \"The working class has nothing, it is necessary to give them ownership. They have no other wealth than their own labor, it is necessary to give them work that will benefit all....they are without organization and without connections, without rights and without a future; it is necessary to give them rights and a future and to raise them in their own eyes by association, education, and discipline.\" He proposed various practical ideas for creating a banking and savings system that would provide credit to the working class, and to establish agricultural colonies similar to the kibutzes later founded in Israel.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 89. Translated by D. Siefkin</ref> This book was widely reprinted and circulated in France, and played an important part in his future electoral success.\n\nHe was busy in prison, but also unhappy and impatient. He was aware that the popularity of Napoleon Bonaparte was steadily increasing in France; the Emperor was the subject of heroic poems, books and plays. Huge crowds had gathered in Paris on 15 December 1840 when the [[Retour des cendres|remains of Napoleon]] Bonaparte were returned with great ceremony to Paris and handed over to Louis Napoleon's old enemy, King Louis-Philippe, while Louis Napoleon could only read about it in prison. On 25 May 1846, with the assistance of his doctor and other friends on the outside, he disguised himself as a laborer carrying lumber, and walked out of the prison. His enemies later derisively called him \"Badinguet\", the name of the laborer whose identity he had assumed. A carriage was waiting to take him to the coast and then by boat to England. A month after his escape, his father Louis died, making Louis Napoleon the clear heir to the Bonaparte dynasty.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 93</ref>\n\n===Return and early affairs===\nHe quickly resumed his place in British society. He lived on King Street in St James's, London, went to the theatre and hunted, renewed his acquaintance with Benjamin Disraeli, and met [[Charles Dickens]]. He went back to his studies at the British Museum. He had an affair with the actress [[Rachel (actress)|Rachel]], the most famous French actress of the period, during her tours to Britain. More important for his future career, he had an affair with the wealthy heiress [[Harriet Howard]] (1823\u20131865). They met in 1846, soon after his return to Britain. They began to live together, she took in his two illegitimate children and raised them with her own son, and she provided financing for his political plans so that, when the moment came, he could return to France.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte \u00e0 Boulogne (D\u00e9barquement en Ao\u00fbt 1840).JPG|Louis Napoleon's 1840 attempt to lead an uprising against Louis-Philippe ended in fiasco and ridicule.

He spoke rarely in the Assembly, but, because of his name, had enormous popularity in the country.]]\n\nIn February 1848, Louis Napoleon learned that the [[French Revolution of 1848]] had broken out, and that Louis-Philippe, faced with opposition within his government and army, had abdicated. Believing that his time had finally come, he set out for Paris on 27 February, departing England on the same day that Louis-Philippe left France for his own exile in England. When he arrived in Paris, he found that the Second Republic had been declared, led by a Provisional Government headed by a Commission led by [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], and that different factions of republicans, from conservatives to those on the far left, were competing for power. He wrote to Lamartine announcing his arrival, saying that he \"was without any other ambition than that of serving my country\". Lamartine wrote back politely but firmly, asking Louis-Napoleon to leave Paris \"until the city is more calm, and not before the elections for the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]\". His close advisors urged him to stay and try to take power, but he wanted to show his prudence and loyalty to the Republic; while his advisors remained in Paris, he returned to London on 2 March 1848 and watched events from there.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 102</ref>\n\nHe did not run in the first elections for the National Assembly, held in April 1848, but three members of the Bonaparte family, [[Jerome Bonaparte|J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], [[Pierre Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], and [[Prince Lucien Murat|Lucien Murat]] were elected; the name Bonaparte still had political power. In the next elections, on 4 June, where candidates could run in multiple departments, he was elected in four different departments; in Paris, he was among the top five candidates, just after the conservative leader [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. His followers were mostly on the left, from the peasantry and working class. His pamphlet on \"The Extinction of Pauperism\" was widely circulated in Paris, and his name was cheered with those of the socialist candidates [[Armand Barb\u00e8s|Barb\u00e8s]] and [[Louis Blanc]].<ref>'S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 105</ref>\n\nThe [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] leaders of the provisional government, Lamartine and [[Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Cavaignac|Cavaignac]], considered arresting him as a dangerous revolutionary, but once again he outmaneuvered them. He wrote to the President of the Provisional Government: \"I believe I should wait to return to the heart of my country, so that my presence in France will not serve as a pretext to the enemies of the Republic.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 106</ref>\n\nIn June 1848, the [[June Days Uprising]] broke out in Paris, led by the far left, against the conservative majority in the National Assembly. Hundreds of barricades appeared in the working-class neighborhoods. General Cavaignac, the leader of the army, first withdrew his soldiers from Paris to allow the insurgents to deploy their barricades, and then returned with overwhelming force to crush the uprising; from 24 to 26 June, there were battles in the streets of the working class districts of Paris. An estimated five thousand insurgents were killed at the barricades, fifteen thousand were arrested, and four thousand deported.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 108\u201309</ref>\n\nHis absence from Paris meant that Louis Napoleon was not connected either with the uprising, or with the brutal repression that had followed. He was still in London on 17\u201318 September, when the elections for the National Assembly were held, but he was a candidate in thirteen departments. He was elected in five departments; in Paris, he received 110,000 votes of the 247,000 cast, the highest number of votes of any candidate. He returned to Paris on 24 September, and this time he took his place in the National Assembly. In seven months, he had gone from a political exile in London to a highly visible place in the National Assembly, as the government finished the [[French Constitution of 1848|new Constitution]] and prepared for the first election ever of a President of the French Republic.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 182</ref>\n\n===Presidential election of 1848===\n{{further|French presidential election, 1848}}\n[[File:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte pr\u00e9sident.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Louis Napoleon captured 74.2 percent of votes cast in the first French direct presidential elections in 1848.]]\nThe new constitution of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], drafted by a commission including [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], called for a strong executive and a president elected by popular vote through universal male suffrage, rather than chosen by the National Assembly.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 111</ref> The [[1848 French presidential election|elections]] were scheduled for 10\u201311 December 1848. Louis Napoleon promptly announced his candidacy. There were four other candidates for the post: General Cavaignac, who had led the suppression of the June uprisings in Paris; Lamartine, the poet-philosopher and leader of the provisional government; [[Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin]], the leader of the socialists; and [[Raspail]], the leader of the far left wing of the socialists.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 182\u201390</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon established his campaign headquarters and residence at the Hotel du Rhin on [[Place Vend\u00f4me]]. He was accompanied by his companion, Harriet Howard, who gave him a large loan to help finance his campaign. He rarely went to the sessions of the National Assembly and rarely voted. He was not a gifted orator; he spoke slowly, in a monotone, with a slight German accent from his Swiss education. His opponents sometimes ridiculed him, one comparing him to \"a turkey who believes he's an eagle\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 115</ref>\n\nHis campaign appealed to both the left and right. His election manifesto proclaimed his support for \"religion, family, property, the eternal basis of all social order\". But it also announced his intent \"to give work to those unoccupied; to look out for the old age of the workers; to introduce in industrial laws those improvements which don't ruin the rich, but which bring about the well-being of each and the prosperity of all\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 125</ref>\n\nHis campaign agents, many of them veterans from Napoleon Bonaparte's army, raised support for him around the country. Louis Napoleon won the grudging endorsement of the conservative leader [[Adolphe Thiers]], who believed he could be the most easily controlled; Thiers called him \"of all the candidates, the least bad\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 123</ref> He won the backing of ''L'Evenement'', the newspaper of Victor Hugo, which declared, \"We have confidence in him; he carries a great name.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 124</ref> His chief opponent, General Cavaignac, expected that Louis Napoleon would come in first, but that he would receive less than fifty percent of the vote, which would mean the election would go to the National Assembly, where Cavaignac was certain to win.\n\nThe elections were held on 10\u201311 December. Results were announced on 20 December. Louis Napoleon was widely expected to win, but the size of his victory surprised almost everyone. He won 5,572,834 votes, or 74.2 percent of votes cast, compared with 1,469,156 for Cavaignac. The socialist Ledru-Rollin received 376,834; the extreme left candidate Raspail 37,106, and the poet Lamartine only 17,000 votes. Louis Napoleon won the support of all segments of the population: the peasants unhappy with rising prices; unemployed workers; small businessmen who wanted prosperity and order; and intellectuals such as Victor Hugo. He won the votes of 55.6 percent of all registered voters, and won in all but four of France's departments.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 189\u201390</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Election france 1848.jpg|The 1848 presidential campaign pitted Louis Napoleon against General Cavaignac, the Minister of Defense of the Provisional Government, and the leaders of the socialists.\nFile:Extinction du Paup\u00e9risme par Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1.jpeg|Louis Napoleon's essay, \"The Extinction of Pauperism\", advocating reforms to help the working class, was widely circulated during the 1848 election campaign.\n</gallery>\n\n===Prince-President (1848\u20131851)===\nLouis Napoleon moved his residence to the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] at the end of December 1848 and immediately hung a portrait of his mother in the boudoir and a portrait of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, in his coronation robes, in the grand salon.

The previous government had sent an expeditionary force to Rome to help restore the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal authority]] of [[Pope Pius IX]], who was being threatened by the troops of the Italian republicans [[Mazzini]] and [[Garibaldi]]. The French troops came under fire from Garibaldi's soldiers. The Prince-President, without consulting his ministers, ordered his soldiers to fight if needed in support of the Pope. This was very popular with French Catholics, but infuriated the republicans, who supported Garibaldi.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 194\"/> To please the radical republicans, he asked the Pope to introduce liberal reforms and the ''[[Code Napoleon]]'' to the [[Papal States]]. To gain support from the Catholics, he approved the ''[[Loi Falloux]]'' in 1851, which restored a greater role for the Catholic Church in the French educational system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger Price|title=Napol\u00e9on III and the Second Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqd6MdOYZkwC&pg=PA16|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=16|isbn=978-0203134245}}</ref>\n\nElections were held for the [[1849 French legislative election|National Assembly on 13\u201314 May 1849]], only a few months after Louis Napoleon had become President, and were largely won by a coalition of conservative republicans\u2014which Catholics and monarchists called \"The [[Party of Order]]\"\u2014led by Adolphe Thiers. The socialists and \"red\" republicans, led by Ledru-Rollin and Raspail, also did well, winning two hundred seats. The moderate republicans, in the middle, did very badly, taking just 70-80 seats. The Party of Order had a clear majority, enough to block any initiatives of Louis Napoleon.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 208\u201309</ref>\n\nOn 11 June 1849 the socialists and radical republicans made [[French demonstration of 15 May 1848|an attempt to seize power]]. Ledru-Rollin, from his headquarters in the [[Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers|Conservatory of Arts and Professions]], declared that Louis Napoleon was no longer President and called for a general uprising. A few barricades appeared in the working-class neighborhoods of Paris. Louis Napoleon acted swiftly, and the uprising was short-lived. Paris was declared in a state of siege, the headquarters of the uprising was surrounded, and the leaders arrested. Ledru-Rollin fled to England, Raspail was arrested and sent to prison, the republican clubs were closed, and their newspapers closed down.\n\nThe National Assembly, now without the left republicans and determined to keep them out forever, proposed a new election law that placed restrictions on universal male suffrage, imposing a three-year residency requirement. This new law excluded 3.5 of 9 million French voters, the voters that the leader of the Party of Order, Adolphe Thiers, scornfully called \"the vile multitude\".<ref>Cobban, p. 155</ref> This new election law was passed in May 1850 by a majority of 433 to 241, putting the National Assembly on a direct collision course with the Prince-President.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ronald Aminzade|title=Ballots and Barricades: Class Formation and Republican Politics in France, 1830\u20131871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTbybLDLPiAC&pg=PA299|year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=299|isbn=978-0691028712}}</ref> Louis Napoleon broke with the Assembly and the conservative ministers opposing his projects in favour of the dispossessed. He secured the support of the army, toured the country making populist speeches that condemned the Assembly, and presented himself as the protector of universal male suffrage. He demanded that the law be changed, but his proposal was defeated in the Assembly by a vote of 355 to 348.<ref>Cobban, p. 156</ref>\n\nAccording to the Constitution of 1848, he had to step down at the end of his term, so Louis Napoleon sought a constitutional amendment to allow him to succeed himself, arguing that four years were not enough to fully implement his political and economic program. He toured the country and gained support from many of the regional governments and many within the Assembly. The vote in July 1851 was 446 to 278 in favor of changing the law and allowing him to run again, but this was short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Stevens Cabot Abbott|title=The history of Napoleon III., emperor of the French|publisher=B.B.

His half-brother Morny and a few close advisors quietly began to organize [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They brought Major General [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud]], a former captain from the [[French Foreign Legion]] and a commander of French forces in Algeria, and other officers from the French army in North Africa, to provide military backing for the coup. The date set for the coup was 2 December, the anniversary of the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] and the anniversary of the [[coronation of Napoleon I|coronation of Louis Napoleon's uncle Napoleon I]]. On the night of 1\u20132 December, Saint Arnaud's soldiers quietly occupied the national printing office, the [[Palais Bourbon]], newspaper offices, and the strategic points in the city. In the morning, Parisians found posters around the city announcing the dissolution of the National Assembly, the restoration of universal suffrage, new elections, and a state of siege in Paris and the surrounding departments. Sixteen members of the National Assembly were arrested in their homes. When about 220 deputies of the moderate right gathered at the city hall of the [[10th arrondissement of Paris|10th arrondissement]], they were also arrested.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 255</ref> On 3 December, writer [[Victor Hugo]] and a few other republicans tried to organize an opposition to the coup. A few barricades appeared, and about 1,000 insurgents came out in the streets, but the army moved in force with 30,000 troops and the uprisings were swiftly crushed, with the killing of an estimated 300 to 400 opponents of the coup.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 261</ref> There were also small uprisings in the more militant red republican towns in the south and center of France, but these were all put down by 10 December.<ref>Cobban, pp. 157\u201358</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon followed the [[self-coup]] by a period of repression of his opponents, aimed mostly at the red republicans. About 26,000 people were arrested, including 4,000 in Paris alone. The 239 inmates who were judged most severely were sent to the penal colony in [[Cayenne]].<ref>Cobban, p. 158</ref> 9,530 followers were sent to [[French Algeria]], 1,500 were expelled from France, and another 3,000 were given forced residence away from their homes.<ref>Cobban and Milza</ref> Soon afterwards, a commission of revision freed 3,500 of those sentenced. In 1859, the remaining 1800 prisoners and exiles were amnestied, with the exception of the republican leader Ledru-Rollin, who was released from prison but required to leave the country.<ref>Cobban, p 158</ref>\n\nStrict press censorship was enacted by a decree from 17 February 1852. No newspaper dealing with political or social questions could be published without the permission of the government, fines were increased, and the list of press offenses was expanded. After three warnings, a newspaper or journal could be suspended or even permanently closed.<ref>Cobban, p. 159</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon wished to demonstrate that his new government had a broad popular mandate, so [[1851 French constitutional referendum|on 20\u201321 December a national plebiscite]] was held asking if voters agreed to the coup. Mayors in many regions threatened to publish the names of any electors who refused to vote.

Work began on [[French Constitution of 1852|the new document]] in 1852. It was officially prepared by a committee of eighty experts, but was actually drafted by a small group of the Prince-President's inner circle. Under the new constitution, Louis-Napoleon was automatically reelected as president. Under Article Two, the president could now serve an unlimited number of 10-year terms. He alone was given the authority to declare war, sign treaties, form alliances and initiate laws. The Constitution re-established universal male [[suffrage]], and also retained a National Assembly, but with reduced authority.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 277</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon's government imposed new authoritarian measures to control dissent and reduce the power of the opposition. One of his first acts was to settle scores with his old enemy, King Louis-Philippe, who had sent him to prison for life, and who had died in 1850. A decree on 23 January 1852 forbade the late King's family to own property in France and annulled the inheritance he had given to his children before he became King.\n\nThe National Guard, whose members had sometimes joined anti-government demonstrations, was re-organized and largely used only in parades. Government officials were required to wear uniforms at official formal occasions. The Minister of Education was given the power to dismiss professors at the universities and review the content of their courses. Students at the universities were forbidden to wear beards, seen as a symbol of republicanism.<ref name=\"Milsa, Pierre pg. 279\">Milza, 2006, p. 279</ref>\n\n[[File:Gustave Le Gray, Louis-Napol\u00e9on, Prince-President of the Republic, 1852.jpg|thumb|Photographic portrait of Louis Napoleon (1852) by [[Gustave Le Gray]]]]\nAn election was held for a new National Assembly on 29 February 1852, and all the resources of the government were used on behalf of the candidates backing the Prince-President. Of eight million eligible voters, 5,200,000 votes went to the official candidates and 800,000 to opposition candidates. About one third of the eligible voters abstained. The new Assembly included a small number of opponents of Louis Napoleon, including 17 monarchists, 18 conservatives, two liberal democrats, three republicans and 72 independents.<ref>Milsa, 2006, p. 279</ref>\n\nDespite now holding all governing power in the nation, Louis Napoleon was not content with being an authoritarian president. The ink had barely dried on the new, severely authoritarian constitution when he set about making himself emperor. Following the election, the Prince-President went on a triumphal national tour. In Marseille, he laid the cornerstone of a new cathedral, a new stock exchange, and a chamber of commerce. In Bordeaux, on 9 October 1852, he gave his principal speech:\n:Some people say the Empire is war. I say the Empire is peace. Like the Emperor I have many conquests to make\u2026 Like him I wish \u2026 to draw into the stream of the great popular river those hostile side-currents which lose themselves without profit to anyone.

We have ruins to repair, false gods to tear down, truths which we need to make triumph. This is how I see the Empire, if the Empire is re-established.

During his reign, the railway network of France expanded from 3&nbsp;500 kilometers to 20&nbsp;000 kilometers.]]\n[[File:Printemps haussmann1.JPG|thumb|Among the commercial innovations encouraged by Napoleon III were the first department stores. [[Bon March\u00e9]] opened in 1852, followed by Au Printemps in 1865.]]\n\nOne of the first priorities of Napoleon III was the modernization of the French economy, which had fallen far behind that of the United Kingdom and some of the German states. Political economics had long been a passion of the Emperor. While in Britain, he had visited factories and railway yards, and in prison, he had studied and written about the sugar industry and policies to reduce poverty. He wanted the government to play an active, not a passive, role in the economy. In 1839, he had written: \"Government is not a necessary evil, as some people claim; it is instead the benevolent motor for the whole social organism.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 468</ref> He did not advocate the government getting directly involved in industry. Instead, the government took a very active role in building the infrastructure for economic growth; stimulating the stock market and investment banks to provide credit; building railways, ports, canals and roads; and providing training and education. He also opened up French markets to foreign goods, such as railway tracks from England, forcing French industry to become more efficient and more competitive.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 467\u201369</ref>\n\nThe period was favorable for industrial expansion. The gold rushes in [[California Gold Rush|California]] and [[Victorian gold rush|Australia]] increased the European money supply. In the early years of the Empire, the economy also benefited from the coming of age of those born during the baby boom of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] period.<ref>{{harvnb|Plessis|1989|pp=60\u201361}}</ref> The steady rise of prices caused by the increase of the money supply encouraged company promotion and investment of capital.\n\nBeginning in 1852, Napoleon III encouraged the creation of new banks, such as [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier]], which sold shares to the public and provided loans to both private industry and to the government. [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] was founded in 1863 and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] in 1864. These banks provided the funding for Napoleon III's major projects, from railway and canals to the rebuilding of Paris.\n\nIn 1851, France had only 3,500 kilometers of railway, compared with 10,000 kilometers in England and 800 kilometers in [[Belgium]], a country one-twentieth the size of France. Within days of the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851, Napoleon III's Minister of Public Works launched a project to build a railway line around Paris, connecting the different independent lines coming into Paris from around the country. The government provided guarantees for loans to build new lines and urged railway companies to consolidate. There were 18 railway companies in 1848 and six at the end of the Empire. By 1870, France had 20,000 kilometers of railway linked to the French ports and to the railway systems of the neighbouring countries that carried over 100 million passengers a year and transported the products of France's new steel mills, mines and factories.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 471\u201374</ref>\n\n====Development of steamships and early reconstruction on Paris====\n[[File:Travaux nocturnes des constructions de la rue de Rivoli, \u00e9clair\u00e9s par la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique.jpg|thumb|Enormous public works projects reconstructed the center of Paris. Here, work to extend the Rue de Rivoli continues at night by electric light (1854).]]\n\nNew shipping lines were created and ports rebuilt in [[Marseille]] and [[Le Havre]], which connected France by sea to the US, Latin America, North Africa and the Far East. During the Empire, the number of steamships tripled, and by 1870, France possessed the second-largest maritime fleet in the world after England.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 475</ref> Napoleon III backed the greatest maritime project of the age, the construction of the [[Suez Canal]] between 1859 and 1869. The canal project was funded by shares on the [[Paris Bourse|Paris stock market]] and led by a former French diplomat, [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. It was opened by the Empress [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Eug\u00e9nie]] with a performance of [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Aida]].''<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 474</ref>\n\nThe rebuilding of central Paris also encouraged commercial expansion and innovation. The first department store, [[Bon March\u00e9]], opened in Paris in 1852 in a modest building and expanded rapidly, its income increasing from 450,000 francs a year to 20 million. Its founder, [[Aristide Boucicaut]], commissioned a new glass and iron building designed by [[Louis-Charles Boileau]] and [[Gustave Eiffel]] that opened in 1869 and became the model for the modern [[department store]]. Other department stores quickly appeared: [[Printemps|Au Printemps]] in 1865 and [[La Samaritaine]] in 1870. They were soon imitated around the world.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 486</ref>\n\nNapoleon III's program also included reclaiming farmland and reforestation. One such project in the [[Gironde|Gironde department]] drained and reforested 10,000 square kilometers (3,900 square miles) of moorland, creating the [[Landes forest]], the largest maritime pine forest in Europe.\n\n===Reconstruction of Paris (1854\u20131870)===\n{{Main|Haussmann's renovation of Paris}}\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - Avenue de l'Opera - Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts Reims.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra]], one of the new boulevards created by Napoleon III. The new buildings on the boulevards were required to be all of the same height and same basic facade design, and all faced with cream coloured stone, giving the city center its distinctive harmony.]]\nNapoleon III began his regime by launching a series of enormous public works projects in Paris, hiring tens of thousands of workers to improve the sanitation, water supply and traffic circulation of the city. To direct this task, he named a new prefect of the [[Seine department]], [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], and gave him extraordinary powers to rebuild the center of the city. He installed a large map of Paris in a central position in his office, and he and Haussmann planned the new Paris.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice (2009), ''Les jardins du Baron Haussmann'', p. 15</ref>\n\nThe population of Paris had doubled since 1815, with neither an increase in its area nor a development of its structure of very narrow medieval streets and alleys.\n\nTo accommodate the growing population and those who would be forced from the center by the construction of new boulevards and squares, Napoleon III issued a decree in 1860 to [[Municipal annexation|annex]] eleven [[Communes of France|communes]] (municipalities) on the outskirts of Paris and increase the number of [[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]] (city boroughs) from twelve to twenty. Paris was thus enlarged to its modern boundaries with the exception of the two major city parks ([[Bois de Boulogne]] and [[Bois de Vincennes]]) that only became part of the French capital in 1920.\n\nFor the duration of Napoleon III's reign and a decade afterwards, most of Paris was an enormous construction site. His hydraulic chief engineer, [[Eug\u00e8ne Belgrand]], built a new aqueduct to bring clean water from the [[Vanne (river)|Vanne River]] in the [[Champagne (province)|Champagne region]], and a new huge reservoir near the future [[Parc Montsouris]]. These two works increased the water supply of Paris from 87,000 to 400,000 cubic meters of water a day.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice (2009), ''Les jardins du Baron Haussmann'' p. 21</ref> Hundreds of kilometers of pipes distributed the water throughout the city, and a second network, using the less-clean water from the [[Ourcq]] and the [[Seine]], washed the streets and watered the new park and gardens. He completely rebuilt the [[Paris sewers]] and installed miles of pipes to distribute gas for thousands of new [[streetlight]]s along the Paris streets.<ref>Milza, 2006</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1854, in the center of the city, Haussmann's workers tore down hundreds of old buildings and constructed new avenues to connect the central points of the city. Buildings along these avenues were required to be the same height, constructed in a architectural similar style, and be faced with cream-coloured stone to create the signature look of Paris boulevards.\n\nNapoleon III built two new railway stations: the [[Gare de Lyon]] (1855) and the [[Gare du Nord]] (1865). He completed [[Les Halles]], the great cast iron and glass pavilioned produce market in the center of the city, and built a new municipal hospital, the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu, Paris|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]], in the place of crumbling medieval buildings on the [[Ile de la Cit\u00e9]]. The signature architectural landmark was the [[Paris Opera]], the largest theater in the world, designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] to crown the center of Napoleon III's new Paris.<ref>Ayers, Andrew (2004). ''The Architecture of Paris''. Stuttgart; London: Edition Axel Menges. {{ISBN|978-3-930698-96-7}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon III also wanted to build new parks and gardens for the recreation and relaxation of the Parisians, particularly those in the new neighbourhoods of the expanding city.<ref name=\"Jarrasse, Dominique 2007\">Jarrasse, Dominique (2007), ''Grammaire des jardins parisiens'', Parigramme</ref>\n\nNapoleon III's new parks were inspired by his memories of the parks in London, especially [[Hyde Park (London)|Hyde Park]], where he had strolled and promenaded in a carriage while in exile; but he wanted to build on a much larger scale. Working with Haussmann and [[Jean-Charles Alphand]], the engineer who headed the new Service of Promenades and Plantations, he laid out a plan for four major parks at the cardinal points of the compass around the city. Thousands of workers and gardeners began to dig lakes, build cascades, plant lawns, flowerbeds and trees, and construct chalets and grottoes. Napoleon III transformed the [[Bois de Boulogne]] into a park (1852\u201358) to the west of Paris. To the east, he created the [[Bois de Vincennes]] (1860\u201365), and to the north, the [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]] (1865\u201367). The [[Parc Montsouris]] (1865\u201378) was created to the south.<ref name=\"Jarrasse, Dominique 2007\"/>\n\nIn addition to building the four large parks, Napoleon had the city's older parks, including the [[Parc Monceau]], formerly owned by the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans family]], and the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]], refurbished and replanted. He also created some twenty small parks and gardens in the neighbourhoods as miniature versions of his large parks. Alphand termed these small parks \"green and flowering salons\". The intention of Napoleon's plan was to have one park in each of the eighty \"quartiers\" (neighbourhoods) of Paris, so that no one was more than a ten-minute walk from such a park. The parks were an immediate success with all classes of Parisians.<ref>Jarrasse, Dominque (2007), Grammmaire des jardins Parisiens, Parigramme. p. 134</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Adolphe Yvon - Haussmann pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'Empereur le plan d'annexion des Communes.jpg|[[Baron Haussmann]] and Napoleon III make official the annexation of eleven communes around Paris to the City.

The architect, [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], described the style simply as \"Napoleon the Third\".\nFile:Bois de Boulogne.jpeg|The [[Bois de Boulogne]], transformed by Napoleon III between 1852 and 1858, was designed to give a place for relaxation and recreation to all the classes of Paris.\n</gallery>\n\n===Search for a wife===\n[[File:Imperatrice Eug\u00e9nie - Winterhalter - 1853.jpg|thumb|Empress Eug\u00e9nie in 1853, after her marriage to Napoleon III (by Franz Xaver Winterhalter)]]\n\nSoon after becoming emperor, Napoleon III began searching for a wife to give him an heir. He was still attached to his companion [[Harriet Howard]], who attended receptions at the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] and traveled around France with him. He quietly sent a diplomatic delegation to approach the family of Princess [[Carola of Vasa]], the granddaughter of deposed King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]]. They declined because of his Catholic religion and the political uncertainty about his future, as did the family of [[Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]], a niece of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nLouis-Napoleon finally announced that he found the right woman: a Spaniard called [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Eug\u00e9nie du Derje de Montijo]], age 23, 20th [[Count of Teba|Countess of Teba]] and 15th Marchioness of [[Ardales]]. She received much of her education in Paris. Her beauty attracted Louis-Napoleon, who, as was his custom, tried to seduce her, but Eug\u00e9nie told him to wait for marriage. The civil ceremony took place at [[Tuileries Palace]] on 22 January 1853, and a much grander ceremony was held a few days later at the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. In 1856, Eug\u00e9nie gave birth to a son and heir-apparent, [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 199\u2013204</ref>\n\n[[File:Empress Eugenie with her son 1862.jpg|thumb|Eug\u00e9nie and the Prince Imperial in 1862]]\n\nWith an heir to the throne secured, Napoleon III resumed his \"petites distractions\" with other women. Eug\u00e9nie faithfully performed the duties of an empress, entertaining guests and accompanying the Emperor to balls, opera, and theater. She traveled to Egypt to open the [[Suez Canal]] and officially represented him whenever he traveled outside France.\n\nThough a fervent Catholic and conservative on many other issues, she strongly advocated equality for women. She pressured the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]] to give the first [[baccalaur\u00e9at|baccalaureate]] diploma to a woman and tried unsuccessfully to induce the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] to elect the writer [[George Sand]] as its first female member.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 204\u201310</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy (1852\u20131860)==\nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world as a supporter of [[popular sovereignty]] and [[nationalism]].<ref>John B.

French troops assisted [[Italian unification]] by fighting on the side of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. In return, France received [[Savoy]] and the county of [[Nice]] in 1860. Later, however, to appease fervent French Catholics, he sent soldiers to defend the residual [[Papal States]] against annexation by Italy.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 285884|title = The Good Napoleon III|journal = French Historical Studies|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = 308\u2013329|last1 = Spitzer|first1 = Alan B.|year = 1962|doi = 10.2307/285884}}</ref><ref>Lynn Case, ''French opinion on war and diplomacy during the Second Empire'' (1954).</ref>\n\n===Principle of Nationalities===\n[[File:Abd-EL-Kader-And-Napoleon-III.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III and [[Abdelkader El Djezairi]], the Algerian military leader who led a struggle against the [[French conquest of Algeria|French invasion of Algeria]]]]\n\nIn a speech at Bordeaux shortly after becoming Emperor, Napoleon III proclaimed that \"The Empire means peace\" (\"''L'Empire, c'est la paix''\"), reassuring foreign governments that he would not attack other European powers in order to extend the French Empire. He was, however, determined to follow a strong foreign policy to extend France's influence and warned that he would not stand by and allow another European power to threaten its neighbour.\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, he was also an advocate of a new \"principle of nationalities\" (''principe des nationalit\u00e9s'') that supported the creation of new states [[nation-state|based on nationality]], such as Italy, in place of the old multinational empires, such as the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (or [[Empire of Austria]], known since 1867 as [[Austria-Hungary]]). In this he was influenced by his uncle's policy as described in the ''M\u00e9morial de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne''. In all of his foreign policy ventures, he put the interests of France first. Napoleon III felt that new states created on the basis of national identity would become natural allies and partners of France.<ref>Roger Price, ''The French Second Empire: an anatomy of political power'' (2001) p. 43</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Britain and the Crimean War (1853\u20131856)===\n{{Main|Crimean War}}\n[[File:William Simpson - Attack on the Malakoff.jpg|thumb|The French capture of Russian positions around [[Sevastopol]] brought the end of the [[Crimean War]].]]\n\n[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] as Britain's foreign minister and prime minister had close personal ties with leading French statesmen, notably Napoleon III himself.

[[John Thadeus Delane|John Delane]], editor of ''[[The Times]]'', visited France in January 1853 and was impressed by its military preparedness. He expressed his conviction that \"Louis-Napoleon was resolved on a forward foreign policy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/articles/palmerstons-follies-a-reply-to-the-french-threat/|title='Palmerston's Follies': a reply to the French 'threat'|last=Hicks|first=Peter|date=2016|website=NAPOLEON.org \u2013 The History Website of the Fondation Napoleon|access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref> Napoleon III was actually determined to increase the country\u2019s naval power. The first purpose-built steam-powered battleship (worryingly christened after [[French battleship Napol\u00e9on|Napoleon I]]) was launched in 1850, and the fortification of [[Cherbourg-en-Cotentin|Cherbourg]] was strengthened. This led to the extension of the breakwater of [[Alderney]] and the construction of [[Fort Clonque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/fort-clonque-7423|title=Fort Clonque Alderney, Channel Islands|date=2018|website=The Landmark Trust|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrom the start of his Empire, Napoleon III sought an alliance with Britain. He had lived there while in exile and saw Britain as a natural partner in the projects he wished to accomplish. An opportunity soon presented itself: In early 1853, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] put pressure on the weak [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] government, demanding that the [[Ottoman Empire]] give Russia a protectorate over the Christian countries of the [[Balkans]] as well as control over [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Dardanelles]]. The Ottoman Empire, backed by Britain and France, refused Russia's demands, and a joint British-French fleet was sent to support the Ottoman Empire. When Russia refused to leave the [[Romania|Romanian territories]] it had occupied, Britain and France declared war on 27 March 1854.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 382-386\">Milza, 2006, pp. 382\u201386</ref>\n\nIt took France and Britain six months to organize a full-scale military expedition to the [[Black Sea]]. The Anglo-French fleet landed thirty thousand French and twenty thousand British soldiers in the [[Crimea]] on 14 September and began to [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)|lay siege]] to the major Russian port of [[Sevastopol]]. As the siege dragged on, the French and British armies were reinforced and troops from the Kingdom of Sardinia joined them, reaching a total of 140,000 soldiers, but they suffered terribly from epidemics of [[typhus]], [[dysentery]], and [[cholera]]. During the 332 days of the siege, the French lost 95,000 soldiers, including 75,000 due to disease. The suffering of the army in the Crimea was carefully concealed from the French public by press censorship.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 388\u201389</ref>\n\n[[File:Courtine de Malakoff, 8 septembre 1855 par Adolphe Yvon.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Malakoff]], 8 September 1855]]\nThe death of Tsar Nicholas I on 2 March 1855 and his replacement by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] changed the political equation. In September, after a massive bombardment, the Anglo-French army of fifty thousand men stormed the Russian positions, and the Russians were forced to evacuate Sevastopol. Alexander II sought a political solution, and negotiations were held in Paris in the new building of the French Foreign Ministry on the [[Quai d'Orsay]], from 25 February to 8 April 1856.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 382-386\"/>\n\nThe Crimean War added three new place names to Paris: [[Pont de l'Alma|Alma]], named for the first French victory on the river of that name; [[Boulevard de S\u00e9bastopol|Sevastopol]]; and [[Malakoff]], named for a tower in the center of the Russian line [[Battle of Malakoff|captured by the French]]. The war had two important diplomatic consequences: Alexander II became an ally of France, and Britain and France were reconciled. In April 1855, Napoleon III and Eug\u00e9nie went to England and were received by the Queen; in turn, Victoria and Prince Albert visited Paris. Victoria was the first British monarch to do so in centuries.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 392\u201395</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Russia and the alliance with Britain gave France increased authority and prestige in Europe. This was the first war between European powers since the close of the Napoleonic Wars and the [[Congress of Vienna]], marking a breakdown of the alliance system that had maintained peace for nearly half a century. The war also effectively ended the [[Concert of Europe]] and the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]], or \"Waterloo Coalition,\" that the other four powers (Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain) had established. The [[Congress of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Conference of 1856]] represented a high-water mark for Napoleon's regime in foreign affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1975|p=199}}</ref> It encouraged Napoleon III to make an even bolder foreign policy venture in Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan J.

A group of conspirators threw three bombs at the royal carriage as it made its way to the opera. Eight members of the escort and bystanders were killed and over one hundred people injured. The culprits were quickly arrested. The leader was an Italian nationalist, [[Felice Orsini]], who was aided by a French surgeon [[Simon Fran\u00e7ois Bernard|Simon Bernard]]. They believed that if Napoleon III were killed, a republican revolt would immediately follow in France, and the new republican government would help all Italian states win independence from Austria and achieve national unification. Bernard was in London at the time. Since he was a political exile, the British government refused to extradite him, but Orsini was tried, convicted and executed on 13 March 1858. The bombing focused the attention of France, and particularly of Napoleon III, on the issue of Italian nationalism.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 407\u201312</ref>\n\nPart of Italy, particularly the kingdom of [[Piedmont]]-[[Sardinia]] (officially the \"Kingdom of Sardinia\"), was independent, but central Italy was still ruled by the Pope (in this era, [[Pope Pius IX and Italy|Pope Pius IX]]), while [[Venice]], [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy]] and much of the north was [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|ruled by Austria]]. Other states were [[de jure]] independent (e.g. the [[Duchy of Parma]] or the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]) but [[de facto]] totally under Austrian influence. Napoleon III had fought with the Italian patriots against the Austrians when he was young, and his sympathy was with them, but the Empress, most of his government and the Catholic Church in France supported the Pope and the existing governments. The British Government was also hostile to the idea of promoting nationalism in Italy. Despite the opposition in his government and in his own palace, Napoleon III did all that he could to support the cause of Piedmont-Sardinia. The King of Piedmont-Sardinia, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], was invited to Paris in November 1855, and given the same royal treatment as Queen Victoria.\n\n[[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Count Cavour]], the Prime Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia, came to Paris with the King and employed an unusual emissary in his efforts to win the support of Napoleon III: his beautiful young cousin, [[Virginia Oldoini, Countess of Castiglione]] (1837\u201399). As Cavour had hoped, she caught his eye and became his mistress. Between 1855 and 1857, she used the opportunity to pass messages and to plead the Italian cause.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 357\u201362</ref>\n\nIn July 1858, Napoleon arranged a secret visit by Count Cavour. They agreed to join forces and drive the Austrians from Italy. In exchange, Napoleon III asked for Savoy (the ancestral land of the King of Piedmont-Sardinia) and the then bilingual county of Nice, which had been taken from France after Napoleon's fall in 1815 and given to Piedmont-Sardinia. Cavour protested that Nice was Italian, but Napoleon responded that \"these are secondary questions. There will be time later to discuss them.\"<ref>cited in Milza, 2006, p. 414</ref>\n\nAssured of the support of Napoleon III, Count Cavour began to prepare the army of Piedmont-Sardinia for war against Austria. Napoleon III looked for diplomatic support. He approached [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], and the British Government; Britain was against the war, but agreed to remain neutral. Still facing strong opposition within his own government, Napoleon III offered to negotiate a diplomatic solution with the twenty-eight-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] in the spring of 1858. The Austrians demanded the disarmament of Piedmont-Sardinia first, and sent a fleet with thirty thousand soldiers to reinforce their garrisons in Italy. Napoleon III responded on 26 January 1859 by signing a treaty of alliance with Piedmont-Sardinia. Napoleon promised to send two hundred thousand soldiers to help one hundred thousand soldiers from Piedmont-Sardinia to force the Austrians out of northern Italy; in return, France would receive the county of Nice and Savoy provided that their populations would agree in a referendum.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 415\u201320</ref>\n\nIt was the Emperor Franz Joseph, growing impatient, who finally unleashed the war. On 23 April 1859, he sent an ultimatum to the government of Piedmont-Sardinia demanding that they stop their military preparations and disband their army. On 26 April, Count Cavour rejected the demands, and on 27 April, the Austrian army invaded Piedmont.\n\n====War in Italy \u2013 Magenta and Solferino (1859)====\n[[File:Yvon Bataille de Solferino Compiegne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Napoleon III with the French forces at the [[Battle of Solferino]], which secured the Austrian withdrawal from Italy. He was horrified by the casualties, and ended the war soon after the battle.]]\n\nNapoleon III, though he had very little military experience, decided to lead the French army in Italy himself. Part of the French army crossed over the Alps, while the other part, with the Emperor, landed in [[Genoa]] on 18 May 1859. Fortunately for Napoleon and the Piedmontese, the commander of the Austrians, General Giulay, was not very aggressive. His forces greatly outnumbered the Piedmontese army at Turin, but he hesitated, allowing the French and Piedmontese to unite their forces.\n\nNapoleon III wisely left the fighting to his professional generals. The first great battle of the war, on 4 June 1859, [[Battle of Magenta|was fought]] at the town of [[Magenta, Lombardy|Magenta]]. It was long and bloody, and the French center was exhausted and nearly broken, but the battle was finally won by a timely attack on the Austrian flank by the soldiers of General MacMahon. The Austrians had seven thousand men killed and five thousand captured, while the French forces had four thousand men killed. The battle was largely remembered because, soon after it was fought, patriotic chemists in France gave the name of the battle to their newly discovered bright purple chemical dye; the dye and the colour took the name [[magenta]].<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 425</ref>\n\nThe rest of the Austrian army was able to escape while Napoleon III and King Victor Emmanuel made a triumphal entry on 10 June into the city of [[Milan]], previously ruled by the Austrians. They were greeted by huge, jubilant crowds waving Italian and French flags.\n\nThe Austrians had been driven from Lombardy, but the army of General Giulay remained in the region of Venice. His army had been reinforced and numbered 130,000 men, roughly the same as the French and Piedmontese, though the Austrians were superior in artillery. On 24 June, the [[Battle of Solferino|second and decisive battle]] was fought at [[Solferino]]. This battle was even longer and bloodier than Magenta. In confused and often ill-directed fighting, there were approximately forty thousand casualties, including 11,500 French. Napoleon III was horrified by the thousands of dead and wounded on the battlefield. He proposed an armistice to the Austrians, which was accepted on 8 July. A formal treaty ending the war was signed on 11 July 1859.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 427\u201328</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVoSBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=Armistice+of+Villafranca#v=onepage&q=Armistice%20of%20Villafranca&f=false|title=Italy in the Age of the Risorgimento 1790\u20131870|last=Hearder|first=Harry|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317872061|location=|page=226|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCount Cavour and the Piedmontese were bitterly disappointed by the abrupt end of the war. Lombardy had been freed, but [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Venetia]] (the Venice region) was still controlled by the Austrians, and the Pope was still the ruler of Rome and Central Italy. Cavour angrily resigned his post. Napoleon III returned to Paris on 17 July, and a huge parade and celebration were held on 14 August, in front of the [[Place Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me column]], the symbol of the glory of Napoleon I. Napoleon III celebrated the day by granting a general amnesty to the political prisoners and exiles he had chased from France.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 431</ref>\n\nIn Italy, even without the French army, the process of Italian unification launched by Cavour and Napoleon III took on a momentum of its own. There were uprisings in central Italy and the Papal states, and Italian patriots, led by Garibaldi, [[Expedition of the Thousand|invaded and took over]] Sicily, which would lead to the collapse of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Napoleon III wrote to the Pope and suggested that he \"make the sacrifice of your provinces in revolt and confide them to Victor Emmanuel\". The Pope, furious, declared in a public address that Napoleon III was a \"liar and a cheat\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 260</ref> Rome and the surrounding [[Latium]] region remained in Papal hands, and therefore did not immediately become the capital of the newly created Kingdom of Italy, and Venetia was still occupied by the Austrians, but the rest of Italy had come under the rule of Victor Emmanuel.\n\nAs Cavour had promised, Savoy and the county of Nice were annexed by France in 1860 after referendums, although it is disputed how fair they were. In Nice, 25,734 voted for union with France, just 260 against, but Italians still called for its return into the 20th century. On 18 February 1861, the first Italian parliament met in Turin, and on 23 March, Victor Emmanuel was proclaimed King of Italy. Count Cavour died a few weeks later, declaring that \"Italy is made.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 434\u201341</ref>\n\nNapoleon's support for the Italian patriots and his confrontation with Pope Pius IX over who would govern Rome made him unpopular with fervent French Catholics, and even with Empress Eug\u00e9nie, who was a fervent Catholic. To win over the French Catholics and his wife, he agreed to guarantee that Rome would remain under the Pope and independent from the rest of Italy, and agreed to keep French troops there. The capital of Italy became Turin (in 1861) then Florence (in 1865), not Rome. However, in 1862, Garibaldi gathered an army to march on Rome, under the slogan, \"Rome or death\".{{sfn|Briggs|Clavin|2003|page=97}} To avoid a confrontation between Garibaldi and the French soldiers, the Italian government [[Battle of Aspromonte|sent its own soldiers]] to face them, arrested Garibaldi and put him in prison. Napoleon III sought, but was unable to find, a diplomatic solution that would allow him to withdraw French troops from Rome while guaranteeing that the city would remain under Papal control.\n[[File:CousinMontaubanCampaignOf1860.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Cousin-Montauban, Comte de Palikao|Cousin-Montauban]] leading French forces during the [[Second Opium War|Anglo-French expedition to China]]]]\n\nGaribaldi made another attempt to capture Rome in November 1867, but was defeated by the French and Papal troops near the town of [[Mentana]] on 3 November 1867.\n\nThe garrison of eight thousand French troops remained in Rome until August 1870, when they were recalled at the start of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. In September 1870, Garibaldi's soldiers finally entered Rome and made it the capital of Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 325\u201328</ref>\n\nAfter the successful conclusion of the Italian campaign and the annexation of Savoy and Nice to the territory of France, the Continental foreign policy of Napoleon III entered a calmer period. Expeditions to distant corners of the world and the expansion of the Empire replaced major changes in the map of Europe. The Emperor's health declined; he gained weight, he began to dye his hair to cover the gray, he walked slowly because of [[gout]], and in 1864, at the military camp of [[Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne]], he suffered the first medical crisis from his [[gallstones]], the ailment that killed him nine years later. He was less engaged in governing and less attentive to detail, but still sought opportunities to increase French commerce and prestige globally.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 309\u201310</ref>\n\n===Overseas empire===\n{{main|French colonial empire#Napoleon III: 1852\u20131870}}\n\n====Establishing a Mexican empire====\n[[File:Arrival of Marshal Randon in Algier-Ernest-Francis Vacherot mg 5120.jpg|thumb|Arrival of Marshal [[Jacques Louis Randon|Randon]] in [[Algiers]] in 1857]]\n\nIn 1862, Napoleon III [[French intervention in Mexico|sent troops]] to Mexico in an effort to establish an allied monarchy in the Americas, with Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] enthroned as [[Emperor of Mexico|Emperor]] [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]]. The [[Second Mexican Empire]] faced resistance from the republican government of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], however. After victory in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, the United States made clear that France would have to leave. It sent 50,000 troops under General [[Philip H. Sheridan]] to the U.S.-Mexico border and helped resupply Ju\u00e1rez. Napoleon's military was stretched very thin; he had committed 40,000 troops to Mexico, 20,000 to Rome to guard the Pope against the Italians, and another 80,000 in restive Algeria. Furthermore, Prussia, having just defeated Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, was an imminent threat. Napoleon realized his predicament and withdrew his troops from Mexico in 1866. Maximilian was overthrown and executed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Don H.

The palace was given that name because the neighbourhood in which it had been built in 1564 was previously known for its numerous mason and tiler businesses.\n\nNapoleon III's bedroom was decorated with a talisman from [[Charlemagne]] (a symbol of good luck for the Bonaparte family), while his office featured a portrait of [[Julius Caesar]] by [[Ingres]] and a large map of Paris that he used to show his ideas for the reconstruction of Paris to his prefect of the Seine department, [[Baron Haussmann]]. The Emperor's rooms were overheated and were filled with smoke, as he smoked cigarette after cigarette. The Empress occupied a suite of rooms just above his, highly decorated in the style of Louis XVI with a pink salon, a green salon and a blue salon.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 200\u201301</ref>\n\nThe court moved with the Emperor and Empress from palace to palace each year following a regular calendar. At the beginning of May, the Emperor and court moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud]] for outdoor activities in the park. In June and July, they moved with selected guests to the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] for walks in the forest and boating on the lake. In July, the court moved to thermal baths for a health cure, first to [[Plombi\u00e8res]], then to [[Vichy]], and then, after 1856, to the military camp and residence built at [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]] (nowadays: Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne), where Napoleon could take the waters and review military parades and exercises. Beginning in 1856, the Emperor and Empress spent each September in [[Biarritz]] in the [[Villa Eug\u00e9nie]], a large villa overlooking the sea.<ref>[http://thegrandhotelsoftheworld.com/palais/ \"History of the Hotel du Palais, the former Villa Eugenie\"]. Grand Hotels of the World.com</ref> They would walk on the beach or travel to the mountains, and in the evenings they would dance and sing and play cards and take part in other games and amateur theatricals and charades with their guests. In November, the court moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne]] for forest excursions, dancing and more games. Famous scientists and artists, such as [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] and Giuseppe [[Verdi]], were invited to participate in the festivities at Compi\u00e8gne.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 202\u201304</ref>\n\nAt the end of the year the Emperor and Court returned to the Tuileries Palace and gave a series of formal receptions and three or four grand balls with six hundred guests early in the new year. Visiting dignitaries and monarchs were frequently invited. During [[Carnival]], there were a series of very elaborate costume balls on the themes of different countries and different historical periods, for which guests sometimes spent small fortunes on their costumes.\n\n===Visual Arts===\n{{main|Napoleon III style|Paris during the Second Empire}}\n[[File:\u00c9douard Manet - Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|When [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and other [[avant-garde]] paintings were rejected by the [[Paris Salon]] of 1863, Napoleon III ordered that the works be displayed, so that the public could judge for themselves.]]\n\nNapoleon III had conservative and traditional taste in art: his favourite painters were [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]], who received major commissions, and whose work was purchased for state museums. At the same time, he followed public opinion, and he made an important contribution to the French [[avant-garde]]. In 1863, the jury of the [[Paris Salon]], the famous annual showcase of French painting, headed by the ultra-conservative director of the Academy of Fine Arts, Count  [[\u00c9milien de Nieuwerkerke]], refused all submissions by avant-garde artists, including those by [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Johan Jongkind]]. The artists and their friends complained, and the complaints reached Napoleon III. His office issued a statement: \"Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition. His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry.\"<ref>Published in ''Le Moniteur'' on 24 April 1863.

More than a thousand visitors a day came to see now-famous paintings such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and James McNeill Whistler's ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''. '<ref>Meneglier, Herv\u00e9, ''Paris Imp\u00e9rial \u2013 la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire''</ref> The journalist [[\u00c9mile Zola]] reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galeries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter and mocking comments of many of the spectators. While the paintings were ridiculed by many critics and visitors, the work of the avant-garde became known for the first time to the French public, and it took its place alongside the more traditional style of painting.<ref>Meneglier, Herv\u00e9, ''Paris Imp\u00e9rial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire,'' \u00c9ditions Armand Colin, (1990). p. 173</ref>\n[[File:Carcasonneouterwall.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Napoleon III commissioned [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]] to restore the medieval town of [[Carcassonne]] in 1853.]]\nNapoleon III also began or completed the restoration of several important historic landmarks, carried out for him by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. He restored the [[fl\u00e8che]], or spire, of the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], which had been partially destroyed and desecrated during the [[French Revolution]]. In 1855, he completed the restoration, begun in 1845, of the stained glass windows of the [[Sainte-Chapelle]], and in 1862, he declared it a national historical monument. In 1853, he approved and provided funding for Viollet-le-Duc's restoration of the medieval town of [[Carcassonne]]. He also sponsored Viollet-le-Duc's restoration of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]] and the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], In 1862, he closed the prison which had occupied the Abbey of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]] since the French Revolution, where many important political prisoners had been held, so it could be restored and opened to the public.\n\n==Social and economic policies==\n\n===Social policy and reforms===\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Napoleon III launched a series of social reforms aimed at improving the life of the working class. He began with small projects, such as opening up two clinics in Paris for sick and injured workers, a program of legal assistance to those unable to afford it, and subsidies to companies that built low-cost housing for their workers. He outlawed the practice of employers taking possession of or making comments in the work document that every employee was required to carry; negative comments meant that workers were unable to get other jobs. In 1866, he encouraged the creation of a state insurance fund to help workers or peasants who became disabled, and to help their widows and families.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 314</ref>\n\nTo help the working class, Napoleon III offered a prize to anyone who could develop an inexpensive substitute for butter; the prize was won by the French chemist [[Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s]], who in 1869 patented a product he named oleomargarine, later shortened simply to [[margarine]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 313</ref>\n\n====Rights to strike and organize (1864\u20131866)====\n\nHis most important social reform was the 1864 law that gave French workers the right to strike, which had been forbidden since 1810. In 1866, he added to this an \"Edict of Tolerance,\" which gave factory workers the right to organize. He issued a decree regulating the treatment of apprentices, limited working hours on Sundays and holidays, and removed from the [[Napoleonic Code]] the infamous article 1781, which said that the declaration of the employer, even without proof, would be given more weight by the court than the word of the employee.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 314\u201317</ref>\n\n====Education for girls and women, and school reform (1861\u20131869)====\n[[File:J.V Daubi\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|In 1861, through the direct intervention of the Emperor and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie, [[Julie-Victoire Daubi\u00e9]] became the first woman to receive a [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] diploma.]]\n\nNapoleon III and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie worked to give girls and women greater access to public education.

Duruy accelerated the pace of the reforms, often coming into conflict with the Catholic church, which wanted the leading role in education. Despite the opposition of the church, Duruy opened schools for girls in each commune with more than five hundred residents, a total of eight hundred new schools.<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 592\">Milza, 2006, p. 592</ref>\n\n[[File:Victorduruy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Victor Duruy]], Napol\u00e9on III's Minister of Public Education from 1863 to 1869, created schools for girls in every commune of France and women were admitted for the first time to medical school and to the [[Sorbonne]].]]\nBetween 1863 and 1869, Duruy created scholastic libraries for fifteen thousand schools and required that primary schools offer courses in history and geography. Secondary schools began to teach philosophy, which had been banned by the previous regime at the request of the Catholic church. For the first time, public schools in France began to teach contemporary history, modern languages, art, gymnastics and music. The results of the school reforms were dramatic: in 1852, over 40 percent of army conscripts in France were unable to read or write, yet by 1869, the number had dropped to 25 percent. The rate of illiteracy among both girls and boys dropped to 32 percent.\n<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 592\"/>\n\nAt the university level, Napoleon III founded new faculties in [[Marseille]], [[Douai]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Clermont-Ferrand]] and [[Poitiers]] and founded a network of research institutes of higher studies in the sciences, history, and economics. These also were criticized by the Catholic Church. The Cardinal-Archbishop of Rouen, [[Henri-Marie-Gaston Boisnormand de Bonnechose|Monseigneur Bonnechose]], wrote, \"True science is religious, while false science, on the other hand, is vain and prideful; being unable to explain God, it rebels against him.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 598</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\n\n====Lower tariffs and the opening of French markets (1860)====\nOne of the centerpieces of the economic policy of Napoleon III was the lowering of tariffs and the opening of French markets to imported goods. He had been in Britain in 1846 when Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] had lowered tariffs on imported grains, and he had seen the benefits to British consumers and the British economy. However, he faced bitter opposition from many French industrialists and farmers, who feared British competition. Convinced he was right, he sent his chief economic advisor, [[Michel Chevalier]], to London to begin discussions, and secretly negotiated a [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty|new commercial agreement]] with Britain, calling for the gradual lowering of tariffs in both countries. He signed the treaty, without consulting with the Assembly, on 23 January 1860. Four hundred of the top industrialists in France came to Paris to protest, but he refused to yield. Industrial tariffs on such products as steel rails for railways were lowered first; tariffs on grains were not lowered until June 1861. Similar agreements were negotiated with the Netherlands, Italy, and France's other neighbors. France's industries were forced to modernize and become more efficient to compete with the British, as Napoleon III had intended. Commerce between the countries surged.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 241\u201343</ref>\n\n====Economic expansion and social change====\nBy the 1860s, the huge state investment in railways, infrastructure and fiscal policies of Napoleon III had brought dramatic changes to the French economy and French society. French people travelled in greater numbers, more often and farther than they had ever travelled before. The opening of the first public school libraries by Napoleon III and the opening by [[Louis Hachette]] of the first bookstores in Napoleon's new train stations led to the wider circulation of books around France.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 304</ref>\n\nDuring the Empire, industrial production increased by 73 percent, growing twice as rapidly as that of the United Kingdom, though its total output remained lower. From 1850 to 1857, the French economy grew at a pace of five percent a year and exports grew by sixty percent between 1855 and 1869.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe pp. 306-307\">S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 306\u201307</ref>\n\nFrench agricultural production increased by sixty percent, spurred by new farming techniques taught at the agricultural schools started in each [[Departments of France|Department]] by Napoleon III, and new markets opened by the railways. The threat of famine, which for centuries had haunted the French countryside, receded. The last recorded famine in France was in 1855.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe pp. 306-307\"/>\n\nDuring the Empire, the migration of the rural population to the cities increased. The portion of the population active in agriculture dropped from 61 percent in 1851 to 54 percent in 1870.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe p. 309\">S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 309</ref>\n\nThe average salary of French workers grew by 45 percent during the Second Empire, but only kept up with price inflation. On the other hand, more French people than ever were able to save money; the number of bank accounts grew from 742,889 in 1852 to 2,079,141 in 1870.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe p. 309\"/>\n\n====Growing opposition and liberal concessions (1860\u20131870)====\nDespite the economic progress the country had made, domestic opposition to Napoleon III was slowly growing, particularly in the ''[[Corps l\u00e9gislatif]]'' (Parliament). The republicans on the left had always opposed him, believing he had usurped power and suppressed the Republic. The conservative Catholics were increasingly unhappy, because he had abandoned the Pope in his struggle to retain political control of the Papal States and had built up a public education system that was a rival to the Catholic system. Many businessmen, particularly in the metallurgical and textile industries, were unhappy, because he had reduced the tariffs on British products, putting the British products in direct competition with their own. The members of Parliament were particularly unhappy with him for dealing with them only when he needed money. When he had liberalized trade with England, he had not even consulted them.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 345\u201346</ref>\n\nNapoleon's large-scale program of public works, and his expensive foreign policy, had created rapidly mounting government debts; the annual deficit was about 100 million gold-francs, and the cumulative debt had reached nearly 1,000 million gold-francs (1 billion in US readings). The Emperor needed to restore the confidence of the business world and to involve the legislature and have them share responsibility.\n[[File:Alexandre Cabanel 002.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III in 1865]]\n[[File:Ten centimes 1855.JPG|thumb|Ten [[centime]] coin, 1855]]\nOn 24 December 1861, Napoleon III, against the opposition of his own ministers, issued a decree announcing that the legislature would have greater powers. The Senate and the Assembly could, for the first time, give a response to the Emperor's program, ministers were obliged to defend their programs before the Assembly, and the right of [[Deputy (France)|Deputies]] to amend the programs was enlarged. On 1 February 1861, further reforms were announced: Deputies could speak from the tribune, not just from their seats, and a stenographic record would be made and published of each session. Another even more important reform was announced on 31 December 1861: the budget of each ministry would be voted section by section, not in a block, and the government could no longer spend money by special decree when the legislature was not in session. He did retain the right to change the budget estimates section by section.\n\nThe Deputies quickly took advantage of their new rights; the Emperor's Italian policy was bitterly condemned in Parliament, and anti-government amendments by the pro-Catholic deputies were defeated by votes of 158 to 91 in the ''Corps l\u00e9gislatif'' and 79 to 61 in the Senate.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 346\u201347</ref>\n\nIn the legislative elections of 31 May 1863, the pro-government candidates received 5,308,000 votes, while the opposition received 1,954,000 votes, three times more than in the previous elections. The rural departments still voted for Napoleon III's candidates, but in Paris, 63 percent of the votes went to anti-government republican candidates, with similar numbers in all the large cities. The new Assembly contained a large opposition block ranging from Catholics outraged by the Papal policies to [[Legitimists]], [[Orl\u00e9anist]]s, [[protectionism|protectionists]] and republicans, armed with new powers given to them by the Emperor himself.<ref>Alain Plessis, ''The Rise and Fall of the Second Empire, 1852\u20131871'' (1988)</ref><ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 568\u201369</ref>\n\nDespite the opposition in the legislature, Napoleon III's reforms remained popular in the rest of the country. A new [[1870 French constitutional referendum|plebiscite was held in 1870]], on this text: \"The people approve the liberal reforms added to the Constitution since 1860 by the Emperor, with the agreement of the legislative bodies and ratified by the Senate on April 20, 1870.\" Napoleon III saw this as a referendum on his rule as Emperor: \"By voting yes,\" he wrote, \"you will chase away the threat of revolution; you will place the nation on a solid base of order and liberty, and you will make it easier to pass on the Crown to my son.\" When the votes were counted, Napoleon III had lost Paris and the other big cities but decisively won the rest of the country. The final vote was 7,336,434 votes yes, 1,560,709 votes no, and 1,900,000 abstentions. [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], the leader of the republican opposition, wrote in despair, \"We were crushed. The Emperor is more popular than ever.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 370</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n\n===Declining health and rise of Prussia===\nThrough the 1860s, the health of the Emperor steadily worsened. It had been damaged by his six years in prison at Ham; he had chronic pains in his legs and feet, particularly when it was cold, and as a result, he always lived and worked in overheated rooms and offices. He smoked heavily. He distrusted doctors, disregarded medical advice and attributed any problems simply to \"rheumatism\", for which he regularly visited the hot springs at [[Vichy]] and other spas. It became difficult for him to ride a horse, and he was obliged to walk slowly, often with a cane. From 1869 onwards, the crises of his urinary tract were treated with [[opium]], which made him seem lethargic and apathetic. His writing became hard to read and his voice weak. In the spring of 1870, he was visited by an old friend from England, [[James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]]. Malmesbury found him to be \"terribly changed and very ill\".<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 449</ref>\n\nThe health problems of the Emperor were kept secret by the government, which feared that, if his condition became public, the opposition would demand his abdication. One newspaper, the ''Courrier de la Vienne'', was warned by the censors to stop publishing articles which had \"a clear and malicious intent to spread, contrary to the truth, alarms about the health of the Emperor\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 338</ref>\n\nAt the end of June 1870, a specialist in the problems of urinary tracts, [[Germain S\u00e9e]], was finally summoned to examine him. S\u00e9e reported that the Emperor was suffering from a [[gallstone]]. On 2 July, four eminent French doctors, N\u00e9laton, Ricord, Fauvel and Corvisart, examined him and confirmed the diagnosis. They were reluctant to operate, however, because of the high risk (gallstone operations did not become relatively safe until the 1880s) and because of the Emperor's weakness. Before anything further could be done, however, France was in the middle of a diplomatic crisis.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 450</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, [[Prussia]] appeared on the horizon as a new rival to French power in Europe. Its chancellor, [[Otto von Bismarck]], had ambitions for Prussia to lead a [[German unification|unified Germany]]. In May 1862, Bismarck came to Paris on a diplomatic mission and met Napoleon III for the first time. They had cordial relations. On 30 September 1862, however, in Munich, Bismarck declared, in a famous speech: \"It is not by speeches and votes of the majority that the great questions of our period will be settled, as one believed in 1848, but by [[Blood and Iron (speech)|iron and blood]].\" Bismarck saw Austria and France as the main obstacles to his ambitions, and he set out to divide and defeat them.\n\n===Search for allies, and war between Austria and Prussia===\n\nIn the winter and spring of 1864, when the [[North German Confederation]] (and southern German allies) [[Second Schleswig War|invaded and occupied]] the German-speaking provinces of [[Denmark]] ([[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]), Napoleon III recognized the threat that a unified Germany would pose to France, and he looked for allies to challenge Germany, without success.\n\nThe British government was suspicious that Napoleon wanted to take over Belgium and Luxembourg, felt secure with its powerful navy, and did not want any military engagements on the European continent at the side of the French.\n\nThe Russian government was also suspicious of Napoleon, whom it believed had encouraged Polish nationalists to [[January Uprising|rebel against Russian rule]] in 1863. Bismarck and Prussia, on the other hand, had offered assistance to Russia to help crush the Polish patriots.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 376\u201377</ref>\n\nIn October 1865, Napoleon had a cordial meeting with Bismarck at [[Biarritz]]. They discussed Venetia, Austria's remaining province in Italy. Bismarck told Napoleon that Germany had no secret arrangement to give Venetia to Italy, and Napoleon assured him in turn that France had no secret understanding with Austria. Bismarck hinted vaguely that, in the event of a war between Austria and Prussia, French neutrality would be rewarded with some sort of territory as a compensation. Napoleon III had Luxembourg in mind.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 649</ref>\n\nIn 1866, relations between Austria and Prussia worsened and Bismarck demanded the expulsion of Austria from the German Confederation. Napoleon and his foreign minister, [[Drouyn de Lhuys]], expected a long war and an eventual Austrian victory. Napoleon III felt he could extract a price from both Prussia and Austria for French neutrality. On 12 June 1866, France signed a secret treaty with Austria, guaranteeing French neutrality in a Prussian-Austrian war. In exchange, in the event of an Austrian victory, Austria would give Venetia to France and would also create a new independent German state on the Rhine, which would become an ally of France. At the same time, Napoleon proposed a secret treaty with Bismarck, promising that France would remain neutral in a war between Austria and Prussia. In the event of a Prussian victory, France would recognize Prussia's annexation of smaller German states, and France, in exchange, would receive a portion of German territory, the [[Palatinate region]] north of Alsace. Bismarck, rightly confident of success due to the modernization of the [[Prussian Army]], summarily rejected Napoleon's offer.\n\nOn 15 June, the Prussian Army invaded [[Saxony]], an ally of Austria. On 2 July, Austria asked Napoleon to arrange an armistice between Italy, which had allied itself with Prussia, and Austria, in exchange for which France would receive Venetia. But on 3 July, the Prussian army crushed the Austrian army at the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] in [[Bohemia]]. The way to Vienna was open for the Prussians, and Austria asked for an armistice. The armistice was signed on 22 July; Prussia annexed the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], the [[Electorate of Hesse-Kassel]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]] and the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], with a combined population of four million people.<ref name=\"Girard, 1986, p. 380\">Girard, 1986, p. 380</ref>\n\nThe Austrian defeat was followed by a new crisis in the health of Napoleon III. [[Marshal Canrobert]], who saw him on 28 July, wrote that the Emperor \"was pitiful to see. He could barely sit up in his armchair, and his drawn face expressed at the same time moral anguish and physical pain.\"<ref name=\"Girard, 1986, p. 380\"/>\n\n===Luxembourg Crisis===\n{{Main|Luxembourg Crisis}}\nNapoleon III still hoped to receive some compensation from Prussia for French neutrality during the war. His foreign minister, Drouyn, asked Bismarck for the Palatinate region on the Rhine, which belonged to Bavaria, and for the demilitarization of Luxembourg, which was the site of a [[Fortress of Luxembourg|formidable fortress]] staffed by a strong Prussian garrison in accordance with international treaties. Napoleon's senior advisor [[Eug\u00e8ne Rouher]] increased the demands, asking that Prussia accept the annexation by France of Belgium and of Luxembourg.\n\nLuxembourg had regained its [[de jure]] independence in 1815 as a [[grand duchy]]. However, it was in [[personal union]] with the Netherlands. King [[William III of the Netherlands]], who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, desperately needed money and was prepared to sell the Grand Duchy to France. Bismarck swiftly intervened and showed the British ambassador a copy of Napoleon's demands; as a result, he put pressure on William III to refuse to sell Luxembourg to France. France was forced to renounce any claim to Luxembourg in the [[Treaty of London (1867)]]. Napoleon III gained nothing for his efforts but the demilitarization of the Luxembourg fortress.<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1975|p=203}}</ref>\n\n===Failure to increase the size of the French army===\nDespite his failing health, Napoleon III could see that the Prussian Army, combined with the armies of Bavaria and the other German states, would be a formidable enemy. In 1866, Prussia, with a population of 22 million, had been able to mobilize an army of 700,000 men, while France, with a population of 26 million, had an army of only 385,000 men, of whom 140,000 were in Algeria, Mexico, and Rome.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 387</ref> In the autumn of 1867, Napoleon III proposed a form of universal military service similar to the Prussian system to increase the size of the French Army, if needed, to 1 million. His proposal was opposed by many French officers, such as [[Marshal Randon]], who preferred a smaller, more professional army; he said: \"This proposal will only give us recruits; it's soldiers we need.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 389</ref> It was also strongly opposed by the republican opposition in the French parliament, who denounced the proposal as a militarization of French society. The republican deputy, [[\u00c9mile Ollivier]], who later became Napoleon's prime minister, declared: \"The armies of France, which I always considered too large, are now going to be increased to an exorbitant size. Why? What is the necessity? Where is the danger? Who is threatening us? ...If France were to disarm, the Germans would know how to convince their governments to do the same. \"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 392</ref> Facing almost certain defeat in the parliament, Napoleon III withdrew the proposal. It was replaced in January 1868 by a much more modest project to create a ''garde mobile'', or reserve force, to support the army.\n<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Howard|title=The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870\u20131871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2wEeRuei6AC|year=1981|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=30, 38\u201339|isbn=9780203993057}}</ref>\n\n===A last search for allies===\nNapoleon III was overconfident in his military strength and went into war even after he failed to find any allies who would support a war to stop German unification.<ref>James D. Morrow, \"Arms versus Allies: Trade-offs in the Search for Security.\" ''International Organization'' 47.2 (1993): 207\u201333. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706889 online]</ref>\n \nFollowing the defeat of Austria, Napoleon resumed his search for allies against Prussia. In April 1867, he proposed an alliance, defensive and offensive, with Austria. If Austria joined France in a victorious war against Prussia, Napoleon promised that Austria could form a new confederation with the southern states of Germany and could annex [[Silesia]], while France took for its part the left bank of the [[Rhine River]]. But the timing of Napoleon's offer was poorly chosen; Austria was in the process of a [[Ausgleich|major internal reform]], creating a new twin monarchy structure with two components, one being the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] and the other being the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nNapoleon's attempt to install the archduke Maximilian, the brother of the Austrian Emperor, in Mexico was just coming to its disastrous conclusion; the French troops had just been withdrawn from Mexico in February 1867, and the unfortunate Maximilian would be captured, judged and shot by a firing squad on 19 June. Napoleon III made these offers again in August 1867, on a visit to offer condolences for the death of Maximilian, but the proposal was not received with enthusiasm.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 45\u201346</ref>\n\n[[File:Adolphe Yvon - Portrait of Napoleon III - Walters 3795.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Napoleon III in 1868 by [[Adolphe Yvon]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher= The Walters Art Museum |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/597|title= Portrait of Napoleon III}}</ref>]]\nNapoleon III also made one last attempt to persuade Italy to be his ally against Prussia. Italian King Victor Emmanuel was personally favorable to a better relationship with France, remembering the role that Napoleon III had played in achieving Italian unification, but Italian public opinion was largely hostile to France; on 3 November 1867, French and Papal soldiers had fired upon the Italian patriots of Garibaldi, when he tried to capture Rome. Napoleon presented a proposed treaty of alliance on 4 June 1869, the anniversary of the joint French-Italian victory at Magenta. The Italians responded by demanding that France withdraw its troops who were protecting the Pope in Rome. Given the opinion of fervent French Catholics, this was a condition Napoleon III could not accept.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nWhile Napoleon III was having no success finding allies, Bismarck signed secret military treaties with the southern German states, who promised to provide troops in the event of a war between Prussia and France. In 1868, Bismarck signed an accord with Russia that gave Russia liberty of action in the Balkans in exchange for neutrality in the event of a war between France and Prussia. This treaty put additional pressure on Austria, which also had interests in the Balkans, not to ally itself with France. Bismarck also reached out to the liberal government of [[William Gladstone]] in London, offering to protect the neutrality of Belgium against a French threat. The British Foreign Office under [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]] mobilized the British fleet, to dissuade France against any aggressive moves against Belgium. In any war between France and Prussia, France would be entirely alone.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 47\u201348</ref>\n\nBismarck thought that French vanity would lead to war; he exploited that vanity in the [[Ems Dispatch]] in July 1870. France took the bait and declared war on Prussia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alison Kitson|title=Germany 1858\u20131990: Hope, Terror and Revival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwyp6RYFNhsC&pg=PA1870|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=1870|isbn=978-0199134175}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, French politician [[Adolphe Thiers]] (who became President of the French Republic in 1871) accused Napoleon III of erroneous foreign policy: \"There is no mistake that can be made\".<ref>History of the XIX century (1848-1871). In 5 volumes. Under the editorship of professors of Lavisse and Rambaud. Second edition. Volume 5. Part 1. \u2013 M. p. 182</ref> Napoleon III and France in the summer of 1870, however, made a serious mistake when France declared war on Prussia. This allowed Bismarck and Prussia to present the war to the world as defensive, although Prussia and Bismarck had aggressive plans, and they soon became known in relation to the annexation of the French provinces of Alsace and [[Lorraine]].\n\n===Hohenzollern candidacy and the Ems telegram===\n{{Main|Ems Dispatch}}\nIn his memoirs, written long after the war, Bismarck wrote, \"I always considered that a war with France would naturally follow a war against Austria... I was convinced that the gulf which was created over time between the north and the south of Germany could not be better overcome than by a national war against the neighbouring people who were aggressive against us. I did not doubt that it was necessary to make a French-German war before the general reorganization of Germany could be realized.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 394</ref> As the summer of 1870 approached, pressure mounted on Bismarck to have a war with France as quickly as possible. In [[Bavaria]], the largest of the southern German states, unification with (mostly Protestant) Prussia was being opposed by the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Patriotic Party]], which favoured a confederacy of (Catholic) Bavaria with (Catholic) Austria. German Protestant public opinion was on the side of unification with Prussia.\n\nIn France, patriotic sentiment was also growing. On 8 May 1870, French voters had overwhelmingly supported Napoleon III's program in a national plebiscite, with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no, an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869. The Emperor was less popular in Paris and the big cities, but highly popular in the French countryside. Napoleon had named a new foreign minister, Antoine Agenor, [[Agenor, duc de Gramont|the Duke de Gramont]], who was hostile to Bismarck. The Emperor was weak and ill, but the more extreme Bonapartists were prepared to show their strength against the republicans and monarchists in the parliament.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 47\u201350</ref>\n[[File:LeopoldHS.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern]]]]\n\nIn July 1870, Bismarck found a cause for a war in an old dynastic dispute. In September 1868, Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] had been overthrown and exiled to France. The new government of Spain considered several candidates, including [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern]], a cousin of [[William I, German Emperor|King Wilhelm I]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. At the end of 1869, Napoleon III had let it be known to the Prussian king and his Chancellor Bismarck that a Hohenzollern prince on the throne of Spain would not be acceptable to France. King Wilhelm had no desire to enter into a war against Napoleon III and did not pursue the subject further. At the end of May, however, Bismarck wrote to the father of Leopold, asking him to put pressure on his son to accept the candidacy to be King of Spain. Leopold, solicited by both his father and Bismarck, agreed.\n\nThe news of Leopold's candidacy, published 2 July 1870, aroused fury in the French parliament and press. The government was attacked by both the republicans and monarchist opposition, and by the ultra-Bonapartists, for its weakness against Prussia. On 6 July, Napoleon III held a meeting of his ministers at the ch\u00e2teau of Saint-Cloud and told them that Prussia must withdraw the Hohenzollern candidacy or there would be a war. He asked [[Edmond Le Boeuf|Marshal Leboeuf]], the chief of staff of the French army, if the army was prepared for a war against Prussia. Leboeuf responded that the French soldiers had a rifle superior to the Prussian rifle, that the French artillery was commanded by an elite corps of officers, and that the army \"would not lack a button on its [[puttees]]\". He assured the Emperor that the French army could have four hundred thousand men on the Rhine in less than fifteen days.<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 52</ref>\n\nKing Wilhelm I did not want to be seen as the instigator of the war; he had received messages urging restraint from Emperor Alexander II, Queen Victoria, and the [[Leopold II of Belgium|King of the Belgians]]. On 10 July, he told Leopold's father that his candidacy should be withdrawn. Leopold resisted the idea, but finally agreed on the 11th, and the withdrawal of the candidacy was announced on the 12th, a diplomatic victory for Napoleon. On the evening of the 12th, after meeting with the Empress and with his foreign minister, Gramont, he decided to push his success a little further; he would ask King Wilhelm to guarantee the Prussian government would never again make such a demand for the Spanish throne.\n\nThe French Ambassador to Prussia, Count [[Vincent Benedetti]], was sent to the German spa resort of [[Bad Ems]], where the Prussian King was staying. Benedetti met with the King on 13 July in the park of the ch\u00e2teau. The King told him courteously that he agreed fully with the withdrawal of the Hohenzollern candidacy, but that he could not make promises on behalf of the government for the future. He considered that the matter was closed. As he was instructed by Gramont, Benedetti asked for another meeting with the King to repeat the request, but the King politely, yet firmly, refused. Benedetti returned to Paris and the affair seemed finished. However, Bismarck edited the official dispatch of the meeting to make it appear that both sides had been hostile: \"His majesty the King,\" the dispatch read, \"refused to meet again with the French ambassador, and let him know, through an aide-de-camp of service, that His Majesty had nothing more to say to the Ambassador.\" This version was communicated to governments, and the next day was in the French press.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nThe [[Ems telegram]] had exactly the effect that Bismarck had intended. Once again, public opinion in France was inflamed. \"This text produced the effect of a red flag to the Gallic bull,\" Bismarck later wrote. Gramont, the French foreign minister, declared that he felt \"he had just received a slap.\" The leader of the conservatives in parliament, Thiers, spoke for moderation, arguing that France had won the diplomatic battle and there was no reason for war, but he was drowned out by cries that he was a traitor and a Prussian. Napoleon's new prime minister, [[\u00c9mile Ollivier]], declared that France had done all that it could humanly and honourably do to prevent the war, and that he accepted the responsibility \"with a light heart\". A crowd of 15\u201320,000 persons, carrying flags and patriotic banners, marched through the streets of Paris, demanding war. On 19 July 1870, a declaration of war was sent to the Prussian government.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 57\u201359</ref>\n\n===Defeat in the Franco-Prussian War===\n[[File:Place de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|At the outbreak of the war, crowds gathered on the Place de la Bastille, chanting \"To Berlin!\"]]\n\nWhen France entered the war, there were patriotic demonstrations in the streets of Paris, with crowds singing ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and chanting \"To Berlin! To Berlin!\" But Napoleon was melancholic. He told General Lepic that he expected the war to be \"long and difficult\", and wondered, \"Who knows if we'll come back?\" He told [[Jacques Louis Randon|Marshal Randon]] that he felt too old for a military campaign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 473</ref> Despite his ill health, Napoleon decided to go with the army to the front as commander in chief, as he had done during the successful Italian campaign. On 28 July, he departed Saint-Cloud by train for the front. He was accompanied by the 14-year-old Prince Imperial in the uniform of the army, by his military staff, and by a large contingent of chefs and servants in livery. He was pale and visibly in pain. The Empress remained in Paris as the [[Regent]], as she had done on other occasions when the Emperor was out of the country.\n\nThe mobilization of the French army was chaotic. Two hundred thousand soldiers converged on the German frontier, along a front of 250 kilometers, choking all the roads and railways for miles. Officers were unable to find their units, and units were unable to find their officers. General [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke]] and the German army, with experience mobilizing in the war against Austria, were able to efficiently move three armies of 518,000 men to a more concentrated front of just 120 kilometers. In addition, the German soldiers were backed by a substantial reserve of the [[Landwehr]] (Territorial defence), with 340,000 men, and an additional reserve of 400,000 territorial guards. The French army arrived at the frontier equipped with maps of Germany, but without maps of France\u2014where the actual fighting took place\u2014and without a specific plan of what it was going to do.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nOn 2 August, Napoleon and the Prince Imperial accompanied the army as it made a tentative crossing of the German border toward the city of [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]. The French won a minor skirmish and advanced no further. Napoleon III, very ill, was unable to ride his horse and had to support himself by leaning against a tree. In the meantime, the Germans had assembled a much larger army opposite Alsace and Lorraine than the French had expected or were aware of. On 4 August 1870, the Germans attacked with overwhelming force against a French division in Alsace at the [[Battle of Wissembourg (1870)|Battle of Wissembourg]] (German: Weissenburg), forcing it to retreat. On 5 August, the Germans defeated another French Army at the [[Battle of Spicheren]] in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]].\n\nOn 6 August, 140,000 Germans attacked 35,000 French soldiers at the [[Battle of W\u00f6rth]]; the French lost 19,200 soldiers killed, wounded and captured, and were forced to retreat. The French soldiers fought bravely, and French cavalry and infantry attacked the German lines repeatedly, but the Germans had superior logistics, communications, and leadership. The decisive weapon was the new German [[C64 (field gun)|Krupp six pound field gun]], which had a steel barrel, was loaded by the breech, had a longer range, had a higher rate of fire, and was more accurate than the bronze muzzle-loading French cannons. The Krupp guns caused terrible casualties in the French ranks.<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 61</ref>\n\nWhen the news of the French defeats reached Paris on 7 August, it was greeted with disbelief and dismay. Prime Minister Ollivier and the chief of staff of the army, Marshal [[Edmond Le Boeuf]], both resigned. The Empress Eug\u00e9nie took it upon herself as the Regent to name a new government. She chose General [[Cousin-Montauban]], better known as the Count of Palikao, seventy-four years old, the former commander of the French expeditionary force to China, as her new prime minister. The Count of Palikao named Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]], the commander of the French forces in Lorraine, as the new military commander. Napoleon III proposed returning to Paris, realizing that he was doing no good for the army. The Empress, in charge of the government responded by telegraph, \"Don't think of coming back, unless you want to unleash a terrible revolution. They will say you quit the army to flee the danger.\" The Emperor agreed to remain with the army.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 80\u201381</ref> With the Empress directing the country, and Bazaine commanding the army, the Emperor no longer had any real role to play. At the front, the Emperor told Marshal Leboeuf, \"we've both been dismissed.\"<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 81</ref>\n\nOn 18 August 1870, the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], the biggest battle of the war, took place in Lorraine between the Germans and the army of Marshal Bazaine. The Germans suffered 20,000 casualties and the French 12,000, but the Germans emerged as the victors, as Marshal Bazaine's army, with 175,000 soldiers, six divisions of cavalry and five hundred cannons, was trapped inside the fortifications of Metz, unable to move.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 92\">Milza, 2009, p. 92</ref>\n\nNapoleon was at [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]] with the army of Marshal [[Patrice de MacMahon]]. MacMahon, Marshal Bazaine, and the count of Palikao, with the Empress in Paris, all had different ideas on what the army should do next, and the Emperor had to act as a referee among them. The Emperor and MacMahon proposed moving their army closer to Paris to protect the city, but on 17 August Bazaine telegraphed to the Emperor: \"I urge you to renounce this idea, which seems to abandon the Army at Metz... Couldn't you make a powerful diversion toward the Prussian corps, which are already exhausted by so many battles? The Empress shares my opinion.\" Napoleon III wrote back, \"I yield to your opinion.\"<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 480</ref> The Emperor sent the Prince Imperial back to Paris for his safety, and went with the weary army in the direction of Metz. The Emperor, riding in an open carriage, was jeered, sworn at and insulted by demoralized soldiers.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 92\"/>\n\nThe direction of movement of MacMahon's army was supposed to be secret, but it was published in the French press and thus was quickly known to the German general staff. Moltke, the German commander, ordered two Prussian armies marching toward Paris to turn towards MacMahon's army. On 30 August, one corps of MacMahon's army was attacked by the Germans at [[Beaumont, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Beaumont]], losing five hundred men and forty cannons. MacMahon, believing he was ahead of the Germans, decided to stop and reorganize his forces at the fortified city of [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]], in the [[Ardennes]] close to the Belgian border.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 482</ref>\n\n====Battle of Sedan and capitulation====\n{{Further|Battle of Sedan (1870)}}\n[[File:The fallen emperor and triumphant statesman talked together.jpg|thumb|Bismarck with Napoleon III after his capitulation]]\n\nThe Battle of Sedan was a total disaster for the French\u2014the army surrendered to the Prussians and Napoleon himself was made a prisoner of war.<ref>Alan Strauss-Schom, ''The Shadow Emperor: A Biography of Napoleon III'' (2018) pp. 404\u201318.</ref> MacMahon arrived at Sedan with one hundred thousand soldiers, not knowing that two German armies were closing in on the city (one from the west and one from the east), blocking any escape. The Germans arrived on 31 August, and by 1 September, occupied the heights around Sedan, placed batteries of artillery, and began to shell the French positions below. At five o'clock in the morning on 1 September, a German shell seriously wounded MacMahon in the hip. Sedan soon came under bombardment from seven hundred German guns.<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 708\">Milza, 2006, p. 708</ref> MacMahon's replacement, General [[Emmanuel F\u00e9lix de Wimpffen|Wimpffen]], launched a series of valiant cavalry attacks to try to break the German encirclement, with no success. During the battle and bombardment, the French lost seventeen thousand killed or wounded and twenty-one thousand captured.\n\nAs the German shells rained down on the French positions, Napoleon III wandered aimlessly in the open around the French positions. One officer of his military escort was killed and two more received wounds. A doctor accompanying him wrote in his notebook, \"If this man has not come here to kill himself, I don't know what he has come to do. I have not seen him give an order all morning.\"<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 708\"/>\n\nFinally, at one o'clock in the afternoon, Napoleon emerged from his [[daydream|reverie]] and ordered a white flag hoisted above the citadel. He then had a message sent to the Prussian King, who was at Sedan with his army: \"Monsieur my brother, not being able to die at the head of my troops, nothing remains for me but to place my sword in the hands of Your Majesty.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 709</ref>\n\nAfter the war, when accused of having made a \"shameful surrender\" at Sedan, he wrote: \n\n{{bquote|Some people believe that, by burying ourselves under the ruins of Sedan, we would have better served my name and my dynasty. It's possible. Nay, to hold in my hand the lives of thousands of men and not to make a sign to save them was something that was beyond my capacity....my heart refused these sinister grandeurs.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 79</ref>}}\n\nAt six o'clock in the morning on 2 September, in the uniform of a general and accompanied by four generals from his staff, Napoleon was taken to the German headquarters at [[Donchery]]. He expected to see King William, but instead he was met by Bismarck and the German commander, General von Moltke. They dictated the terms of the surrender to Napoleon. Napoleon asked that his army be disarmed and allowed to pass into Belgium, but Bismarck refused. They also asked Napoleon to sign the preliminary documents of a peace treaty, but Napoleon refused, telling them that the French government headed by the Regent, Empress Eug\u00e9nie, would need to negotiate any peace agreement. The Emperor was then taken to the Chateau at Bellevue near {{interlanguage link|Fr\u00e9nois (Ardennes)|fr|Fr\u00e9nois (Ardennes)}}, where the Prussian King visited him. Napoleon told the King that he had not wanted the war, but that public opinion had forced him into it. The Prussian king politely agreed.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} That evening, from the Chateau, Napoleon wrote to the Empress Eug\u00e9nie: \n\n{{bquote|It is impossible for me to say what I have suffered and what I am suffering now...I would have preferred death to a capitulation so disastrous, and yet, under the present circumstances, it was the only way to avoid the butchering of sixty thousand people.

I think of you, our son, and our unhappy country.<ref>\nMilza, 2006, p. 710\n</ref>}}\n\n====Aftermath====\nThe news of the capitulation reached Paris on 3 September, confirming the rumors that were already circulating in the city. When the news was given to the Empress that the Emperor and the army were prisoners, she reacted by shouting at the Emperor's personal aide, \"No! An Emperor does not capitulate! He is dead!...They are trying to hide it from me. Why didn't he kill himself! Doesn't he know he has dishonored himself?!\".<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 711</ref> Later, when hostile crowds formed near the palace, and the staff began to flee, the Empress slipped out with one of her entourage and sought sanctuary with her American dentist, who took her to [[Deauville]]. From there, on 7 September, she took the yacht of a British official to England. On 4 September, a group of republican deputies, led by [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], gathered at the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]] in Paris and proclaimed the return of the Republic and the creation of a [[Government of National Defence]]. The Second Empire had come to an end.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 711\u201312</ref>\n\n===Captivity, exile and death===\n\n====Final months====\nFrom 5 September 1870 until 19 March 1871, Napoleon III and his entourage of thirteen aides were held in comfortable captivity in a castle at [[Wilhelmsh\u00f6he]], near [[Kassel]].

Bazaine was willing to take over power in France after the Germans had defeated the republic in Paris.

But by this time, Metz had already fallen, leaving Napoleon without a power basis. Bismarck did not see much chance for a restored empire as Napoleon would look like a marionette of the enemy to the French people.<ref>David Wetzel: ''A Duel of Nations.

Bonapartist candidates participated in the first elections for the National Assembly on 8 February, but won only five seats. On 1 March, the newly elected assembly officially declared the removal of the Emperor from power and placed all the blame for the French defeat squarely on him.<ref name=\"Louis Girard p. 488\"/> When peace was arranged between France and Germany, Bismarck released Napoleon. He decided to go into exile in England. Napoleon had limited funds; he sold properties and jewels and arrived in England on 20 March 1871.\n\n[[File:Napoleon III after Death - Illustrated London News Jan 25 1873-2.PNG|thumb|Napoleon III after his death, wood-engraving in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' of 25 January 1873, after a photograph by Mssrs.

Strode bought Camden Place in 1860 and spent large sums of money transforming it into a French chateau. Strode had also received money from the Emperor, possibly to buy Camden Place and maintain it as a [[Retreat (survivalism)|bolt hole]].<ref>[http://www.chislehurst-society.org.uk/Pages/About/People/NapoleonIII.html Napoleon III of France<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNapoleon passed his time writing and designing a stove which would be more energy efficient. In the summer of 1872, his health began to worsen. Doctors recommended surgery to remove his gallstones. After two operations, he became very seriously ill.

Two of France's largest banks, [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] and [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]], still in existence today, were founded during that period. The French stock market also expanded prodigiously, with many coal mining and steel companies issuing stocks. Historians credit Napoleon chiefly for supporting the railways, but not otherwise building the economy.<ref>Charles P. Kindleberger, ''Economic Growth in France and Britain 1851\u20131950'' (1964) pp. 6, 42, 186\u201388</ref>\n\nNapoleon's military pressure and Russian mistakes, culminating in the Crimean War, dealt a fatal blow to the [[Concert of Europe]]. It was based on stability and balance of powers, whereas Napoleon attempted to rearrange the world map to France's favour even when it involved radical and potentially revolutionary changes in politics. A [[Canon obusier de 12|12-pound cannon]] designed by France is commonly referred to as a \"Napoleon cannon\" or \"12-pounder Napoleon\" in his honour.\n\n===Historical reputation===\nThe historical reputation of Napoleon III is far below that of his uncle. [[Victor Hugo]] portrayed him as \"Napoleon the Small\" (''[[Napol\u00e9on le Petit]]''), a mere mediocrity, in contrast with Napoleon I \"The Great\", presented as a military and administrative genius. In France, such arch-opposition from the age's central literary figure, whose attacks on Napoleon III were obsessive and powerful, made it impossible for a very long time to assess his reign objectively. [[Karl Marx]], in ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', famously mocked Napoleon III by saying \"Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historical facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.\" Napoleon III has often been seen as an authoritarian but ineffectual leader who brought France into dubious, and ultimately disastrous, foreign military adventures.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen E.

His greatest achievements came in material improvements, in the form of  a grand railway network that facilitated commerce and tied the nation together and centered it on Paris. He is given high credits for the rebuilding of Paris with broad boulevards, striking public buildings, and very attractive residential districts for upscale Parisians. He promoted French business and exports. In international policy, he tried to emulate his uncle, with numerous imperial ventures around the world, as well as wars in Europe. He badly mishandled the threat from Prussia and found himself without allies in the face of overwhelming force.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''[France: 1815 to the Present'' (1963) online p. 275]</ref>\n\nHistorians have also praised his attention to the fate of the working classes and poor people. His book ''Extinction du paup\u00e9risme'' (\"Extinction of pauperism\"), which he wrote while imprisoned at the Fort of Ham in 1844, contributed to his popularity among the working classes and thus his election in 1848. Throughout his reign, the emperor worked to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, on occasion breaching the 19th-century economic orthodoxy of freedom and [[laissez-faire]] and using state resources or interfering in the market. Among other things, the Emperor granted the right to strike to French workers in 1864, despite intense opposition from corporate lobbies.\n\n===Screen===\n\nOn screen Napoleon has been portrayed by:\n* [[Walter Kingsford]] in \n**''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'' (1936)\n**''[[A Dispatch from Reuter's]]'' (1940)\n* [[Frank Vosper]] in ''[[Spy of Napoleon]]'' (1936)\n* [[Guy Bates Post]] in \n**''[[Maytime (1937 film)|Maytime]]'' (1937) \n**''[[The Mad Empress]]'' (1939)\n* [[Leon Ames (actor)|Leon Ames]] in ''[[Suez (film)|Suez]]'' (1938)\n* [[Claude Rains]] in ''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]'' (1939) \n* [[Walter Franck]] in ''[[Bismarck (1940 film)|Bismarck]]'' (1940)\n* [[Jerome Cowan]] in ''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' (1943)\n* David Bond in ''[[The Sword of Monte Cristo]]'' (1951)\n* [[Siegfried Wischnewski]] in ''[[Maximilian von Mexiko]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|title=Maximilian von Mexiko|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379886/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n* Robert Dumont in ''[[Those Years]]'' (Spanish: ''Aquellos a\u00f1os'', 1973).<ref>{{cite web|title=Aquellos a\u00f1os|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193724/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n* Julian Sherrier in ''[[Edward the Seventh]]'' (1975)\n* [[Nick Jameson]] in ''[[The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer]]'' (1998)\n* [[Erwin Steinhauer]] in ''[[Sisi (miniseries)|Sisi]]'' (2009).<ref>{{cite web|title=Sisi|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442136/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon III also plays a small but crucial role in ''[[April and the Extraordinary World]]'' (2015).\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* 20 April 1808 \u2013 9 July 1810: His Imperial and Royal Highness Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on of France, Prince of Holland\n* 20 April 1808 \u2013 20 December 1848: His Imperial Highness Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on of France\n* 20 December 1848 \u2013 2 December 1852: His Imperial Highness The Prince-President of the French Republic (\"''{{lang|fr|Son Altesse Imp\u00e9riale le Prince-President}}''\")\n* 2 December 1852 \u2013 1 March 1871: His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French\n* 1 March 1871 \u2013 9 January 1873: His Imperial Majesty Napol\u00e9on III{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nHis full title as emperor was: \"Napoleon the Third, [[By the Grace of God]] and the will of the [[Second French Empire|Nation]], [[Emperor of the French]]\".<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/napoleon.htm#naptitles \"Napol\u00e9on's Titles\"].

D.

If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time.

Substitute P with 36 into the above formula:\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = MOD[210\u00b0\u00d744<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180\u00b0,360\u00b0] = 132.98\u00b0 which is roughly equal to 120\u00b0 on the chart.\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = {[(n+\u00bd)\u00d7360\u00b0+A]\u00f7210\u00b0}\u00b2 where n = 0,1,2,3\u2026\n\n====== Method 2 ======\nTo find the exact angle on the Hexagon Chart, one has to use a slightly more complicated formula below.\n\nA\u209a = 180\u00b0\u2212(3r\u2092\u00b2\u2212P)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f7r\u2092\n\nWhere r\u2092 is the smallest natural number greater than (P\u00f73)<sup>\u00bd</sup>\n\nLet us take 44 as an example:\n\n(44/3)<sup>\u00bd</sup> = 3.8297, r\u2092 = 4\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = 180\u00b0\u2212(3\u00d74\u00b2-44)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f74 = 120\u00b0\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = 3n\u00b2\u2212(180\u00b0\u2212 A\u00d7n\u00f760\u00b0)\n\n==== Practical examples ====\n[[File:The_Hexagon_Chart_and_the_Corn_Market_Top_in_March_1925.jpg|thumb|300x300px|In March, Saturn was at 224\u00b0 and Venus was at 344\u00b0. The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

He reigned until he was deposed in 1862.\n\nThe second son of King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], Otto ascended the newly created throne of Greece while still a minor. His government was initially run by a three-man {{ill|Regency council of Otto of Greece|el|\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u038c\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1|lt=regency council}} made up of Bavarian court officials. Upon reaching his majority, Otto removed the regents when they proved unpopular with the people, and he ruled as an [[absolute monarch]]. Eventually his subjects' demands for a constitution proved overwhelming, and in the face of an armed (but bloodless) insurrection, Otto granted a constitution in 1843.\n\nThroughout his reign Otto was unable to resolve Greece's poverty and prevent economic meddling from outside. Greek politics in this era were based on affiliations with the three [[European balance of power|Great Powers]] that had guaranteed Greece's independence, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]] and [[Russia]], and Otto's ability to maintain the support of the powers was key to his remaining in power. To remain strong, Otto had to play the interests of each of the Great Powers' Greek adherents against the others, while not irritating the Great Powers. When Greece was blockaded by the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1850 and again in 1854, to stop Greece from attacking the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Crimean War]], Otto's standing amongst Greeks suffered. As a result, there was an assassination attempt on [[Queen Amalia]], and finally in 1862 Otto was deposed while in the countryside. He died in exile in Bavaria in 1867.\n\n==Early life and reign==\n[[File:Otto of Hellas.jpg|thumb|200px|A portrait by [[Gottlieb Bodmer]]]]\n{{Further|Ioannis Kapodistrias|Augustinos Kapodistrias}}\nOtto was born as Prince Otto Friedrich Ludwig of Bavaria at [[Palace of Mirabell|Schloss Mirabell]] in [[Salzburg]] (when it briefly belonged to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salzburger-schlosskonzerte.at/en/Schloss_Mirabell.htm |title=Salzburger Schlosskonzerte website |publisher=Salzburger-schlosskonzerte.at |accessdate=11 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706094138/http://www.salzburger-schlosskonzerte.at/en/Schloss_Mirabell.htm |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> as the second son of Crown Prince [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and [[Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. His father served there as the Bavarian governor-general. Through his ancestor, the Bavarian Duke [[John II, Duke of Bavaria|John II]], Otto was a descendant of the Byzantine [[Byzantine Emperor|imperial dynasties]] of [[Komnenos]] and [[Laskaris]].\n\nWhen he was elected king, the Great Powers extracted a pledge from Otto's father to restrain him from hostile actions against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They also insisted that his title be \"King of Greece\", rather than \"King of the Hellenes\", because the latter would imply a claim over the millions of Greeks then still under Turkish rule. Not quite 18, the young prince arrived in Greece with 3,500 Bavarian troops (the [[Bavarian Auxiliary Corps]]) and three Bavarian advisors aboard the British [[frigate]] [[HMS Madagascar (1822)|HMS ''Madagascar'']]. Although he did not speak Greek, he immediately endeared himself to his adopted country by adopting the Greek national costume and Hellenizing his name to \"Othon\" (some English sources, such as [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], call him \"Otho\").\n\nOtto's reign is usually divided into three periods:{{By whom|date=August 2019}}\n* The years of {{ill|Regency council of Otto of Greece|el|\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u038c\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1|lt=Regency Council}}: 1832\u20131835\n* The years of [[Absolute Monarchy]]: 1835\u20131843\n* The years of [[Constitutional Monarchy]]: 1843\u20131862\n\nThe Bavarian advisors were arrayed in a Regency Council, headed by Count [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]], who, in Bavaria as minister of finance, had recently succeeded in restoring [[Bavaria]]n credit, at the cost of his popularity. Von Armansperg was the President of the Privy Council and the first representative (or Prime Minister) of the new Greek government. The other members of the Regency Council were [[Karl von Abel]] and [[Georg Ludwig von Maurer]], with whom von Armansperg often clashed. After the king reached his majority in 1835, von Armansperg was made Arch-Secretary, but was called Arch-Chancellor by the Greek press.\n\n[[File:Map Greece expansion 1832-1947-en.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the original territory of the [[Kingdom of Greece]], as laid down in the treaty of 1832 (in dark blue)]]\n\nBritain and the [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] bank, who were underwriting the Greek loans, insisted on financial stringency from Armansperg. The Greeks were soon more heavily taxed than under Ottoman rule;<ref name=\"Petropulos, John A. 1968\">{{cite book |last=Petropulos |first=John A. |title=Politics and Statecraft in the Kingdom of Greece |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1968 }}</ref> as the people saw it, they had exchanged a hated [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for government by a foreign [[bureaucracy]], the \"Bavarocracy\" (\u0392\u03b1\u03c5\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1).\n\nIn addition, the regency showed little respect for local customs. As a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], Otto himself was viewed as a heretic by many pious Greeks; however, his [[heir]]s would have to be [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], according to the terms of the 1843 Constitution.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last=Clogg |first=Richard |title=A Short History of Modern Greece |url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofmo0000clog |url-access=registration |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1979 |isbn=0-521-32837-3 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nKing Otto brought his personal brewmaster with him, Herr Fuchs, a Bavarian who stayed in Greece after Otto's departure and introduced Greece to beer, under the label \"[[Fix (beer)|Fix]]\".<ref>Dean Karayanis, Catherine Karayanis, ''Regional Greek Cooking'', Hippocrene Books, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NrIapgM4LwQC&pg=PA262&lpg=PA262&dq=king+otto+herr+fuchs+beer+greece&source=bl&ots=QLW5pkFVV4&sig=6UkdtQlrkU5RJmYWEQcCg8f5lgk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu3MivxMTRAhUG7CYKHVSnBekQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=king%20otto%20herr%20fuchs%20beer%20greece&f=false p. 262].</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2019}}\n\nPopular heroes and leaders of the Greek Revolution, such as generals [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] and [[Yiannis Makriyiannis]], who opposed the Bavarian-dominated regency, were charged with treason, put in jail and sentenced to death.

His first task as king was to make a detailed archaeological and topographic survey of Athens. He assigned [[Gustav Eduard Schaubert]] and [[Stamatios Kleanthis]]<ref>{{cite book |last= Tung |first= Anthony |authorlink= Anthony Tung |title= Preserving the World's Great Cities: The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis |url= https://archive.org/details/preservingworlds00anth |url-access= registration |publisher= Three RIvers Press |year= 2001 |location= New York |pages= [https://archive.org/details/preservingworlds00anth/page/256 256\u2013260] |isbn= 0-609-80815-X}}</ref> to complete this task. At that time, Athens had a population of roughly 4,000\u20135,000 people, located mainly in what today covers the district of [[Plaka]] in [[Athens]].\n\n[[File:Peter von Hess - The Entry of King Othon of Greece in Athens - WGA11387.jpg|thumb|220px|\"The Entry of King Otto in Athens\" by [[Peter von Hess]], 1839]]\n[[File:Chalkis 1830s.jpg|thumb|220px|Men of the [[Hellenic Gendarmerie|Royal Gendarmerie Corps]] which was established after the enthronement of Otto in 1833]]\n\nAthens was chosen as the Greek capital for historical and sentimental reasons, not because it was a large city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses at the foot of the [[Acropolis]]. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the [[University of Athens]] (1837, under the name Othonian University), the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic University]] (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the [[National Gardens of Athens]] (1840), the [[National Library of Greece]] (1842), the [[Old Royal Palace]] (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), and the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament Building]] (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion. Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.\n\nDuring 1836\u201337, Otto visited Germany, marrying a beautiful and talented 17-year-old, [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Duchess Amalia (Amelie) of Oldenburg]] (21 December 1818 to 20 May 1875). The wedding took place not in Greece but in [[Oldenburg]], on 22 November 1836; the marriage did not produce an heir, and the new queen made herself unpopular by interfering in the government and maintaining her [[Lutheran]] faith. Otto was unfaithful to his wife, and had an affair with [[Jane Digby]], a notorious woman his father had previously taken as a lover.<ref>Lovell, Mary S., ''A Scandalous Life: The Biography of Jane Digby'' (Fourth Estate, 1996) {{ISBN|978-1-85702-469-2}}</ref> {{Better source|date=August 2019}}\n\nDue to his having overtly undermined the king, Armansperg was dismissed from his duties by King Otto immediately upon his return from Germany. However, despite high hopes on the part of the Greeks, the Bavarian [[Ignaz von Rudhart|Rudhart]] was appointed chief minister, and the granting of a [[constitution]] was again postponed. The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example by the suggested acquisition of [[Crete]] in 1841, failed in their objective and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with the Great Powers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n==Parties, finances and the church==\n{{Main|Early Greek Parties}}\n[[File:Grece armoiries(Otto).png|thumb|left|180px|Personal coat of arms of Otto]]\n\nThroughout his reign, King Otto found himself confronted by a recurring series of problems: partisanship of the Greeks, financial uncertainty, and ecclesiastical disputes.\n\nGreek parties in the Othonian era were based on two factors: the political activities of the diplomatic representatives of the [[Great Powers]] Russia, United Kingdom and France and the affiliation of Greek political figures with these diplomats.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n[[File:King Otto of Greece.jpg|thumb|A romantic portrayal of Otto in [[Evzones|Evzonas]] uniform, in front of ancient Greek ruins, by [[Gottlieb Bodmer]]]]\n\nAccording to [[Richard Clogg]], the financial uncertainty of the Othonian monarchy was the result of\n*1) Greece's poverty,\n*2) the concentration of land in the hands of a small number of wealthy \"primates\" like the [[Petros Mavromichalis|Mavromichalis]] family of [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]],\n\nand\n*3) the promise of 60,000,000 francs in loans from the Great Powers, which kept these nations involved in Greek internal affairs and the Crown constantly seeking to please one or the other power to ensure the flow of funds.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe political machinations of the Great Powers were personified in their three legates in Athens: the French [[Theobald Piscatory]], the Russian [[Gabriel Catacazy]], and the English [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons|Edmund Lyons]]. They informed their home governments on the activities of the Greeks, while serving as advisers to their respective allied parties within Greece.\n\nOtto pursued policies such as balancing power among all the parties and sharing offices among the parties, ostensibly to reduce the power of the parties while trying to bring a pro-Othon party into being. The parties, however, became the entree into government power and financial stability.\n\nThe effect of his (and his advisors') policies was to make the Great Powers' parties more powerful, not less. The Great Powers did not support curtailing Otto's increasing absolutism, however, which resulted in a near permanent conflict between Otto's absolute monarchy and the power bases of his Greek subjects.<ref name=\"Petropulos, John A. 1968\"/>\n\nOtto found himself confronted by a number of intractable [[ecclesiastical]] issues: 1) [[monasticism]], 2) [[Autocephaly]], 3) the king as head of the Church and 4) toleration of other churches. {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nHis regents, Armansperg and Rundhart, established a controversial policy of [[Secularization|suppressing the monasteries]]. This was very upsetting to the Church hierarchy. Russia considered itself a stalwart defender of [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodoxy]], but Orthodox believers were found in all three parties. Once he rid himself of his Bavarian advisers, Otto allowed the statutory dissolution of the monasteries to lapse.\n\nBy tradition dated back to the Byzantine era, the king was regarded by the Church as part of its head. {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} On the issue of the Church's [[Autocephaly]] and his role as king within the Church, Otto was overwhelmed by the arcana of Orthodox Church doctrine and popular discontent with his Roman Catholicism<ref name=\"Petropulos, John A. 1968\"/> (while the Queen was Protestant).\n\nIn 1833, the regents had unilaterally declared the Autocephaly of the [[Church of Greece]].\nThis was a recognition of the ''de facto'' political situation, as the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] was partially under the political control of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. However, faithful people, concerned that having a Catholic as the head of the Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church, criticised the unilateral declaration of Autocephaly as [[Canon law|non-canonical]]. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly [[Protestant]] missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.\n\n[[File:Otto and Amalia of Greece on a ride through Athens.jpg|thumb|240px|Otto with [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Amalia]] on a ride through Athens]]\n\nTolerance of other religions was over-supported by some in the English Party and others educated in the West as a symbol of Greece's progress as a [[Liberalism|liberal]] European state. In the end, power over the Church and education was ceded to the Russian Party, while the king maintained a veto over the decision of the [[Synod]] of Bishops. This was to keep balance and avoid discrediting Greece in the eyes of Western Europe as a backward, religiously intolerant society.<ref name=\"Petropulos, John A. 1968\"/>\n\nGreek society was in reality very tolerant of other religions. {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} But after 400 years of religious oppression by the Ottomans, Greeks were very suspicious of imposed \"Liberal European progress\". Such forced \"progress\" was viewed as one more attempt against their faith and against their own understanding of freedom, as the main motto of the Greek Revolution was ''\"for the holy faith of Christ and the freedom of the homeland\"''; home and faith were inseparable, given also that the Church was the main contributor to the survival of the Greek language and Greek consciousness during Turkish occupation.\n\nCatholic communities had been established in Greece since the 13th century (Athens, Cyclades, Chios, Crete). Jewish communities also existed in the country, those arriving after the [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain]] (1492) joining the earlier [[Romaniotes]], Jews who had been living there since the times of [[Apostle Paul]].<ref>Bowman, \"The Jews of Greece\", [http://www.umass.edu/judaic/anniversaryvolume/articles/30-F3-Bowman.pdf 421\u2013422] (PDF)</ref> Muslim families were still living in Greece during Otto's reign, since hostility was mainly against the Ottoman state and its depressive mechanisms and not against Muslim people.\n\n==3 September 1843 Revolution==\n{{main|3 September 1843 Revolution}}\n[[File:3\u03b7 \u03a3\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.jpg|thumb|right|A painting representing the 3 September 1843 Revolution]]\n\nAlthough King Otto tried to function as an absolute monarch, as [[Thomas Gallant (historian)|Thomas Gallant]] writes, he \"was neither ruthless enough to be feared, nor compassionate enough to be loved, nor competent enough to be respected.\"<ref>[[Thomas W. Gallant|Gallant, Thomas W.]], ''Modern Greece'' (Oxford University Press, 2003) {{ISBN|0-340-76336-1}}</ref>\n\nBy 1843, public dissatisfaction with him had reached crisis proportions and there were demands for a Constitution. Initially Otto refused to grant a Constitution, but as soon as Bavarian troops were withdrawn from the kingdom, a [[3 September 1843 Revolution|popular revolt]] was launched.\n\nOn 3 September 1843, the infantry led by Colonel [[Dimitri Kalergis|Dimitris Kallergis]] and the respected Revolutionary captain and former President of the Athens City Council [[Ioannis Makriyannis|General Yiannis Makriyiannis]] assembled in [[Syntagma Square|Palace Square]] in front of the Palace in Athens.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Eventually joined by much of the population of the small capital, the crowd refused to disperse until the king agreed to grant a constitution, which would require that there be Greeks in the Council, that he convene a permanent National Assembly and that Otto personally thank the leaders of the uprising.\n\nLeft with little recourse now that his German troops were gone, King Otto gave in to the pressure and agreed to the demands of the crowd over the objections of his opinionated [[Queen Amalia of Greece|queen]]. This square was renamed [[Syntagma Square|Constitution Square]] (\u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) to commemorate (through to the present) the events of September 1843 \u2014 and to feature many later tumultuous events of Greek history.<ref>Tompkinson, John L., ''Athens: The City'' (Anagnosis Books, 1996) {{ISBN|960-87186-0-0}}</ref> Now for the first time, the king had Greeks in his Council and the French Party, the English Party and the Russian Party (according to which of the Great Powers' culture they most esteemed) vied for rank and power.\n\nThe king's prestige, which was based in large part on his support by the combined Great Powers, but mostly the support of the British, suffered in the ''[[Pacifico incident]]'' of 1850, when British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] sent the British fleet to blockade the port of [[Piraeus]] with warships to exact reparation for injustice done to a British subject.<ref>Pacifico was a Jew of Portuguese nationality, merchant and the Portuguese Consul in Athens, who accidentally was also a British citizen because he was born in Gibraltar. After a robbery in his shop he asked for compensation from the Greek state, but nobody paid attention to him, not even the Portuguese government. Finally, he asked for help from the British ambassador, and his case was turned into the blockade of the port of Piraeus by the British Fleet.</ref>\n\n==Crimean War==\n{{See also|Epirus revolt of 1854}}\nThe ''[[Megali Idea|Great Idea]]'' (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u0399\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1), the dream of uniting all Greek populations of the Ottoman Empire, thereby restoring the [[Byzantine Empire]] under Christian rule, led him to contemplate entering the [[Crimean War]] on the side of Russia against Turkey and its British and French allies in 1853; the enterprise was unsuccessful and resulted in renewed intervention by the two Great Powers and a second blockade of the [[Piraeus]] port, forcing Greece to neutrality.\n\nThe continued inability of the royal couple to have children also raised the thorny issue of succession: the 1844 constitution insisted that Otto's successor had to be Orthodox, but as the king was childless, the only possible heirs were his younger brothers, [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]] and [[Prince Adalbert of Bavaria (1828\u20131875)|Adalbert]]. The staunch Catholicism of the Wittelsbachs complicated matters, as Luitpold refused to convert and Adalbert married [[Infanta Amalia of Spain]]. The sons of Adalbert, and especially the eldest, [[Prince Ludwig Ferdinand of Bavaria|Ludwig Ferdinand]], were now considered the most likely candidates, but due to the issue of religion, no definite arrangements were ever made.{{sfn|Jelavich|1961|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\nIn 1861, a student named [[Aristeidis Dosios]] (son of politician [[Konstantinos Dosios]]) attempted to murder [[Queen Amalia of Greece|Queen Amalia]] and was openly hailed as a hero.

He reigned until he was deposed in 1862.\n\nThe second son of King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], Otto ascended the newly created throne of Greece while still a minor. His government was initially run by a three-man {{ill|Regency council of Otto of Greece|el|\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u038c\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1|lt=regency council}} made up of Bavarian court officials. Upon reaching his majority, Otto removed the regents when they proved unpopular with the people, and he ruled as an [[absolute monarch]]. Eventually his subjects' demands for a constitution proved overwhelming, and in the face of an armed (but bloodless) insurrection, Otto granted a constitution in 1843.\n\nThroughout his reign Otto was unable to resolve Greece's poverty and prevent economic meddling from outside. Greek politics in this era were based on affiliations with the three [[European balance of power|Great Powers]] that had guaranteed Greece's independence, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]] and [[Russia]], and Otto's ability to maintain the support of the powers was key to his remaining in power. To remain strong, Otto had to play the interests of each of the Great Powers' Greek adherents against the others, while not irritating the Great Powers. When Greece was blockaded by the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1850 and again in 1854, to stop Greece from attacking the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Crimean War]], Otto's standing amongst Greeks suffered. As a result, there was an assassination attempt on [[Queen Amalia]], and finally in 1862 Otto was deposed while in the countryside. He died in exile in Bavaria in 1867.\n\n==Early life and reign==\n[[File:Otto of Hellas.jpg|thumb|200px|A portrait by [[Gottlieb Bodmer]]]]\n{{Further|Ioannis Kapodistrias|Augustinos Kapodistrias}}\nOtto was born as Prince Otto Friedrich Ludwig of Bavaria at [[Palace of Mirabell|Schloss Mirabell]] in [[Salzburg]] (when it briefly belonged to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salzburger-schlosskonzerte.at/en/Schloss_Mirabell.htm |title=Salzburger Schlosskonzerte website |publisher=Salzburger-schlosskonzerte.at |accessdate=11 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706094138/http://www.salzburger-schlosskonzerte.at/en/Schloss_Mirabell.htm |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> as the second son of Crown Prince [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and [[Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. His father served there as the Bavarian governor-general. Through his ancestor, the Bavarian Duke [[John II, Duke of Bavaria|John II]], Otto was a descendant of the Byzantine [[Byzantine Emperor|imperial dynasties]] of [[Komnenos]] and [[Laskaris]].\n\nWhen he was elected king, the Great Powers extracted a pledge from Otto's father to restrain him from hostile actions against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They also insisted that his title be \"King of Greece\", rather than \"King of the Hellenes\", because the latter would imply a claim over the millions of Greeks then still under Turkish rule. Not quite 18, the young prince arrived in Greece with 3,500 Bavarian troops (the [[Bavarian Auxiliary Corps]]) and three Bavarian advisors aboard the British [[frigate]] [[HMS Madagascar (1822)|HMS ''Madagascar'']]. Although he did not speak Greek, he immediately endeared himself to his adopted country by adopting the Greek national costume and Hellenizing his name to \"Othon\" (some English sources, such as [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], call him \"Otho\").\n\nOtto's reign is usually divided into three periods:{{By whom|date=August 2019}}\n* The years of {{ill|Regency council of Otto of Greece|el|\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u038c\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1|lt=Regency Council}}: 1832\u20131835\n* The years of [[Absolute Monarchy]]: 1835\u20131843\n* The years of [[Constitutional Monarchy]]: 1843\u20131862\n\nThe Bavarian advisors were arrayed in a Regency Council, headed by Count [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]], who, in Bavaria as minister of finance, had recently succeeded in restoring [[Bavaria]]n credit, at the cost of his popularity. Von Armansperg was the President of the Privy Council and the first representative (or Prime Minister) of the new Greek government. The other members of the Regency Council were [[Karl von Abel]] and [[Georg Ludwig von Maurer]], with whom von Armansperg often clashed. After the king reached his majority in 1835, von Armansperg was made Arch-Secretary, but was called Arch-Chancellor by the Greek press.\n\n[[File:Map Greece expansion 1832-1947-en.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the original territory of the [[Kingdom of Greece]], as laid down in the treaty of 1832 (in dark blue)]]\n\nBritain and the [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] bank, who were underwriting the Greek loans, insisted on financial stringency from Armansperg.

His first task as king was to make a detailed archaeological and topographic survey of Athens.

At that time, Athens had a population of roughly 4,000\u20135,000 people, located mainly in what today covers the district of [[Plaka]] in [[Athens]].\n\n[[File:Peter von Hess - The Entry of King Othon of Greece in Athens - WGA11387.jpg|thumb|220px|\"The Entry of King Otto in Athens\" by [[Peter von Hess]], 1839]]\n[[File:Chalkis 1830s.jpg|thumb|220px|Men of the [[Hellenic Gendarmerie|Royal Gendarmerie Corps]] which was established after the enthronement of Otto in 1833]]\n\nAthens was chosen as the Greek capital for historical and sentimental reasons, not because it was a large city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses at the foot of the [[Acropolis]]. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the [[University of Athens]] (1837, under the name Othonian University), the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic University]] (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the [[National Gardens of Athens]] (1840), the [[National Library of Greece]] (1842), the [[Old Royal Palace]] (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), and the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament Building]] (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion. Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.\n\nDuring 1836\u201337, Otto visited Germany, marrying a beautiful and talented 17-year-old, [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Duchess Amalia (Amelie) of Oldenburg]] (21 December 1818 to 20 May 1875). The wedding took place not in Greece but in [[Oldenburg]], on 22 November 1836; the marriage did not produce an heir, and the new queen made herself unpopular by interfering in the government and maintaining her [[Lutheran]] faith. Otto was unfaithful to his wife, and had an affair with [[Jane Digby]], a notorious woman his father had previously taken as a lover.<ref>Lovell, Mary S., ''A Scandalous Life: The Biography of Jane Digby'' (Fourth Estate, 1996) {{ISBN|978-1-85702-469-2}}</ref> {{Better source|date=August 2019}}\n\nDue to his having overtly undermined the king, Armansperg was dismissed from his duties by King Otto immediately upon his return from Germany. However, despite high hopes on the part of the Greeks, the Bavarian [[Ignaz von Rudhart|Rudhart]] was appointed chief minister, and the granting of a [[constitution]] was again postponed. The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example by the suggested acquisition of [[Crete]] in 1841, failed in their objective and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with the Great Powers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n==Parties, finances and the church==\n{{Main|Early Greek Parties}}\n[[File:Grece armoiries(Otto).png|thumb|left|180px|Personal coat of arms of Otto]]\n\nThroughout his reign, King Otto found himself confronted by a recurring series of problems: partisanship of the Greeks, financial uncertainty, and ecclesiastical disputes.\n\nGreek parties in the Othonian era were based on two factors: the political activities of the diplomatic representatives of the [[Great Powers]] Russia, United Kingdom and France and the affiliation of Greek political figures with these diplomats.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n[[File:King Otto of Greece.jpg|thumb|A romantic portrayal of Otto in [[Evzones|Evzonas]] uniform, in front of ancient Greek ruins, by [[Gottlieb Bodmer]]]]\n\nAccording to [[Richard Clogg]], the financial uncertainty of the Othonian monarchy was the result of\n*1) Greece's poverty,\n*2) the concentration of land in the hands of a small number of wealthy \"primates\" like the [[Petros Mavromichalis|Mavromichalis]] family of [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]],\n\nand\n*3) the promise of 60,000,000 francs in loans from the Great Powers, which kept these nations involved in Greek internal affairs and the Crown constantly seeking to please one or the other power to ensure the flow of funds.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe political machinations of the Great Powers were personified in their three legates in Athens: the French [[Theobald Piscatory]], the Russian [[Gabriel Catacazy]], and the English [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons|Edmund Lyons]]. They informed their home governments on the activities of the Greeks, while serving as advisers to their respective allied parties within Greece.\n\nOtto pursued policies such as balancing power among all the parties and sharing offices among the parties, ostensibly to reduce the power of the parties while trying to bring a pro-Othon party into being. The parties, however, became the entree into government power and financial stability.\n\nThe effect of his (and his advisors') policies was to make the Great Powers' parties more powerful, not less. The Great Powers did not support curtailing Otto's increasing absolutism, however, which resulted in a near permanent conflict between Otto's absolute monarchy and the power bases of his Greek subjects.<ref name=\"Petropulos, John A. 1968\"/>\n\nOtto found himself confronted by a number of intractable [[ecclesiastical]] issues: 1) [[monasticism]], 2) [[Autocephaly]], 3) the king as head of the Church and 4) toleration of other churches. {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nHis regents, Armansperg and Rundhart, established a controversial policy of [[Secularization|suppressing the monasteries]]. This was very upsetting to the Church hierarchy. Russia considered itself a stalwart defender of [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodoxy]], but Orthodox believers were found in all three parties. Once he rid himself of his Bavarian advisers, Otto allowed the statutory dissolution of the monasteries to lapse.\n\nBy tradition dated back to the Byzantine era, the king was regarded by the Church as part of its head. {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} On the issue of the Church's [[Autocephaly]] and his role as king within the Church, Otto was overwhelmed by the arcana of Orthodox Church doctrine and popular discontent with his Roman Catholicism<ref name=\"Petropulos, John A. 1968\"/> (while the Queen was Protestant).\n\nIn 1833, the regents had unilaterally declared the Autocephaly of the [[Church of Greece]].\nThis was a recognition of the ''de facto'' political situation, as the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] was partially under the political control of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. However, faithful people, concerned that having a Catholic as the head of the Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church, criticised the unilateral declaration of Autocephaly as [[Canon law|non-canonical]]. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly [[Protestant]] missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.\n\n[[File:Otto and Amalia of Greece on a ride through Athens.jpg|thumb|240px|Otto with [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Amalia]] on a ride through Athens]]\n\nTolerance of other religions was over-supported by some in the English Party and others educated in the West as a symbol of Greece's progress as a [[Liberalism|liberal]] European state. In the end, power over the Church and education was ceded to the Russian Party, while the king maintained a veto over the decision of the [[Synod]] of Bishops. This was to keep balance and avoid discrediting Greece in the eyes of Western Europe as a backward, religiously intolerant society.<ref name=\"Petropulos, John A. 1968\"/>\n\nGreek society was in reality very tolerant of other religions. {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} But after 400 years of religious oppression by the Ottomans, Greeks were very suspicious of imposed \"Liberal European progress\". Such forced \"progress\" was viewed as one more attempt against their faith and against their own understanding of freedom, as the main motto of the Greek Revolution was ''\"for the holy faith of Christ and the freedom of the homeland\"''; home and faith were inseparable, given also that the Church was the main contributor to the survival of the Greek language and Greek consciousness during Turkish occupation.\n\nCatholic communities had been established in Greece since the 13th century (Athens, Cyclades, Chios, Crete). Jewish communities also existed in the country, those arriving after the [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain]] (1492) joining the earlier [[Romaniotes]], Jews who had been living there since the times of [[Apostle Paul]].<ref>Bowman, \"The Jews of Greece\", [http://www.umass.edu/judaic/anniversaryvolume/articles/30-F3-Bowman.pdf 421\u2013422] (PDF)</ref> Muslim families were still living in Greece during Otto's reign, since hostility was mainly against the Ottoman state and its depressive mechanisms and not against Muslim people.\n\n==3 September 1843 Revolution==\n{{main|3 September 1843 Revolution}}\n[[File:3\u03b7 \u03a3\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.jpg|thumb|right|A painting representing the 3 September 1843 Revolution]]\n\nAlthough King Otto tried to function as an absolute monarch, as [[Thomas Gallant (historian)|Thomas Gallant]] writes, he \"was neither ruthless enough to be feared, nor compassionate enough to be loved, nor competent enough to be respected.\"<ref>[[Thomas W. Gallant|Gallant, Thomas W.]], ''Modern Greece'' (Oxford University Press, 2003) {{ISBN|0-340-76336-1}}</ref>\n\nBy 1843, public dissatisfaction with him had reached crisis proportions and there were demands for a Constitution. Initially Otto refused to grant a Constitution, but as soon as Bavarian troops were withdrawn from the kingdom, a [[3 September 1843 Revolution|popular revolt]] was launched.\n\nOn 3 September 1843, the infantry led by Colonel [[Dimitri Kalergis|Dimitris Kallergis]] and the respected Revolutionary captain and former President of the Athens City Council [[Ioannis Makriyannis|General Yiannis Makriyiannis]] assembled in [[Syntagma Square|Palace Square]] in front of the Palace in Athens.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Eventually joined by much of the population of the small capital, the crowd refused to disperse until the king agreed to grant a constitution, which would require that there be Greeks in the Council, that he convene a permanent National Assembly and that Otto personally thank the leaders of the uprising.\n\nLeft with little recourse now that his German troops were gone, King Otto gave in to the pressure and agreed to the demands of the crowd over the objections of his opinionated [[Queen Amalia of Greece|queen]]. This square was renamed [[Syntagma Square|Constitution Square]] (\u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) to commemorate (through to the present) the events of September 1843 \u2014 and to feature many later tumultuous events of Greek history.<ref>Tompkinson, John L., ''Athens: The City'' (Anagnosis Books, 1996) {{ISBN|960-87186-0-0}}</ref> Now for the first time, the king had Greeks in his Council and the French Party, the English Party and the Russian Party (according to which of the Great Powers' culture they most esteemed) vied for rank and power.\n\nThe king's prestige, which was based in large part on his support by the combined Great Powers, but mostly the support of the British, suffered in the ''[[Pacifico incident]]'' of 1850, when British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] sent the British fleet to blockade the port of [[Piraeus]] with warships to exact reparation for injustice done to a British subject.<ref>Pacifico was a Jew of Portuguese nationality, merchant and the Portuguese Consul in Athens, who accidentally was also a British citizen because he was born in Gibraltar. After a robbery in his shop he asked for compensation from the Greek state, but nobody paid attention to him, not even the Portuguese government. Finally, he asked for help from the British ambassador, and his case was turned into the blockade of the port of Piraeus by the British Fleet.</ref>\n\n==Crimean War==\n{{See also|Epirus revolt of 1854}}\nThe ''[[Megali Idea|Great Idea]]'' (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u0399\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1), the dream of uniting all Greek populations of the Ottoman Empire, thereby restoring the [[Byzantine Empire]] under Christian rule, led him to contemplate entering the [[Crimean War]] on the side of Russia against Turkey and its British and French allies in 1853; the enterprise was unsuccessful and resulted in renewed intervention by the two Great Powers and a second blockade of the [[Piraeus]] port, forcing Greece to neutrality.\n\nThe continued inability of the royal couple to have children also raised the thorny issue of succession: the 1844 constitution insisted that Otto's successor had to be Orthodox, but as the king was childless, the only possible heirs were his younger brothers, [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]] and [[Prince Adalbert of Bavaria (1828\u20131875)|Adalbert]]. The staunch Catholicism of the Wittelsbachs complicated matters, as Luitpold refused to convert and Adalbert married [[Infanta Amalia of Spain]]. The sons of Adalbert, and especially the eldest, [[Prince Ludwig Ferdinand of Bavaria|Ludwig Ferdinand]], were now considered the most likely candidates, but due to the issue of religion, no definite arrangements were ever made.{{sfn|Jelavich|1961|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\nIn 1861, a student named [[Aristeidis Dosios]] (son of politician [[Konstantinos Dosios]]) attempted to murder [[Queen Amalia of Greece|Queen Amalia]] and was openly hailed as a hero.

He was an organizer and principal philosopher of ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]'', a political movement that was [[monarchist]], [[anti-parliamentarist]], and [[counter-revolutionary]]. Maurras' ideas greatly influenced [[National Catholicism]] and [[integral nationalism|\"nationalisme int\u00e9gral\"]]. A major tenet of integral nationalism was stated by Maurras as \"a true nationalist places his country above everything\". He was one of the few eminent and probably the most important of all French ethnic nationalists, being naturally opposed to republican universalism and liberalism, advocating for corporatism, order, hierarchy and an organically decentralised France. A political theorist and a major intellectual influence in early 20th-century Europe, his views influenced several far-right ideologies; they also prefigured some of the ideas of [[fascism]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Maurras|title=Charles Maurras {{!}} French writer and political theorist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}</ref>{{Integralism}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Before World War I ===\nMaurras was born into a [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] family, brought up by his mother and grandmother in a Catholic and [[monarchism|monarchist]] environment.

Quoted by Bruno Goyet, ''op.cit.'', p.84</ref> Vichy's reactionary program of a [[R\u00e9volution nationale|R\u00e9volution Nationale]] (National Revolution) was fully approved of by Maurras, who inspired large parts of it.<ref name=Academie/> The monarchist newspaper was forbidden in the Occupied Zone and under Vichy censorship in the Southern Zone from November 1942.<ref>[[Jean S\u00e9villia]], ''Historiquement correct'', Tempus, 2006, p.365</ref> In ''La Seule France'' (1941) Maurras argued for a policy of ''France d'abord'' (\"France First\"), whereby France would restore itself politically and morally under P\u00e9tain, resolving the causes in his eyes of France's defeat in 1940, before dealing with the issue of the foreign occupation. This position was contrasted to the attitude of the Gaullists, who fled France and continued the military struggle. Maurras savaged the pre-war French governments for taking an increasingly bellicose position vis-\u00e0-vis Germany at precisely the same time that these governments were weakening France, militarily, socially and politically, thereby making France's defeat during 1940 all but inevitable. Maurras also criticized the 1940 [[Statute on Jews]] for being too moderate.<ref name=Slama/> At the same time he continued to express elements of his long standing germanophobia by arguing in ''La Seule France'' that Frenchmen must not be drawn to the German model and by hosting anti-German conferences,<ref>Jean Madiran, ''Maurras toujours l\u00e0'', Consep, 2004, p.71\u201372</ref> and he opposed both the \"[[Free French Forces|dissidents]]\" in London and the collaborators in Paris and Vichy (such as [[Lucien Rebatet]],<ref>In 1942, Rebatet published \"Les D\u00e9combres\" (\"The Ruins\"), a pamphlet in which he strongly opposed the \"en-jewed\" Action Fran\u00e7aise.</ref> [[Robert Brasillach]], [[Pierre Laval]], or [[Marcel D\u00e9at]]<ref>See for example [[Henri Amouroux]], ''La Vie des Fran\u00e7ais sous l'Occupation.

He later claimed he believed that P\u00e9tain was playing a \"double game\", working for an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in secret.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter the liberation of France, Maurras was arrested in September 1944 together with his right-hand man [[Maurice Pujo]], and indicted before the High Court of Lyon for \"complicity with the enemy\" on the basis of the articles he had published since the start of the war. At the end of the trial, during which there were many irregularities such as false dating or truncated quotations,<ref>[[Robert Aron]], ''Histoire de l'\u00e9puration'' (second volume), Fayard, 1969, p.365, 366, 367.<br>Listing these irregularities, Robert Aron describes Maurras' trial as \"one of the most pathetic and most characteristic of the [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale|\u00e9puration]]\" (page 362).</ref> Maurras was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil liberties. He was automatically dismissed from the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise (a measure included in the ordinance of 26 December 1944<ref name=Academie/>). His response to his conviction was to exclaim \"''C'est la revanche de Dreyfus!''\" (It's Dreyfus's revenge!)<ref name=Slama/> Meanwhile, the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise declared his seat vacant, as it had for P\u00e9tain's, instead of expelling him as it did for [[Abel Hermant]] and [[Abel Bonnard]].<ref name=Academie/> (The academy waited until his death to elect his successor, and chose [[Antoine de L\u00e9vis-Mirepoix]], who was himself influenced by Action Fran\u00e7aise and collaborated with [[Pierre Boutang]]'s monarchist review ''[[La Nation fran\u00e7aise|La Nation Fran\u00e7aise]]''.)\n\nAfter being imprisoned in [[Riom]] and then [[Clairvaux Prison|Clairvaux]], Maurras was released in March 1952 to enter hospital. He was supported by Henry Bordeaux, who repeatedly asked the President of the Republic, [[Vincent Auriol]], to pardon Maurras. Although weakened, Maurras collaborated with ''Aspects de la France'', which had replaced the outlawed review ''Action Fran\u00e7aise'' in 1947. He was transferred to a clinic in [[Tours]], where he soon died. In his last days he readopted the Catholic faith of his childhood and received the last rites.<ref>Lettre de l\u2019abb\u00e9 Giraud \u00e0 Charles Forot, 4 July 1958, archives d\u00e9partementales de Privas, dossier 24J25</ref>\n\n== Maurras' work ==\n{{main|Maurassisme}}\n\n=== Maurras and F\u00e9librige ===\n{{Main|F\u00e9librige}}\n\nA [[Provence]]-born author, Maurras joined F\u00e9librige (from ''f\u00e9libre'', Proven\u00e7al for pupil or follower), a literary and cultural association founded by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]] and other Proven\u00e7al writers to defend and promote Occitan languages and literature.\n\n=== Maurras' political thought ===\nMaurras' political ideas were based on intense nationalism (what he described as \"[[integralism|integral nationalism]]\") and a belief in an ordered society based on strong government. These were the bases of his endorsement for both a French monarchy and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nHe formulated an aggressive political strategy, which contrasted with the [[Legitimist]]s' apathy for political action.<ref name=Slama/> He managed to combine the paradox of a [[reactionary]] thought which would actively change history, a form of Counter-revolution opposed to simple conservatism.<ref name=Slama/> His \"integral nationalism\" rejected all [[democratic principles]] which he judged contrary to \"natural inequality\", criticizing all evolution since the 1789 [[French Revolution]], and advocated the return to a hereditary monarchy.<ref name=Academie/>\n\nLike many people in Europe at the time, he was haunted by the idea of \"[[decadence]]\", partly inspired by his reading of the publications of [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Ernest Renan]], and admired [[classicism]]. He felt that France had lost its grandeur during the [[French Revolution|Revolution of 1789]], a grandeur inherited from its origins as a province of the [[Roman Empire]] and forged by, as he put it, \"forty kings who in a thousand years made France.\" The French Revolution, he wrote in the ''Observateur Fran\u00e7ais'', was negative and destructive.\n\nHe traced this decline further back, to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; he described the source of the evil as \"Swiss ideas\", a reference to the adopted nation of [[John Calvin|Calvin]] and the birth nation of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. Maurras further blamed France's decline on \"Anti-France\", which he defined as the \"four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, [[Freemason]]s and foreigners\" (his actual word for the latter being the term ''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8ques]]''). Indeed, to him the first three were all \"internal foreigners.\"<ref>See, for example, [http://counterenlightenment.blogspot.com/2011/04/charles-maurras-on-four-confederate.html this extract] from his ''Dictionnaire politique et critique''.</ref>\n\nCriticism of the ''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8ques]] (foreigners)''  were common themes in his writings. He believed that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and the eventual outcome of the [[French Revolution]] had all contributed to individuals valuing themselves more than the nation, with consequent negative effects on the latter, and that democracy and liberalism were only making matters worse.\n\nAlthough Maurras advocated the revival of monarchy, in many ways Maurras did not typify the French monarchist tradition. His endorsement of the monarchy and for Catholicism was explicitly pragmatic, as he alleged that a state religion was the only way of maintaining public order. By contrast with [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], a theorist of a kind of [[Romantic nationalism]] based on the Ego, Maurras claimed to base his opinions on reason rather than on sentiment, loyalty and faith.\n\nParadoxically, he admired the [[Positivism|positivist]] philosopher [[Auguste Comte]], like many of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] politicians he detested, with which he opposed [[German idealism]]. Whereas the [[Legitimist]] monarchists refused to engage in political action, retreating into an intransigently conservative Catholicism and a relative indifference to a modern world they believed was irredeemably wicked and apostate, Maurras was prepared to engage in political action, both orthodox and unorthodox (the Action Fran\u00e7aise's [[Camelots du Roi]] league frequently engaged in street violence with left-wing opponents, as well as [[Marc Sangnier]]'s socialist Catholic [[Le Sillon]]). Maurras was twice convicted of inciting violence against politicians, and Prime Minister [[L\u00e9on Blum]] nearly died from the injuries inflicted by associates of Maurras.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/two-parisian-bookstores-side-by-side-are-waging-a-culture-war/2019/06/13/d234c051-a5f2-48f1-bd11-48f6bbe71677_story.html|title=Two Parisian bookstores, side by side, are waging a culture war|work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-06-14|language=en}}</ref>His slogan was the phrase \"La politique d'abord!\" (\"Politics first!\"). Other influences included [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Le Play]]; [[English empiricist]]s, who allowed him to reconcile [[Rationalism#Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650)|Cartesian rationalism]] with empiricism,<ref name=Slama/> and [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de La Tour du Pin Chambly, marquis de La Charce|Ren\u00e9 de La Tour du Pin]].\n\nMaurras' religious views were likewise less than orthodox. He supported the Catholic Church both because it was intimately involved with French history and because its hierarchical structure and clerical elite mirrored his image of an ideal society. He considered the Church to be the mortar which held France together, and the association linking all Frenchmen together. However, he distrusted the Gospels, written, as he put it, \"by four obscure Jews\",<ref>''Le Chemin du Paradis'', 1894</ref> but admired the Catholic Church for having allegedly concealed much of the Bible's \"dangerous teachings\". Maurras' interpretation of the Gospels and his integralist teachings were fiercely criticised by many Catholic clergy. However, towards the end of his life Maurras eventually converted from agnosticism to Catholicism.\n\nNotwithstanding his religious unorthodoxy, Maurras gained a large following among French monarchists and Catholics, including the [[Assumptionists]] and the [[Orleanist]] pretender to the French throne, the [[Philippe, comte de Paris|comte de Paris, Philippe]]. Nonetheless, his agnosticism worried parts of the Catholic hierarchy, and in 1926 [[Pope Pius XI]] placed some of Maurras's writings on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]] and condemned the Action Fran\u00e7aise philosophy as a whole. Seven of Maurras' books had already been placed on this list in 1914 and a dossier on Maurras had been submitted to Pius X.\n\nIt was not just his agnosticism which worried the Catholic hierarchy but that by insisting upon ''politiques d'abord'' he questioned the primacy of the spiritual and thus the teaching authority of the Church and the authority of the Pope himself. That this was the basis of the matter is shown by [[Jacques Maritain]]'s book ''Primaut\u00e9 du Spirituel''. Maritain was associated with L\u2019Action Fran\u00e7aise and knew Maurras. While his unease with the movement pre-dates the 1926 crisis, it was this which occasioned his alienation from Maurras and L\u2019Action Fran\u00e7aise. This papal condemnation was a great surprise to many of his devotees, who included a considerable number of French clergy, and caused great damage to the movement. It was ended however in 1939, a year after Maurras was elected to the ''Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise''.\n\n===Legacy===\nMaurras was a major intellectual influence of [[national Catholicism]], far-right movements, Latin [[conservatism]], and [[integral nationalism]].<ref name=Rojas>Miguel Rojas-Mix, \"''Maurras en Am\u00e9rique latine''\", ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', November 1980 (republished in ''Mani\u00e8res de voir'' n\u00b095, \"''Les droites au pouvoir''\", October\u2013November 2007)</ref> He and the ''Action Fran\u00e7aise'' influenced many people and movements including General [[Francisco Franco]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Sardinha]], [[Leon Degrelle]], and autonomist movements in Europe. The Christian Democrat [[Jacques Maritain]] was also close to Maurras before the papal condemnation of the AF in 1927,<ref name=Rojas/> and criticized democracy in one of his early writings, ''Une opinion sur Charles Maurras ou le devoir des catholiques''.<ref name=Rojas/> Furthermore, Maurrassism also influenced many writings from members of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' who theorized \"[[counter-revolutionary warfare]]\".<ref name=Rojas/> In Spain, the ''[[Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]]'' adopted not only its far right monarchism but also its name from Maurras's movement.<ref>[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''Spain's First Democracy: The Second Republic, 1931\u20131936'', 1993, p. 171</ref>\n\nThe influence extended to Latin America, as in Mexico where Jes\u00fas Guiza y Acevedo<ref name=Rojas/> was nicknamed \"the little Maurras\", as well as the historian [[Carlos Pereyra]] or the Venezuelan author [[Laureano Vallenilla Lanz]], who wrote a book titled ''Cesarismo democratico'' (Democratic [[Caesarism]]).<ref name=Rojas/> Other figures influenced include the Brazilian [[Plinio Corr\u00eaa de Oliveira]]. Maurras' thought also influenced [[Catholic fundamentalist]] supporters of the [[History of Brazil (1964\u20131985)|Brazilian dictatorship]]<ref name=Rojas/> (1964\u201385) as well as the ''Cursillos de la Cristiandad'' (Christendom Courses), similar to the ''[[Cit\u00e9 Catholique]]'' group, which were initiated during 1950 by the bishop of [[Ciudad Real]], Mgr.

This position was contrasted to the attitude of the Gaullists, who fled France and continued the military struggle. Maurras savaged the pre-war French governments for taking an increasingly bellicose position vis-\u00e0-vis Germany at precisely the same time that these governments were weakening France, militarily, socially and politically, thereby making France's defeat during 1940 all but inevitable. Maurras also criticized the 1940 [[Statute on Jews]] for being too moderate.<ref name=Slama/> At the same time he continued to express elements of his longstanding germanophobia by arguing in ''La Seule France'' that Frenchmen must not be drawn to the German model and by hosting anti-German conferences,<ref>Jean Madiran, ''Maurras toujours l\u00e0'', Consep, 2004, p.71\u201372</ref> and he opposed both the \"[[Free French Forces|dissidents]]\" in London and the collaborators in Paris and Vichy (such as [[Lucien Rebatet]],<ref>In 1942, Rebatet published \"Les D\u00e9combres\" (\"The Ruins\"), a pamphlet in which he strongly opposed the \"en-jewed\" Action Fran\u00e7aise.</ref> [[Robert Brasillach]], [[Pierre Laval]], or [[Marcel D\u00e9at]]<ref>See for example [[Henri Amouroux]], ''La Vie des Fran\u00e7ais sous l'Occupation.

At the end of the trial, during which there were many irregularities such as false dating or truncated quotations,<ref>[[Robert Aron]], ''Histoire de l'\u00e9puration'' (second volume), Fayard, 1969, p.365, 366, 367.<br>Listing these irregularities, Robert Aron describes Maurras' trial as \"one of the most pathetic and most characteristic of the [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale|\u00e9puration]]\" (page 362).</ref> Maurras was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil liberties. He was automatically dismissed from the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise (a measure included in the ordinance of 26 December 1944<ref name=Academie/>). His response to his conviction was to exclaim \"''C'est la revanche de Dreyfus!''\" (It's Dreyfus's revenge!)<ref name=Slama/> Meanwhile, the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise declared his seat vacant, as it had for P\u00e9tain's, instead of expelling him as it did for [[Abel Hermant]] and [[Abel Bonnard]].<ref name=Academie/> (The academy waited until his death to elect his successor, and chose [[Antoine de L\u00e9vis-Mirepoix]], who was himself influenced by Action Fran\u00e7aise and collaborated with [[Pierre Boutang]]'s monarchist review ''[[La Nation fran\u00e7aise|La Nation Fran\u00e7aise]]''.)\n\nAfter being imprisoned in [[Riom]] and then [[Clairvaux Prison|Clairvaux]], Maurras was released in March 1952 to enter hospital. He was supported by Henry Bordeaux, who repeatedly asked the President of the Republic, [[Vincent Auriol]], to pardon Maurras. Although weakened, Maurras collaborated with ''Aspects de la France'', which had replaced the outlawed review ''Action Fran\u00e7aise'' in 1947. He was transferred to a clinic in [[Tours]], where he soon died. In his last days he readopted the Catholic faith of his childhood and received the last rites.<ref>Lettre de l\u2019abb\u00e9 Giraud \u00e0 Charles Forot, 4 July 1958, archives d\u00e9partementales de Privas, dossier 24J25</ref>\n\n== Maurras' work ==\n{{main|Maurassisme}}\n\n=== Maurras and F\u00e9librige ===\n{{Main|F\u00e9librige}}\n\nA [[Provence]]-born author, Maurras joined F\u00e9librige (from ''f\u00e9libre'', Proven\u00e7al for pupil or follower), a literary and cultural association founded by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]] and other Proven\u00e7al writers to defend and promote Occitan languages and literature.\n\n=== Maurras' political thought ===\nMaurras' political ideas were based on intense nationalism (what he described as \"[[integralism|integral nationalism]]\") and a belief in an ordered society based on strong government. These were the bases of his endorsement for both a French monarchy and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nHe formulated an aggressive political strategy, which contrasted with the [[Legitimist]]s' apathy for political action.<ref name=Slama/> He managed to combine the paradox of a [[reactionary]] thought which would actively change history, a form of Counter-revolution opposed to simple conservatism.<ref name=Slama/> His \"integral nationalism\" rejected all [[democratic principles]] which he judged contrary to \"natural inequality\", criticizing all evolution since the 1789 [[French Revolution]], and advocated the return to a hereditary monarchy.<ref name=Academie/>\n\nLike many people in Europe at the time, he was haunted by the idea of \"[[decadence]]\", partly inspired by his reading of the publications of [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Ernest Renan]], and admired [[classicism]]. He felt that France had lost its grandeur during the [[French Revolution|Revolution of 1789]], a grandeur inherited from its origins as a province of the [[Roman Empire]] and forged by, as he put it, \"forty kings who in a thousand years made France.\" The French Revolution, he wrote in the ''Observateur Fran\u00e7ais'', was negative and destructive.\n\nHe traced this decline further back, to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; he described the source of the evil as \"Swiss ideas\", a reference to the adopted nation of [[John Calvin|Calvin]] and the birth nation of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. Maurras further blamed France's decline on \"Anti-France\", which he defined as the \"four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, [[Freemason]]s and foreigners\" (his actual word for the latter being the xenophobic term ''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8ques]]''). Indeed, to him the first three were all \"internal foreigners.\"<ref>See, for example, [http://counterenlightenment.blogspot.com/2011/04/charles-maurras-on-four-confederate.html this extract] from his ''Dictionnaire politique et critique''.</ref>\n\n[[Antisemitism]] and [[anti-Protestantism]] were common themes in his writings. He believed that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and the eventual outcome of the [[French Revolution]] had all contributed to individuals valuing themselves more than the nation, with consequent negative effects on the latter, and that democracy and liberalism were only making matters worse.\n\nAlthough Maurras advocated the revival of monarchy, in many ways Maurras did not typify the French monarchist tradition. His endorsement of the monarchy and for Catholicism was explicitly pragmatic, as he alleged that a state religion was the only way of maintaining public order. By contrast with [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], a theorist of a kind of [[Romantic nationalism]] based on the Ego, Maurras claimed to base his opinions on reason rather than on sentiment, loyalty and faith.\n\nParadoxically, he admired the [[Positivism|positivist]] philosopher [[Auguste Comte]], like many of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] politicians he detested, with which he opposed [[German idealism]]. Whereas the [[Legitimist]] monarchists refused to engage in political action, retreating into an intransigently conservative Catholicism and a relative indifference to a modern world they believed was irredeemably wicked and apostate, Maurras was prepared to engage in political action, both orthodox and unorthodox (the Action Fran\u00e7aise's [[Camelots du Roi]] league frequently engaged in street violence with left-wing opponents, as well as [[Marc Sangnier]]'s socialist Catholic [[Le Sillon]]). Maurras was twice convicted of inciting violence against Jewish politicians, and [[L\u00e9on Blum]], the first Jewish French prime minister, nearly died from the injuries inflicted by associates of Maurras.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/two-parisian-bookstores-side-by-side-are-waging-a-culture-war/2019/06/13/d234c051-a5f2-48f1-bd11-48f6bbe71677_story.html|title=Two Parisian bookstores, side by side, are waging a culture war|work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-06-14|language=en}}</ref>His slogan was the phrase \"La politique d'abord!\" (\"Politics first!\"). Other influences included [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Le Play]]; [[English empiricist]]s, who allowed him to reconcile [[Rationalism#Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650)|Cartesian rationalism]] with empiricism,<ref name=Slama/> and [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de La Tour du Pin Chambly, marquis de La Charce|Ren\u00e9 de La Tour du Pin]].\n\nMaurras' religious views were likewise less than orthodox. He supported the political Catholic Church both because it was intimately involved with French history and because its hierarchical structure and clerical elite mirrored his image of an ideal society. He considered the Church to be the mortar which held France together, and the association linking all Frenchmen together. However, he distrusted the Gospels, written, as he put it, \"by four obscure Jews\",<ref>''Le Chemin du Paradis'', 1894</ref> but admired the Catholic Church for having allegedly concealed much of the Bible's \"dangerous teachings\". Maurras' interpretation of the Gospels and his integralist teachings were fiercely criticised by many Catholic clergy. However, towards the end of his life Maurras eventually converted from agnosticism to Catholicism.\n\nNotwithstanding his religious unorthodoxy, Maurras gained a large following among French monarchists and Catholics, including the [[Assumptionists]] and the [[Orleanist]] pretender to the French throne, the [[Philippe, comte de Paris|comte de Paris, Philippe]]. Nonetheless, his agnosticism worried parts of the Catholic hierarchy, and in 1926 [[Pope Pius XI]] placed some of Maurras's writings on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]] and condemned the Action Fran\u00e7aise philosophy as a whole. Seven of Maurras' books had already been placed on this list in 1914 and a dossier on Maurras had been submitted to Pius X.\n\nIt was not just his agnosticism which worried the Catholic hierarchy but that by insisting upon ''politiques d'abord'' he questioned the primacy of the spiritual and thus the teaching authority of the Church and the authority of the Pope himself. That this was the basis of the matter is shown by [[Jacques Maritain]]'s book ''Primaut\u00e9 du Spirituel''. Maritain was associated with L\u2019Action Fran\u00e7aise and knew Maurras. While his unease with the movement pre-dates the 1926 crisis, it was this which occasioned his alienation from Maurras and L\u2019Action Fran\u00e7aise. This papal condemnation was a great surprise to many of his devotees, who included a considerable number of French clergy, and caused great damage to the movement. It was ended however in 1939, a year after Maurras was elected to the ''Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise''.\n\n===Legacy===\nMaurras was a major intellectual influence of [[national Catholicism]], far-right movements, Latin [[conservatism]], and [[integral nationalism]].<ref name=Rojas>Miguel Rojas-Mix, \"''Maurras en Am\u00e9rique latine''\", ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', November 1980 (republished in ''Mani\u00e8res de voir'' n\u00b095, \"''Les droites au pouvoir''\", October\u2013November 2007)</ref> He and the ''Action Fran\u00e7aise'' influenced many people and movements including General [[Francisco Franco]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Sardinha]], [[Leon Degrelle]], and autonomist movements in Europe.

Payne]], ''Spain's First Democracy: The Second Republic, 1931\u20131936'', 1993, p. 171</ref>\n\nThe influence extended to Latin America, as in Mexico where Jes\u00fas Guiza y Acevedo<ref name=Rojas/> was nicknamed \"the little Maurras\", as well as the historian [[Carlos Pereyra]] or the Venezuelan author [[Laureano Vallenilla Lanz]], who wrote a book titled ''Cesarismo democratico'' (Democratic [[Caesarism]]).<ref name=Rojas/> Other figures influenced include the Brazilian [[Plinio Corr\u00eaa de Oliveira]]. Maurras' thought also influenced [[Catholic fundamentalist]] supporters of the [[History of Brazil (1964\u20131985)|Brazilian dictatorship]]<ref name=Rojas/> (1964\u201385) as well as the ''Cursillos de la Cristiandad'' (Christendom Courses), similar to the ''[[Cit\u00e9 Catholique]]'' group, which were initiated during 1950 by the bishop of [[Ciudad Real]], Mgr. Herv\u00e9.<ref name=Rojas/> The Argentine militarist [[Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda]], who overthrew [[Arturo Illia]] in a military putsch in 1969, as well as [[Alejandro Agust\u00edn Lanusse]], who succeeded Ongan\u00eda after another coup, had participated in the ''Cursillos de la Cristiandad'',<ref name=Rojas/> as did also the Dominican militarists [[Antonio Imbert Barrera]] and [[El\u00edas Wessin y Wessin]], chief of staff of the military and an opponent of the restoration of the 1963 Constitution after [[Rafael Trujillo]] was deposed.<ref name=Rojas/> In Argentina he also influenced the nationalist writers of the 1920s and 1930s such as [[Rodolfo Irazusta]] and [[Juan Carulla]].<ref>Sandra McGee Deutsch, ''Las Derechas'', 1999, p. 197</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Michael Crowley wrote that [[Steve Bannon]], then chief strategist to President Donald Trump, \"... has also expressed admiration for the reactionary French philosopher Charles Maurras, according to French media reports confirmed by Politico.\"<ref name=\"Crowley\">{{cite web | url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/trump-steve-bannon-destroy-eu-european-union-214889 | last=Michael | first=Crowley | date=March 2017 | accessdate=2018-06-06 | publisher=Politico | title=The Man Who Wants to Unmake the West}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n{|width=100%\n|valign=\"top\" width=50%|\n* 1889 : ''Th\u00e9odore Aubanel''\n* 1891 : ''Jean Mor\u00e9as''\n* 1894 : ''Le Chemin du Paradis, mythes et fabliaux''\n* 1896\u20131899 : ''Le voyage d'Ath\u00e8nes''\n* 1898 : ''L'id\u00e9e de d\u00e9centralisation''\n* 1899 : ''Trois id\u00e9es politiques : Chateaubriand, Michelet, Sainte-Beuve''\n* 1900 : ''Enqu\u00eate sur la monarchie''\n* 1901 : ''Anthin\u00e9a : d'Ath\u00e8nes \u00e0 Florence''\n* 1902 : ''Les Amants de Venise, George Sand et Musset''\n* 1905 : ''L'Avenir de l'intelligence''\n* 1906 : ''Le Dilemme de Marc Sangnier''\n* 1910 : ''Kiel et Tanger''\n* 1912 : ''La Politique religieuse''\n* 1914 : ''L'Action Fran\u00e7aise et la Religion Catholique''\n* 1915 : ''L'\u00c9tang de Berre''\n* 1916 : ''Quand les Fran\u00e7ais ne s'aimaient pas''\n* 1916\u20131918 : ''Les Conditions de la victoire'', 4 volumes\n* 1921 : ''Tombeaux''\n* 1922 : ''Inscriptions''\n* 1923 : ''Po\u00e8tes''\n* 1924 : ''L'All\u00e9e des philosophes''\n* 1925 : ''La Musique int\u00e9rieure''\n* 1925 : ''Barbarie et po\u00e9sie''\n* 1927 : ''Lorsque Hugo eut les cent ans''\n* 1928 : ''Le prince des nu\u00e9es''\n* 1928 : ''Un d\u00e9bat sur le romantisme''\n* 1928 : ''Vers un art intellectuel''\n* 1928 : ''L'Anglais qui a connu la France''\n* 1929 : ''Corps glorieux ou Vertu de la perfection''\n* 1929 : ''Promenade italienne''\n* 1929 : ''Napol\u00e9on pour ou contre la France''\n* 1930 : ''De D\u00e9mos \u00e0 C\u00e9sar''\n* 1930 : ''Corse et Provence''\n* 1930 : ''Quatre nuits de Provence''\n* 1931 : ''Triptyque de Paul Bourget''\n* 1931 : ''Le Quadrilat\u00e8re''\n* 1931 : ''Au signe de Flore''\n* 1932 : ''Heures immortelles''\n|valign=\"top\" width=50%|\n* 1932\u20131933 : ''Dictionnaire politique et critique'', 5 volumes\n* 1935 : ''Prologue d'un essai sur la critique''\n* 1937 : ''Quatre po\u00e8mes d'Eurydice''\n* 1937 : ''L'amiti\u00e9 de Platon''\n* 1937 : ''Jacques Bainville et Paul Bourget''\n* 1937 : ''Les vergers sur la mer''\n* 1937 : ''Jeanne d'Arc, Louis XIV, Napol\u00e9on''\n* 1937 : ''Devant l'Allemagne \u00e9ternelle''\n* 1937 : ''Mes id\u00e9es politiques''\n* 1937 : ''La Dentelle du Rempart''\n* 1940 : ''Pages africaines''\n* 1941 : ''Sous la muraille des cypr\u00e8s''\n* 1941 : ''Mistral''\n* 1941 : ''La seule France''\n* 1942 : ''De la col\u00e8re \u00e0 la justice''\n* 1943 : ''Pour un r\u00e9veil fran\u00e7ais''\n* 1944 : ''Po\u00e9sie et v\u00e9rit\u00e9''\n* 1944 : ''Paysages mistraliens''\n* 1944 : ''Le Pain et le Vin''\n* 1945 : ''Au-devant de la nuit''\n* 1945 : ''L'Allemagne et nous''\n* 1947 : ''Les Deux Justices ou Notre J'accuse''\n* 1948 : ''L'Ordre et le D\u00e9sordre''\n* 1948 : ''Maurice Barr\u00e8s''\n* 1948 : ''Une promotion de Judas''\n* 1948 : ''R\u00e9ponse \u00e0 Andr\u00e9 Gide''\n* 1949 : ''Au Grand Juge de France''\n* 1949 : ''Le Cintre de Riom''\n* 1950 : ''Mon jardin qui s'est souvenu''\n* 1951 : ''Tragi-com\u00e9die de ma surdit\u00e9''\n* 1951 : ''V\u00e9rit\u00e9, justice, patrie'' (with [[Maurice Pujo]])\n* 1952 : ''\u00c0 mes vieux oliviers''\n* 1952 : ''La Balance int\u00e9rieure''\n* 1952 : ''Le Beau Jeu des reviviscences''\n* 1952 : ''Le Bienheureux [[Pius X|Pie X]], sauveur de la France''\n* 1953 : ''Pascal puni'' (published posthumously)\n* 1958: ''Lettres de prison (1944\u20131952)'' (published posthumously)\n* 1966: ''Lettres passe-murailles, correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e avec [[Xavier Vallat]] (1950\u20131952)'' (published posthumously)\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Curtis, Michael (2010).
