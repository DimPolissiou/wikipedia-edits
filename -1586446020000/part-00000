It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.  The Rally Monkey then holds up a \"Rally Time\" sign and the chorus of \"Jump Around\" is played to fire up the fans to cheer for the Angels to rally and catch up in the game while the Rally Monkey is shown jumping up and down.\n\n====Melbourne City FC====\nThe song is played by Australian football club [[Melbourne City FC]] after they score goals during home games at [[AAMI Park]].\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe song was played during the 2015 post-season in [[Gillette Stadium]] when the [[New England Patriots]] scored the final touchdown against the [[Baltimore Ravens]].

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

It is located in the [[sestiere]] of [[Cannaregio]], in Campo dei Gesuiti, not far from the Fondamenta Nuove.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Canaletto (II) 008.jpg|thumb|left|The Campo and Church, by Canaletto]]\nAccording to some sources<ref group=Notes>Giangiacopo Fontana, ''Illustrazione storico critica della Chiesa di Santa Sofia'' del 1836</ref> the construction of the church was financed by a certain Pietro or, according to Doge [[Andrea Dandolo]], by Cleto Gussoni in 1148 and was surrounded by grounds, bodies of water and wetlands. In 1154 Cleto turned it into a hospital for the poor who were ill, both men and women. Another Gussoni, by the name of Buonavere, relative and heir of Cleto, ultimately provided vineyards and some of his other estates in the districts of [[Chioggia]] and [[Pellestrina]]. In the monastery of I Gesuiti a member of the same family, Marco Gussoni, took his vows, miraculously cured by the then Blessed, later Saint [[Aloysius Gonzaga|Luigi Gonzaga]]. It is said that in 1601 Marco, struck down by a grave illness, was healed instantly on the invocation by the saint. However, on 1 August 1631 he contracted [[Italian plague of 1629-1631|the plague]] and died in [[Ferrara]] whilst working to help the plague victims there; he became known as \"uomo di somma piet\u00e0\" (man of supreme mercy). A portrait of him entitled ''Marco Gussoni blessing the plague victims at the Lazzaretto of Ferrara''<ref group=Notes>Marco Gussoni che benedice gli appestati nel Lazzaretto di Ferrara (1664)</ref> is exhibited in [[Ca' Rezzonico]].\n\nSaint [[Ignatius of Loyola]] visited the city of Venice for the first time in 1523 to embark on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He returned to I Gesuiti in 1535 with a group of friends, who already called themselves the [[Society of Jesus]] (members of which are referred to as Jesuits - Gesuiti in Italian), and here they were ordained as priests. It took just two years for the group to fully establish themselves in the [[Venetian Lagoon|lagoon of Venice]] and to gain a large following. They left for Rome in 1537.\n\nIn 1606, due to the quarrels between [[Pope Paul V]] and Venice, the city was placed under interdiction,<ref group=Notes>Interdiction involved a ban on performing religious rites</ref> and as a consequence, the Jesuits were exiled until 1657. During these years, Venice was involved in a consuming war with the Ottoman Empire and [[Pope Alexander VIII]] decided to provide the services of the Betlemitani, an order created to assist the Knights of the Cross who were under the control of this pope.\n\nVenice then sold the whole estate to the Jesuits, including a church, a hospital and a convent, for fifty-thousand [[ducat]]s. However, the Betlemitani church was not large enough for the Jesuits. So in 1715 they knocked it down and built their own temple. The church was given the name of ''Santa Maria Assunta'' ([[Assumption of Mary|Mary after Assumption]]). It was financed by the Manin family; an aristocratic Friulan family from 1651. The church was consecrated in 1728.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Campo dei Gesuiti (Venice).jpg|thumb|left|View of the \"Complex of Gesuiti\"]]\n[[File:Chiesa dei Gesuiti (North exposure).jpg|thumb|View from lagoon]]\nThe Jesuits in Venice determined that [[Domenico Rossi (architect)|Domenico Rossi]], who designed the [[San Stae|Church of San Stae]], was the ideal architect to do the work they needed. It was not an easy task for him as he had to follow strict plans, which were defined for the Jesuits by the [[Council of Trent]].\n\nThe facade is in two tiers: the lower of which is formed around eight columns, on which rests the rough and cracked [[architrave]] of the second tier. The columns support eight statues, which, along with four others in various niches, represent the \"[[Apostle (Christian)#The twelve apostles|twelve apostles]]\". Four other statues on the sides of the main entrance represent [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James the Greater]], [[Saint Peter]], [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] and [[Saint Matthew|Saint Matthew the Evangelist]]. Among the sculptors is [[Filippo Catasio]].<ref>Dizionario, Volume 1, by stefano Ticozzi, page 298</ref> and [[Giuseppe Ziminiani]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Filippo de'| last=Boni| year=1852| title=''Biografia degli artisti ovvero dizionario della vita e delle opere dei pittori, degli scultori, degli intagliatori, dei tipografi e dei musici di ogni nazione che fiorirono da'tempi pi\u00f9 remoti sino \u00e1 nostri giorni.

In recent times some work of Francesco Bonazza has been lost. A green and white marble banner, positioned in front of the central window.\n\nThe layout of the church is typical of Jesuit churches, in the form of a Latin cross with three chapels in the longest wing. The [[transept]] and [[chancel]] are alongside two other chapels. The six chapels on the sides of the [[nave]] are separated by small rooms which were probably once used for confession. Between the second and third chapels stands the remarkable pulpit created by Francesco Bonazza and along the entire corridor there are \"corretti\", grates that visitors to the convent could look through. The nave of the church pales in comparison to the altar, which is dedicated to the Holy Trinity, due to the presence of four pillars which support the cross vault. These pillars were decorated with green and white marble between 1725 and 1731.\nThe [[campanile]] is almost entirely the original that was erected for the church of the Betlemitani, the only addition is the [[Bell tower|belfry]] from the eighteenth century.\n\nThe ceiling is adorned with frescoes. In the chancel, ''Angel musicians in Glory'' (1720), and on the vaulted ceiling ''The Triumph of the Name of Jesus'' (1732), were painted by [[Ludovico Dorigny]]. On the ceiling of the nave, ''Abraham and Three Angels'' and ''Vision of St John Evangelist'' were painted by [[Francesco Fontebasso]] in 1734. The chancel is decorated with statues of cherubs, little angels, angels and archangels by [[Giuseppe Torretti]]. Around the altar, designed by the Jesuit father [[Giuseppe Pozzo]], ten columns support a green and white dome. A chapel in the church has the monument to Doge Cicogna by Campagna.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nChiesa Gesuiti Venezia Interno.jpg|The nave\nInterior of Chiesa dei Gesuiti (Venice) - Visione di san Giovanni evengelista - Francesco Fontebasso.jpg|''Vision of St John Evangelist'' by [[Francesco Fontebasso]]\nInterior of Chiesa dei Gesuiti (Venice) - Abramo che adora i tre angeli - Francesco Fontebasso.jpg|''Abraham and Three Angels'' by [[Francesco Fontebasso]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Counter-fa\u00e7ade ===\nThe funeral monument of the Da Lezze family by [[Jacopo Sansovino]] (mid-16th century).

It is located in the [[sestiere]] of [[Cannaregio]], in Campo dei Gesuiti, not far from the Fondamenta Nuove.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Canaletto (II) 008.jpg|thumb|left|The Campo and Church, by Canaletto]]\nAccording to some sources<ref group=Notes>Giangiacopo Fontana, ''Illustrazione storico critica della Chiesa di Santa Sofia'' del 1836</ref> the construction of the church was financed by a certain Pietro or, according to Doge [[Andrea Dandolo]], by Cleto Gussoni in 1148 and was surrounded by grounds, bodies of water and wetlands. In 1154 Cleto turned it into a hospital for the poor who were ill, both men and women. Another Gussoni, by the name of Buonavere, relative and heir of Cleto, ultimately provided vineyards and some of his other estates in the districts of [[Chioggia]] and [[Pellestrina]]. In the monastery of I Gesuiti a member of the same family, Marco Gussoni, took his vows, miraculously cured by the then Blessed, later Saint [[Aloysius Gonzaga|Luigi Gonzaga]]. It is said that in 1601 Marco, struck down by a grave illness, was healed instantly on the invocation by the saint. However, on 1 August 1631 he contracted [[Italian plague of 1629-1631|the plague]] and died in [[Ferrara]] whilst working to help the plague victims there; he became known as \"uomo di somma piet\u00e0\" (man of supreme mercy). A portrait of him entitled ''Marco Gussoni blessing the plague victims at the Lazzaretto of Ferrara''<ref group=Notes>Marco Gussoni che benedice gli appestati nel Lazzaretto di Ferrara (1664)</ref> is exhibited in [[Ca' Rezzonico]].\n\nSaint [[Ignatius of Loyola]] visited the city of Venice for the first time in 1523 to embark on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He returned to I Gesuiti in 1535 with a group of friends, who already called themselves the [[Society of Jesus]] (members of which are referred to as Jesuits - Gesuiti in Italian), and here they were ordained as priests. It took just two years for the group to fully establish themselves in the [[Venetian Lagoon|lagoon of Venice]] and to gain a large following. They left for Rome in 1537.\n\nIn 1606, due to the quarrels between [[Pope Paul V]] and Venice, the city was placed under interdiction,<ref group=Notes>Interdiction involved a ban on performing religious rites</ref> and as a consequence, the Jesuits were exiled until 1657. During these years, Venice was involved in a consuming war with the Ottoman Empire and [[Pope Alexander VIII]] decided to provide the services of the Betlemitani, an order created to assist the Knights of the Cross who were under the control of this pope.\n\nVenice then sold the whole estate to the Jesuits, including a church, a hospital and a convent, for fifty-thousand [[ducat]]s. However, the Betlemitani church was not large enough for the Jesuits. So in 1715 they knocked it down and built their own temple. The church was given the name of ''Santa Maria Assunta'' ([[Assumption of Mary|Mary after Assumption]]). It was financed by the Manin family; an aristocratic Friulan family from 1651. The church was consecrated in 1728.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Campo dei Gesuiti (Venice).jpg|thumb|left|View of the \"Complex of Gesuiti\"]]\n[[File:Chiesa dei Gesuiti (North exposure).jpg|thumb|View from lagoon]]\nThe Jesuits in Venice determined that [[Domenico Rossi (architect)|Domenico Rossi]], who designed the [[San Stae|Church of San Stae]], was the ideal architect to do the work they needed. It was not an easy task for him as he had to follow strict plans, which were defined for the Jesuits by the [[Council of Trent]].\n\nThe facade is in two tiers: the lower of which is formed around eight columns, on which rests the rough and cracked [[architrave]] of the second tier. The columns support eight statues, which, along with four others in various niches, represent the \"[[Apostle (Christian)#The twelve apostles|twelve apostles]]\". Four other statues on the sides of the main entrance represent [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James the Greater]], [[Saint Peter]], [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] and [[Saint Matthew|Saint Matthew the Evangelist]]. Among the sculptors is [[Filippo Catasio]].<ref>Dizionario, Volume 1, by stefano Ticozzi, page 298</ref> and [[Giuseppe Ziminiani]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Filippo de'| last=Boni| year=1852| title=''Biografia degli artisti ovvero dizionario della vita e delle opere dei pittori, degli scultori, degli intagliatori, dei tipografi e dei musici di ogni nazione che fiorirono da'tempi pi\u00f9 remoti sino \u00e1 nostri giorni.

In recent times some work of Francesco Bonazza has been lost. A green and white marble banner, positioned in front of the central window.\n\nThe layout of the church is typical of Jesuit churches, in the form of a Latin cross with three chapels in the longest wing. The [[transept]] and [[chancel]] are alongside two other chapels. The six chapels on the sides of the [[nave]] are separated by small rooms which were probably once used for confession. Between the second and third chapels stands the remarkable pulpit created by Francesco Bonazza and along the entire corridor there are \"corretti\", grates that visitors to the convent could look through. The nave of the church pales in comparison to the altar, which is dedicated to the Holy Trinity, due to the presence of four pillars which support the cross vault. These pillars were decorated with green and white marble between 1725 and 1731.\nThe [[campanile]] is almost entirely the original that was erected for the church of the Betlemitani, the only addition is the [[Bell tower|belfry]] from the eighteenth century.\n\nThe ceiling is adorned with frescoes. In the chancel, ''Angel musicians in Glory'' (1720), and on the vaulted ceiling ''The Triumph of the Name of Jesus'' (1732), were painted by [[Ludovico Dorigny]]. On the ceiling of the nave, ''Abraham and Three Angels'' and ''Vision of St John Evangelist'' were painted by [[Francesco Fontebasso]] in 1734. The chancel is decorated with statues of cherubs, little angels, angels and archangels by [[Giuseppe Torretti]]. Around the altar, designed by the Jesuit father [[Giuseppe Pozzo]], ten columns support a green and white dome. A chapel in the church has the monument to Doge Cicogna by Campagna.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nChiesa Gesuiti Venezia Interno.jpg|The nave\nInterior of Chiesa dei Gesuiti (Venice) - Visione di san Giovanni evengelista - Francesco Fontebasso.jpg|''Vision of St John Evangelist'' by [[Francesco Fontebasso]]\nInterior of Chiesa dei Gesuiti (Venice) - Abramo che adora i tre angeli - Francesco Fontebasso.jpg|''Abraham and Three Angels'' by [[Francesco Fontebasso]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Counter-fa\u00e7ade ===\nThe funeral monument of the Da Lezze family by [[Jacopo Sansovino]] (mid-16th century).

The Chief Minister under Aandavar's influence has given free rein to the police to dismantle Chinna Marudhu's organization and they bring Chinna Marudhu alive to Aandavar's house. Aandavar requests Chinna Marudhu to join him and to kill Nallathambi or he will kill all the members of his organization. Nallathambi accepts to sacrifice his life for the organization and Chinna Marudhu shot him dead. One year later, Chinna Marudhu works for Aandavar and he is waiting for the right moment to kill Aandavar.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*Rishi Kumar as Nallathambi / Meyyan\n*[[Shruthi Raj]] as Sarasu\n*Sujibala as Malar\n*[[Sanjay Ram]] as Chinna Marudhu\n*Sudhakar Vasanth as Aandavar\n*[[R.

It is a stone [[Neo-Gothic]] structure built in the early 20th century.\n\nIt was the first of 65 similar churches, most also in [[Western New York]], designed by Robert North, a former [[choirboy]] at the church. His design was informed by a trip he made to England, paid for by the dying widow who also underwrote the church's construction and wanted a design inspired by \"the quiet spirit of the English countryside\". North also followed contemporary architects like [[Ralph Adams Cram]] in their desire to extend the Gothic style beyond its medieval models, and made early use of newer building materials like [[reinforced concrete]] and [[cast stone]].\n\nIt is the third building to house the church, which dates to the early years of Batavia's settlement a century before the church's construction. In 2004 the church building, its [[rectory]] and a stone wall were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Around the same time it faced a scandal surrounding the dismissal of its pastor, and the costs of maintaining an aging building raised doubts as to whether the church could continue using it. It is currently trying to raise the money to restore its [[bell tower]].\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n\nThe church complex is a {{convert|2.8|acre|adj=on}} parcel on the north side of East Main, midway between Ross and Vine streets, just east of downtown Batavia. On the west are two older houses now serving as professional offices; to the east are houses. Across the street are several larger commercial buildings and their parking lots. To the north is a baseball diamond associated with one of the city's elementary schools. [[Richmond Memorial Library]], also listed on the Register, is to the northeast. The church property is on a slight rise in the middle of an otherwise level area.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThere are three buildings on the site, between the drives and parking areas on the east and west. The church itself is in the center, with the [[rectory]] to its northeast and a storage building to its northeast. A stone [[retaining wall]] with steps in the middle sets off the large lawn facing East Main on the south. All except the storage building are [[contributing property|contributing properties]] to the Register listing.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\n===Church===\n\nThe church building itself has three sections. The main block, with the [[sanctuary]], is a rectangular structure of sandstone laid in random [[ashlar]] [[sandstone]] with a steeply pitched [[gable]]d roof sheathed in blue and gray slate. It is dominated by the square [[bell tower]] at the south (front) end.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nAlong both sides are stepped stone [[buttress]]es. All the [[Tudor Revival]] arched doors and [[stained glass]] windows have smooth finished [[limestone]] and cast stone surrounds. The large windows on the north and south sides have [[Decorated Gothic]] stone [[mullion]]s; the aisle windows have [[Perpendicular Gothic]] mullions with [[quatrefoil]] carvings in the apex. Small windows are located in the [[clerestory]].<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nAt the base of the bell tower is the wooden main entrance. Above it is the large southern window, with two vents having [[patina]]ted copper [[louver]]s and an empty niche in between at the [[bell tower|belfry]] stage. A [[bas-relief]] [[Celtic cross]] rises to the [[parapet]]ed roofline.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nOn the west side is the church's office wing. It is a two-story [[Tudor Revival]] structure with the lower story sided in random ashlar stone and [[stucco]] and the upper in half-timber. At the top is a decorative cross-gabled roof; on the sides are multi-paned [[casement window]]s. A newer [[concrete block]] educational wing projects from its north.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\n====Interior====\n\nInside, the tower base's high arch makes it a [[narthex]], with a glazed wood screen setting it apart from the [[nave]]. The white marble [[baptismal font]] is located in the center aisle a short distance from the nave.  The floor is [[terra cotta]] panels set in cast concrete. Walls are done in unpainted stone, cast stone and plaster scored to resemble stone. Dark [[wood stain|stained]] oak panels complement the similar [[pew]]s.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThe west aisle leads to a [[chantry]] altar and [[aumbry]]. Behind it is the organ chamber. A wood screen similar to the narthex screen sets off the [[chapel]] on the east side.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nAt the north end is a traditional deep square [[chancel]] set off from the nave by a stone wall with brass gates. A white marble [[pulpit]] and [[Eagle lectern|lectern with brass eagle motif]] flank the steps. In the center is the white marble altar, originally against the north wall. Now located behind it is a paneled [[reredos]] with three niches. The center one has a figure of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] holding his hand out in blessing. It is flanked by smaller niches with figures of [[James the Just|St. James]] and [[John the Baptist|St. John]]. On either side of the chancel are [[choir stall]]s.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThe inside of the office wing is minimally decorated. It has plaster walls and simple [[architrave]] door and window surrounds. The doors are paneled oak; other woodwork is stained in dark [[walnut]]. To the north the education wing has plain walls of painted concrete block; the fellowship hall has a large ceiling on [[lamination|laminated]] Tudor arched [[truss]]es.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\n===Rectory and storage building===\n\nThe rectory is a two-story [[Tudor Revival]] house with a cross-gabled roof. A garage is attached to the north. Its half-timbered stucco walls have a bank of casement windows on the south and paired casement windows elsewhere. The storage building is a simple gabled [[timber frame|wood frame]] building with a north-south orientation. On its south end a rolling door is sheltered by a deep projection of the roof supported by wooden posts.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe St. James congregation was founded in 1815, in the early days of Batavia's settlement as the center of the [[Holland Purchase]], most of today's [[Western New York]], eight years before the settlement itself was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a village. Throughout the rest of the century it occupied two buildings on Ellicott Street, neither of which are extant. Adelaide Richmond Kenny, a congregant and the only daughter of [[Dean Richmond]], a local railroad executive who served as president of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]], donated the money for the new church in the last years of her life. It was the culmination of over three decades of local philanthropy following her brief marriage, in which she also endowed nearby Batavia Hospital.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, she gave Robert North $600 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600|1900|r=-3}}}} in contemporary dollars.{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to travel to the [[United Kingdom]], directing him to \"design a church in the quiet spirit of the English countryside.\" He received the formal commission three days after Kenny died.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThat instruction brought North, a former St. James' [[choirboy]] who had studied architecture at [[Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning|Cornell]], into close contact with the type of churches held up as architectural exemplars in ''[[Cambridge Camden Society#The Ecclesiologist|The Ecclesiologist]]'' a half-century before. Those English country churches had inspired [[Richard Upjohn]], [[Frederick Clarke Withers]] and other [[Gothic Revival]] architects of that era. Contemporary architects like [[Ralph Adams Cram]], [[Bertram Goodhue]] and [[Henry Vaughan (architect)|Henry Vaughan]] were also designing churches from those models, but they believed that the style offered potential that had not been explored when it initially fell out of favor in the 16th century. Their churches, which emphasized clarity of design and functionality over the [[Picturesque]] elements of the earlier Gothic-inspired architects, were called [[Neo-Gothic]].<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nNorth's church was a sophisticated example of the style, one that anticipates later neo-Gothic churches. It recalls medieval models with its restrained [[ornament (architecture)|decoration]] and [[buttress]]es outside. The inside also seems at first to be strictly following medieval precepts, but the high arch in the lower story of the tower, giving the effect of a continuation of the [[nave]], departs from that model. North also made use of some new building materials of his time, such as structural [[reinforced concrete]], particularly in the floor, and [[cast stone]] in the exterior tracery. He went on to design 65 other churches throughout Western New York in a similar style.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThe rectory was built in the same [[Tudor Revival]] as the office wing, in 1929. In 1953 the education wing was added to the latter's north end. Inside the [[sanctuary]] the altar has been moved off the north wall, in keeping with modern [[liturgy|liturgical]] trends. There have been no other significant changes to the building and grounds since construction.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nAs its centennial neared, St. James was at the center of a scandal. Rector Simon Howson was [[termination of employment|dismissed]] in 2004 after allegations that he had stolen from the church. A month later he filed a [[wrongful termination]] suit against the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York, claiming he had been retaliated against by the bishop for reporting [[sexual harassment]] by a visiting gay priest from Massachusetts. He was [[Defrocking#Anglicanism|defrocked]] in 2007. The following year he and the diocese [[settlement (law)|settled]] for an undisclosed amount.<ref name=\"Howson scandal\">{{cite news|last=Tokasz|first=Jay|title=Settlement reached in suit brought by ex-priest|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/buffalo-news/mi_8030/is_20081002/settlement-reached-suit-brought-priest/ai_n43010275/|publisher=findarticles.com|date=October 2, 2008|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAt that time the building's design and age were also issues for the church. The costs of maintaining its declining structure were further strained when the church's [[endowment fund|endowment]] lost money in the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|stock market declines of the late 2000s]]. Utility bills alone reached  $60,000 a month. Howson's replacement had to leave since the congregation could not afford a full-time pastor, and the congregation pondered whether it should leave the building.<ref name=\"2009 Batavia Daily News story\">{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Joanne|title=Batavia Episcopal church is losing its pastor|url=http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_53ef6059-e8e2-56a9-a984-8d7b63b13b23.html|newspaper=[[The Daily News (Batavia)|The Daily News]]|location=[[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia, NY]]|date=October 15, 2009|access-date=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418221144/http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_53ef6059-e8e2-56a9-a984-8d7b63b13b23.html|archive-date=2012-04-18|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Under new [[vicar]] Stephen Metcalfe, who took over in 2010, the church is hoping to raise the money to rehabilitate the aging bell tower.<ref name=\"2010 Batavia Daily News story\">{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Joanne|title=St. James Church vicar ready for challenges of new post|url=http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_07abe8c2-b0d3-11df-ae39-001cc4c002e0.html|newspaper=[[The Daily News (Batavia)|The Daily News]]|location=[[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia, NY]]|date=August 26, 2010|access-date=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829122631/http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_07abe8c2-b0d3-11df-ae39-001cc4c002e0.html|archive-date=2010-08-29|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Genesee County, New York]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.stjamesbatavia.org/ St. James Episcopal Church]\n*[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMEKN_Saint_James_Episcopal_Church Saint James' Episcopal Church - U.S. National Register of Historic Places on Waymarking.com]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in New York}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint James Episcopal Church, Batavia, New York}}\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1908]]\n[[Category:20th-century Episcopal church buildings]]\n[[Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Episcopal church buildings in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1815]]\n[[Category:Churches in Genesee County, New York]]\n[[Category:1815 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Genesee County, New York]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox religious building\n| name         = St. James Episcopal Church\n| image                 = Saint James Episcopal Church Batavia NY Oct 09.JPG\n\n| alt                   = A stone church tower with a level top, gently arched pointed windows and a small wooden door in the base.

It is a stone [[Neo-Gothic]] structure built in the early 20th century.\n\nIt was the first of 65 similar churches, most also in [[Western New York]], designed by Robert North, a former [[choirboy]] at the church. His design was informed by a trip he made to England, paid for by the dying widow who also underwrote the church's construction and wanted a design inspired by \"the quiet spirit of the English countryside\". North also followed contemporary architects like [[Ralph Adams Cram]] in their desire to extend the Gothic style beyond its medieval models, and made early use of newer building materials like [[reinforced concrete]] and [[cast stone]].\n\nIt is the third building to house the church, which dates to the early years of Batavia's settlement a century before the church's construction. In 2004 the church building, its [[rectory]] and a stone wall were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Around the same time it faced a scandal surrounding the dismissal of its pastor, and the costs of maintaining an aging building raised doubts as to whether the church could continue using it. It is currently trying to raise the money to restore its [[bell tower]].\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n\nThe church complex is a {{convert|2.8|acre|adj=on}} parcel on the north side of East Main, midway between Ross and Vine streets, just east of downtown Batavia. On the west are two older houses now serving as professional offices; to the east are houses. Across the street are several larger commercial buildings and their parking lots. To the north is a baseball diamond associated with one of the city's elementary schools. [[Richmond Memorial Library]], also listed on the Register, is to the northeast. The church property is on a slight rise in the middle of an otherwise level area.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThere are three buildings on the site, between the drives and parking areas on the east and west. The church itself is in the center, with the [[rectory]] to its northeast and a storage building to its northeast. A stone [[retaining wall]] with steps in the middle sets off the large lawn facing East Main on the south. All except the storage building are [[contributing property|contributing properties]] to the Register listing.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\n===Church===\n\nThe church building itself has three sections. The main block, with the [[sanctuary]], is a rectangular structure of sandstone laid in random [[ashlar]] [[sandstone]] with a steeply pitched [[gable]]d roof sheathed in blue and gray slate. It is dominated by the square [[bell tower]] at the south (front) end.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nAlong both sides are stepped stone [[buttress]]es. All the [[Tudor Revival]] arched doors and [[stained glass]] windows have smooth finished [[limestone]] and cast stone surrounds. The large windows on the north and south sides have [[Decorated Gothic]] stone [[mullion]]s; the aisle windows have [[Perpendicular Gothic]] mullions with [[quatrefoil]] carvings in the apex. Small windows are located in the [[clerestory]].<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nAt the base of the bell tower is the wooden main entrance. Above it is the large southern window, with two vents having [[patina]]ted copper [[louver]]s and an empty niche in between at the [[bell tower|belfry]] stage. A [[bas-relief]] [[Celtic cross]] rises to the [[parapet]]ed roofline.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nOn the west side is the church's office wing. It is a two-story [[Tudor Revival]] structure with the lower story sided in random ashlar stone and [[stucco]] and the upper in half-timber. At the top is a decorative cross-gabled roof; on the sides are multi-paned [[casement window]]s. A newer [[concrete block]] educational wing projects from its north.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\n====Interior====\n\nInside, the tower base's high arch makes it a [[narthex]], with a glazed wood screen setting it apart from the [[nave]]. The white marble [[baptismal font]] is located in the center aisle a short distance from the nave.  The floor is [[terra cotta]] panels set in cast concrete. Walls are done in unpainted stone, cast stone and plaster scored to resemble stone. Dark [[wood stain|stained]] oak panels complement the similar [[pew]]s.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThe west aisle leads to a [[chantry]] altar and [[aumbry]]. Behind it is the organ chamber. A wood screen similar to the narthex screen sets off the [[chapel]] on the east side.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nAt the north end is a traditional deep square [[chancel]] set off from the nave by a stone wall with brass gates. A white marble [[pulpit]] and [[Eagle lectern|lectern with brass eagle motif]] flank the steps. In the center is the white marble altar, originally against the north wall. Now located behind it is a paneled [[reredos]] with three niches. The center one has a figure of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] holding his hand out in blessing. It is flanked by smaller niches with figures of [[James the Just|St. James]] and [[John the Baptist|St. John]]. On either side of the chancel are [[choir stall]]s.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThe inside of the office wing is minimally decorated. It has plaster walls and simple [[architrave]] door and window surrounds. The doors are paneled oak; other woodwork is stained in dark [[walnut]]. To the north the education wing has plain walls of painted concrete block; the fellowship hall has a large ceiling on [[lamination|laminated]] Tudor arched [[truss]]es.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\n===Rectory and storage building===\n\nThe rectory is a two-story [[Tudor Revival]] house with a cross-gabled roof. A garage is attached to the north. Its half-timbered stucco walls have a bank of casement windows on the south and paired casement windows elsewhere. The storage building is a simple gabled [[timber frame|wood frame]] building with a north-south orientation. On its south end a rolling door is sheltered by a deep projection of the roof supported by wooden posts.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe St. James congregation was founded in 1815, in the early days of Batavia's settlement as the center of the [[Holland Purchase]], most of today's [[Western New York]], eight years before the settlement itself was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a village. Throughout the rest of the century it occupied two buildings on Ellicott Street, neither of which are extant. Adelaide Richmond Kenny, a congregant and the only daughter of [[Dean Richmond]], a local railroad executive who served as president of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]], donated the money for the new church in the last years of her life. It was the culmination of over three decades of local philanthropy following her brief marriage, in which she also endowed nearby Batavia Hospital.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, she gave Robert North $600 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600|1900|r=-3}}}} in contemporary dollars.{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to travel to the [[United Kingdom]], directing him to \"design a church in the quiet spirit of the English countryside.\" He received the formal commission three days after Kenny died.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThat instruction brought North, a former St. James' [[choirboy]] who had studied architecture at [[Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning|Cornell]], into close contact with the type of churches held up as architectural exemplars in ''[[Cambridge Camden Society#The Ecclesiologist|The Ecclesiologist]]'' a half-century before. Those English country churches had inspired [[Richard Upjohn]], [[Frederick Clarke Withers]] and other [[Gothic Revival]] architects of that era. Contemporary architects like [[Ralph Adams Cram]], [[Bertram Goodhue]] and [[Henry Vaughan (architect)|Henry Vaughan]] were also designing churches from those models, but they believed that the style offered potential that had not been explored when it initially fell out of favor in the 16th century. Their churches, which emphasized clarity of design and functionality over the [[Picturesque]] elements of the earlier Gothic-inspired architects, were called [[Neo-Gothic]].<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nNorth's church was a sophisticated example of the style, one that anticipates later neo-Gothic churches. It recalls medieval models with its restrained [[ornament (architecture)|decoration]] and [[buttress]]es outside. The inside also seems at first to be strictly following medieval precepts, but the high arch in the lower story of the tower, giving the effect of a continuation of the [[nave]], departs from that model. North also made use of some new building materials of his time, such as structural [[reinforced concrete]], particularly in the floor, and [[cast stone]] in the exterior tracery. He went on to design 65 other churches throughout Western New York in a similar style.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThe rectory was built in the same [[Tudor Revival]] as the office wing, in 1929. In 1953 the education wing was added to the latter's north end. Inside the [[sanctuary]] the altar has been moved off the north wall, in keeping with modern [[liturgy|liturgical]] trends. There have been no other significant changes to the building and grounds since construction.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nAs its centennial neared, St. James was at the center of a scandal. Rector Simon Howson was [[termination of employment|dismissed]] in 2004 after allegations that he had stolen from the church. A month later he filed a [[wrongful termination]] suit against the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York, claiming he had been retaliated against by the bishop for reporting [[sexual harassment]] by a visiting gay priest from Massachusetts. He was [[Defrocking#Anglicanism|defrocked]] in 2007. The following year he and the diocese [[settlement (law)|settled]] for an undisclosed amount.<ref name=\"Howson scandal\">{{cite news|last=Tokasz|first=Jay|title=Settlement reached in suit brought by ex-priest|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/buffalo-news/mi_8030/is_20081002/settlement-reached-suit-brought-priest/ai_n43010275/|publisher=findarticles.com|date=October 2, 2008|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAt that time the building's design and age were also issues for the church. The costs of maintaining its declining structure were further strained when the church's [[endowment fund|endowment]] lost money in the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|stock market declines of the late 2000s]]. Utility bills alone reached  $60,000 a month. Howson's replacement had to leave since the congregation could not afford a full-time pastor, and the congregation pondered whether it should leave the building.<ref name=\"2009 Batavia Daily News story\">{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Joanne|title=Batavia Episcopal church is losing its pastor|url=http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_53ef6059-e8e2-56a9-a984-8d7b63b13b23.html|newspaper=[[The Daily News (Batavia)|The Daily News]]|location=[[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia, NY]]|date=October 15, 2009|access-date=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418221144/http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_53ef6059-e8e2-56a9-a984-8d7b63b13b23.html|archive-date=2012-04-18|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Under new [[vicar]] Stephen Metcalfe, who took over in 2010, the church is hoping to raise the money to rehabilitate the aging bell tower.<ref name=\"2010 Batavia Daily News story\">{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Joanne|title=St. James Church vicar ready for challenges of new post|url=http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_07abe8c2-b0d3-11df-ae39-001cc4c002e0.html|newspaper=[[The Daily News (Batavia)|The Daily News]]|location=[[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia, NY]]|date=August 26, 2010|access-date=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829122631/http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_07abe8c2-b0d3-11df-ae39-001cc4c002e0.html|archive-date=2010-08-29|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Genesee County, New York]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.stjamesbatavia.org/ St. James' Episcopal Church]\n*[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMEKN_Saint_James_Episcopal_Church Saint James' Episcopal Church - U.S. National Register of Historic Places on Waymarking.com]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in New York}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint James Episcopal Church, Batavia, New York}}\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1908]]\n[[Category:20th-century Episcopal church buildings]]\n[[Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Episcopal church buildings in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1815]]\n[[Category:Churches in Genesee County, New York]]\n[[Category:1815 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Genesee County, New York]]\n", "name_user": "Jgellison80", "label": "safe", "comment": "The apostrophe was removed from the name", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._James%27_Episcopal_Church_(Batavia,_New_York)"}
