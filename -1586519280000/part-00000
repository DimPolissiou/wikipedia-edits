Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling [[charlatan]]. In this act he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to [[Paris]] where he worked as a street performer.\n\nAt the start of the [[War of the First Coalition]], Tarrare joined the [[French Revolutionary Army]], where ever quadruple the standard military ration was unable to satisfy his large appetite. He would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. He was hospitalised due to exhaustion and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed eels whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and with the exception of his eating habits he showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.\n\nGeneral [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]] decided to put Tarrare's abilities to military use, and employed him as a [[courier]] for the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Tarrare could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] forces, severely beaten, and underwent a [[mock execution]] before being returned to French lines.\n\nChastened by this experience, he agreed to submit to any procedure that would cure his appetite, and was treated with [[laudanum]], tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for [[offal]] in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] with a case of severe [[tuberculosis]], and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of [[exudative diarrhoea]].\n\n==Early life==\nTarrare was born in rural France, near [[Lyon]], around 1772.<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 203\">{{citation|editor=T.

Although General de&nbsp;Beauharnais was convinced of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, he was concerned about his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near [[Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Neustadt]];{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality de&nbsp;Beauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}}\n\nTarrare crossed Prussian lines under cover of darkness, disguised as a German peasant.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Unable to speak German,{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=198}} he soon attracted the attention of local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside [[Landau]].

Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling [[charlatan]]. In this act he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to [[Paris]] where he worked as a street performer.\n\nAt the start of the [[War of the First Coalition]], Tarrare joined the [[French Revolutionary Army]], where ever quadruple the standard military ration was unable to satisfy his large appetite. He would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. He was hospitalised due to exhaustion and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed eels whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and with the exception of his eating habits he showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.\n\nGeneral [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]] decided to put Tarrare's abilities to military use, and employed him as a [[courier]] for the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Tarrare could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] forces, severely beaten and underwent a [[mock execution]] before being returned to French lines.\n\nChastened by this experience, he agreed to submit to any procedure that would cure his appetite, and was treated with [[laudanum]], tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for [[offal]] in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] with a case of severe [[tuberculosis]], and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of [[exudative diarrhoea]].\n\n==Early life==\nTarrare was born in rural France, near [[Lyon]], around 1772.<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 203\">{{citation|editor=T.

He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin.<ref name=\"Gould & Pyle\" />{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=197}} Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.<ref name=\"Gould & Pyle\" />\n\n===Service as a military courier===\nAfter several months he spent as an experimental case, military authorities began to press for Tarrare to be returned to active duty.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached [[Alexandre de Beauharnais|General Alexandre de&nbsp;Beauharnais]] with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}}<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" /> Courville proposed to de&nbsp;Beauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}}\n\nTarrare was called on by Beauharnais to demonstrate his abilities before a gathering of the commanders of the [[Army of the Rhine (France)|Army of the Rhine]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} Having swallowed the box successfully, Tarrare was given a wheelbarrow filled with {{convert|30|lb}} of raw bull's lungs and liver as a reward,<ref name=\"Gould & Pyle\" /> which he immediately ate in front of the assembled generals.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}}{{sfn|Lord|1839|p=112}}\n\nFollowing this successful demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially as a spy of the Army of the Rhine. Although General de&nbsp;Beauharnais was convinced of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, he was concerned about his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near [[Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Neustadt]];{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality de&nbsp;Beauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}}\n\nTarrare crossed Prussian lines under cover of darkness, disguised as a German peasant.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Unable to speak German,{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=198}} he soon attracted the attention of local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside [[Landau]]. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed,<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" /> the wooden box emerged.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be de&nbsp;Beauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a [[gallows]] and the noose placed around his neck.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had the presence of mind to recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.){{sfn|Good|1864|p=80}}<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" /> At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}}\n\n==Attempted cures==\nFollowing this incident, Tarrare was desperate to avoid further military service, and returned to the hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Percy treated him with [[laudanum]] without success; further treatments with [[vinegar|wine vinegar]] and [[tobacco]] pills were likewise unsuccessful.<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" />{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-[[boiled egg]]s, but this also failed to suppress his appetite.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for [[offal]] outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps.<ref name=\"Gould & Pyle\" /><ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" />{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing [[bloodletting]], and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary.<ref name=\"Gould & Pyle\" /><ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" />{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a [[lunatic asylum]], but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}}\n\nAfter some time, a 14-month-old child disappeared from the hospital, and Tarrare was immediately suspected. Percy was unable or unwilling to defend him, and the hospital staff chased Tarrare from the hospital, to which he never returned.<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" />{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}}\n\n==Death==\nFour years later, in 1798, a M.&nbsp;Tessier of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] hospital contacted Percy to notify him that a patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it. Percy, however, recognised that he had advanced [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} A month later, Tarrare began to experience continuous [[exudative diarrhoea]], dying shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}}\n\nThe corpse rotted quickly; the surgeons of the hospital refused to dissect it.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} Tessier, however, wanted to find out how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} At the autopsy, Tarrare's [[gullet]] was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=280}} His body was found to be filled with [[pus]],<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" /> his [[liver]] and [[gallbladder]] were abnormally large,<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" /> and his stomach was enormous, covered in [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]]{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=198}} and filling most of his abdominal cavity.<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" />{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}}\n\nThe fork was never found.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=310}}\n==See also==\n* [[Charles Domery]], another soldier in the French Revolutionary Army who exhibited similar symptoms.\n\n==Notes and references==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n'''References'''\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation|last=Bondeson|first=Jan|title=Freaks: The Pig-Faced Lady of Manchester Square & Other Medical Marvels|year=2006|publisher=Tempus Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=0-7524-3662-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|last=Bondeson|first=Jan|title=The Two-Headed Boy|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=0-8014-8958-X|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|last=Good|first=John Mason|title=The Study of Medicine|edition=15|year=1864|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|last=Lord|first=Perceval B.|title=Popular Physiology|edition=2|year=1839|publisher=John W.

In such a situation, female activists and political actors contest a dualistic notion of nationalism, thus generating political, cultural, and social tension. The form of nationalism resulting from the binary and its contestation is muscular nationalism.<ref>Banerjee, Sikata.

Masculinity is a wider discourse, entangled with a wider range of societal, political and national issues<ref name=\":4\">{{Citation|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|title=Masculinity After the Opening of the Border|date=2019|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14702-0_5|work=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|pages=153\u2013190|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-030-14701-3|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nPost-conflict masculinity mobilizes the military institution as a platform for the exemplification of certain constructions of masculinity to the wider society. The significance of nationalist militarized forms of masculinity extends beyond the military and the hegemonic model of masculinity to the broader social body, which is committed in a variety of ways to the defence and struggle for justice of its community. This discourse is embodied in the state and the position of the given society and is perceived as a unified nationalist, militarist masculinist body that resists the feminization of certain \u2018positions of power\u2019. Thus, post-conflict masculinity is concomitant to a post-conflict femininity, against which the national body is asserted<ref name=\":4\" />.[[File:Joan of Arc Saved France.jpg|thumb|World War I-era poster urges to American women to buy War Saving Stamps by using Joan of Arc as a symbol of female patriotism.

Banerjee describes muscular nationalism as a form of nationalism that relies on a binary notion of gender with opposing conceptions of man versus woman. In such a situation, female activists and political actors contest a dualistic notion of nationalism, thus generating political, cultural, and social tension. The form of nationalism resulting from the binary and its contestation is muscular nationalism.<ref>Banerjee, Sikata.

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001.

The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the&nbsp;ocean.<ref name=ssbsterg>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a-9VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DuEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5161%2C3581553 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle booster stage to be solid-fuel, reusable vehicle |date=March 15, 1972 |page=3A}}</ref> In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle,<ref name=odsp>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tNhVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3326%2C897997|work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=President okays spacecraft plan|date=January 5, 1972 |page=1A}}</ref><ref name=bsspgpa>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2u9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xe0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4846%2C1764562 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Big Space Shuttle proposal gets presidential approval |date=January 6, 1972 |page=1}}</ref> and NASA decided on its final design in&nbsp;March.<ref name=ssbsterg/> That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]].

The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information.

As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

A number of physiological responses occur in the body and mind as preparation for [[sexual intercourse]] and continue during it. [[#Male physiological response|Male arousal]] will lead to an [[erection]], and in [[#Female physiological response|female arousal]] the body's response is engorged sexual tissues such as [[Erection of nipples|nipples]], [[vulva]], [[Clitoral erection|clitoris]], [[Vagina#Sexual activity|vaginal wall]]s and [[vaginal lubrication]]. [[Stimulus (psychology)|Mental stimuli]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical stimuli]] such as touch, and the internal fluctuation of [[hormones]], can influence sexual arousal.\n\nSexual arousal has several stages and may not lead to any actual sexual activity, beyond a mental arousal and the physiological changes that accompany it. Given sufficient [[sexual stimulation]], sexual arousal in humans reaches its climax during an [[orgasm]]. It may also be pursued for its own sake, even in the absence of an orgasm.\n\n==Terminology==\nThere are several informalities, terms and phrases to describe sexual arousal including ''horny'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/horny |title=horny - definition of horny by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> ''turned on'', ''randy'', ''steamy'', and ''lustful''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synonyms.net/synonym/aroused |title=aroused synonym. |publisher=Synonyms.net |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> Things that precipitate human sexual arousal are called '''erotic stimuli''' and colloquially known as '''turn-ons'''.\n\n==Erotic stimuli==\n{{Main|Sexual stimulation|Erogenous zone}}\n\nDepending on the situation, a person can be sexually aroused by a variety of factors, both physical and mental. A person may be sexually aroused by another person or by particular aspects of that person, or by a non-human object. The physical stimulation of an [[erogenous zone]] or acts of [[foreplay]] can result in arousal, especially if it is accompanied with the anticipation of imminent sexual activity. Sexual arousal may be assisted by a [[romance (love)|romantic]] setting, music or other soothing situation. The potential stimuli for sexual arousal vary from person to person, and from one time to another, as does the level of arousal.\n\nStimuli can be classified according to the sense involved: [[somatosensory]] (touch), visual, and [[olfactory]] (scent). Auditory stimuli are also possible, though they are generally considered secondary in role to the other three.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Erotic stimuli which can result in sexual arousal can include conversation, reading, films or images, or a smell or setting, any of which can generate erotic thoughts and memories in a person. Given the right context, these may lead to the person desiring physical contact, including [[kiss]]ing, [[hug|cuddling]], and [[petting]] of an erogenous zone. This may in turn make the person desire direct sexual stimulation of the [[breast]]s, [[nipple]]s, [[buttocks]] and/or [[Sex organ|genitals]], and further [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].\n\nErotic stimuli may originate from a source unrelated to the object of subsequent sexual interest. For example, many people may find [[nudity]], [[erotica]] or [[pornography]] sexually arousing.<ref>DeVita-Raeburn, Elizabeth. \"[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200512/lust-the-long-haul Lust For The Long Haul]\". [[Psychology Today]]. 2008-12-26</ref> This may generate a general sexual interest that is satisfied by sexual activity. When sexual arousal is achieved by or dependent on the use of objects, it is referred to as [[sexual fetishism]], or in some instances a [[paraphilia]].\n\nThere is a common belief that women need more time to achieve arousal. However, recent scientific research has shown that there is no considerable difference for the time men and women require to become fully aroused. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal]] (in Canada) used the method of [[thermal]] imaging to record baseline [[temperature]] change in genital area to define the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal while watching sexually explicit movies or pictures and came to the conclusion that on average women and men took almost the same time for sexual arousal&nbsp;\u2014 around 10 minutes.<ref name=intro/> The time needed for foreplay is very individualistic and varies from one time to the next depending on many circumstances.<ref name=intro>{{cite web|url=http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html|title=Your introduction to foreplay|accessdate=2007-05-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618222527/http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many other animals, [[human]]s do not have a [[mating season]], and both sexes are potentially capable of sexual arousal throughout the year.\n\n==Disorders==\n{{see also|Sexual arousal disorder|Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|Female sexual arousal disorder}}\n\nSexual arousal for most people is a positive experience and an aspect of their sexuality, and is often sought. A person can normally control how they will respond to arousal. They will normally know what things or situations are potentially stimulating, and may at their leisure decide to either create or avoid these situations. Similarly, a person's sexual partner will normally also know his or her partner's erotic stimuli and turn-offs. Some people feel embarrassed by sexual arousal and some are [[sexually inhibited]]. Some people do not feel aroused on every occasion that they are exposed to erotic stimuli, nor act in a sexual way on every arousal. A person can take an active part in a sexual activity without sexual arousal. These situations are considered normal, but depend on the maturity, age, culture and other factors influencing the person.\n\nHowever, when a person fails to be aroused in a situation that would normally produce arousal and the lack of arousal is persistent, it may be due to a [[sexual arousal disorder]] or [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]]. There are many reasons why a person fails to be aroused, including a mental disorder, such as depression, [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], or a medical or physical condition. The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or due to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. A person may always have had no or low sexual desire or the lack of desire may have been acquired during the person's life. There are also complex philosophical and psychological issues surrounding sexuality. Attitudes towards life, death, childbirth, one's parents, friends, family, contemporary society, the human race in general, and particularly one's place in the world play a substantive role in determining how a person will respond in any given sexual situation.\n\nOn the other hand, a person may be [[Hypersexuality|hypersexual]], which is a desire to engage in sexual activities considered abnormally high in relation to normal development or culture, or suffering from a [[persistent genital arousal disorder]], which is a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable arousal, and the physiological changes associated with arousal.\n\n== Physiological and psychological response patterns ==\n=== Physiological responses ===\n\nSexual arousal causes various physical responses, most significantly in the [[sex organ]]s (genital organs). Sexual arousal for a man is usually indicated by the [[tumescence|swelling]] and [[erection]] of the [[human penis|penis]] when blood fills the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]]. This is usually the most prominent and reliable sign of sexual arousal in males. In a woman, sexual arousal leads to increased blood flow to the [[clitoris]] and [[vulva]], as well as vaginal transudation - the seeping of moisture through the vaginal walls which serves as [[vaginal lubrication|lubrication]].\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%\"|\nIn males:\n!In females:\n|-\n|[[File:Comparison of flaccid and erect penis.jpg|thumb]]<br /><small>Male sexual arousal.

Physical or psychological stimulation, or both, leads to [[vasodilation]] and the increased blood flow engorges the three spongy areas that run along the length of the penis (the two [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] and the [[corpus spongiosum]]). The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the [[scrotum]] is pulled tighter, and the [[testes]] are pulled up against the body.<ref name=\"NHS\">{{cite web|title=Sexual arousal in men|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodsex/Pages/Malesexualarousal.aspx|work=NHS Direct|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> However, the relationship between erection and arousal is not one-to-one.

A young man&nbsp;\u2014 or one with a strong libido&nbsp;\u2014 may experience enough sexual arousal for an erection to result from a passing thought, or just the sight of a passerby. Once erect, his penis may gain enough stimulation from contact with the inside of his clothing to maintain and encourage it for some time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embarrassing erections|url=http://www.thesite.org/sex-and-relationships/masturbation/embarrassing-erections-3357.html|work=TheSite.org|publisher=YouthNet UK|accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs sexual arousal and stimulation continues, it is likely that the [[Glans penis|glans]] or head of the erect penis will swell wider and, as the genitals become further engorged with blood, their color deepens and the testicles can grow up to 50% larger. As the testicles continue to rise, a feeling of warmth may develop around them and the [[perineum]]. With further sexual stimulation, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises and breathing becomes quicker.<ref name=\"NHS\"/> The increase in blood flow in the genital and other regions may lead to a [[sex flush]] sometimes, in some men.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kennard|first=Jerry|title=Sexual Arousal|url=http://menshealth.about.com/od/sexualhealth/a/sexual_arousal.htm|work=Men's health|publisher=About.com|year=2006|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref>\n\nAs sexual stimulation continues, [[orgasm]] begins, when the muscles of the [[pelvic floor]], the [[vas deferens]] (between the testicles and the prostate), the [[seminal vesicle]]s and the [[prostate]] gland itself may begin to contract in a way that forces sperm and semen into the [[urethra]] inside the penis. Once this has started, it is likely that the man will continue to [[ejaculate]] and orgasm fully, with or without further stimulation.\n\nEqually, if sexual stimulation stops before orgasm, the physical effects of the stimulation, including the [[vasocongestion]], will subside in a short time. Repeated or prolonged stimulation without orgasm and ejaculation can lead to discomfort in the testes (corresponding to the slang term \"[[blue balls]]\"<ref>Weinzimer, S.A. & Thorton, P.S., \"Blue balls\", \" ''Pediatrics'' 108(5), 1233-1234\", 2001</ref>).\n\nAfter orgasm and ejaculation, men usually experience a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] characterised by loss of erection, a subsidence in any sex flush, less interest in sex, and a feeling of relaxation that can be attributed to the [[neurohormone]]s [[oxytocin]] and [[prolactin]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Exton MS, Kr\u00fcger TH, Koch M, etal |title=Coitus-induced orgasm stimulates prolactin secretion in healthy subjects |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=287\u201394 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11166491 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(00)00053-6|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb194b5e0370574c39ab5765d9e7221aa6a213c7 }}</ref> The intensity and duration of the refractory period can be very short in a highly aroused young man in what he sees as a highly arousing situation, perhaps without even a noticeable loss of erection.

Further changes to the internal organs also occur including to the internal shape of the vagina and to the position of the [[uterus]] within the [[human pelvis|pelvis]].<ref name=\"Soucasaux\"/> Other changes include an increase in [[heart rate]] as well as in [[blood pressure]], feeling hot and flushed and perhaps experiencing tremors.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKinne|first=Kathleen|title=Sexuality in close relationship|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-8058-0719-6|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4pG9ULmRTRsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> A [[sex flush]] may extend over the chest and upper body.\n\nIf sexual stimulation continues, then sexual arousal may peak into [[orgasm]].

Older women produce less vaginal lubrication and studies have investigated changes to degrees of satisfaction, frequency of sexual activity, to desire, sexual thoughts and [[sexual fantasy|fantasies]], sexual arousal, beliefs about and attitudes to sex, pain, and the ability to reach orgasm in women in their 40s and after [[menopause]]. Other factors have also been studied including socio-demographic variables, health, psychological variables, partner variables such as their partner's health or sexual problems, and lifestyle variables. It appears that these other factors often have a greater impact on women's sexual functioning than their menopausal status. It is therefore seen as important always to understand the \"context of women's lives\" when studying their sexuality.<ref name=\"sexualityandu.ca\"/>\n\nReduced [[estrogen]] levels may be associated with increased vaginal dryness and less [[clitoral erection]] when aroused, but are not directly related to other aspects of sexual interest or arousal. In older women, decreased pelvic muscle tone may mean that it takes longer for arousal to lead to orgasm, may diminish the intensity of orgasms, and then cause more rapid resolution.

Masters and Virginia E. Johnson]] conducted many important studies into [[human sexuality]]. In 1966, they published ''[[Human Sexual Response (book)|Human Sexual Response]]'', detailing four stages of physiological changes in humans during sexual stimulation: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/sexual-response-cycle\n| title = The Sexual Response Cycle\n| accessdate = 2007-04-24\n| work = SexInfo\n| publisher = [[University of California]], Santa Barbara\n| quote = Masters and Johnson's Four-Phase Model: The sexual responses of men and women have many similarities....\n}}</ref>\n\n===Singer's model of sexual arousal===\nBarry Singer presented a model of the process of sexual arousal in 1984, in which he conceptualized human sexual response to be composed of ''three independent but generally sequential components''. The first stage, ''aesthetic response,'' is an emotional reaction to noticing an attractive face or figure. This emotional reaction produces an increase in attention toward the object of attraction, typically involving head and eye movements toward the attractive object. The second stage, ''approach response,'' progresses from the first and involves bodily movements towards the object. The final ''genital response'' stage recognizes that with both attention and closer proximity, physical reactions result in genital tumescence. Singer also stated that there is an array of other autonomic responses, but acknowledges that the research literature suggests that the genital response is ''the most reliable and convenient to measure'' in males.<ref name=\"singer\">{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = B | year = 1984 | title = Conceptualizing sexual arousal and attraction | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013240 | doi=10.1080/00224498409551222}}</ref>\n\n===Basson's sexual response cycle===\nIn 2000, Rosemary Basson presented an alternative model to the human sexual response cycle that is ''specific to women\u2019s sexual response''.<ref name=\"A different model\">{{cite journal | last1 = Basson | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The female sexual response: A different model | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy]] | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 51\u201365 | doi=10.1080/009262300278641 | pmid=10693116}}</ref> She argues that gender differences in [[sex drive]], sexual motivation, sexual concordance, and capacity for orgasm underlie the need for an alternative model of sexual response. While the human sexual response cycle begins with desire, followed by arousal, orgasm, and finally resolution, Basson's<ref name=\"autogenerated2001\"/> alternative model is circular and begins with women feeling a need for [[intimacy]], which leads her to seek out and be receptive to sexual stimuli; women then feel sexual arousal, in addition to [[sexual desire]]. The cycle results in an enhanced feeling of intimacy. Basson emphasizes the idea that a lack of spontaneous desire should not be taken as an indication of [[female sexual dysfunction]]; many women experience sexual arousal and responsive desire simultaneously when they are engaged in sexual activity.<ref name=\"A different model\"/>\n\n===Toates's incentive-motivation model===\nFrederick Toates presented a model of sexual motivation, arousal, and behavior in 2009 that combines the principles of ''incentive-motivation theory'' and ''hierarchical control of behavior''. The [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|basic incentive-motivation model]] of sex suggests that incentive cues in the environment invade the nervous system, which results in sexual motivation. Positive sexual experiences enhance motivation, while negative experiences reduce it. Motivation and behaviour are organized [[hierarchy|hierarchically]]; each are controlled by a combination direct (external stimuli) and indirect (internal cognitions) factors. Excitation and inhibition of behavior act at various levels of this hierarchical structure. For instance, an external stimulus may directly excite sexual arousal and motivation below a conscious level of awareness, while an internal cognition can elicit the same effects indirectly, through the conscious representation of a sexual image. In the case of inhibition, sexual behavior can be active or conscious (e.g., choosing not to have sex) or it can be passive or unconscious (e.g., being unable to have sex due to fear). Toates emphasizes the importance considering [[cognitive]] representations in addition to external stimuli; he suggests that mental representations of incentives are interchangeable with excitatory external stimuli for eliciting sexual arousal and motivation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Toates | first1 = F. | title = An Integrative Theoretical Framework for Understanding Sexual Motivation, Arousal, and Behavior | doi = 10.1080/00224490902747768 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2\u20133 | pages = 168\u2013193 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19308842| pmc = }}</ref>\n\n===Bancroft's dual control model===\nThis model created by [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] and Erick Janssen at the Kinsey Institute explores the ''individual variability of sexual response''.  They postulate that this variability depends on the interaction between an individual's sexual excitation system (SES) and sexual inhibition system (SIS). Popularized by Emily Nagoski's self-help book ''Come as You Are'', the SES has been described as the sexual response's 'accelerator' and the SIS as the 'brake'.<ref name=Nagoski2015>Nagoski, E. (2015). Come As You Are. New York City, New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref>  The SIS/SES questionnaire was developed to assess an individual's SIS and SES levels.  A factor analysis of the SIS/SES questionnaire, revealed a single excitation factor and two inhibition factors.  These inhibition factors were interpreted as SIS1 (inhibition due to the threat of performance failure) and SIS2 (inhibition due to the threat of performance consequences). \n \nThe SIS/SES questionnaire was originally developed for men though it has since proven its statistical validity among women. Despite this, the SESII-W (the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women) was created by Graham and associates.<ref name=Graham2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = C.

A factor analysis of this questionnaire revealed only two factors: sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI).  This may point to internal inconsistencies in the SIS/SES questionnaire regarding gender.  One lower order factor in the SESII-W labeled Arousal Contingency was particularly relevant; this factor explains the easy disruption of sexual arousal.\n\nRegardless of the difference in these two questionnaires, both surveys' scores show normal distribution verifying the hypothesis that there is a normal individual variation in sexual arousal and inhibition.  In the original SIS/SES questionnaire, statistically significant gender differences are seen despite considerable overlap in scores between men and women.  On average, males score higher on sexual excitation and lower than females on both facets of sexual inhibition.  As yet, the differences in scores between genders have not been explained beyond the theoretical level. \n \nThe source of individual variability on the sexual excitation and inhibition systems is not known definitively.  Even less is known about how these systems develop in individuals.  Age of first [[masturbation]] has been used as a measure to assess sexual development. Age of masturbatory onset is much more variable in girls than boys, whose tend to be close to puberty.<ref name= Bancroft_et_al.,2003>Bancroft, J., Herbenick, D., & Reynolds, M. (2003).

[[Ivan Tarkhanov (physiologist)|Ivan Tarkhanov]] showed, in experiments on cutting and artificial emptying of the [[seminal vesicle]]s, that the latter played the crucial role in the generation of sexual excitement in frogs. Proceeding from these experimental results, Tarkhanov put forward a hypothesis that filling and evacuation of the seminal vesicles were the main biological cause which led to sexual arousal and its disappearance in mammals and humans.<ref>[[Ivan Tarkhanov (physiologist)|\u0422\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0418. \u0420.]] \u041a \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0443 \u043b\u044f\u0433\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 (On Physiology of the Reproductive system in frogs). \u2014 \u00ab\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0430 (Russian medicine)\u00bb, 1885, \u211630\u201332, \u0441. 1\u201326.

If the level of this tension reaches threshold, sexual arousal occurs as the expression of necessity to let off steam. Gary F. Kelly ([[Clarkson University]]) describes this model as follows:\n{{Quotation|For centuries, the assumption was made that the longing for [[Sexual intercourse|sexual interaction]] was innate, and an inner drive model was used to explain it. It has been suggested that this model was much like a metaphor for a steam boiler. Internal sexual \u201csteam\u201d would build up until the pressure became so great that the drive to release it was very strong.

An erection, for example, is pleasurable and painful at the same time. With an increase of sexual excitation, the tension increases and becomes wholly unpleasurable.

Such an approach assumes sexual arousal to be a spontaneous desire that appears periodically like sensations of hunger and thirst.

In this sense sex is a necessity of life, just as air, food, and warmth.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Coleman | first = E. | editor = Eli Coleman| title = Chemical Dependency and Intimacy Dysfunction | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=MmA78fbMYEwC&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false | year = 2009 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | isbn = 978-0-86656-640-7 | pages = 189\u2013204 | chapter = Sexual Compulsivity: Definition, Etiology and Treatment Considerations | accessdate = 2013-11-03 }}</ref>{{rp|190|}} And yet there is no empirical evidence in support of such a parallel, Imieli\u0144ski says. Sensations of hunger and thirst occur due to certain states of physiological insufficiency. The feeling of hunger results from the lack of glucose, fats and amino acids in blood.

There are a variety of methods used to assess genital sexual arousal in women. [[Vaginal photoplethysmography]] (VPG) can measure changes in vaginal blood volume or phasic changes in vasocongestion associated with each heartbeat. [[Clitoral photoplethysmograph]]y functions in a similar way to VPG, but measures changes in clitoral blood volume, rather than vaginal vasocongestion. [[Thermography (sexual psychophysiology)|Thermography]] provides a direct measure of genital sexual arousal by measuring changes in [[temperature]] associated with increased blood flow to the [[external genitals|external genital]] tissues. Similarly, [[labial thermistor clip]]s measure changes in temperature associated with genital engorgement; this method directly measures changes in temperature of the labia. More recently, [[laser doppler imaging]] (LDI) has been used as a direct measure of genital sexual arousal in women. LDI functions by measuring superficial changes in blood flow in the vulvar tissues.\n\n==Category-specificity==\nCategory-specificity refers to a person showing sexual arousal to the categories of people they prefer to have sex with.

For instance, men and women alike are capable of classifying sex acts as sexual no matter if they find them appealing or not, making a genital response to unappealing erotic stimuli a single mechanism step. It is therefore argued by neurologists that category specificity of genital response to erotical imagery, being determined by one or a small number of closely linked brain mechanisms and therefore not subject to significant multivariate effects, cannot be subject to such a large sex difference as that apparent in pletysmographic studies. These neurologists cite the existence of significant volunteering bias among men but not women in erotica research, in particular that the overrepresentation of erectile dysfunction yet underrepresentation of sexuality-related shame in volunteers is consistent with the hypothesis that genital response to both sexual relevance and appeal allows for a stronger erectile function than response only to appeal and that a majority of the male population are ashamed of their responses to unappealing stimuli, accounting for the discrepancy between the report from most heterosexual couples that male erection is faster than female lubrication and the appearance on pletysmography volunteers that female lubrication is at least as fast as male erection. They also argue that the appearance of a greater individual variability in female genital response than in male genital response is consistent with a representative female sample and a male sample subject to bias that leaves much of the individual variability unstudied, with a reference to the neurological observation that all brain structures display significant individual variability in both sexes and that no brain structure is variable only in females and not in males.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15468.full Sex beyond the genitalia: The human brain mosaic] October 23, 2015</ref><ref>Multivariate revisit to \u201csex beyond the genitalia\u201d</ref>\n\n==Concordance==\nSexual arousal results in a combination of physiological and psychological factors, like genital sexual response and subjective experience of sexual arousal. The degree to which genital and subjective sexual response correspond is termed ''concordance''. Research has shown a [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]] gender difference in concordance of sexual arousal, such that men have a higher level of concordance between genital and subjective sexual responding than women do.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Suschinsky | first1 = K.

However, current research studies suggest that many animals, like humans, enjoy sexual relations that are not limited to reproduction. [[Dolphin]]s and [[bonobo]]s, for example, are both well known to use sex as a \"social tool to strengthen and maintain bonds.\"<ref>{{cite video\n | people = McCarey, Kevin (writer)\n | date = 1999\n | title = Dolphins: The wild side\n | url = http://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/press/990202.html\n | medium = Documentary\n | publisher = [[National Geographic Adventure (TV channel)|National Geographic Adventure]]\n | location = USA\n | accessdate = 2007-04-24\n | time =\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090815060458/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/press/990202.html\n | archivedate= 2009-08-15\n}} \"Like humans and some chimpanzees, dolphins use sex for reasons other than procreation.

Cementing social bondage is one of the most prominent theorized selective advantages of [[group selection]] theory. Experts in the [[evolution of sex]] such as [[John Maynard Smith]] advocate for the idea that the exchange of sexual favors helps congeal and localize the assortment of [[alleles]] in isolated population and therefore is potentially a very strong force in [[evolution]]. Maynard Smith has also written extensively on the \"seminal fluid swapping theory\" logistic application of the assortment of alleles as a more accurate synthetic depiction of the [[Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle]] in cases of severely interbreeding populations.\n\n==Evolutionary models==\nThe effect of sexual response is thought to be a plastic positive reinforcement behavior modifier associated with the [[Baldwin effect]]. The display of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s in humans such as a penis-like enlarged [[clitoris]] in females during arousal and [[gynecomastia]] in males are thought to have once been objects of [[mate selection]] in human evolution because of the persistence of the phenomenon of these features invoking sexual arousal for potential mates in [[cross-cultural studies]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Miller, Geoffrey|url=http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Human%20Nature%20S%201999/SexualSelection/sex%5B1%5D.pdf|title=A Review of Sexual Selection and Human Evolution|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309180820/http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Human%20Nature%20S%201999/SexualSelection/sex%5B1%5D.pdf|archivedate=2006-03-09}}</ref> A dramatic example of this is the high rates of secondary sex characteristic [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphism]] in some Southeast Asia human populations.<ref>Harpending, Henry \"Human Diversity and its History\" ''(Bibliographic Guide to East Asian Studies'', by Gale Group, Gale Group, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7838-9219-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7838-9219-1}})</ref> Similar evolutionary stimuli may also have resulted in novel structures such as the [[pseudo-penis]] of the female [[spotted hyena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/699-painful-realities-hyena-sex.html |title=The Painful Realities of Hyena Sex |publisher=LiveScience |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Human sexuality}}\n* [[Aphrodisiac]]\n* [[Erectile tissue]]\n* [[Kinsey Reports]]\n* [[Nudity and sexuality]]\n* [[Priapism]]\n* [[Sexology]]\n* [[Sexual frustration]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Sexual arousal}}\n\n{{Sex}}\n{{Human sexuality}}\n\n<!--Eponymous categories:-->\n<!--Other categories:-->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sexual Arousal}}\n[[Category:Sexual arousal| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Turn-on||Turn On (disambiguation){{!}}Turn On}}\n{{about|sexual arousal in humans|sexual arousal in other species|Animal sexual behaviour}}\n{{short description|Arousal of sexual desire, during or in anticipation of sexual activity}}\n{{redirects here|Aroused|the 2013 documentary film|Aroused (film)|other uses|Arousal}}\n[[File:Martin van Maele - Francion 15.jpg|thumb|[[Martin van Ma\u00eble]]'s print ''Francion 15'']]\n\n'''Sexual arousal''' (also '''sexual excitement''') is typically the [[arousal]] of [[sexual desire]] during or in anticipation of [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. A number of physiological responses occur in the body and mind as preparation for [[sexual intercourse]] and continue during it. [[#Male physiological response|Male arousal]] will lead to an [[erection]], and in [[#Female physiological response|female arousal]] the body's response is engorged sexual tissues such as [[Erection of nipples|nipples]], [[vulva]], [[Clitoral erection|clitoris]], [[Vagina#Sexual activity|vaginal wall]]s and [[vaginal lubrication]]. [[Stimulus (psychology)|Mental stimuli]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical stimuli]] such as touch, and the internal fluctuation of [[hormones]], can influence sexual arousal.\n\nSexual arousal has several stages and may not lead to any actual sexual activity, beyond a mental arousal and the physiological changes that accompany it. Given sufficient [[sexual stimulation]], sexual arousal in humans reaches its climax during an [[orgasm]]. It may also be pursued for its own sake, even in the absence of an orgasm.\n\n==Terminology==\nThere are several informalities, terms and phrases to describe sexual arousal including ''horny'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/horny |title=horny - definition of horny by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> ''turned on'', ''randy'', ''steamy'', and ''lustful''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synonyms.net/synonym/aroused |title=aroused synonym. |publisher=Synonyms.net |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> Things that precipitate human sexual arousal are called '''erotic stimuli''' and colloquially known as '''turn-ons'''.\n\n==Erotic stimuli==\n{{Main|Sexual stimulation|Erogenous zone}}\n\nDepending on the situation, a person can be sexually aroused by a variety of factors, both physical and mental. A person may be sexually aroused by another person or by particular aspects of that person, or by a non-human object. The physical stimulation of an [[erogenous zone]] or acts of [[foreplay]] can result in arousal, especially if it is accompanied with the anticipation of imminent sexual activity. Sexual arousal may be assisted by a [[romance (love)|romantic]] setting, music or other soothing situation. The potential stimuli for sexual arousal vary from person to person, and from one time to another, as does the level of arousal.\n\nStimuli can be classified according to the sense involved: [[somatosensory]] (touch), visual, and [[olfactory]] (scent). Auditory stimuli are also possible, though they are generally considered secondary in role to the other three.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Erotic stimuli which can result in sexual arousal can include conversation, reading, films or images, or a smell or setting, any of which can generate erotic thoughts and memories in a person. Given the right context, these may lead to the person desiring physical contact, including [[kiss]]ing, [[hug|cuddling]], and [[petting]] of an erogenous zone. This may in turn make the person desire direct sexual stimulation of the [[breast]]s, [[nipple]]s, [[buttocks]] and/or [[Sex organ|genitals]], and further [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].\n\nErotic stimuli may originate from a source unrelated to the object of subsequent sexual interest. For example, many people may find [[nudity]], [[erotica]] or [[pornography]] sexually arousing.<ref>DeVita-Raeburn, Elizabeth. \"[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200512/lust-the-long-haul Lust For The Long Haul]\". [[Psychology Today]]. 2008-12-26</ref> This may generate a general sexual interest that is satisfied by sexual activity. When sexual arousal is achieved by or dependent on the use of objects, it is referred to as [[sexual fetishism]], or in some instances a [[paraphilia]].\n\nThere is a common belief that women need more time to achieve arousal. However, recent scientific research has shown that there is no considerable difference for the time men and women require to become fully aroused. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal]] (in Canada) used the method of [[thermal]] imaging to record baseline [[temperature]] change in genital area to define the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal while watching sexually explicit movies or pictures and came to the conclusion that on average women and men took almost the same time for sexual arousal&nbsp;\u2014 around 10 minutes.<ref name=intro/> The time needed for foreplay is very individualistic and varies from one time to the next depending on many circumstances.<ref name=intro>{{cite web|url=http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html|title=Your introduction to foreplay|accessdate=2007-05-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618222527/http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many other animals, [[human]]s do not have a [[mating season]], and both sexes are potentially capable of sexual arousal throughout the year.\n\n==Disorders==\n{{see also|Sexual arousal disorder|Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|Female sexual arousal disorder}}\n\nSexual arousal for most people is a positive experience and an aspect of their sexuality, and is often sought. A person can normally control how they will respond to arousal. They will normally know what things or situations are potentially stimulating, and may at their leisure decide to either create or avoid these situations. Similarly, a person's sexual partner will normally also know his or her partner's erotic stimuli and turn-offs. Some people feel embarrassed by sexual arousal and some are [[sexually inhibited]]. Some people do not feel aroused on every occasion that they are exposed to erotic stimuli, nor act in a sexual way on every arousal. A person can take an active part in a sexual activity without sexual arousal. These situations are considered normal, but depend on the maturity, age, culture and other factors influencing the person.\n\nHowever, when a person fails to be aroused in a situation that would normally produce arousal and the lack of arousal is persistent, it may be due to a [[sexual arousal disorder]] or [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]]. There are many reasons why a person fails to be aroused, including a mental disorder, such as depression, [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], or a medical or physical condition. The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or due to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. A person may always have had no or low sexual desire or the lack of desire may have been acquired during the person's life. There are also complex philosophical and psychological issues surrounding sexuality. Attitudes towards life, death, childbirth, one's parents, friends, family, contemporary society, the human race in general, and particularly one's place in the world play a substantive role in determining how a person will respond in any given sexual situation.\n\nOn the other hand, a person may be [[Hypersexuality|hypersexual]], which is a desire to engage in sexual activities considered abnormally high in relation to normal development or culture, or suffering from a [[persistent genital arousal disorder]], which is a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable arousal, and the physiological changes associated with arousal.\n\n== Physiological and psychological response patterns ==\n=== Physiological responses ===\n\nSexual arousal causes various physical responses, most significantly in the [[sex organ]]s (genital organs). Sexual arousal for a man is usually indicated by the [[tumescence|swelling]] and [[erection]] of the [[human penis|penis]] when blood fills the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]]. This is usually the most prominent and reliable sign of sexual arousal in males. In a woman, sexual arousal leads to increased blood flow to the [[clitoris]] and [[vulva]], as well as vaginal transudation - the seeping of moisture through the vaginal walls which serves as [[vaginal lubrication|lubrication]].\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%\"|\nIn males:\n!In females:\n|-\n|[[File:Comparison of flaccid and erect penis.jpg|thumb]]<br /><small>Male sexual arousal.

Physical or psychological stimulation, or both, leads to [[vasodilation]] and the increased blood flow engorges the three spongy areas that run along the length of the penis (the two [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] and the [[corpus spongiosum]]). The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the [[scrotum]] is pulled tighter, and the [[testes]] are pulled up against the body.<ref name=\"NHS\">{{cite web|title=Sexual arousal in men|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodsex/Pages/Malesexualarousal.aspx|work=NHS Direct|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> However, the relationship between erection and arousal is not one-to-one.

A young man&nbsp;\u2014 or one with a strong libido&nbsp;\u2014 may experience enough sexual arousal for an erection to result from a passing thought, or just the sight of a passerby.

As the testicles continue to rise, a feeling of warmth may develop around them and the [[perineum]]. With further sexual stimulation, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises and breathing becomes quicker.<ref name=\"NHS\"/> The increase in blood flow in the genital and other regions may lead to a [[sex flush]] sometimes, in some men.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kennard|first=Jerry|title=Sexual Arousal|url=http://menshealth.about.com/od/sexualhealth/a/sexual_arousal.htm|work=Men's health|publisher=About.com|year=2006|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref>\n\nAs sexual stimulation continues, [[orgasm]] begins, when the muscles of the [[pelvic floor]], the [[vas deferens]] (between the testicles and the prostate), the [[seminal vesicle]]s and the [[prostate]] gland itself may begin to contract in a way that forces sperm and semen into the [[urethra]] inside the penis. Once this has started, it is likely that the man will continue to [[ejaculate]] and orgasm fully, with or without further stimulation.\n\nEqually, if sexual stimulation stops before orgasm, the physical effects of the stimulation, including the [[vasocongestion]], will subside in a short time. Repeated or prolonged stimulation without orgasm and ejaculation can lead to discomfort in the testes (corresponding to the slang term \"[[blue balls]]\"<ref>Weinzimer, S.A. & Thorton, P.S., \"Blue balls\", \" ''Pediatrics'' 108(5), 1233-1234\", 2001</ref>).\n\nAfter orgasm and ejaculation, men usually experience a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] characterised by loss of erection, a subsidence in any sex flush, less interest in sex, and a feeling of relaxation that can be attributed to the [[neurohormone]]s [[oxytocin]] and [[prolactin]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Exton MS, Kr\u00fcger TH, Koch M, etal |title=Coitus-induced orgasm stimulates prolactin secretion in healthy subjects |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=287\u201394 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11166491 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(00)00053-6|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb194b5e0370574c39ab5765d9e7221aa6a213c7 }}</ref> The intensity and duration of the refractory period can be very short in a highly aroused young man in what he sees as a highly arousing situation, perhaps without even a noticeable loss of erection.

After orgasm, some women do not want any further stimulation and the sexual arousal quickly dissipates.

Older women produce less vaginal lubrication and studies have investigated changes to degrees of satisfaction, frequency of sexual activity, to desire, sexual thoughts and [[sexual fantasy|fantasies]], sexual arousal, beliefs about and attitudes to sex, pain, and the ability to reach orgasm in women in their 40s and after [[menopause]]. Other factors have also been studied including socio-demographic variables, health, psychological variables, partner variables such as their partner's health or sexual problems, and lifestyle variables. It appears that these other factors often have a greater impact on women's sexual functioning than their menopausal status.

The first stage, ''aesthetic response,'' is an emotional reaction to noticing an attractive face or figure. This emotional reaction produces an increase in attention toward the object of attraction, typically involving head and eye movements toward the attractive object. The second stage, ''approach response,'' progresses from the first and involves bodily movements towards the object. The final ''genital response'' stage recognizes that with both attention and closer proximity, physical reactions result in genital tumescence. Singer also stated that there is an array of other autonomic responses, but acknowledges that the research literature suggests that the genital response is ''the most reliable and convenient to measure'' in males.<ref name=\"singer\">{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = B | year = 1984 | title = Conceptualizing sexual arousal and attraction | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013240 | doi=10.1080/00224498409551222}}</ref>\n\n===Basson's sexual response cycle===\nIn 2000, Rosemary Basson presented an alternative model to the human sexual response cycle that is ''specific to women\u2019s sexual response''.<ref name=\"A different model\">{{cite journal | last1 = Basson | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The female sexual response: A different model | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy]] | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 51\u201365 | doi=10.1080/009262300278641 | pmid=10693116}}</ref> She argues that gender differences in [[sex drive]], sexual motivation, sexual concordance, and capacity for orgasm underlie the need for an alternative model of sexual response. While the human sexual response cycle begins with desire, followed by arousal, orgasm, and finally resolution, Basson's<ref name=\"autogenerated2001\"/> alternative model is circular and begins with women feeling a need for [[intimacy]], which leads her to seek out and be receptive to sexual stimuli; women then feel sexual arousal, in addition to [[sexual desire]]. The cycle results in an enhanced feeling of intimacy. Basson emphasizes the idea that a lack of spontaneous desire should not be taken as an indication of [[female sexual dysfunction]]; many women experience sexual arousal and responsive desire simultaneously when they are engaged in sexual activity.<ref name=\"A different model\"/>\n\n===Toates's incentive-motivation model===\nFrederick Toates presented a model of sexual motivation, arousal, and behavior in 2009 that combines the principles of ''incentive-motivation theory'' and ''hierarchical control of behavior''. The [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|basic incentive-motivation model]] of sex suggests that incentive cues in the environment invade the nervous system, which results in sexual motivation. Positive sexual experiences enhance motivation, while negative experiences reduce it. Motivation and behaviour are organized [[hierarchy|hierarchically]]; each are controlled by a combination direct (external stimuli) and indirect (internal cognitions) factors. Excitation and inhibition of behavior act at various levels of this hierarchical structure. For instance, an external stimulus may directly excite sexual arousal and motivation below a conscious level of awareness, while an internal cognition can elicit the same effects indirectly, through the conscious representation of a sexual image. In the case of inhibition, sexual behavior can be active or conscious (e.g., choosing not to have sex) or it can be passive or unconscious (e.g., being unable to have sex due to fear). Toates emphasizes the importance considering [[cognitive]] representations in addition to external stimuli; he suggests that mental representations of incentives are interchangeable with excitatory external stimuli for eliciting sexual arousal and motivation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Toates | first1 = F. | title = An Integrative Theoretical Framework for Understanding Sexual Motivation, Arousal, and Behavior | doi = 10.1080/00224490902747768 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2\u20133 | pages = 168\u2013193 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19308842| pmc = }}</ref>\n\n===Bancroft's dual control model===\nThis model created by [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] and Erick Janssen at the Kinsey Institute explores the ''individual variability of sexual response''.  They postulate that this variability depends on the interaction between an individual's sexual excitation system (SES) and sexual inhibition system (SIS). Popularized by Emily Nagoski's self-help book ''Come as You Are'', the SES has been described as the sexual response's 'accelerator' and the SIS as the 'brake'.<ref name=Nagoski2015>Nagoski, E. (2015). Come As You Are. New York City, New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref>  The SIS/SES questionnaire was developed to assess an individual's SIS and SES levels.  A factor analysis of the SIS/SES questionnaire, revealed a single excitation factor and two inhibition factors.  These inhibition factors were interpreted as SIS1 (inhibition due to the threat of performance failure) and SIS2 (inhibition due to the threat of performance consequences). \n \nThe SIS/SES questionnaire was originally developed for men though it has since proven its statistical validity among women. Despite this, the SESII-W (the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women) was created by Graham and associates.<ref name=Graham2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = C.

A factor analysis of this questionnaire revealed only two factors: sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI).  This may point to internal inconsistencies in the SIS/SES questionnaire regarding gender.  One lower order factor in the SESII-W labeled Arousal Contingency was particularly relevant; this factor explains the easy disruption of sexual arousal.\n\nRegardless of the difference in these two questionnaires, both surveys' scores show normal distribution verifying the hypothesis that there is a normal individual variation in sexual arousal and inhibition.  In the original SIS/SES questionnaire, statistically significant gender differences are seen despite considerable overlap in scores between men and women.  On average, males score higher on sexual excitation and lower than females on both facets of sexual inhibition.  As yet, the differences in scores between genders have not been explained beyond the theoretical level. \n \nThe source of individual variability on the sexual excitation and inhibition systems is not known definitively.  Even less is known about how these systems develop in individuals.  Age of first [[masturbation]] has been used as a measure to assess sexual development. Age of masturbatory onset is much more variable in girls than boys, whose tend to be close to puberty.<ref name= Bancroft_et_al.,2003>Bancroft, J., Herbenick, D., & Reynolds, M. (2003).

If the level of this tension reaches threshold, sexual arousal occurs as the expression of necessity to let off steam. Gary F. Kelly ([[Clarkson University]]) describes this model as follows:\n{{Quotation|For centuries, the assumption was made that the longing for [[Sexual intercourse|sexual interaction]] was innate, and an inner drive model was used to explain it. It has been suggested that this model was much like a metaphor for a steam boiler.

An erection, for example, is pleasurable and painful at the same time. With an increase of sexual excitation, the tension increases and becomes wholly unpleasurable.

Such an approach assumes sexual arousal to be a spontaneous desire that appears periodically like sensations of hunger and thirst.

The use of the volume (or circumference) change during penile erection as a convenient measure of sexual arousal was first developed by [[Kurt Freund]].<ref>Freund, \"A note on the use of the phallometric method of measuring mild sexual arousal in the male\", \"Behavior therapy\", 1971</ref> This measurement of blood flow to the male genitals is known as penile plethysmography.

There are a variety of methods used to assess genital sexual arousal in women. [[Vaginal photoplethysmography]] (VPG) can measure changes in vaginal blood volume or phasic changes in vasocongestion associated with each heartbeat. [[Clitoral photoplethysmograph]]y functions in a similar way to VPG, but measures changes in clitoral blood volume, rather than vaginal vasocongestion. [[Thermography (sexual psychophysiology)|Thermography]] provides a direct measure of genital sexual arousal by measuring changes in [[temperature]] associated with increased blood flow to the [[external genitals|external genital]] tissues. Similarly, [[labial thermistor clip]]s measure changes in temperature associated with genital engorgement; this method directly measures changes in temperature of the labia. More recently, [[laser doppler imaging]] (LDI) has been used as a direct measure of genital sexual arousal in women. LDI functions by measuring superficial changes in blood flow in the vulvar tissues.\n\n==Category-specificity==\nCategory-specificity refers to a person showing sexual arousal to the categories of people they prefer to have sex with. Sexual arousal studies involving category-specificity look at genital responses (physiological changes), as well as subjective responses (what people report their arousal levels to be). Category-specific sexual arousal is more commonly found amongst men than women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chivers | first1 = M.L. | year = 2005 | title = Leading comment: A brief review and discussion of sex differences in the specificity of sexual arousal | journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 377\u2013390 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.513.4313 | doi = 10.1080/14681990500238802 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15482445\">{{cite journal|last=Chivers|first=ML|author2=Rieger, G |author3=Latty, E |author4= Bailey, JM |title=A sex difference in the specificity of sexual arousal.|journal=Psychological Science|date=Nov 2004|volume=15|issue=11|pages=736\u201344|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00750.x|pmid=15482445}}</ref> [[Heterosexuality|Heterosexual]] men experience much higher genital and subjective arousal to women than to men.

This hypothesis suggests that, provided there is enough of an increase in vaginal blood flow for [[vaginal lubrication]] to occur in a sexual context, the magnitude of arousal need not be consistent. That is, the hypothesis is that vaginal lubrication can take place as a protective mechanism even in a non-preferred sexual situation, such as when sexual activity is [[Rape|non-consensual]].<ref name=\"stable\" />\n\nOther researchers argue that since the research is done on people who volunteer to be studied, the observed levels of category specificity may not represent the population, that there may be different cultural expectations of sexual interests being linked to genital arousal that make men with non-category specific genital arousal less likely to appear as test subjects. There researchers also argue that the assumption that men are always sexually interested in what causes genital arousal removes its own falsifiability by explaining all contradictory data away as \"denial\", making the theory untestable.<ref>Research Methods in Psychiatry, third edition. Chris Freeman, Peter J.</ref><ref>Issues in Psychology and Psychiatry Research and Practice: 2013 Edition. Q Ashton Acton</ref>\n\n===Overlapping brain variables and sexual arousal===\nWhile there is disagreement among neurologists on whether or not it is possible to categorically distinguish male brains and female brains by measuring many variables in the brain, neurologists agree that all single variables in the brain display more individual variation and overlap between the sexes than differences between the sexes. For instance, men and women alike are capable of classifying sex acts as sexual no matter if they find them appealing or not, making a genital response to unappealing erotic stimuli a single mechanism step. It is therefore argued by neurologists that category specificity of genital response to erotical imagery, being determined by one or a small number of closely linked brain mechanisms and therefore not subject to significant multivariate effects, cannot be subject to such a large sex difference as that apparent in pletysmographic studies. These neurologists cite the existence of significant volunteering bias among men but not women in erotica research, in particular that the overrepresentation of erectile dysfunction yet underrepresentation of sexuality-related shame in volunteers is consistent with the hypothesis that genital response to both sexual relevance and appeal allows for a stronger erectile function than response only to appeal and that a majority of the male population are ashamed of their responses to unappealing stimuli, accounting for the discrepancy between the report from most heterosexual couples that male erection is faster than female lubrication and the appearance on pletysmography volunteers that female lubrication is at least as fast as male erection. They also argue that the appearance of a greater individual variability in female genital response than in male genital response is consistent with a representative female sample and a male sample subject to bias that leaves much of the individual variability unstudied, with a reference to the neurological observation that all brain structures display significant individual variability in both sexes and that no brain structure is variable only in females and not in males.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15468.full Sex beyond the genitalia: The human brain mosaic] October 23, 2015</ref><ref>Multivariate revisit to \u201csex beyond the genitalia\u201d</ref>\n\n==Concordance==\nSexual arousal results in a combination of physiological and psychological factors, like genital sexual response and subjective experience of sexual arousal. The degree to which genital and subjective sexual response correspond is termed ''concordance''. Research has shown a [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]] gender difference in concordance of sexual arousal, such that men have a higher level of concordance between genital and subjective sexual responding than women do.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Suschinsky | first1 = K.

There may be a difference in women's ability to perceive [[internal genitalia|internal]] versus [[external genitals|external genital]] engorgement subjectively, as measured by vaginal photoplethysmography (VPG) and [[Thermography (medical)|thermography]] respectively.

However, few studies using thermography have been conducted and further research is required to determine whether the gender difference in concordance is a measurement artifact or a true phenomenon.\n\n==Hormones==\n{{See also|Sexual motivation and hormones}}\nSeveral [[hormone]]s affect sexual arousal, including [[testosterone]], [[cortisol]], and [[estradiol]]. However, the specific roles of these hormones are not clear.<ref name=Bancroft>Bancroft, J., \"[http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/186/3/411.full.pdf The endocrinology of sexual arousal]\", \"Journal of Endocrinology, 2005</ref> Testosterone is the most commonly studied hormone involved with sexuality.

However, current research studies suggest that many animals, like humans, enjoy sexual relations that are not limited to reproduction. [[Dolphin]]s and [[bonobo]]s, for example, are both well known to use sex as a \"social tool to strengthen and maintain bonds.\"<ref>{{cite video\n | people = McCarey, Kevin (writer)\n | date = 1999\n | title = Dolphins: The wild side\n | url = http://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/press/990202.html\n | medium = Documentary\n | publisher = [[National Geographic Adventure (TV channel)|National Geographic Adventure]]\n | location = USA\n | accessdate = 2007-04-24\n | time =\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090815060458/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/press/990202.html\n | archivedate= 2009-08-15\n}} \"Like humans and some chimpanzees, dolphins use sex for reasons other than procreation.

Cementing social bondage is one of the most prominent theorized selective advantages of [[group selection]] theory. Experts in the [[evolution of sex]] such as [[John Maynard Smith]] advocate for the idea that the exchange of sexual favors helps congeal and localize the assortment of [[alleles]] in isolated population and therefore is potentially a very strong force in [[evolution]]. Maynard Smith has also written extensively on the \"seminal fluid swapping theory\" logistic application of the assortment of alleles as a more accurate synthetic depiction of the [[Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle]] in cases of severely interbreeding populations.\n\n==Evolutionary models==\nThe effect of sexual response is thought to be a plastic positive reinforcement behavior modifier associated with the [[Baldwin effect]]. The display of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s in humans such as a penis-like enlarged [[clitoris]] in females during arousal and [[gynecomastia]] in males are thought to have once been objects of [[mate selection]] in human evolution because of the persistence of the phenomenon of these features invoking sexual arousal for potential mates in [[cross-cultural studies]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Miller, Geoffrey|url=http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Human%20Nature%20S%201999/SexualSelection/sex%5B1%5D.pdf|title=A Review of Sexual Selection and Human Evolution|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309180820/http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Human%20Nature%20S%201999/SexualSelection/sex%5B1%5D.pdf|archivedate=2006-03-09}}</ref> A dramatic example of this is the high rates of secondary sex characteristic [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphism]] in some Southeast Asia human populations.<ref>Harpending, Henry \"Human Diversity and its History\" ''(Bibliographic Guide to East Asian Studies'', by Gale Group, Gale Group, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7838-9219-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7838-9219-1}})</ref> Similar evolutionary stimuli may also have resulted in novel structures such as the [[pseudo-penis]] of the female [[spotted hyena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/699-painful-realities-hyena-sex.html |title=The Painful Realities of Hyena Sex |publisher=LiveScience |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Human sexuality}}\n* [[Aphrodisiac]]\n* [[Erectile tissue]]\n* [[Kinsey Reports]]\n* [[Nudity and sexuality]]\n* [[Priapism]]\n* [[Sexology]]\n* [[Sexual frustration]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Sexual arousal}}\n\n{{Sex}}\n{{Human sexuality}}\n\n<!--Eponymous categories:-->\n<!--Other categories:-->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sexual Arousal}}\n[[Category:Sexual arousal| ]]\n", "name_user": "2603:3011:202:d400:e8ed:6ae:1a7c:26b8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal"}
