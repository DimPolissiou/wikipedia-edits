In 840, Sorbian Duke [[Czimislav]] was killed. In 932, [[Henry I the Fowler|Henry I]] conquered [[Lusatia]] and [[Upper Lusatia|Milsko]]. [[Gero II]], [[Margrave]] of the Saxon [[Saxon Eastern March|Ostmark]], reconquered Lusatia the following year and, in 939, murdered 30 Sorbian princes during a feast. As a result, there were many Sorbian uprisings against German rule. A reconstructed castle, at Raddusch in Lower Lusatia, is the sole physical remnant from this early period.\n\n===High and Late Middle Ages===\nDuring the reign of [[Boleslaw I of Poland]] in 1002\u20131018, three Polish-German wars were waged which caused [[Lusatia]] to come under the domination of new rulers. In 1018, on the strength of peace in [[Bautzen]], [[Lusatia]] became a part of [[Poland]]; but, it returned to [[Germany|German]] rule before 1031.  However, this German rule is not to be understood in a national sense. At that time, Lusatia (along with [[Silesia]]) was part of \n[[Bohemia]] which itself was part of the Roman-German Empire but was ruled by a powerful indigenous Slavic dynasty. There was a dense network of dynastic and diplomatic relations between German and Slavic feudal lords, e.g. [[Wiprecht of Groitzsch]] (a German) rose to power through close links with the Bohemian king and his marriage into Slavic nobility. The Slavic-governed Bohemia remained a loyal and politically influential member of the Roman-German Empire but was in a constant power-struggle with neighbouring Poland. From the 11th to the 15th century, agriculture in Lusatia developed and colonization by Frankish, Flemish and Saxon settlers intensified. This can still be seen today from the names of local villages which geographically form a patchwork of typical German (ending on -dorf, -thal etc.) and typical Slavic origin (ending on -witz, -ow etc.), indicating the language originally spoken by its inhabitants. In 1327 the first prohibitions on using Sorbian before courts and in administrative affairs in the cities of [[Altenburg]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Leipzig]] appeared. Speaking Sorbian in family and business contexts was, however, not banned, as it did not involve the functioning of the administration. Also the village communities and the village administration usually kept operating in Sorbian.\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[File:Budy\u0161in Serbski Dom.JPG|thumb|\"House of the Sorbs\" (''Serbski dom'') in [[Bautzen]]]]\nBetween 1376 and 1635 Lusatia was part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]], under the rule of the Luxembourgs, Habsburgs and other kings. From the beginning of the 16th century the whole Sorbian-inhabited area, with the exception of Lusatia, underwent [[Germanization]]. In 1635 Lusatia became a [[fiefdom]] of Saxon electors, but it retained a considerable autonomy and largely its own legal system (see [[Lusatian League]]). The [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[second plague pandemic|plague of the 17th century]] caused terrible devastation in Lusatia. This led to further German colonization and Germanization.\n\nIn 1667 the Prince of [[Brandenburg]], Frederick Wilhelm, ordered the immediate destruction of all Sorbian printed materials and banned saying masses in this language. At the same time the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Church]] supported printing Sorbian religious literature as a means of fighting the [[Counterreformation]]. In 1706 the Sorbian Seminary, the main centre for the education of Sorbian [[Catholic]] priests, was founded in [[Prague]]. [[Evangelism|Evangelical]] students of theology formed the Sorbian College of Ministers.\n\n===Late modern period===\n[[The Congress of Vienna]], in 1815, gave part of [[Upper Lusatia]] to [[Saxony]], but most of Lusatia to [[Prussia]]. More and more bans on the use of [[Sorbian languages]] appeared from then until 1835 in [[Saxony]] and Prussia; emigration of the Sorbs, mainly to the town of Serbin in [[Texas]] and to [[Australia]], increased. In 1848, 5000 Sorbs signed a petition to the Saxon Government, in which they demanded equality for the Sorbian language with the German one in churches, courts, schools and Government departments. From 1871 the whole of Lusatia became a part of united Germany and was divided between two parts; Prussia ([[Silesia]] and [[Brandenburg]]), and Saxony.\n\nIn 1871 the industrialization of the region and German immigration began; official Germanization intensified. Although the [[Weimar Republic]] guaranteed constitutional minority rights, it did not practice them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe news about Serbs came in the period of the Serbian-Turkish Wars (1876-1878). An unknown Sorbian poet made even song about it, where he says: \u2033Over the mountains, across the valleys, in the distance, all my thoughts go to you, brothers of my people\u2033.

Sorbian costume, culture, customs, and the language was said to be no indication of a non-German origin. The Reich declared that there were truly no \"Sorbs\" or \"Lusatians\", only Wendish-Speaking Germans. As such, while the Sorbs were largely safe from the Reich's policies of ethnic cleansing, the cultivation of \"Wendish\" customs and traditions was to be encouraged in a controlled manner and it was expected that the Slavic language would decline due to natural causes. Young Sorbs enlisted in the [[Wehrmacht]] and were sent to the front. Entangled lives of the Sorbs during [[World War II]] are exemplified by life stories of [[Mina Witkojc]], [[M\u011br\u010din Nowak-Njechor\u0144ski]] and [[Jan Skala]].\n\nThe first Lusatian cities were captured in April 1945, when the [[Red Army]] and the [[Second Army (Poland)|Polish Second Army]] crossed the river [[Kwisa|Queis]] (Kwisa). The defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] changed the Sorbs\u2019 situation considerably. The regions in [[East Germany]] (the German Democratic Republic) faced heavy industrialisation and a large influx of [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled Germans]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The East German authorities tried to counteract this development by creating a broad range of Sorbian institutions. The Sorbs were officially recognized as an ethnic minority, more than 100 Sorbian schools and several academic institutions were founded, the [[Domowina]] and its associated societies were re-established and a Sorbian theatre was created. Owing to the suppression of the church and forced collectivization, however, these efforts were severely affected and consequently over time the number of people speaking Sorbian languages decreased by half.\n\nSorbs caused the communist government of East Germany  plenty of trouble, mainly because of the high levels of religious observance and resistance to the nationalisation of agriculture. During the compulsory collectivization campaign, a great many unprecedented incidents were reported. Thus, throughout the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]], violent clashes with the police were reported in Lusatia. An open uprising took place in three upper communes of B\u0142ot.\n\nAfter the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, Lusatians made efforts to create an autonomous administrative unit; however, [[Helmut Kohl]]\u2019s government did not agree to it.  After 1989, the Sorbian movement revived, however, it still encounters many obstacles. Although Germany supports national minorities, Sorbs claim that their aspirations are not sufficiently fulfilled{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.  The desire to unite Lusatia in one of the federal states has not been taken into consideration. [[Upper Lusatia]] still belongs to Saxony and [[Lower Lusatia]] to Brandenburg.  Liquidations of Sorbian schools, even in areas mostly populated by Sorbs, still happen, under the pretext of financial difficulties or demolition of whole villages to create [[lignite]] quarries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nFaced with growing threat of cultural extinction, the Domowina issued a memorandum in March 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domowina.sorben.com/pm/memorandum08.htm|title=DOMOWINA - Medijowe wozjewjenje - Pressemitteilung- Press release|work=sorben.com|accessdate=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204939/http://www.domowina.sorben.com/pm/memorandum08.htm|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> and called for \"help and protection against the growing threat of their cultural extinction, since an ongoing conflict between the German government, Saxony and Brandenburg about the financial distribution of help blocks the financing of almost all Sorbian institutions\".

Between 1841 and 1843, [[Jan Arno\u0161t Smoler]] and Leopold Haupt (a.k.a. J. L. Haupt and J. E. Schmaler) published two-volume collection of Wendish folk-songs in Upper and Lower Lusatia. From 1842, the first Sorbian publishing companies started to appear: the poet Handrij Zejler set up a weekly magazine, the precursor of today\u2019s Sorbian News. In 1845 in [[Bautzen]] the first festival of Sorbian songs took place. In 1875, [[Jakub Bart-\u0106i\u0161inski]], the poet and classicist of Upper Sorbian literature, and Karol Arno\u0161t Muka created a movement of young Sorbians influencing Lusatian art, science and literature for the following 50 years. A similar movement in [[Lower Lusatia]] was organized around the most prominent Lower Lusatian poets [[Mato K\u00f3syk]] (Mato Kosyk) and [[Bogumi\u0142 \u0160wjela]].\n\nIn 1904, mainly thanks to the Sorbs\u2019 contribution, the most important Sorbian cultural centre (the Sorbian House) was built in [[Bautzen]]. In 1912, the social and cultural organization of Lusatian Sorbs was created, the [[Domowina]] Institution - the union of Sorbian organizations. In 1919 it had 180,000 members. In 1920, Jan Skala set up a Sorbian party and in 1925 in Berlin, Skala started Kulturwille- the newspaper for the protection of national minorities in Germany. In 1920, the [[Sokol]] Movement was founded (youth movement and gymnastic organization). From 1933 the Nazi party started to repress the Sorbs. At that time the Nazis also dissolved the Sokol Movement and began to combat every sign of Sorbian culture. In 1937, the activities of the Domowina Institution and other organizations were banned as anti-national. Sorbian clergymen and teachers were forcedly deported from Lusatia; Nazi German authorities confiscated the Sorbian House, other buildings and crops.\n\n[[Image:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1982, MiNr Zusammendruck 2716-2721.jpg|thumb|1982 stamps from the East German period]]\nOn May 10, 1945, in [[Crostwitz]], after the [[Red Army]]\u2019s invasion, the Domowina Institution renewed its activity. In 1948, the [[Landtag]] of [[Saxony]] passed an Act guaranteeing protection to Sorbian Lusatians; in 1949, [[Brandenburg]] resolved a similar law. Article 40 of the constitution of [[German Democratic Republic]] adopted on 7 October 1949 expressly provided for the protection of the language and culture of the Sorbs. In the times of the German Democratic Republic, Sorbian organizations were financially supported by the country, but at the same time the authorities encouraged [[Germanization]] of Sorbian youth as a means of incorporating them into the system of \"building [[Socialism]]\". Sorbian language and culture could only be publicly presented as long as they promoted socialist ideology. For over 1000 years, the Sorbs were able to maintain and even develop their national culture, despite escalating Germanization and [[Polonization]], mainly due to the high level of religious observance, cultivation of their tradition and strong families (Sorbian families still often have five children). In the middle of the 20th century, the revival of the Central European nations included some Sorbs, who became strong enough to attempt twice to regain their independence. After [[World War II]], the Lusatian National Committee in Prague claimed the right to self-government and separation from Germany and the creation of a Lusatian Free State or attachment to [[Czechoslovakia]]. The majority of the Sorbs were organized in the Domowina, though, and did not wish to split from Germany.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Claims asserted by the Lusatian National movement were postulates of joining Lusatia to Poland or Czechoslovakia.

There was also a project of proclaiming a Lusatian Free State, whose Prime Minister was supposed to be a Polish archaeologist of Lusatian origin- Wojciech K\u00f3\u010dka.

Similarly, in Czechoslovakia, where before the [[Potsdam Conference]] in [[Prague]], 300,000 people demonstrated for the independence of Lusatia. The endeavours to separate Lusatia from Germany did not succeed because of various individual and geopolitical interests.\n\n[[File:Bilinguale Stra\u00dfenbeschilderung Cottbus.jpg|thumb|Bilingual names of streets in [[Cottbus]]]]\nThe following statistics indicates the progression of cultural change among Sorbs: by the end of the 19th century, about 150,000 people spoke Sorbian languages. By 1920, almost all Sorbs had mastered Sorbian and German to the same degree. Nowadays, the number of people using Sorbian languages has been estimated to be no more than 40,000.\n\nThe Israeli Slavic linguist [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]] has argued that the Yiddish language structure provides \"compelling evidence of an intimate Jewish contact with the Slavs in the German and Bohemian lands as early as the 9th century\", and has theorized that Sorbs may have been contributors to the Ashkenazic Jewish population in Europe from the same period.<ref>[[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]], ''[https://slavica.indiana.edu/bookListings/linguistics/The_Ashkenazic_Jews The Ashkenazic Jews]'', Slavica Publishers, 1993</ref><ref name=\"Wexler2\">[[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]] (1992), \"From Serb Lands to Sorb Lands,\" in ''The Balkan Substratum of Yiddish: A Reassessment of the Unique Romance and Greek Components'', [[Harrassowitz Verlag]], 1992, p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Traditions ===\n''[[Zapust (tradition)|Zapust]]'' is the most popular tradition of the Sorbs, deeply linked to the working life of the community.

In some of these places (''e.g.'', [[Radibor]] or Radwor in Sorbian, [[Crostwitz]] or Chr\u00f3s\u0107icy, and [[Ralbitz-Rosenthal|Rosenthal]] or R\u00f3\u017eant), Sorbs constitute the majority of the population, and children grow up speaking Sorbian.\n\nOn Sundays, during holidays, and at weddings, people wear regional costumes, rich in decoration and embroidery, encrusted with pearls.\n\nSome of the customs and traditions observed include Bird Wedding (25 January), [[Easter]] Cavalcade of Riders, Witch Burning (30 April), Maik, singing on [[St. Martin's Day]] (Nicolay), and the celebrations of [[Saint Barbara]]\u2019s Day and [[Saint Nicholas]]\u2019s Day.\n\n=== Region of Hoyerswerda (Wojerecy) and Schleife (Slepo) ===\n\nIn the area from [[Hoyerswerda]] to [[Schleife]], a dialect of Sorbian which combines characteristic features of both Upper and Lower Sorbian is spoken. The region is predominantly Protestant, highly devastated by the brown coal mining industry, sparsely populated, and to a great extent germanicized. Most speakers of Sorbian are over 60 years old.\n\nThe region distinguishes itself through many examples of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] wooden architecture monuments including churches and regular houses, a diversity of regional costumes (mainly worn by elderly women) that feature white-knitting with black, cross-like embroidery, and a tradition of playing [[bagpipes]].\nIn several villages, residents uphold traditional festivities such as expelling of winter, ''Maik'', [[Easter]] and [[Great Friday]] singing, and the celebration of ''d\u017a\u011b\u0107etko'' (disguised child or young girl giving [[Christmas]] presents).\n\n=== Region of Lower Lusatia ===\n[[Image:Flagaluzycdolnych.png|thumb|right|The Flag of [[Lower Lusatia]]]]\n[[File:Niederlausitz Wappen.png|thumb|Coat of arms of Lower Lusatia, as drawn by [[Hugo Gerard Str\u00f6hl]]]]\n\nThere are 60 towns from the area of [[Cottbus]] belonging to this region, where most of the older people over 60 but few young people and children can speak the Lower Sorbian language; the local variant often incorporates many words taken from the German language, and in conversations with the younger generation, German is generally preferred. Some primary schools in the region teach bilingually, and in Cottbus there is an important Gymnasium whose main medium of instruction is Lower Sorbian. The region is predominantly Protestant, again highly devastated by the brown coal mining industry. The biggest tourist attraction of the region and in the whole [[Lusatia]] are the marshlands, with many [[Spreewald]]/B\u0142\u00f3ta canals, picturesque broads of the [[Spree]].\n\nWorn mainly by older but on holidays by young women, regional costumes are colourful, including a large headscarf called \"lapa\", rich in golden embroidering and differing from village to village.\n\nIn some villages, following traditions are observed: Shrovetide, ''Maik'', [[Easter]] bonfires, [[Rooster]]s catching/hunting. In J\u00e4nschwalde (Sorbian: Jan\u0161ojcach) so-called Jan\u0161ojki bog (disguised young girl) gives [[Christmas]] presents.\n\n== Relationship with Poland ==\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|250px|thumb|Lusatia was part of the Polish state between 1002 and 1031 under the rule of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw I]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Boles\u0142aw I]] had taken control of the marches of [[Lusatia]] (\u0141u\u017cyce), Sorbian [[Meissen]] (Mi\u015bnia), and the cities of Budziszyn (Bautzen) and Meissen in 1002, and refused to pay the tribute to the [[Empire]] from the conquered territories. Boles\u0142aw, after the Polish-German War (1002\u20131018), signed the [[Peace of Bautzen]] on 30 January 1018, which made Boles\u0142aw I a clear winner. The Polish ruler was able to keep the contested marches of Lusatia and Sorbian Meissen not as fiefs, but as part of Polish territory.<ref>Jasienica, Pawel (2007) (in Polish). Polska Piastow.

The book was expanded and published again in cooperation with Micha\u0142 H\u00f3rnik in 1884 in [[Bautzen]], under a new title ''Historije serbskeho naroda''. Alfons Parczewski was another friend of Sorbs, who from 1875 was involved in Sorbs' rights protection, participating in Sorbian meetings in [[Bautzen]]. It was thanks to him, among others, that [[J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski]] founded a scholarship for Sorbian students. An association of friends of Sorbian Nation was established at the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1936 (Polish full name: Towarzystwo Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Narodu Serbo-\u0141u\u017cyckiego). It gathered people not only from the university. Its president was Professor Stanis\u0142aw S\u0142o\u0144ski, and the deputy president was Julia Wiele\u017cy\u0144ska. The association was a legal entity. There were three individual organizations devoted to Sorbian matters. Pro\u0142u\u017c founded in Krotoszyn, expanded to all Poland (3000 members). It was the biggest non-communist organization that dealt with foreign affairs. This youth organization was created during the Soviet occupation and its motto was \"Polish guard over Lusatia\" (pl. Nad \u0141u\u017cycami polska stra\u017c). Its highest activity was in [[Greater Poland]] (Polish: Wielkopolska,  a district of western Poland).\nAfter the creation of [[East Germany]], Pro\u0142u\u017c was dissolved, and its president historian from Pozna\u0144 Alojzy Stanis\u0142aw Matyniak was arrested.<ref>\"Pro\u0142u\u017c Akademicki Zwi\u0105zek Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 \u0141u\u017cyc\" Jakub Brodacki.

In 840, Sorbian Duke [[Czimislav]] was killed. In 932, [[Henry I the Fowler|Henry I]] conquered [[Lusatia]] and [[Upper Lusatia|Milsko]]. [[Gero II]], [[Margrave]] of the Saxon [[Saxon Eastern March|Ostmark]], reconquered Lusatia the following year and, in 939, murdered 30 Sorbian princes during a feast. As a result, there were many Sorbian uprisings against German rule. A reconstructed castle, at Raddusch in Lower Lusatia, is the sole physical remnant from this early period.\n\n===High and Late Middle Ages===\nDuring the reign of [[Boleslaw I of Poland]] in 1002\u20131018, three Polish-German wars were waged which caused [[Lusatia]] to come under the domination of new rulers. In 1018, on the strength of peace in [[Bautzen]], [[Lusatia]] became a part of [[Poland]]; but, it returned to [[Germany|German]] rule before 1031.  However, this German rule is not to be understood in a national sense. At that time, Lusatia (along with [[Silesia]]) was part of \n[[Bohemia]] which itself was part of the Roman-German Empire but was ruled by a powerful indigenous Slavic dynasty. There was a dense network of dynastic and diplomatic relations between German and Slavic feudal lords, e.g. [[Wiprecht of Groitzsch]] (a German) rose to power through close links with the Bohemian king and his marriage into Slavic nobility. The Slavic-governed Bohemia remained a loyal and politically influential member of the Roman-German Empire but was in a constant power-struggle with neighbouring Poland. From the 11th to the 15th century, agriculture in Lusatia developed and colonization by Frankish, Flemish and Saxon settlers intensified. This can still be seen today from the names of local villages which geographically form a patchwork of typical German (ending on -dorf, -thal etc.) and typical Slavic origin (ending on -witz, -ow etc.), indicating the language originally spoken by its inhabitants. In 1327 the first prohibitions on using Sorbian before courts and in administrative affairs in the cities of [[Altenburg]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Leipzig]] appeared. Speaking Sorbian in family and business contexts was, however, not banned, as it did not involve the functioning of the administration. Also the village communities and the village administration usually kept operating in Sorbian.\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[File:Budy\u0161in Serbski Dom.JPG|thumb|\"House of the Sorbs\" (''Serbski dom'') in [[Bautzen]]]]\nBetween 1376 and 1635 Lusatia was part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]], under the rule of the Luxembourgs, Habsburgs and other kings. From the beginning of the 16th century the whole Sorbian-inhabited area, with the exception of Lusatia, underwent [[Germanization]]. In 1635 Lusatia became a [[fiefdom]] of Saxon electors, but it retained a considerable autonomy and largely its own legal system (see [[Lusatian League]]). The [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[second plague pandemic|plague of the 17th century]] caused terrible devastation in Lusatia. This led to further German colonization and Germanization.\n\nIn 1667 the Prince of [[Brandenburg]], Frederick Wilhelm, ordered the immediate destruction of all Sorbian printed materials and banned saying masses in this language. At the same time the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Church]] supported printing Sorbian religious literature as a means of fighting the [[Counterreformation]]. In 1706 the Sorbian Seminary, the main centre for the education of Sorbian [[Catholic]] priests, was founded in [[Prague]]. [[Evangelism|Evangelical]] students of theology formed the Sorbian College of Ministers.\n\n===Late modern period===\n[[The Congress of Vienna]], in 1815, gave part of [[Upper Lusatia]] to [[Saxony]], but most of Lusatia to [[Prussia]]. More and more bans on the use of [[Sorbian languages]] appeared from then until 1835 in [[Saxony]] and Prussia; emigration of the Sorbs, mainly to the town of Serbin in [[Texas]] and to [[Australia]], increased. In 1848, 5000 Sorbs signed a petition to the Saxon Government, in which they demanded equality for the Sorbian language with the German one in churches, courts, schools and Government departments. From 1871 the whole of Lusatia became a part of united Germany and was divided between two parts; Prussia ([[Silesia]] and [[Brandenburg]]), and Saxony.\n\nIn 1871 the industrialization of the region and German immigration began; official Germanization intensified. Although the [[Weimar Republic]] guaranteed constitutional minority rights, it did not practice them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe news about Serbs came in the period of the Serbian-Turkish Wars (1876-1878).

Sorbian costume, culture, customs, and the language was said to be no indication of a non-German origin. The Reich declared that there were truly no \"Sorbs\" or \"Lusatians\", only Wendish-Speaking Germans. As such, while the Sorbs were largely safe from the Reich's policies of ethnic cleansing, the cultivation of \"Wendish\" customs and traditions was to be encouraged in a controlled manner and it was expected that the Slavic language would decline due to natural causes. Young Sorbs enlisted in the [[Wehrmacht]] and were sent to the front. Entangled lives of the Sorbs during [[World War II]] are exemplified by life stories of [[Mina Witkojc]], [[M\u011br\u010din Nowak-Njechor\u0144ski]] and [[Jan Skala]].\n\nThe first Lusatian cities were captured in April 1945, when the [[Red Army]] and the [[Second Army (Poland)|Polish Second Army]] crossed the river [[Kwisa|Queis]] (Kwisa). The defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] changed the Sorbs\u2019 situation considerably. The regions in [[East Germany]] (the German Democratic Republic) faced heavy industrialisation and a large influx of [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled Germans]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The East German authorities tried to counteract this development by creating a broad range of Sorbian institutions. The Sorbs were officially recognized as an ethnic minority, more than 100 Sorbian schools and several academic institutions were founded, the [[Domowina]] and its associated societies were re-established and a Sorbian theatre was created. Owing to the suppression of the church and forced collectivization, however, these efforts were severely affected and consequently over time the number of people speaking Sorbian languages decreased by half.\n\nSorbs caused the communist government of East Germany  plenty of trouble, mainly because of the high levels of religious observance and resistance to the nationalisation of agriculture. During the compulsory collectivization campaign, a great many unprecedented incidents were reported. Thus, throughout the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]], violent clashes with the police were reported in Lusatia. An open uprising took place in three upper communes of B\u0142ot.\n\nAfter the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, Lusatians made efforts to create an autonomous administrative unit; however, [[Helmut Kohl]]\u2019s government did not agree to it.  After 1989, the Sorbian movement revived, however, it still encounters many obstacles. Although Germany supports national minorities, Sorbs claim that their aspirations are not sufficiently fulfilled{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.  The desire to unite Lusatia in one of the federal states has not been taken into consideration. [[Upper Lusatia]] still belongs to Saxony and [[Lower Lusatia]] to Brandenburg.  Liquidations of Sorbian schools, even in areas mostly populated by Sorbs, still happen, under the pretext of financial difficulties or demolition of whole villages to create [[lignite]] quarries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nFaced with growing threat of cultural extinction, the Domowina issued a memorandum in March 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domowina.sorben.com/pm/memorandum08.htm|title=DOMOWINA - Medijowe wozjewjenje - Pressemitteilung- Press release|work=sorben.com|accessdate=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204939/http://www.domowina.sorben.com/pm/memorandum08.htm|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> and called for \"help and protection against the growing threat of their cultural extinction, since an ongoing conflict between the German government, Saxony and Brandenburg about the financial distribution of help blocks the financing of almost all Sorbian institutions\".

In 1548 [[Miko\u0142aj Jakubica]] \u2013 Lower Sorbian vicar, from the village called Lubanice, wrote the first unprinted translation of the [[New Testament]] into Lower Sorbian. In 1574 the first Sorbian book was printed: [[Albin Moller]]s\u2019 songbook. In 1688 Jurij Haw\u0161tyn Sw\u011btlik translated [[the Bible]] for Catholic Sorbs. From 1706 to 1709 the New Testament was printed in the Upper Sorbian translation was done by [[Micha\u0142 Frencel]] and in Lower Sorbian by [[Jan Bogumi\u0142 Fabricius]] (1681\u20131741). [[Jan Bjedrich Fryco]] (a.k.a. Johann Friedrich Fritze) (1747\u20131819), translated the [[Old Testament]] for the first time into Lower Sorbian, published in 1790.\n\nOther Sorbian Bible translators include Jakub Buk (1825\u20131895), [[Micha\u0142 H\u00f3rnik]] (Michael Hornig) (1833\u20131894), Jurij \u0141u\u0161\u0107anski (a.k.a. Georg Wuschanski) (1839\u20131905). In 1809 for the short period of time, there was the first printed Sorbian newspaper. In 1767 Jurij Mje\u0144 publishes the first secular Sorbian book. Between 1841 and 1843, [[Jan Arno\u0161t Smoler]] and Leopold Haupt (a.k.a. J. L. Haupt and J. E. Schmaler) published two-volume collection of Wendish folk-songs in Upper and Lower Lusatia. From 1842, the first Sorbian publishing companies started to appear: the poet Handrij Zejler set up a weekly magazine, the precursor of today\u2019s Sorbian News. In 1845 in [[Bautzen]] the first festival of Sorbian songs took place. In 1875, [[Jakub Bart-\u0106i\u0161inski]], the poet and classicist of Upper Sorbian literature, and Karol Arno\u0161t Muka created a movement of young Sorbians influencing Lusatian art, science and literature for the following 50 years. A similar movement in [[Lower Lusatia]] was organized around the most prominent Lower Lusatian poets [[Mato K\u00f3syk]] (Mato Kosyk) and [[Bogumi\u0142 \u0160wjela]].\n\nIn 1904, mainly thanks to the Sorbs\u2019 contribution, the most important Sorbian cultural centre (the Sorbian House) was built in [[Bautzen]]. In 1912, the social and cultural organization of Lusatian Sorbs was created, the [[Domowina]] Institution - the union of Sorbian organizations. In 1919 it had 180,000 members. In 1920, Jan Skala set up a Sorbian party and in 1925 in Berlin, Skala started Kulturwille- the newspaper for the protection of national minorities in Germany. In 1920, the [[Sokol]] Movement was founded (youth movement and gymnastic organization). From 1933 the Nazi party started to repress the Sorbs. At that time the Nazis also dissolved the Sokol Movement and began to combat every sign of Sorbian culture. In 1937, the activities of the Domowina Institution and other organizations were banned as anti-national. Sorbian clergymen and teachers were forcedly deported from Lusatia; Nazi German authorities confiscated the Sorbian House, other buildings and crops.\n\n[[Image:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1982, MiNr Zusammendruck 2716-2721.jpg|thumb|1982 stamps from the East German period]]\nOn May 10, 1945, in [[Crostwitz]], after the [[Red Army]]\u2019s invasion, the Domowina Institution renewed its activity. In 1948, the [[Landtag]] of [[Saxony]] passed an Act guaranteeing protection to Sorbian Lusatians; in 1949, [[Brandenburg]] resolved a similar law. Article 40 of the constitution of [[German Democratic Republic]] adopted on 7 October 1949 expressly provided for the protection of the language and culture of the Sorbs. In the times of the German Democratic Republic, Sorbian organizations were financially supported by the country, but at the same time the authorities encouraged [[Germanization]] of Sorbian youth as a means of incorporating them into the system of \"building [[Socialism]]\". Sorbian language and culture could only be publicly presented as long as they promoted socialist ideology. For over 1000 years, the Sorbs were able to maintain and even develop their national culture, despite escalating Germanization and [[Polonization]], mainly due to the high level of religious observance, cultivation of their tradition and strong families (Sorbian families still often have five children). In the middle of the 20th century, the revival of the Central European nations included some Sorbs, who became strong enough to attempt twice to regain their independence. After [[World War II]], the Lusatian National Committee in Prague claimed the right to self-government and separation from Germany and the creation of a Lusatian Free State or attachment to [[Czechoslovakia]]. The majority of the Sorbs were organized in the Domowina, though, and did not wish to split from Germany.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Claims asserted by the Lusatian National movement were postulates of joining Lusatia to Poland or Czechoslovakia.

In some of these places (''e.g.'', [[Radibor]] or Radwor in Sorbian, [[Crostwitz]] or Chr\u00f3s\u0107icy, and [[Ralbitz-Rosenthal|Rosenthal]] or R\u00f3\u017eant), Sorbs constitute the majority of the population, and children grow up speaking Sorbian.\n\nOn Sundays, during holidays, and at weddings, people wear regional costumes, rich in decoration and embroidery, encrusted with pearls.\n\nSome of the customs and traditions observed include Bird Wedding (25 January), [[Easter]] Cavalcade of Riders, Witch Burning (30 April), Maik, singing on [[St. Martin's Day]] (Nicolay), and the celebrations of [[Saint Barbara]]\u2019s Day and [[Saint Nicholas]]\u2019s Day.\n\n=== Region of Hoyerswerda (Wojerecy) and Schleife (Slepo) ===\n\nIn the area from [[Hoyerswerda]] to [[Schleife]], a dialect of Sorbian which combines characteristic features of both Upper and Lower Sorbian is spoken. The region is predominantly Protestant, highly devastated by the brown coal mining industry, sparsely populated, and to a great extent germanicized. Most speakers of Sorbian are over 60 years old.\n\nThe region distinguishes itself through many examples of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] wooden architecture monuments including churches and regular houses, a diversity of regional costumes (mainly worn by elderly women) that feature white-knitting with black, cross-like embroidery, and a tradition of playing [[bagpipes]].\nIn several villages, residents uphold traditional festivities such as expelling of winter, ''Maik'', [[Easter]] and [[Great Friday]] singing, and the celebration of ''d\u017a\u011b\u0107etko'' (disguised child or young girl giving [[Christmas]] presents).\n\n=== Region of Lower Lusatia ===\n[[Image:Flagaluzycdolnych.png|thumb|right|The Flag of [[Lower Lusatia]]]]\n[[File:Niederlausitz Wappen.png|thumb|Coat of arms of Lower Lusatia, as drawn by [[Hugo Gerard Str\u00f6hl]]]]\n\nThere are 60 towns from the area of [[Cottbus]] belonging to this region, where most of the older people over 60 but few young people and children can speak the Lower Sorbian language; the local variant often incorporates many words taken from the German language, and in conversations with the younger generation, German is generally preferred. Some primary schools in the region teach bilingually, and in Cottbus there is an important Gymnasium whose main medium of instruction is Lower Sorbian. The region is predominantly Protestant, again highly devastated by the brown coal mining industry. The biggest tourist attraction of the region and in the whole [[Lusatia]] are the marshlands, with many [[Spreewald]]/B\u0142\u00f3ta canals, picturesque broads of the [[Spree]].\n\nWorn mainly by older but on holidays by young women, regional costumes are colourful, including a large headscarf called \"lapa\", rich in golden embroidering and differing from village to village.\n\nIn some villages, following traditions are observed: Shrovetide, ''Maik'', [[Easter]] bonfires, [[Rooster]]s catching/hunting. In J\u00e4nschwalde (Sorbian: Jan\u0161ojcach) so-called Jan\u0161ojki bog (disguised young girl) gives [[Christmas]] presents.\n\n== Relationship with Poland ==\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|250px|thumb|Lusatia was part of the Polish state between 1002 and 1031 under the rule of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw I]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Boles\u0142aw I]] had taken control of the marches of [[Lusatia]] (\u0141u\u017cyce), Sorbian [[Meissen]] (Mi\u015bnia), and the cities of Budziszyn (Bautzen) and Meissen in 1002, and refused to pay the tribute to the [[Empire]] from the conquered territories. Boles\u0142aw, after the Polish-German War (1002\u20131018), signed the [[Peace of Bautzen]] on 30 January 1018, which made Boles\u0142aw I a clear winner. The Polish ruler was able to keep the contested marches of Lusatia and Sorbian Meissen not as fiefs, but as part of Polish territory.<ref>Jasienica, Pawel (2007) (in Polish). Polska Piastow.

The book was expanded and published again in cooperation with Micha\u0142 H\u00f3rnik in 1884 in [[Bautzen]], under a new title ''Historije serbskeho naroda''. Alfons Parczewski was another friend of Sorbs, who from 1875 was involved in Sorbs' rights protection, participating in Sorbian meetings in [[Bautzen]]. It was thanks to him, among others, that [[J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski]] founded a scholarship for Sorbian students. An association of friends of Sorbian Nation was established at the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1936 (Polish full name: Towarzystwo Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Narodu Serbo-\u0141u\u017cyckiego). It gathered people not only from the university. Its president was Professor Stanis\u0142aw S\u0142o\u0144ski, and the deputy president was Julia Wiele\u017cy\u0144ska. The association was a legal entity. There were three individual organizations devoted to Sorbian matters. Pro\u0142u\u017c founded in Krotoszyn, expanded to all Poland (3000 members). It was the biggest non-communist organization that dealt with foreign affairs. This youth organization was created during the Soviet occupation and its motto was \"Polish guard over Lusatia\" (pl. Nad \u0141u\u017cycami polska stra\u017c). Its highest activity was in [[Greater Poland]] (Polish: Wielkopolska,  a district of western Poland).\nAfter the creation of [[East Germany]], Pro\u0142u\u017c was dissolved, and its president historian from Pozna\u0144 Alojzy Stanis\u0142aw Matyniak was arrested.<ref>\"Pro\u0142u\u017c Akademicki Zwi\u0105zek Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 \u0141u\u017cyc\" Jakub Brodacki.

Slavs were labeled inferior to Germanic peoples, and in 1875, the use of Sorbian was banned in German schools. As a result, almost the entire Sorbian population was bilingual by the end of the 19th century.{{Efn|name=Remus|\"[A]nti-Sorbian policies throughout the Sorbian area of settlement got increasingly aggressive and, unsurprisingly, saw their climax under Nazi rule.

Their distinct identity and culture and Slavic origins were denied by referring to them as \"Wendish-speaking Germans\". Under Nazi rule, the Sorbian language and practice of Sorbian culture was banned, Sorbian and Slavic place-names were changed to German ones, Sorbian books and printing presses were destroyed, Sorbian organizations and newspapers were banned, Sorbian libraries and archives were closed, and Sorbian teachers and clerics were deported to German-speaking areas and replaced with German-speaking teachers and clerics.

Under head coach [[Norb Hecker]], Atlanta lost their first nine regular season games in 1966; their first victory came on the road against the struggling [[1966 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on November 20 in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Two weeks later, Atlanta won at [[1966 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], and beat [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis]] in Atlanta the next week for their first home win.  The team finished the 1960s with 12 wins in four seasons.\n\nThe Falcons had their first [[Monday Night Football]] game in Atlanta during the [[1970 Atlanta Falcons season|1970]] season, a 20\u20137 loss to the [[1970 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].

The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30\u201327 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened [[1982 Atlanta Falcons season|1982]] season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the [[1982 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], 30\u201324.

Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5\u201311 record that year. In 2004, a new head coach, [[Jim L. Mora]], was hired and Vick returned for the [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|full season]]. The Falcons went 11\u20135, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the [[2004 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], 47\u201317, in the [[Georgia Dome]], advancing to the [[NFC Championship Game]], which they lost to the [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]], 27\u201310.\n\nThe [[2005 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in {{nfly|2005}}, going 8\u20138. In {{nfly|2006}}, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039. After finishing the season 7\u20139, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed and [[Bobby Petrino]], the [[University of Louisville]]'s football coach, replaced him. Before the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia.

Their first loss of the season was a 23\u201317 home defeat to the [[Buffalo Bills]] in week 4.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/atl/2017_games.htm |title=2017 Atlanta Falcons Schedule & Game Results |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> The team returned to the playoffs with a 10\u20136 record (albeit with a third-place finish in the NFC South). The Falcons defeated the Los Angeles Rams 26\u201313 in the Wild Card round, but their 2017 season came to an end a week later in the Divisional Playoff round at the hands of the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles 15\u201310.\n\n==Stadiums==\n{{main|Mercedes-Benz Stadium}}\nThe Falcons have called three stadiums home in their 51 years of existence, and its third home in their history opened in the late summer of 2017. The first was the [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]], sharing with the [[Atlanta Braves]] [[Major League Baseball]] team until 1991. In 1992, the [[Georgia Dome]] was built, and the Falcons played there from its opening to the 2016 season. The Dome has been frequently used for [[college football]], including [[Georgia State Panthers football|Georgia State]] football and college bowl games such as the [[Peach Bowl]].\n\nIn an effort to replace the aging Georgia Dome and potentially host a future [[Super Bowl]], team owner Arthur Blank proposed a deal with the city of Atlanta to build a new state-of-the-art stadium not far from where the Georgia Dome is located. Blank will contribute $800 million and the city of Atlanta will contribute an additional $200 million via bonds backed by the city's hotel/motel tax towards the construction of a retractable roof stadium. Blank will contribute additional money for cost overruns if it is needed. The team will provide up to $50 million towards infrastructure costs that weren't included in the construction budget and to retire the remaining debt on the Georgia Dome. In addition, Blank's foundation and the city will each provide $15 million for development in surrounding neighborhoods. Though the total cost of the stadium was initially estimated to be around $1 billion,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9028345/atlanta-falcons-city-officials-agree-financing-terms-new-1-billion-stadium|title=Atlanta Falcons, city officials agree on financing terms for new $1 billion stadium|publisher=ESPN.go.com|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref> the total cost was revised to $1.5 billion according to Blank.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saporta|first1=Maria|title=New Falcons stadium cost 'rises up' -- again -- another $100 million|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2015/04/13/new-falcons-stadium-cost-rises-up-again-another.html|website=Atlanta Business Chronicle|publisher=American City Business Journals|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}</ref> In March 2013, the Atlanta City Council voted 11\u20134 in favor of building the stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/21667196/atlanta-city-council-could-vote-on-new-falcons-stadium#axzz2tZQLx7YR|title=Atlanta City Council approves Falcons stadium funding|publisher=myfoxatlanta.com|date=March 18, 2013|accessdate=February 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100730/http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/21667196/atlanta-city-council-could-vote-on-new-falcons-stadium#axzz2tZQLx7YR|archive-date=February 22, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The retractable roof [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] broke ground in May 2014, and became the third home stadium for the Falcons and the first for the new [[Atlanta United FC]] [[Major League Soccer]] club upon opening in 2017.\n\n==Logo and uniforms==\n[[File:NFC-Throwback2-Uniform-ATL.PNG|thumb|150px|Falcons uniform: 1971\u20131989]]\n[[File:NFC-Throwback-Uniform-ATL.PNG|thumb|150px|Falcons uniform: 1997\u20132002]]\n[[File:Atlanta falcons unif 16.png|thumb|220px|Falcons uniform: 2016\u201319, including the throwback edition]]\nThe Atlanta Falcons' colors are red, black, silver and white.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=|date=February 13, 2013|title=Evolution of the Falcons' colors|medium=|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/media-lounge/videos/Evolution-of-the-Falcons-Colors/ec2fdb24-144e-444e-ae34-33e8cb975233|accessdate=March 30, 2017|publisher=Atlanta Falcons}}</ref> When the team began play in [[1966 Atlanta Falcons season|1966]], the Falcons wore red helmets with a black falcon crest logo. In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] (white and gold) and the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] (red and black). Although the gold was removed after several seasons, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978. The facemasks on the helmets were initially gray, becoming white in 1978, and then black in 1984; the team has worn black facemasks since then.\n\nA prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the [[1974 Atlanta Falcons season|1974 season]], but was never worn.\n\nIn [[1990 Atlanta Falcons season|1990]], the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in [[1997 Atlanta Falcons season|1997]]. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.)\n\nBoth the logo and uniforms changed in [[2003 Atlanta Falcons season|2003]]. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter ''F''.<ref name=\"NewFalconsLogo2003\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Uniform History|url=https://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/pdf/media-guides/ATL-Media-Guide.pdf#page=377|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|work=2019 Atlanta Falcons Media Guide|date=August 13, 2019|access-date=September 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Falcons unveil new uniforms at fan rally|url=http://atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=177215|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=April 24, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705011150/http://atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=177215|archive-date=July 5, 2003|access-date=August 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|2004]], the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the [[New Orleans Saints]], winning the first two contests (24\u201321 in {{nfly|2004}} and 36\u201317 in {{nfly|2005}}), but losing 31\u201313 in {{nfly|2006}}. The Falcons wore the all black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34\u201314. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14\u20133. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time). After that, the black pants and uniforms were retired and the white pants were now used full-time with the regular uniforms.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 \u2013 against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well. The throwbacks were used twice in 2011 and 2012; both times were against the Panthers and Saints. However, the throwbacks were retired following a 2013 NFL rule requiring only one helmet shell per team.\n\nThe Falcons unveiled an all-red [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform on September 13, 2016; however, due to the fact that the Falcons and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] had similar all-red Color Rush uniforms, the Falcons were unable to wear their Color Rush uniform until the 2017 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL AND NIKE REVEAL COLOR RUSH UNIFORMS|url=https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/nfl-and-nike-reveal-color-rush-uniforms-17676181|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=September 13, 2016|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Tabeek|first=Matthew|title=LOOK: THREE STRAIGHT HOME GAMES WITH THREE DIFFERENT UNIFORM COMBINATIONS FOR FALCONS|url=https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/look-three-straight-home-games-with-three-different-uniform-combination-19907987|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=December 4, 2017|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2016, the Falcons unveiled a mixed throwback uniform set. The uniform tops, pants and socks closely resembled their 1960s kits. But due to the NFL's one-shell rule that prevented them from resurrecting the red helmets, the Falcons instead wore the black helmets with the original logo decal similar to the design they wore in the 1990s.\n\nIt was revealed in January 2020 that the Falcons will change uniforms for the [[2020 NFL season]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Shook|first=Nick|title=Atlanta Falcons to have new uniforms for 2020 season|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001096746/article/atlanta-falcons-to-have-new-uniforms-for-2020-season|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=January 14, 2020|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Rivalries==\n===New Orleans Saints===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|Falcons\u2013Saints rivalry}}\nIn every season except for their debut season, the Falcons have shared a division with the [[New Orleans Saints]] (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South).

The NFL had planned to add two teams in {{nfly|1967}}; the competition with the AFL for Atlanta forced the first to be added a year early in {{nfly|1966}}. The odd number of teams (15) resulted in one idle team (bye) each week, with each team playing 14 games over 15 weeks (similar to {{nfly|1960}}: 12 games over 13 weeks). The second expansion team, the [[1967 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], joined the NFL as planned in 1967 as its 16th franchise.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30, 1965, when Rozelle granted ownership to 40-year-old [[Rankin Smith Sr.]], an Executive Vice President of Life Insurance Company of Georgia.

Under head coach [[Norb Hecker]], Atlanta lost their first nine regular season games in 1966; their first victory came on the road against the struggling [[1966 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on November 20 in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Two weeks later, Atlanta won at [[1966 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], and beat [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis]] in Atlanta the next week for their first home win.  The team finished the 1960s with 12 wins in four seasons.\n\nThe Falcons had their first [[Monday Night Football]] game in Atlanta during the [[1970 Atlanta Falcons season|1970]] season, a 20\u20137 loss to the [[1970 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. The only two winning seasons in their first 12 years were {{nowrap|[[1971 Atlanta Falcons season|1971]] (7\u20136\u20131)}} and {{nowrap|[[1973 Atlanta Falcons season|1973]] (9\u20135).}}\n\n===1978\u20131989===\n[[File:1987 Atlanta Falcons Pocket Schedule.jpg|thumb|right|The Falcons' defense taking on [[1985 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] quarterback [[John Elway]] during a [[1985 Atlanta Falcons season|1985]] game.]]\nIn the [[1978 Atlanta Falcons season|1978]] season, the Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] 14\u201313. The following week, they lost to the [[1978 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 27\u201320 in the Divisional Playoffs.\n\nIn the [[1980 Atlanta Falcons season|1980]] season, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12\u20134 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30\u201327 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened [[1982 Atlanta Falcons season|1982]] season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the [[1982 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], 30\u201324. Falcons coach [[Leeman Bennett]] was fired after the loss. The team then had losing seasons for the next eight years.\n\n===1989\u20131996===\nIn the [[1989 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise. \"Neon Deion\" (a.k.a. \"Prime Time\") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams ([[New York Yankees]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]]) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.\n\n[[File:Atlanta Falcons at Los Angeles Rams 1991-12-08 - 01 (Atlanta Falcons crop).jpg|thumb|right|The Falcons playing against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] during a 1991 away game.]]\n\nAfter defeating the [[1991 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' [[1991 Atlanta Falcons season|1991]] season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. In the [[1991 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected quarterback [[Brett Favre]] as the 33rd overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of four passing attempts with no receptions and two interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].\n\nIn [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|1992]], the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least once during its time there.\n\n===1997\u20132000: The Dan Reeves era===\nIn 1998, under recently acquired head coach [[Dan Reeves]], quarterback [[Chris Chandler]] and running back [[Jamal Anderson]] the \"Dirty Bird\" Falcons had their greatest season to date. On November 8, they beat the [[New England Patriots]] 41\u201310, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14\u20132 regular season record and the NFC West division championship. On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in the [[NFC Championship Game]] 30\u201327, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34\u201319 to the defending champion [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]].\n\nIn the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back [[Jamal Anderson]], who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5\u201311 regular season record.<ref name=\"AtlantaFalcons1\"/> In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4\u201312 and once again missing the playoffs.\n\n===2001\u20132006===\nIn the [[2001 NFL draft]], the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the [[San Diego Chargers]], acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback [[Michael Vick]]) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist [[Tim Dwight]] and the fifth overall pick (used on running back [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]).\n\nThe Falcons finished the [[2001 Atlanta Falcons season|2001 season]] with a record of 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. [[Jessie Tuggle]] retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta. On December 6, 2001, [[Arthur M. Blank]] reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team. In a special meeting prior to [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the purchase.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2001/12/17/weekinbiz.html | title=Arthur Blank buys Falcons from Smith family | date=December 17, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe 2002 season saw the Falcons return to the playoffs with a regular season record of 9\u20136\u20131, tying the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. It was Vick's first year as the starter, and the team, with newly acquired running back Warrick Dunn, delivered the Green Bay Packers their first home playoff loss ever. A 20\u20136 loss to the [[Donovan McNabb]]-led Philadelphia Eagles the following week, however, ended the Falcons' season.\n\nOn March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo.<ref name=\"NewFalconsLogo2003\">{{cite press release|title=Falcons unveil new logo|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=171010|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=March 19, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030623173517/http://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=171010 |archivedate=June 23, 2003|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"AtlantaFalcons1\" /> During the 2003 preseason Vick broke his leg and missed the first 12 games of the season. After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to release head coach Dan Reeves. [[Wade Phillips]] acted as interim coach for the final 3 games. Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5\u201311 record that year. In 2004, a new head coach, [[Jim L. Mora]], was hired and Vick returned for the [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|full season]]. The Falcons went 11\u20135, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the [[2004 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], 47\u201317, in the [[Georgia Dome]], advancing to the [[NFC Championship Game]], which they lost to the [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]], 27\u201310.\n\nThe [[2005 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in {{nfly|2005}}, going 8\u20138. In {{nfly|2006}}, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039. After finishing the season 7\u20139, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed and [[Bobby Petrino]], the [[University of Louisville]]'s football coach, replaced him. Before the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia. On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.\n\n===2007===\n{{main|2007 Atlanta Falcons season}}\nFor the 2007 season, the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] were forced to start [[Joey Harrington]] at quarterback.

In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] (white and gold) and the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] (red and black). Although the gold was removed after several seasons, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978. The facemasks on the helmets were initially gray, becoming white in 1978, and then black in 1984; the team has worn black facemasks since then.\n\nA prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the [[1974 Atlanta Falcons season|1974 season]], but was never worn.\n\nIn [[1990 Atlanta Falcons season|1990]], the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in [[1997 Atlanta Falcons season|1997]]. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.)\n\nBoth the logo and uniforms changed in [[2003 Atlanta Falcons season|2003]].

The Falcons wore the all black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34\u201314. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14\u20133. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time). After that, the black pants and uniforms were retired and the white pants were now used full-time with the regular uniforms.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 \u2013 against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well.

The [[Ottoman Navy]] ordered her from the British [[Thames Iron Works]], and she was [[keel laying|laid down]] in 1868, [[ship launching|launched]] in 1869, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1870. She was armed with four {{cvt|229|mm|0}} guns, was powered by a single-screw [[compound steam engine]] with a top speed of {{convert|13|kn|lk=in}}.\n\n''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' saw action during the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]], where she battled the Russian steamer ''Vesta'' in an inconclusive engagement. The Ottoman fleet was laid up for most of the next twenty years, and ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' saw no activity during this period. Modernized in 1890, she was nevertheless still not in condition for active service at the outbreak of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] in 1897. She was therefore heavily rebuilt in Germany between 1903 and 1907. At the start of the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, the ship was stationed in [[Salonica]]; the ship was disarmed so the guns could be used to strengthen the port's fortifications. On the night of 31 October, a Greek [[torpedo boat]] No 11 slipped into the harbor and sank ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'', killing seven of her crew.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Feth-i B\u00fclend-class ironclad}}\n[[File:Feth-i B\u00fclend (1869).jpg|thumb|left|Line-drawing of ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'']]\n\n''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' was {{convert|72.01|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|11.99|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.51|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The hull was constructed with iron, and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|2762|MT|sp=us}} normally and {{convert|1601|MT|abbr=on}} [[builder's old measurement|BOM]]. She had a crew of 16&nbsp;officers and 153&nbsp;enlisted men.<ref name=G390>Gardiner, p. 390</ref><ref name=LG138>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, p. 138</ref>\n\nThe ship was powered by a single horizontal [[compound engine]] which drove one [[screw propeller]]. Steam was provided by six coal-fired [[box boiler]]s that were trunked into a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] [[amidships]]. The engine was rated at {{convert|3250|ihp|lk=in}} and produced a top speed of {{convert|13|kn|lk=in}}, though by 1877 she was only capable of {{convert|10|kn}}. Decades of poor maintenance had reduced the ship's speed to {{convert|8|kn}} by 1892. ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' carried {{convert|600|MT|abbr=on}} of coal. A supplementary sailing rig was also fitted.<ref name=G390/><ref name=LG138/>\n\nThe ship was armed with a battery of four {{convert|222|mm|abbr=on}} [[muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] [[Armstrong gun]]s mounted in a central, armored [[casemate]], two guns per side. The guns were positioned so as to allow any two to fire directly ahead, astern, or to either [[broadside]]. The casemate had heavy armor protection, with the gun battery protected by 222&nbsp;mm of iron plating. The upper section of the casemate had thinner armor, at {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The hull had a complete [[belt armor|armored belt]] at the [[waterline]], which extended .6&nbsp;m (2&nbsp;ft) above the line and 1.2&nbsp;m (4&nbsp;ft) below. The above-water portion was 222&nbsp;mm thick, while the submerged part was 150&nbsp;mm thick.<ref name=G390/><ref name=LG138/>\n\n== Service history ==\n\n''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' was ordered in 1867 from the [[Thames Iron Works]], [[Blackwall Yard]] in [[London]] and was laid down in May 1868. She was launched in 1869 and began [[sea trials]] in 1870, being commissioned into the [[Ottoman Navy]] later that year.<ref name=LG138/> Upon completion, ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to [[Crete]] to assist in stabilizing the island in the aftermath of the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt]] of 1866&ndash;1869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under [[Hobart Pasha]], remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, pp. 3, 5</ref>\n\n===Russo-Turkish War===\n[[File:Naval battle between \"Vesta\" and \"Fetkh-i Bulend\" at the Black Sea, July 11, 1877.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting ''Feth-i B\u00fclend''{{'}}s (left) battle with ''Vesta'' (center)]]\n\n''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' saw extensive service in the [[Black Sea]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]], based primarily at [[Batumi]]. She took part in the bombardment of Russian positions and capture of the Black Sea port of [[Sokhumi]] on 14\u201316 May 1877. On 23 July, she engaged the Russian armed steamer ''Vesta'' in an inconclusive action. Poor visibility from smoke and escaping steam forced the ships to disengage, both with slight damage and few casualties. On the 31st, ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'', her [[sister ship]] {{ship|Ottoman ironclad|Mukaddeme-i Hayir||2}}, the [[steam frigate]] {{ship|Ottoman frigate|Mubir-i S\u00fcrur||2}}, and several other ships departed [[Sochum]] for [[Trabzon]] to bring ground troops to [[Varna]] to defend against an expected Russian attack across the [[Danube]].<ref name=LG6>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, p. 6</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman fleet then returned to Batumi, where it remained largely inactive. During a patrol on 25 August, ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' encountered the Russian [[yacht]] ''Livadia'', but the Russian vessel fled before ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' could close to effective range.<ref name=LG6/> Following the Ottoman defeat in 1878, the ship was laid up in [[Constantinople]].<ref name=LG138/> The fleet remained inactive at the [[Golden Horn]] for twenty years, though ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' was refitted at the [[Imperial Arsenal (Ottoman Empire)|Imperial Arsenal]] in 1890. During this refit, several small guns were installed, including a pair of {{convert|87|mm|abbr=on}} [[Krupp]] guns, two {{convert|63|mm|abbr=on}} guns, two {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and one {{cvt|25.4|mm|0}} [[Nordenfelt gun]].<ref name=LG138/> At the start of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] in February 1897, the Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'', to be completely unfit for combat against the [[Greek Navy]].<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nFollowing the end of the war, the government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program. The first stage was to rebuild the older armored warships, including ''Feth-i B\u00fclend''. The Ottomans contacted several foreign shipyards; initially, Krupp's [[Germaniawerft]] received the contract to rebuild ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' on 11 August 1900, but by December 1902, the Ottomans had reached an agreement with [[Armstrong-Whitworth|Armstrong]]-[[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]] in [[Genoa]] to rebuild the vessel.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, pp. 10&ndash;11</ref> The work was conducted between 1903 and 1907. The ship was reboilered with a pair of [[water-tube boiler]]s manufactured by the Imperial Arsenal, which improved speed slightly to {{convert|9|kn|abbr=on}}. Her armament was completely replaced with new, [[quick-firing gun]]s manufactured by Krupp. Four [[15 cm SK L/40 gun]]s were mounted in the casemate, and six {{cvt|75|mm|0}} guns and six {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} guns were installed on the upper deck.<ref name=LG138/>\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u20131912, ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' was assigned to the Reserve Division, and she saw no action during the conflict.<ref>Beehler, p. 12</ref> Instead, she was disarmed and most of her weapons&mdash;including all four 15&nbsp;cm guns, and four each of the 75&nbsp;mm and 57&nbsp;mm guns&mdash;were used to bolster the defenses of [[Salonica]]'s harbor. The guns were manned by 90 of the ship's crew. The ship itself was converted to a [[barracks ship]].

The [[Ottoman Navy]] ordered her from the British [[Thames Iron Works]], and she was [[keel laying|laid down]] in 1868, [[ship launching|launched]] in 1869, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1870. She was armed with four {{cvt|229|mm|0}} guns, was powered by a single-screw [[compound steam engine]] with a top speed of {{convert|13|kn|lk=in}}.\n\n''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' saw action during the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]], where she battled the Russian steamer ''Vesta'' in an inconclusive engagement. The Ottoman fleet was laid up for most of the next twenty years, and ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' saw no activity during this period. Modernized in 1890, she was nevertheless still not in condition for active service at the outbreak of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] in 1897. She was therefore heavily rebuilt in Germany between 1903 and 1907. At the start of the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, the ship was stationed in [[Salonica]]; the ship was disarmed so the guns could be used to strengthen the port's fortifications. On the night of 31 October, a Greek [[torpedo boat]] slipped into the harbor and sank ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'', killing seven of her crew.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Feth-i B\u00fclend-class ironclad}}\n[[File:Feth-i B\u00fclend (1869).jpg|thumb|left|Line-drawing of ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'']]\n\n''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' was {{convert|72.01|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|11.99|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.51|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The hull was constructed with iron, and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|2762|MT|sp=us}} normally and {{convert|1601|MT|abbr=on}} [[builder's old measurement|BOM]].

Steam was provided by six coal-fired [[box boiler]]s that were trunked into a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] [[amidships]]. The engine was rated at {{convert|3250|ihp|lk=in}} and produced a top speed of {{convert|13|kn|lk=in}}, though by 1877 she was only capable of {{convert|10|kn}}. Decades of poor maintenance had reduced the ship's speed to {{convert|8|kn}} by 1892. ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' carried {{convert|600|MT|abbr=on}} of coal. A supplementary sailing rig was also fitted.<ref name=G390/><ref name=LG138/>\n\nThe ship was armed with a battery of four {{convert|222|mm|abbr=on}} [[muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] [[Armstrong gun]]s mounted in a central, armored [[casemate]], two guns per side. The guns were positioned so as to allow any two to fire directly ahead, astern, or to either [[broadside]]. The casemate had heavy armor protection, with the gun battery protected by 222&nbsp;mm of iron plating. The upper section of the casemate had thinner armor, at {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The hull had a complete [[belt armor|armored belt]] at the [[waterline]], which extended .6&nbsp;m (2&nbsp;ft) above the line and 1.2&nbsp;m (4&nbsp;ft) below. The above-water portion was 222&nbsp;mm thick, while the submerged part was 150&nbsp;mm thick.<ref name=G390/><ref name=LG138/>\n\n== Service history ==\n\n''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' was ordered in 1867 from the [[Thames Iron Works]], [[Blackwall Yard]] in [[London]] and was laid down in May 1868. She was launched in 1869 and began [[sea trials]] in 1870, being commissioned into the [[Ottoman Navy]] later that year.<ref name=LG138/> Upon completion, ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to [[Crete]] to assist in stabilizing the island in the aftermath of the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt]] of 1866&ndash;1869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under [[Hobart Pasha]], remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, pp. 3, 5</ref>\n\n===Russo-Turkish War===\n[[File:Naval battle between \"Vesta\" and \"Fetkh-i Bulend\" at the Black Sea, July 11, 1877.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting ''Feth-i B\u00fclend''{{'}}s (left) battle with ''Vesta'' (center)]]\n\n''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' saw extensive service in the [[Black Sea]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]], based primarily at [[Batumi]]. She took part in the bombardment of Russian positions and capture of the Black Sea port of [[Sokhumi]] on 14\u201316 May 1877. On 23 July, she engaged the Russian armed steamer ''Vesta'' in an inconclusive action. Poor visibility from smoke and escaping steam forced the ships to disengage, both with slight damage and few casualties. On the 31st, ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'', her [[sister ship]] {{ship|Ottoman ironclad|Mukaddeme-i Hayir||2}}, the [[steam frigate]] {{ship|Ottoman frigate|Mubir-i S\u00fcrur||2}}, and several other ships departed [[Sochum]] for [[Trabzon]] to bring ground troops to [[Varna]] to defend against an expected Russian attack across the [[Danube]].<ref name=LG6>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, p. 6</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman fleet then returned to Batumi, where it remained largely inactive. During a patrol on 25 August, ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' encountered the Russian [[yacht]] ''Livadia'', but the Russian vessel fled before ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' could close to effective range.<ref name=LG6/> Following the Ottoman defeat in 1878, the ship was laid up in [[Constantinople]].<ref name=LG138/> The fleet remained inactive at the [[Golden Horn]] for twenty years, though ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' was refitted at the [[Imperial Arsenal (Ottoman Empire)|Imperial Arsenal]] in 1890. During this refit, several small guns were installed, including a pair of {{convert|87|mm|abbr=on}} [[Krupp]] guns, two {{convert|63|mm|abbr=on}} guns, two {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and one {{cvt|25.4|mm|0}} [[Nordenfelt gun]].<ref name=LG138/> At the start of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] in February 1897, the Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'', to be completely unfit for combat against the [[Greek Navy]].<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nFollowing the end of the war, the government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program. The first stage was to rebuild the older armored warships, including ''Feth-i B\u00fclend''. The Ottomans contacted several foreign shipyards; initially, Krupp's [[Germaniawerft]] received the contract to rebuild ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' on 11 August 1900, but by December 1902, the Ottomans had reached an agreement with [[Armstrong-Whitworth|Armstrong]]-[[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]] in [[Genoa]] to rebuild the vessel.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, pp. 10&ndash;11</ref> The work was conducted between 1903 and 1907. The ship was reboilered with a pair of [[water-tube boiler]]s manufactured by the Imperial Arsenal, which improved speed slightly to {{convert|9|kn|abbr=on}}. Her armament was completely replaced with new, [[quick-firing gun]]s manufactured by Krupp. Four [[15 cm SK L/40 gun]]s were mounted in the casemate, and six {{cvt|75|mm|0}} guns and six {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} guns were installed on the upper deck.<ref name=LG138/>\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u20131912, ''Feth-i B\u00fclend'' was assigned to the Reserve Division, and she saw no action during the conflict.<ref>Beehler, p. 12</ref> Instead, she was disarmed and most of her weapons&mdash;including all four 15&nbsp;cm guns, and four each of the 75&nbsp;mm and 57&nbsp;mm guns&mdash;were used to bolster the defenses of [[Salonica]]'s harbor. The guns were manned by 90 of the ship's crew. The ship itself was converted to a [[barracks ship]]. At the time of the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]] on 18 October 1912, the ship's commander was Captain (''[[Binba\u015fi]]'') Aziz Mahmut Bey, who also functioned as the naval garrison commander.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz, p. 19</ref> On the night of 31 October, the Greek [[torpedo boat]] ''No. 11'' passed by the shore batteries and searchlights and through the mine barrages at 22:20.

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the bombing of AMIA. I dare say before this Assembly\u2014in the presence of some of the family members of the victims who have always been with us\u2014that the Government headed by President Kirchner did the utmost and went the greatest lengths to uncover the real culprits, not only because it opened all my country's intelligence files and created a special prosecutor investigation unit, but also because, when in 2006 the justice system of my country accused Iranian citizens of involvement in the bombing of AMIA, I myself was the only President who dared to propose asking the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with and assist in the investigation. That request was made intermittently from 2007 to 2011, until the Islamic Republic of Iran finally agreed to a bilateral meeting, allowing it to be included in the agenda. That meeting led to the signing by both countries of a memorandum of understanding on legal cooperation that allowed for the Iranian citizens who had been accused, and who live in Tehran, to be deposed before the judge. But what happened when we signed that memorandum? It seemed as if all hell had broken out, both nationally and internationally. The Jewish associations that had sought our support for so many years and that had come here with us to ask for help turned against us, and when an agreement was finally reached on legal cooperation they accused us of complicity with the State of Iran. The same thing happened here in the United States. When the vulture funds lobbied before the United States Congress, they accused us of collaborating with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which at the time was known as the Terrorist State of Iran. They even lobbied on their websites, posting pictures of me on the Internet with former President Ahmadinejad as if we were business partners. Just this week, we learned that the iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel, in this city, was the setting for a meeting between the Secretary of State of this country and his Iranian counterpart. We are not criticizing them. Quite the contrary, anything that represents dialogue and understanding seems very good to us.

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the bombing of AMIA. I dare say before this Assembly\u2014in the presence of some of the family members of the victims who have always been with us\u2014that the Government headed by President Kirchner did the utmost and went the greatest lengths to uncover the real culprits, not only because it opened all my country's intelligence files and created a special prosecutor investigation unit, but also because, when in 2006 the justice system of my country accused Iranian citizens of involvement in the bombing of AMIA, I myself was the only President who dared to propose asking the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with and assist in the investigation. That request was made intermittently from 2007 to 2011, until the Islamic Republic of Iran finally agreed to a bilateral meeting, allowing it to be included in the agenda. That meeting led to the signing by both countries of a memorandum of understanding on legal cooperation that allowed for the Iranian citizens who had been accused, and who live in Tehran, to be deposed before the judge. But what happened when we signed that memorandum? It seemed as if all hell had broken out, both nationally and internationally. The Jewish associations that had sought our support for so many years and that had come here with us to ask for help turned against us, and when an agreement was finally reached on legal cooperation they accused us of complicity with the State of Iran. The same thing happened here in the United States. When the vulture funds lobbied before the United States Congress, they accused us of collaborating with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which at the time was known as the Terrorist State of Iran. They even lobbied on their websites, posting pictures of me on the Internet with former President Ahmadinejad as if we were business partners. Just this week, we learned that the iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel, in this city, was the setting for a meeting between the Secretary of State of this country and his Iranian counterpart. We are not criticizing them. Quite the contrary, anything that represents dialogue and understanding seems very good to us.

The advertisement also argued that the country should revive a controversial agreement with Iran, the country that is suspected of being responsible for the bombings. In addition to that, during a speech president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner accused Israel of being responsible for the [[1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires|1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Argentina]]. This accusation was based on the allegation that Israel was only demanding justice for the AMIA bombing but not for the embassy attack.
