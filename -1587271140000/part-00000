Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] developed the idea to form an organization to produce ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\".<ref name=\"davis125126\" />\n\n''Sesame Street'' premiered as a series on [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the \"CTW model\". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.\n\nAfter ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppets]] accounted for $15\u201317 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement.\n\nOn June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop<ref>http://www.sesameworkshop.org/about-us/leadership-team/joan-ganz-cooney/</ref> to better represent its activities beyond television, and [[Gary Knell]] became CEO. [[H. Melvin Ming]] replaced Knell in 2011. In 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nDuring the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hellman | first = Peter | title = Street Smart: How Big Bird & Company Do It | journal = New York Magazine | volume = 20 | issue = 46 | page = 52 | date = 23 November 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KOUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&vq=sesame+street&q=sesame%20street | issn = 0028-7369 | accessdate = 18 November 2019}}</ref> Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively.

Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, \"Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries\".<ref>Davis, p. 124</ref> At first, Cooney did not fight for the position.

Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget.<ref>Davis, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>  By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.<ref name=\"guthrie2\"/>\n\n[[File:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, thin man in his early fifties, with salty-gray hair and a full beard, and wearing a tuxedo.|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[the Muppets]], in 1989]]\n\nFor the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money.

The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref>Davis, p. 204</ref> In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with the company [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division.

Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] developed the idea to form an organization to produce ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\".<ref name=\"davis125126\" />\n\n''Sesame Street'' premiered as a series on [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the \"CTW model\". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.\n\nAfter ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppets]] accounted for $15\u201317 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement.\n\nOn June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop<ref>http://www.sesameworkshop.org/about-us/leadership-team/joan-ganz-cooney/</ref> to better represent its activities beyond television, and [[Gary Knell]] became CEO. [[H. Melvin Ming]] replaced Knell in 2011. In 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nDuring the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hellman | first = Peter | title = Street Smart: How Big Bird & Company Do It | journal = New York Magazine | volume = 20 | issue = 46 | page = 52 | date = 23 November 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KOUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&vq=sesame+street&q=sesame%20street | issn = 0028-7369 | accessdate = 18 November 2019}}</ref> Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively.

They hired [[Evelyn Payne Davis]] from the [[Urban League]], whom Michael Davis called \"remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable\",<ref>Davis, p. 154</ref> as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and manager of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.<ref name=\"lesser-39\" /> Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new series, both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention concerning ''Sesame Street'' during its first year of production.<ref>Lesser, p. 40</ref>\n\nAccording to Davis, despite her involvement with the project's initial research and development, Cooney's installment as CTW's executive director was questionable due to her lack of executive experience, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience with children's television and education.

Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget.<ref>Davis, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>  By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.<ref name=\"guthrie2\"/>\n\n[[File:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, thin man in his early fifties, with salty-gray hair and a full beard, and wearing a tuxedo.|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[the Muppets]], in 1989]]\n\nFor the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money.

The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref>Davis, p. 204</ref> In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with the company [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division.

He was later hired as a full-time writer for humorist [[Herb Shriner]], initially earning $25 a week.<ref name=\"timemag\" /> He began writing scripts for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen|The Tonight Show]]'', specials for Sid Caesar post-''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' (1954\u20131957), and other television shows.<ref name=\"Lax Bio\" />{{sup|p.111}} By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''The New York Times''{{'}}s [[Arthur Gelb]] described Allen's nebbish quality as [[Charlie Chaplin|\"Chaplinesque\"]] and \"refreshing\".\n\nAllen developed an anxious, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television.

Feldman]] production ''[[What's New, Pussycat?]]'' (1965), for which he wrote the screenplay. He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film he wrote thereafter except ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]''.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie\u2014''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), \"International Secret Police: Key of Keys\"\u2014was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].<ref name=\"Liebenson\">{{cite web |last1=Liebenson |first1=Donald |title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen's Anhedonia |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman |website=vanityfair.com |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |date=April 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"partners\">{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt |last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia |title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 31, 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-317-41792-7|pages=37\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton.

''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes Keaton wore in the film. In an interview with journalist [[Katie Couric]], Keaton did not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.<ref name=Couric>{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|\"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric\"}}, video interview, 2 min.</ref> The film is ranked 35th on the ''[[American Film Institute]]''{{'s}} \"100 Best Movies\" and fourth on the AFI list of the \"100 Best Comedies.\"\n\n''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

In 1989 Allen and directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] made ''[[New York Stories]]'', an [[anthology film]] about New Yorkers.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

His first great success was ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'', which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', which opened in 1969, starring Allen and [[Diane Keaton]]. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]], although none of the nominations were for Allen's writing or acting.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2849 |title=Internet Broadway Database: Play It Again, Sam Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb |date=March 14, 1970 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably ''[[God (play)|God]]'' and ''[[Death (play)|Death]]'', which were published in his 1975 collection ''[[Without Feathers]]''. In 1981 Allen's play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'' opened on Broadway. It was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two [[Tony Award]] nominations, a Tony win for the acting of [[Brian Backer]] (who won the 1981 [[Theater World Award]] and a [[Drama Desk Award]] for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4112 |title=Internet Broadway Database: The Floating Light Bulb Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theatre in 1995 with the one-act ''Central Park West'', an installment in an evening of theatre, ''Death Defying Acts'', that also included new work by [[David Mamet]] and [[Elaine May]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |title=Death Defying Acts and No One Shall Be Immune \u2013 David Mamet Society |publisher=Mamet.eserver.org |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224171536/http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |archive-date=February 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the next few years Allen had no direct involvement with the stage, but notable productions of his work were staged.

She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''The New York Times''{{'}}s [[Arthur Gelb]] described Allen's nebbish quality as [[Charlie Chaplin|\"Chaplinesque\"]] and \"refreshing\".\n\nAllen developed an anxious, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996).

During the run she and Allen became romantically involved.

She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

These early works of Gibson's have been credited with \"renovating\" science fiction literature in the 1980s.\n\nAfter expanding on the story in ''Neuromancer'' with two more novels (''[[Count Zero]]'' in 1986, and ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'' in 1988), thus completing the [[dystopic]] [[Sprawl trilogy|''Sprawl'' trilogy]], Gibson collaborated with [[Bruce Sterling]] on the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre known as ''[[steampunk]]''. \n\nIn the 1990s, Gibson composed the [[Bridge trilogy|''Bridge'' trilogy]] of novels, which explored the [[sociological]] developments of near-future urban environments, [[postindustrial society]], and [[late capitalism]]. Following the turn of the century and the events of [[9/11]], Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly [[Literary realism|realist]] novels\u2014''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'' (2003), ''[[Spook Country]]'' (2007), and ''[[Zero History]]'' (2010)\u2014set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream [[Bestseller|bestseller lists]] for the first time. His most recent novels, ''[[The Peripheral]]'' (2014) and [[Agency (novel)|''Agency'']] (2020), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction themes.\n\nIn 1999, ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK) described Gibson as \"probably the most important novelist of the past two decades,\" while the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' (Australia) called him the \"noir prophet\" of cyberpunk.<ref name=\"smh2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/books/a-reality-stranger-than-fiction/2007/09/06/1188783376158.html|title=A reality stranger than fiction|last=Bennie|first=Angela|date=September 7, 2007|website=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=January 21, 2008}}</ref> Throughout his career, Gibson has written more than 20 short stories and 10 critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), contributed articles to several major publications, and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers, and musicians.

This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates from somewhere in the 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs slightly less than the [[Macintosh SE/30]] I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black \"crackle\" paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 was one of the best portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.</blockquote>\n{{refend}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=isfdb>\n{{isfdb name |172}} ('''ISFDB''').

These early works of Gibson's have been credited with \"renovating\" science fiction literature in the 1980s.\n\nAfter expanding on the story in ''Neuromancer'' with two more novels (''[[Count Zero]]'' in 1986, and ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'' in 1988), thus completing the [[dystopic]] [[Sprawl trilogy|''Sprawl'' trilogy]], Gibson collaborated with [[Bruce Sterling]] on the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre known as ''[[steampunk]]''. \n\nIn the 1990s, Gibson composed the [[Bridge trilogy|''Bridge'' trilogy]] of novels, which explored the [[sociological]] developments of near-future urban environments, [[postindustrial society]], and [[late capitalism]]. Following the turn of the century and the events of [[9/11]], Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly [[Literary realism|realist]] novels\u2014''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'' (2003), ''[[Spook Country]]'' (2007), and ''[[Zero History]]'' (2010)\u2014set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream [[Bestseller|bestseller lists]] for the first time. His most recent novels, ''[[The Peripheral]]'' (2014) and [[Agency (novel)|''Agency'']] (2020), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction themes.\n\nIn 1999, ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK) described Gibson as \"probably the most important novelist of the past two decades,\" while the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' (Australia) called him the \"noir prophet\" of cyberpunk.<ref name=\"smh2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/books/a-reality-stranger-than-fiction/2007/09/06/1188783376158.html|title=A reality stranger than fiction|last=Bennie|first=Angela|date=September 7, 2007|website=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=January 21, 2008}}</ref> Throughout his career, Gibson has written more than 20 short stories and 10 critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), contributed articles to several major publications, and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers, and musicians.

This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates from somewhere in the 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs slightly less than the [[Macintosh SE/30]] I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black \"crackle\" paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 was one of the best portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.</blockquote>\n{{refend}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=isfdb>\n{{isfdb name |172}} ('''ISFDB''').

Adapted by [[William Goldman]] from his 1973 novel ''[[The Princess Bride (novel)|The Princess Bride]]'', it tells the story of a farmhand named Westley, accompanied by companions befriended along the way, who must rescue his true love Princess Buttercup from the odious Prince Humperdinck. The film essentially preserves the novel's narrative style by presenting the story as a book being read by a grandfather ([[Peter Falk]]) to his sick grandson ([[Fred Savage]]).\n\nThe film was first released in the United States on September 25, 1987,<ref name=HR/> and was well-received by critics at the time, but was only a modest box office success. Over time the film has become a [[cult classic]].<ref name=\"our-time\"/> The film is number 50 on the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s \"100 Funniest Movies\", number 88 on The [[American Film Institute]]'s (AFI) \"[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]]\" list of the 100 greatest film love stories, and 46 in [[Channel 4]]'s 50 Greatest Comedy Films list.<ref>{{cite web | title=50 Greatest Comedy Films | url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/50-greatest-comedy-films | date=January 27, 2010 | work=Channel4.com | publisher=Channel 4 | accessdate=October 30, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104165534/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/50-greatest-comedy-films | archive-date=November 4, 2011 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2016, the film was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]], being deemed as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web |date= December 14, 2016 |author= Camila Domonoske |title= 'Lion King,' 'Princess Bride,' 'The Birds' Among Additions To Film Registry |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/14/505556002/lion-king-princess-bride-the-birds-among-additions-to-film-registry |website= NPR.org |accessdate= December 15, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131509/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/14/505556002/lion-king-princess-bride-the-birds-among-additions-to-film-registry |archive-date= December 1, 2017 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is an enactment of a book read to a sick boy from [[Chicago]], who is initially dismissive of the story, by his grandfather, with occasional interruptions of the scenes in this [[frame story]].\n\nA beautiful young woman named Buttercup lives on a farm in the fictional country of Florin. Whenever she instructs the farmhand Westley, he complies and answers, \"As you wish.\" She eventually realizes that he truly means \"I love you\" and that she loves him in return. He leaves to seek his fortune so they can marry, but his ship is attacked by the [[Dread Pirate Roberts]], who is infamous for never leaving survivors, and Westley is believed dead.\n\nFive years later, Buttercup is forced into marriage to Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a short [[Sicilian people|Sicilian]] boss named Vizzini, a giant from [[Greenland]] named Fezzik, and a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[fencing]] master named [[Inigo Montoya]], who seeks revenge against a six-fingered man who killed his father. The outlaws are pursued separately by a masked man in black and Prince Humperdinck with a complement of soldiers.\n\nThe man in black catches up to the outlaws at the top of the Cliffs of Insanity. He defeats Inigo in a duel and knocks him unconscious, chokes Fezzik until he passes out, and kills Vizzini by tricking him into drinking from a cup containing poison. He takes Buttercup prisoner and they flee, stopping to rest at the edge of a gorge. When Buttercup correctly guesses that he is the Dread Pirate Roberts she becomes enraged at him for killing Westley. When Buttercup sees Humperdinck and his men appearing, she shoves Roberts down a hill and wishes death upon him. As he tumbles down, he shouts, \"As you wish!\" Realizing Roberts is Westley, she throws herself into the gorge after him and they are reunited. Westley explains the Dread Pirate Roberts is actually a title passed on by subsequent holders: he had taken the title so the previous Roberts could retire. They pass through the dangerous Fire Swamp, which is inhabited by rodents of unusual size (ROUS), but are captured as they leave by Humperdinck and his sadistic [[vizier]] Count Rugen, who is revealed to be Inigo's father's killer. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck in exchange for Westley's release, but Humperdinck secretly orders Rugen to lock Westley in his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair.\n\nWhen Buttercup expresses unhappiness at marrying Humperdinck, he promises to search for Westley. However, his real plan is to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder by killing Buttercup and framing Guilder for her death (he had hired Vizzini to kill her for that same purpose). Meanwhile, Inigo and Fezzik reunite when Humperdinck orders the thieves arrested in the nearby forest, and Fezzik tells Inigo about Rugen. Inigo decides that they need Westley's help to get into the castle. Buttercup berates Humperdinck after learning that he has not tried to find Westley; enraged, Humperdinck imprisons Buttercup in her chambers, and tortures Westley to death. Inigo and Fezzik follow the cries of anguish through the forest. They find Westley's body and bring him to a [[folk healer]], Miracle Max, whom Humperdinck has recently fired. He discovers that Westley is only \"mostly dead\" due to being sustained by his love for Buttercup, and revives him to a state of heavy paralysis.\n\nAfter Westley, Inigo and Fezzik invade the castle, Humperdinck panics and orders the wedding ceremony shortened. Inigo finds and kills Rugen in a duel, repeatedly taunting him with his greeting of vengeance: \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\" Westley finds Buttercup, who is about to commit suicide, assuring her that the marriage is invalid because she never said \"I do\". Still partly paralyzed, he bluffs his way out of a duel with Humperdinck and they flee the castle. Westley rides away with Buttercup, Inigo and Fezzik before sharing a passionate kiss with Buttercup.\n\nBack in the boy's bedroom, the boy eagerly asks his grandfather to read the story to him again the next day, to which the grandfather replies, \"As you wish.\"\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Framing story===\n* [[Peter Falk]] as Grandpa/The Narrator\n* [[Fred Savage]] as The Grandson\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as The Mother\n\n===Main story===\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Westley/[[Dread Pirate Roberts]]/The Man in Black\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Buttercup/The Princess Bride\n* [[Mandy Patinkin]] as [[Inigo Montoya]]\n* [[Chris Sarandon]] as Prince Humperdinck\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Count Tyrone Rugen\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Vizzini\n* [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] as Fezzik\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Miracle Max\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Valerie, Max's wife\n* [[Peter Cook]] as The Impressive Clergyman\n* [[Mel Smith]] as The Albino\n* [[Margery Mason]] as The Ancient Booer\n* [[Malcolm Storry]] as Yellin, a soldier of Florin\n* [[Willoughby Gray]] as The King\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nRob Reiner, who had been enamored with Goldman's book ever since he was given it as a gift from his father, [[Carl Reiner]], realized he wanted to make the film adaptation after successfully demonstrating his filmmaking skill with the release of ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\"variety 30th\">{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/features/the-princess-bride-turns-30-1202565060/ | title = 'The Princess Bride' Turns 30: Rob Reiner, Robin Wright, Billy Crystal Dish About Making the Cult Classic | first = Susan | last = King | date = September 24, 2017 | accessdate = December 29, 2017 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171230114650/http://variety.com/2017/film/features/the-princess-bride-turns-30-1202565060/ | archive-date = December 30, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> During production of ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', released in 1986, Reiner had spoken to an executive at [[Paramount Pictures]] regarding what his next film would be, and suggested the adaptation of ''The Princess Bride''.

Though initially shy, Wright impressed Jenkins, and later Reiner. They invited Wright to come meet Goldman at his house. Jenkins recalls: \"The doorbell rang. Rob went to the door, and literally, as he opened the door, [Wright] was standing there in this little white summer dress, with her long blonde hair, and she had a halo from the sun. She was backlit by God. And Bill Goldman looked across the room at her, and he said, 'Well, that's what I wrote.'

Goldman's second choice was [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who at that time was almost unknown as an actor. However, by the time ''The Princess Bride'' was finally green-lit, Schwarzenegger was a major film star and the studio could not afford him. Jenkins contacted the [[World Wrestling Federation]] to ask about hiring Andre, but were told that the filming conflicted with a wrestling match in Tokyo that would pay him $5 million. Jenkins auditioned other tall men, including [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Lou Ferrigno]] and [[Carel Struycken]], but these did not pan out. Near the end of casting, the World Wrestling Federation told Jenkins that Andre's match in Tokyo had been cancelled, clearing him to play the role of Fezzik.<ref name=\"vice casting\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Cliffs of Moher, looking north.jpg|thumb|The [[establishing shot]] of the Cliffs of Insanity is the [[Cliffs of Moher]] in [[County Clare]], Ireland.]]\nThe film was shot in various locations in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] in late 1986:<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1987/03/the-princess-bride-1987/|title=Kent Film Office The Princess Bride Film Focus}}</ref>\n* [[Carl Wark]], Sheffield, England\n* [[Burnham Beeches]], Buckinghamshire, England\n* [[River Lathkill|Lathkill Dale]] where it meets Cales Dale (the 'Battle of wits' scene)\n* [[Cave Dale]], [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]], Derbyshire, England\n* Bradley Rocks and [[Robin Hood's Stride]], Birchover, Derbyshire, England\n* [[Cliffs of Moher]], [[County Clare]], Ireland (for the Cliffs of Insanity)\n* [[Haddon Hall]], [[Bakewell]], Derbyshire, England\n* [[Penshurst Place]], [[Kent]], England\n\nThe framing story scenes, the last to be filmed, were recorded at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Surrey]].<ref name=\"variety 30th\"/>\n\nReiner rented a house in England near these sites and frequently invited the cast over for meals and light-hearted get-togethers.

Reiner was an admirer of Knopfler's work but did not know him before working on the film. He sent the script to him hoping he would agree to score the film. Knopfler agreed on one condition: that somewhere in the film Reiner would include the {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43}} baseball cap (which had been modified to say \"USS Ooral Sea OV-4B\") he wore as Marty DiBergi in ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''. Reiner was unable to produce the original cap, but did include a similar cap in the grandson's room.

Princess Bride''''' is a 1987 American [[fantasy]] [[adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] directed and co-produced by [[Rob Reiner]], starring [[Cary Elwes]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Mandy Patinkin]], [[Chris Sarandon]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], and [[Christopher Guest]]. Adapted by [[William Goldman]] from his 1973 novel ''[[The Princess Bride (novel)|The Princess Bride]]'', it tells the story of a farmhand named Westley, accompanied by companions befriended along the way, who must rescue his true love Princess Buttercup from the odious Prince Humperdinck. The film essentially preserves the novel's narrative style by presenting the story as a book being read by a grandfather ([[Peter Falk]]) to his sick grandson ([[Fred Savage]]).\n\nThe film was first released in the United States on September 25, 1987,<ref name=HR/> and was well-received by critics at the time, but was only a modest box office success.

Whenever she instructs the farmhand Westley, he complies and answers, \"As you wish.\" She eventually realizes that he truly means \"I love you\" and that she loves him in return. He leaves to seek his fortune so they can marry, but his ship is attacked by the [[Dread Pirate Roberts]], who is infamous for never leaving survivors, and Westley is believed dead.\n\nFive years later, Buttercup is forced into marriage to Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a short [[Sicilian people|Sicilian]] boss named Vizzini, a giant from [[Greenland]] named Fezzik, and a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[fencing]] master named [[Inigo Montoya]], who seeks revenge against a six-fingered man who killed his father. The outlaws are pursued separately by a masked man in black and Prince Humperdinck with a complement of soldiers.\n\nThe man in black catches up to the outlaws at the top of the Cliffs of Insanity. He defeats Inigo in a duel and knocks him unconscious, chokes Fezzik until he passes out, and kills Vizzini by tricking him into drinking from a cup containing poison. He takes Buttercup prisoner and they flee, stopping to rest at the edge of a gorge. When Buttercup correctly guesses that he is the Dread Pirate Roberts she becomes enraged at him for killing Westley. When Buttercup sees Humperdinck and his men appearing, she shoves Roberts down a hill and wishes death upon him. As he tumbles down, he shouts, \"As you wish!\" Realizing Roberts is Westley, she throws herself into the gorge after him and they are reunited. Westley explains the Dread Pirate Roberts is actually a title passed on by subsequent holders: he had taken the title so the previous Roberts could retire. They pass through the dangerous Fire Swamp, which is inhabited by rodents of unusual size (ROUS), but are captured as they leave by Humperdinck and his sadistic [[vizier]] Count Rugen, who is revealed to be Inigo's father's killer. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck in exchange for Westley's release, but Humperdinck secretly orders Rugen to lock Westley in his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair.\n\nWhen Buttercup expresses unhappiness at marrying Humperdinck, he promises to search for Westley. However, his real plan is to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder by killing Buttercup and framing Guilder for her death (he had hired Vizzini to kill her for that same purpose). Meanwhile, Inigo and Fezzik reunite when Humperdinck orders the thieves arrested in the nearby forest, and Fezzik tells Inigo about Rugen. Inigo decides that they need Westley's help to get into the castle. Buttercup berates Humperdinck after learning that he has not tried to find Westley; enraged, Humperdinck imprisons Buttercup in her chambers, and tortures Westley to death. Inigo and Fezzik follow the cries of anguish through the forest. They find Westley's body and bring him to a [[folk healer]], Miracle Max, whom Humperdinck has recently fired. He discovers that Westley is only \"mostly dead\" due to being sustained by his love for Buttercup, and revives him to a state of heavy paralysis.\n\nAfter Westley, Inigo and Fezzik invade the castle, Humperdinck panics and orders the wedding ceremony shortened. Inigo finds and kills Rugen in a duel, repeatedly taunting him with his greeting of vengeance: \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\" Westley finds Buttercup, who is about to commit suicide, assuring her that the marriage is invalid because she never said \"I do\". Still partly paralyzed, he bluffs his way out of a duel with Humperdinck and they flee the castle. Westley rides away with Buttercup, Inigo and Fezzik before sharing a passionate kiss with Buttercup.\n\nBack in the boy's bedroom, the boy eagerly asks his grandfather to read the story to him again the next day, to which the grandfather replies, \"As you wish.\"\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Framing story===\n* [[Peter Falk]] as Grandpa/The Narrator\n* [[Fred Savage]] as The Grandson\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as The Mother\n\n===Main story===\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Westley/[[Dread Pirate Roberts]]/The Man in Black\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Buttercup/The Princess Bride\n* [[Mandy Patinkin]] as [[Inigo Montoya]]\n* [[Chris Sarandon]] as Prince Humperdinck\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Count Tyrone Rugen\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Vizzini\n* [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] as Fezzik\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Miracle Max\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Valerie, Max's wife\n* [[Peter Cook]] as The Impressive Clergyman\n* [[Mel Smith]] as The Albino\n* [[Margery Mason]] as The Ancient Booer\n* [[Malcolm Storry]] as Yellin, a soldier of Florin\n* [[Willoughby Gray]] as The King\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nRob Reiner, who had been enamored with Goldman's book ever since he was given it as a gift from his father, [[Carl Reiner]], realized he wanted to make the film adaptation after successfully demonstrating his filmmaking skill with the release of ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\"variety 30th\">{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/features/the-princess-bride-turns-30-1202565060/ | title = 'The Princess Bride' Turns 30: Rob Reiner, Robin Wright, Billy Crystal Dish About Making the Cult Classic | first = Susan | last = King | date = September 24, 2017 | accessdate = December 29, 2017 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171230114650/http://variety.com/2017/film/features/the-princess-bride-turns-30-1202565060/ | archive-date = December 30, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> During production of ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', released in 1986, Reiner had spoken to an executive at [[Paramount Pictures]] regarding what his next film would be, and suggested the adaptation of ''The Princess Bride''.

Though initially shy, Wright impressed Jenkins, and later Reiner. They invited Wright to come meet Goldman at his house. Jenkins recalls: \"The doorbell rang. Rob went to the door, and literally, as he opened the door, [Wright] was standing there in this little white summer dress, with her long blonde hair, and she had a halo from the sun. She was backlit by God. And Bill Goldman looked across the room at her, and he said, 'Well, that's what I wrote.' It was the most perfect thing.\"<ref name=\"vice casting\"/>\n\nMandy Patinkin and Wallace Shawn were early choices for the cast; Shawn in particular was chosen as Vizzini due to his diminutive size to contrast that of the giant Fezzik.<ref name=\"vice casting\"/>\n\nWhen Goldman originally shopped his novel in the early 1970s, his first choice for Fezzik was Andre the Giant, whose wrestling schedule left him unavailable for filming. Goldman's second choice was [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who at that time was almost unknown as an actor. However, by the time ''The Princess Bride'' was finally green-lit, Schwarzenegger was a major film star and the studio could not afford him.

Its format is divided into a number of recurring segments such as TV and movie parodies, as well as freeform articles. ''Mad''{{'}}s mascot, [[Alfred E. Neuman]], is typically the focal point of the magazine's cover, with his face often replacing that of a celebrity or character who is lampooned within the issue.\n\nFrom 1952 until 2018, ''Mad'' published 550 regular issues, as well as hundreds of reprint \"Specials\", original-material paperbacks, reprint compilation books and other print projects. The magazine's numbering reverted to 1 with its June 2018 issue, coinciding with the magazine's headquarters move to the West Coast. In July 2019, it was widely reported that ''Mad'' would end its newsstand distribution after 67 years and be available only through the direct market and subscriptions. Future issues will primarily consist of reprinted material from the magazine's archive.<ref>{{cite news |mode=cs2 |author = Beresford, Trilby | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mad-magazine-effectively-close-67-years-1222636 | title = MAD Magazine to Effectively Shutter After 67 Years | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = July 3, 2019| accessdate = July 3, 2019}}; {{cite news |mode=cs2 |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/07/04/738767035/satirical-staple-mad-to-exit-newsstands-and-recycle-its-classic-material |title='Mad' Magazine to End Sales On Newsstands, Move to Reruns |work=[[NPR]] |author=Ulaby, Neda |date=July 4, 2019 |accessdate=July 6, 2019}}.</ref> MAD would ultimately satirize people's beliefs that the magazine would actually come to an end in issue #11 (December 2019) as part of its \"20 Dumbest People, Events, and Things of 2019\" feature of that issue: As such, the magazine still would utilize a handful of archived content in future issues, while also retaining an amount of new bimonthly content.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Mad|Harvey Kurtzman's editorship of Mad}}\n[[File:Madhk1.jpg|thumb|[[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s cover for ''Mad'' #1 (Oct\u2013Nov 1952)]]\n[[File:Mad24.JPG|thumb|With issue 24 (July 1955), ''Mad'' switched to a magazine format. The \"extremely important message\" was \"Please buy this magazine!\"]]\n''Mad'' began as a comic book published by [[EC Comics|EC]], debuting in August 1952 ([[cover date]] October\u2013November). The ''Mad'' office was initially located in [[lower Manhattan]] at 225 Lafayette Street, while in the early 1960s it moved to 485 [[Madison Avenue]], the location listed in the magazine as \"485 MADison Avenue\".\n\nThe first issue was written almost entirely by [[Harvey Kurtzman]], and featured illustrations by him, [[Wally Wood]], [[Will Elder]], [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]], and [[John Severin]]. Wood, Elder, and Davis were to be the three main illustrators throughout the 23-issue run of the comic book.\n\nTo retain Kurtzman as its editor, the comic book converted to magazine format as of issue #24, in 1955. The switchover induced Kurtzman to remain for one more year, but the move had removed ''Mad'' from the strictures of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. [[William Gaines]] related in 1992 that ''Mad'' \"was not changed [into a magazine] to avoid the Code\" but \"as a result of this [change of format] it ''did'' avoid the Code.\"<ref name=gaines>{{cite journal |last=Riggenberg |first=Steve|date=1992 |title=An Interview with [[William Gaines|William M.

Gaines further stated that \"if Harvey [Kurtzman] had not gotten that offer from ''Pageant'', ''Mad'' probably would not have changed format.\"<ref name=gaines/>\n\nAfter Kurtzman's departure in 1956, new editor [[Al Feldstein]] swiftly brought aboard contributors such as [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]], [[Frank Jacobs]], and [[Mort Drucker]], and later [[Antonio Proh\u00edas]], [[Dave Berg (cartoonist)|Dave Berg]], and [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]]. The magazine's circulation more than quadrupled during Feldstein's tenure, peaking at 2,132,655 in 1974; it later declined to a third of this figure by the end of his time as editor.<ref name=slau>{{cite web|url=http://users.pfw.edu/slaubau/mad/madcirculation.htm|author=Slaubaugh, Mike|title=''Mad Magazine'' circulation figures|work=IPFW|accessdate=February 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315224710/http://users.ipfw.edu/slaubau/madcirc.htm|archive-date=March 15, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn its earliest incarnation, new issues of the magazine appeared erratically, between four and seven times a year. By the end of 1958, ''Mad'' had settled on an unusual eight-times-a-year schedule,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=MAD|date=November 1958|volume=1|issue=42|page=1|quote=MAD \u2013 November 1958, Volume I, Number 42, is published monthly except January, April, July and October ...|title=MAD}}</ref> which lasted almost four decades.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=MAD|date=May 1995|issue=335|page=2|quote=MAD ... is published monthly except bimonthly for January/February, March/April, July/August and October/November ...|title=MAD}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=MAD|date=June 1995|issue=336|page=2| quote = MAD ... is published monthly except bimonthly for January/February, March/April and October/November ...|title=MAD}}</ref> Issues would go on sale 7 to 9 weeks before the start of the month listed on the cover. Gaines felt the atypical timing was necessary to maintain the magazine's level of quality. Beginning in 1994, ''Mad'' then began incrementally producing additional issues per year, until it reached a traditional monthly schedule with the January 1997 issue.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=MAD|date=December 1996|issue=352|page=2|quote=MAD ... is published monthly except bimonthly for January/February ...|title=MAD }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=MAD|date=January 1997|issue=353|page=2|quote = MAD ... is published monthly by E.

Long-time production artist Lenny \"The Beard\" Brenner was promoted to art director and [[Joe Raiola]] and [[Charlie Kadau]] joined the staff as junior editors. Following Gaines's death in 1992, ''Mad'' became more ingrained within the Time Warner (now [[WarnerMedia]]) corporate structure. Eventually, the magazine was obliged to abandon its long-time home at 485 Madison Avenue and in the mid-1990s it moved into DC Comics' offices at the same time that DC relocated to 1700 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. In issue #403 of March 2001, the magazine broke its long-standing taboo and began running paid advertising. The outside revenue allowed the introduction of color printing and improved paper stock. After Meglin retired in 2004, the team of Ficarra (as executive editor) Raiola and Kadau (now senior editors), and [[Sam Viviano]], who had taken over as art director in 1999, would helm ''Mad'' for the next 18 years.\n\nThroughout the years, ''Mad'' remained a unique mix of adolescent silliness and political humor. In November 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that \"operating under the cover of barf jokes, ''Mad'' has become America\u2019s best political satire magazine.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/the-hot-list-2017-the-people-and-trends-were-talking-about-the-most-123532/hot-pivot-mad-magazine-122636/|access-date=November 3, 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |title=The Hot List 2017: The People and Trends We\u2019re Talking About the Most}}</ref> Nevertheless, ''Mad'' ended its 550-issue, 65-year run in Manhattan at the end of 2017, when its offices relocated to DC Entertainment headquarters in [[Burbank, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomrichmond.com/2017/12/12/new-york-is-mad-no-more/|title=Richmond Illustration Inc.|website=www.tomrichmond.com}}</ref> None of ''Mad''{{'}}s veteran New York staff made the move, resulting in a change in editorial leadership, tone, and art direction.

Throughout the 1950s, ''Mad'' featured groundbreaking parodies combining a sentimental fondness for the familiar staples of American culture\u2014such as [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie]] and [[Superman]]\u2014with a keen joy in exposing the fakery behind the image. Its approach was described by [[Dave Kehr]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \"[[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]] and [[Ray Goulding]] on the radio, [[Ernie Kovacs]] on television, [[Stan Freberg]] on records, [[Harvey Kurtzman]] in the early issues of ''Mad'': all of those pioneering humorists and many others realized that the real world mattered less to people than the sea of sounds and images that the ever more powerful mass media were pumping into American lives.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1D7173EF933A1575BC0A9609C8B63 |last=Kehr|first= Dave|title=When Unmanly Men Met Womanly Women |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 20, 2006 |access-date= February 2, 2011}}</ref> [[Bob and Ray]], Kovacs and Freberg all became contributors to ''Mad''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madcoversite.com/ugoi-master.html|title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - Mad Magazine Contributors - Master List|website=MadCoverSite.com|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Tony Hiss and Jeff Lewis wrote in ''The New York Times'' about the then-25-year-old publication's initial effect:\n\n{{quote|The skeptical generation of kids it shaped in the 1950s is the same generation that, in the 1960s, opposed a war and didn't feel bad when the United States lost for the first time and in the 1970s helped turn out an Administration and didn't feel bad about that either ... It was magical, objective proof to kids that they weren't alone, that in New York City on Lafayette Street, if nowhere else, there were people who knew that there was something wrong, phony and funny about a world of bomb shelters, brinkmanship and toothpaste smiles. ''Mad''{{'}}s consciousness of itself, as trash, as comic book, as enemy of parents and teachers, even as money-making enterprise, thrilled kids. In 1955, such consciousness was possibly nowhere else to be found. In a ''Mad'' parody, comic-strip characters knew they were stuck in a strip. \"Darnold Duck,\" for example, begins wondering why he has only three fingers and has to wear white gloves all the time. He ends up wanting to murder every other Disney character. G.I. Schmoe tries to win the sexy Asiatic Red Army broad by telling her, \"O.K., baby! You're all mine!

Neuman===\n[[File:MAD Magazine (no. 21, front cover).jpg|right|324px|thumb|First cover appearance (issue 21, March 1955) of Alfred E. Neuman in a fake advertisement satirizing the popular mail-order house [[Johnson Smith Company]]]]\n{{Main|Alfred E. Neuman}}\nThe image most closely associated with the magazine is that of [[Alfred E. Neuman]], the boy with misaligned eyes, a [[Maxillary central incisor|gap-toothed]] smile, and the perennial motto \"What, me worry?\" The original image was a popular humorous graphic for many decades before ''Mad'' adopted it, but the face is now primarily associated with ''Mad''.\n\n''Mad'' initially used the boy's face in November 1954. His first iconic full-cover appearance was as a write-in candidate for President on issue #30 (December 1956), in which he was identified by name and sported his \"What, me worry?\" motto. He has since appeared in a slew of guises and comic situations. According to ''Mad'' writer Frank Jacobs, a letter was once successfully delivered to the magazine through the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. mail]] bearing only Neuman's face, without any address or other identifying information.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Legal disputes==\nThe magazine has been involved in various legal actions over the decades, some of which have reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The most far-reaching was ''[[Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc.|Irving Berlin et al. v. E.C. Publications, Inc.]]'' In 1961, a group of music publishers representing songwriters such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Richard Rodgers]], and [[Cole Porter]] filed a $25&nbsp;million lawsuit against ''Mad'' for [[copyright infringement]] following \"Sing Along With ''Mad''\", a collection of parody lyrics which the magazine said could be \"sung to the tune of\" many popular songs. The publishing group hoped to establish a legal precedent that only a song's composers retained the right to parody that song. Judge Charles Metzner of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled largely in favor of ''Mad'' in 1963, affirming its right to print 23 of the 25 song parodies under dispute. However, in the case of two parodies, \"Always\" (sung to the tune of \"[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]\") and \"There's No Business Like No Business\" (sung to the tune of \"[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]\"), Judge Metzner decided that the issue of [[copyright infringement]] was closer, requiring a trial because in each case the parodies relied on the same verbal hooks (\"always\" and \"business\") as the originals. The music publishers appealed the ruling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals not only upheld the pro-''Mad'' decision in regard to the 23 songs, it adopted an approach that was broad enough to strip the publishers of their limited victory regarding the remaining two songs. Writing a unanimous opinion for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], Circuit Judge [[Irving Kaufman]] observed, \"We doubt that even so eminent a composer as plaintiff Irving Berlin should be permitted to claim a property interest in [[iambic pentameter]].\"<ref name=\"mcir_Musi\">{{cite web | title =  Music Copyright Infringement Resource \u2013 Sponsored By USC Gould School of Law |work = mcir.usc.edu |accessdate = January 17, 2015 | url = http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/1960-1969/Pages/berlinecpublications.html}}</ref> The publishers again appealed, but the Supreme Court refused to hear it, thus allowing the decision to stand.<ref name=jac>Jacobs, Frank.

However, the \"Sing Along With ''Mad''\" songbook was not the magazine's first venture into musical parody. In 1960, ''Mad'' had published \"My Fair Ad-Man\", a full advertising-based spoof of the hit Broadway musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. In 1959, \"If [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert & Sullivan]] wrote ''[[Dick Tracy]]''\" was one of the speculative pairings in \"If Famous Authors Wrote the Comics\".\n\nIn 1966, a series of copyright infringement lawsuits against the magazine regarding ownership of the [[Alfred E. Neuman]] image eventually reached the appellate level. Although Harry Stuff had copyrighted the image in 1914, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that, by allowing many copies of the image to circulate without any copyright notice, the owner of the copyright had allowed the image to pass into the public domain, thus establishing the right of ''Mad''\u2014or anyone else for that matter\u2014to use the image. In addition, ''Mad'' established that Stuff was not himself the creator of the image by producing numerous other examples dating back to the late 19th century. This decision was also allowed to stand.<ref name=maria>Reidelbach, Maria. ''Completely Mad'', New York: Little Brown, 1991. {{ISBN|0-316-73890-5}}</ref>\n\nOther legal disputes were settled more easily. Following the magazine's parody of the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', a letter from [[George Lucas]]'s lawyers arrived in ''Mad'''s offices demanding that the issue be recalled for infringement on copyrighted figures. The letter further demanded that the printing plates be destroyed, and that [[Lucasfilm]] must receive all revenue from the issue plus additional punitive damages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/mad-about-star-wars|title=MAD about Star Wars|date=June 23, 2014|website=StarWars.com}}</ref> Unbeknownst to Lucas' lawyers, ''Mad'' had received a letter days earlier from Lucas himself, expressing delight over the parody and calling artist [[Mort Drucker]] and writer [[Dick DeBartolo]] \"the [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] of comic satire.\"<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=mS-OOULG_IcC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=debartolo+lucas+lawyer+star+bores#v=onepage&q=debartolo%20lucas%20lawyer%20star%20bores&f=false | title=Mad About Star Wars| isbn=9780345501646| last1=Bresman| first1=Jonathan| year=2007}}</ref> Publisher Bill Gaines made a copy of Lucas' letter, added the handwritten notation \"Gee, your boss George liked it!\" across the top, and mailed it to the lawyers.

For decades, it was the most successful American magazine to publish ad-free,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119524101/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105083729/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119524101/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 5, 2013 |title=Mad Economics: An Analysis of an Adless Magazine |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1984.tb02984.x |date=February 7, 2006 |accessdate= February 2, 2011 |volume=34 |journal=Journal of Communication |pages=44\u201361|last1=Norris |first1=Vincent P. }}</ref> beginning with issue #33 (April 1957) and continuing through issue #402 (February 2001).\n\nAs a comic book, ''Mad'' had run the same advertisements as the rest of EC's line. The magazine later made a deal with [[Moxie]] soda that involved inserting the Moxie logo into various articles. ''Mad'' ran a limited number of ads in its first two years as a magazine, helpfully labeled \"real advertisement\" to differentiate the real from the parodies. The last authentic ad published under the original ''Mad'' regime was for [[Famous Artists School]]; two issues later, the inside front cover of issue #34 had a parody of the same ad. After this transitional period, the only promotions to appear in ''Mad'' for decades were house ads for ''Mad'''s own books and specials, subscriptions, and promotional items such as ceramic busts, T-shirts, or a line of ''Mad'' jewelry. This rule was bent only a few times to promote outside products directly related to the magazine, such as [[Parker Brothers]] ''Mad Board Game'', the video game based on ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'', and the notorious ''[[Up the Academy]]'' movie (which the magazine later disowned). ''Mad'' explicitly promised that it would never make its mailing list available.\n\nBoth Kurtzman and Feldstein wanted the magazine to solicit advertising, feeling this could be accomplished without compromising ''Mad'''s content or editorial independence. Kurtzman remembered ''[[Ballyhoo (magazine)|Ballyhoo]]'', a boisterous 1930s humor publication that made an editorial point of mocking its own sponsors. Feldstein went so far as to propose an in-house ''Mad'' ad agency, and produced a \"dummy\" copy of what an issue with ads could look like. But Bill Gaines was intractable, telling the television news magazine ''[[60 Minutes]]'', \"We long ago decided we couldn't take money from Pepsi-Cola and make fun of Coca-Cola.\" Gaines' motivation in eschewing ad dollars was less philosophical than practical:\n\n{{quote|We'd have to improve our package. Most advertisers want to appear in a magazine that's loaded with color and has super-slick paper. So you find yourself being pushed into producing a more expensive package. You get bigger and fancier and attract more advertisers. Then you find you're losing some of your advertisers.

Writers such as [[Dick DeBartolo]], [[Stan Hart]], [[Frank Jacobs]], [[Tom Koch]], and [[Arnie Kogen]] appeared regularly in the magazine's pages. In several cases, only infirmity or death has ended a contributor's run at ''Mad.''\n\nWithin the industry, ''Mad'' was known for the uncommonly prompt manner in which its contributors were paid. Publisher Gaines would typically write a personal check and give it to the artist upon receipt of the finished product. Wally Wood said, \"I got spoiled ... Other publishers don't do that. I started to get upset if I had to wait a whole week for my check.\" Another lure for contributors was the annual \"Mad Trip\", an all-expenses-paid tradition that began in 1960. The editorial staff was automatically invited, along with freelancers who had qualified for an invitation by selling a set number of articles or pages during the previous year. Gaines was strict about enforcing this quota, and one year, longtime writer and frequent traveller Arnie Kogen was bumped off the list.

''Mad'' has been criticized{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} for its over-reliance on a core group of aging regulars throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and then criticized again{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} for an alleged downturn as those same creators began to leave, die, retire, or contribute less frequently.\n\nIt has been proposed that ''Mad'' is more susceptible to this criticism than many media because a sizable percentage of its readership turns over regularly as it ages, as ''Mad'' focuses greatly on current events and a changing popular culture.<ref name=\"jac\"/> In 2010, [[Sergio Aragones]] said, \"Mad is written by people who never thought 'Okay, I'm going to write for kids,' or 'I'm going to write for adults.' ... And many people say 'I used to read ''Mad'', but ''Mad'' has changed a lot.' Excuse me\u2014 you grew up! You have new interests. ...

On December 11, the first-ever letter complaining that ''Mad'' 'just isn't as funny and original like it used to be' arrives.\" The magazine's then art director, [[Sam Viviano]], suggested in 2002 that historically, ''Mad'' was at its best \"whenever you first started reading it.\"<ref>Evanier, Mark. ''Mad Art''. 2002. Watson-Guptill Publications. {{ISBN|0-8230-3080-6}}. p. 216.</ref> According to former ''Mad'' Senior Editor [[Joe Raiola]], \"''Mad'' is the only place in America where if you mature, you get fired.\"\n\nAmong the loudest of those who insist the magazine is no longer funny are supporters of [[Harvey Kurtzman]], who had the good critical fortune to leave ''Mad'' after just 28 issues, before his own formulaic tendencies might have become obtrusive. This also meant Kurtzman suffered the bad creative and financial timing of departing before the magazine became a runaway success.<ref name=\"That Old Feeling: Hail, Harvey!\"/>\n\nHowever, just how much of that success was due to the original Kurtzman template that he left for his successor, and how much should be credited to the [[Al Feldstein]] system and the depth of the post-Kurtzman talent pool, can be argued without resolution. In 2009, an interviewer proposed to [[Al Jaffee]], \"There's a group of ''Mad'' aficionados who feel that if Harvey Kurtzman had stayed at ''Mad'', the magazine would not only have been different, but better.\" Jaffee, a Kurtzman enthusiast, replied, \"And then there's a large group who feel that if Harvey had stayed with ''Mad'', he would have upgraded it to the point that only fifteen people would buy it.\"<ref>Sacks, Mike, \"And Here's the Kicker\", ''Writer's Digest' Books'', 2009, p. 222</ref> During Kurtzman's final two-plus years at EC, ''Mad'' appeared erratically (ten issues appeared in 1954, followed by eight issues in 1955 and four issues in 1956). Feldstein was less well regarded creatively, but kept the magazine on a regular schedule, leading to decades of success. (Kurtzman and [[Will Elder]] returned to ''Mad'' for a short time in the mid-1980s as an illustrating team.)\n\nThe magazine's sales peak came with issue #161 (September 1973), which sold 2.4 million copies in 1973. That period coincided with several other magazines' sales peaks, including ''[[TV Guide]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]''. ''Mad''{{'}}s circulation dropped below one million for the first time in 1983.\n\nMany of the magazine's mainstays began retiring or dying by the 1980s. Newer contributors who appeared in the years that followed include [[Joe Raiola]], [[Charlie Kadau]], [[Tony Barbieri]], Scott Bricher, [[Tom Bunk]], [[John Caldwell (cartoonist)|John Caldwell]], [[Desmond Devlin]], [[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew Friedman]], [[Barry Liebmann]], [[Kevin Pope (cartoonist)|Kevin Pope]], Scott Maiko, [[Hermann Mejia]], [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]], Andrew J.

However, [[Salon (website)|Salon]]'s David Futrelle opined that such content was very much a part of ''Mad''{{'}}s past:\n{{quote|The October 1971 issue, for example, with its war crimes fold-in and back cover \"mini-poster\" of \"The Four Horsemen of the Metropolis\" (Drugs, Graft, Pollution and Slums).

(\"It's a street of depression,/ Corruption, oppression!/ It's a sadist's dream come true!/ And masochists, too!\") With its \"This is America\" photo feature, contrasting images of heroic astronauts with graphic photos of dead soldiers and junkies shooting up. I remember this issue pretty well; it was one of the ones I picked up at a garage sale and read to death. I seem to remember asking my parents what \"graft\" was. One of the joys of ''Mad'' for me at the time was that it was always slightly over my head.

From \"Greeting Cards for the Sexual Revolution\" I learned about \"Gay Liberationists\" and leather-clad \"Sex Fetishists.\" I read the ''Mad'' versions of a whole host of films I never in a million years would have been allowed to see: ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (\"Sleazy Riders\"), ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (\"Midnight Wowboy\"), ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' (\"Five Easy Pages [and two hard ones].\") I learned about the [[John Birch Society]] and [[Madison Avenue]].<ref name=\"Futrelle\">{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/1997/04/08/media_109/ |last=Futrelle|first=David|title=Media Circus: Son of Mad |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=April 8, 1997 |accessdate= February 2, 2011}}</ref>}}\n\n''Mad'' editor [[John Ficarra]] acknowledged that changes in culture made the task of creating fresh satire more difficult, telling an interviewer, \"The editorial mission statement has always been the same: 'Everyone is lying to you, including magazines.

In its earliest years, before amassing its own staff of regulars, the magazine frequently used outside \"name\" talent.

When the magazine learned that [[Tom Koch]] was the writer behind the Bob and Ray radio sketches adapted by ''Mad'', Koch was sought out by the editors and ultimately wrote more than 300 ''Mad'' articles over the next 37 years.\n\nThe magazine has occasionally run guest articles in which notables from show business or comic books have participated. In 1964, an article called \"Comic Strips They'd Really Like To Do\" featured one-shot proposals by cartoonists including [[Mell Lazarus]] and Charles M. Schulz. More than once, the magazine has enlisted popular comic book artists such as [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] or [[Jim Lee]] to design and illustrate a series of \"Rejected Superheroes.\" In 2008, the magazine got national coverage<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/business/media/04mad.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|work= [[The New York Times]] | title=''Mad Magazine'' Uses Pulitzer Winners to Tweak Bush|date=February 4, 2008|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> for its article \"Why [[George W.

This practice continued into the 2000s, with more than 100 ''Mad'' paperbacks published. Gaines made a special effort to keep the entire line of paperbacks in print at all times, and the books were frequently reprinted in new editions with different covers. There were also dozens of ''Mad'' paperbacks featuring entirely new material by the magazine's contributors.\n\n''Mad'' also frequently repackaged its material in a long series of \"Super Special\" format magazines, beginning in 1958 with two concurrent annual series entitled ''The Worst from Mad'' and ''More Trash from Mad''. Various other titles have been used through the years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.madcoversite.com/allthumbs2.html |title=US Mad Specials Cover Site |publisher=Doug Gilford's madcoversite.com}}</ref> These reprint issues were sometimes augmented by exclusive features such as posters, stickers and, on a few occasions, recordings on [[Flexi disc|flexi-disc]], or comic book-formatted inserts reprinting material from the 1952\u201355 era.\n\n==Spin-offs==\n===''Mad Kids''===\n{{Main|Mad Kids}}\nBetween 2005 and February 17, 2009, the magazine published 14 issues of ''Mad Kids,'' a spinoff publication aimed at a younger demographic.<ref name=newsa>{{cite news|author = Brady, Matt |title=Worrying a Little Bit?

But the quarterly magazine also included newly commissioned articles and cartoons, as well as puzzles, bonus inserts, a calendar, and the other activity-related content that is common to kids' magazines.\n\n===Foreign editions===\n''Mad'' has been published in local versions in many countries, beginning with the United Kingdom in 1959, and Sweden in 1960. Each new market receives access to the publication's back catalog of articles and is also encouraged to produce its own localized material in the ''Mad'' vein. However, the sensibility of the American ''Mad'' has not always translated to other cultures, and many of the foreign editions have had short lives or interrupted publications. The Swedish, Danish, Italian and Mexican ''Mad''s were each published on three separate occasions; Norway has had four runs canceled. Brazil also had four runs, but without significant interruptions, spanning five decades. Australia (35 years and counting), United Kingdom (35 years), and Sweden (34 years) have produced the longest uninterrupted ''Mad'' variants.\n\n'''Foreign editions as of 2019'''\n* Australia, 1980\u2013present;\n* Poland, 2015\u2013present;\n\n'''Defunct foreign editions'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* United Kingdom, 1959\u20131994; (still use the US version today)\n* Sweden, 1960\u20131993, 1997\u20132002;\n* Denmark, 1962\u20131971, 1979\u20131997, 1998\u20132002;\n* Netherlands, 1964\u20131996; 2011\u20132012;\n* France, 1965, 1982;\n* [[:de:Mad (Magazin)#Deutsches MAD|Germany]], 1967\u201395, 1998\u20132018;\n* Finland, 1970\u20131972, 1982\u20132005;\n* Italy, 1971\u20131974, 1984, 1992\u20131993;\n* Norway, 1971\u20131972, 1981\u20131996, 2001 (one-offs 2002\u20132003);\n* Brazil, 1974\u20131983, 1984\u20132000, 2000\u20132006; 2008\u20132017;\n* Spain, 1974, 1975 (as ''Locuras''), 2006\u20132016;\n* Argentina, 1977\u20131982;\n* Mexico, 1977\u20131983, 1984\u20131986, 1993\u20131998; 2004\u20132010<ref>According to issue #111 of the Mexican edition (January 2010), the magazine folded under pressure from Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico) (SEP) over lewd language, from the Mexican government over political content, and a \"kid-cover\" incident in issue #110 in which an underaged fan tattooed his back on behalf of the magazine without parental permission.</ref>\n* Caribbean, 1977\u20131983;\n* Greece, 1978\u20131985, 1995\u20131999;\n* Japan, 1979\u20131980; (two oversized anthologies were released)\n* Iceland, 1985; 1987\u20131988;\n* South Africa, 1985\u20132009;\n* Taiwan, 1990;\n* Canada (Quebec), 1991\u20131992 (Past material in a \"collection album\" with ''[[Croc (magazine)|Croc]]'', another Quebec humor magazine);\n* Hungary, 1994\u20132009;<ref>{{cite web|author=Marabu |url=http://marabu-bloglap.blogspot.com/2009/12/broaf.html |title=Marabu BlogLap: BRO\u00c1F |website=Marabu-bloglap.blogspot.com |date=2009-12-29 |accessdate=2016-02-23}}</ref>\n* Israel, 1994\u20131995;\n* Turkey, 2000\u20132001;\n{{div col end}}\n\nConflicts over content have occasionally arisen between the parent magazine and its international franchisees.

Neuman]].\n\nColor comic-book competitors, primarily in the mid-to-late 1950s, were ''Nuts!'', ''Get Lost'', ''Whack'', ''Riot'', ''Flip'', ''Eh!'', ''From Here to Insanity'', and ''Madhouse''; only the last of these lasted as many as eight issues, and some were canceled after an issue or two.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kreiner |first=Rich |url=http://classic.tcj.com/history/rich-kreiner-reviews-humbug-by-harvey-kurtzman-will-elder-arnold-roth-al-jaffee-jack-davis-and-others/ |title=Rich Kreiner reviews Humbug by Harvey Kurtzman, Will Elder, Arnold Roth, Al Jaffee, Jack Davis and others \u00ab The Comics Journal |website=Classic.tcj.com |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2016-02-23}}</ref> Later color satiric comic books included ''Wild'', ''Blast'', ''Parody'', ''Grin'' and ''Gag!''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/the-sincerest-form-of-parody-the-best-1950s-mad-inspired-satirical-comics-dec.-2011-8.html | title=The Sincerest Form of Parody: The Best 1950s MAD-Inspired Satirical Comics [Jan. 2012] | accessdate=January 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023053008/http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/the-sincerest-form-of-parody-the-best-1950s-mad-inspired-satirical-comics-dec.-2011-8.html |archivedate=October 23, 2011 }}</ref> EC Comics itself offered the color comic ''[[Panic (comics)|Panic]]'', produced by future ''Mad'' editor Al Feldstein. Two years after EC's ''Panic'' had ceased publication in 1956, the title was used by another publisher for a similar comic.\n\nIn 1967, [[Marvel Comics]] produced the first of 13 issues of the comic book ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'', which parodied the company's own superhero titles as well as other publishers. From 1973 to 1976, [[DC Comics]] published the comic ''[[Plop!]]'', which featured ''Mad'' stalwart [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]] and frequent cover art by [[Basil Wolverton]]. Another publisher's comic was ''Trash'' (1978){{citation needed|date=December 2013}} featured a blurb on the debut cover reading, \"We mess with ''Mad'' (p. 21)\" and depicted Alfred E. Neuman with a stubbly beard; the fourth and last issue showed two bodybuilders holding up copies of ''Mud'' and ''Crocked'' with the frowning faces of Neuman and ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' cover mascot Sylvester P. Smythe.\n\nAmong other U.S. humor magazines that included some degree of comics art as well as text articles were former ''Mad'' editor Harvey Kurtzman's ''[[Trump (magazine)|Trump]]'', ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]'' and ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]'', as well as ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''.\n\n[[Virginia Commonwealth University|Virginia Commonwealth University's]] Cabell Library has an extensive collection of ''Mad'' along with other comic books and graphic novels.<ref>{{cite web |title=The MAD Fold_in Collection, 1964-2010, cover |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/vculibraries/ |accessdate=29 July 2019 |date=18 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\nOver the years, ''Mad'' has branched out from print into other media. During the Gaines years, the publisher had an aversion to exploiting his fan base and expressed the fear that substandard ''Mad'' products would offend them. He was known to personally issue refunds to anyone who wrote to the magazine with a complaint. Among the few outside ''Mad'' items available in its first 40 years were cufflinks, a T-shirt designed like a [[straitjacket]] (complete with lock), and a small ceramic Alfred E. Neuman bust. For decades, the letters page advertised an inexpensive portrait of Neuman (\"suitable for framing or for wrapping fish\") with misleading slogans such as \"Only 1 Left!\" (The joke being that the picture was so undesirable that only one had left their office since the last ad.) After Gaines' death came an overt absorption into the Time-Warner publishing umbrella, with the result that ''Mad'' merchandise began to appear more frequently. Items were displayed in the [[Warner Bros. Studio Stores]], and in 1994 ''The Mad Style Guide'' was created for licensing use.\n\n===Recordings===\n''Mad'' has sponsored or inspired a number of recordings. In 1959, Bernie Green \"with the Stereo Mad-Men\" recorded the album ''Musically Mad'' for [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]], featuring music inspired by ''Mad'' and an image of Alfred E. Neuman on the cover;<ref>{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,403202,00.html |title=That Old Feeling: What, Me Fifty? |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 31, 2002 |accessdate=February 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204072200/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,403202,00.html |archive-date=February 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> it has been reissued on [[Compact disc|CD]]. That same year, ''The Worst from Mad'' #2 included an original recording, \"Meet the staff of Mad\", on a cardboard [[LP record|33 rpm record]], while a single credited to Alfred E. Neuman & The Furshlugginger Five: \"What \u2013 Me Worry?\" (b/w \"Potrzebie\"), was issued in late 1959 on the ABC Paramount label.\n\nTwo additional albums of novelty songs, written by Norman Blagman and [[Sam Bobrick]] and performed by [[The Dellwoods]], were released by [[Bigtop Records]] in 1962\u201363: \"Mad 'Twists' Rock 'N' Roll\" and \"Fink Along with Mad\". The latter album featured a song titled \"It's a Gas\", which punctuated an instrumental track with [[Burping|belches]] (along with a saxophone break by an uncredited [[King Curtis]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} [[Dr. Demento]] featured this gaseous performance on his radio show in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. ''Mad'' included some of these tracks as plastic-laminated cardboard inserts and (later) [[flexi disc]]s  with their reprinted \"Mad Specials\".\n\nA number of original recordings also were released in this way in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as ''Gall in the Family Fare'' (a [[Radio drama|radio play]] adaptation of their previously illustrated ''[[All in the Family]]'' parody), a single entitled \"Makin' Out\", the octuple-grooved track \"It's a Super Spectacular Day\", which had eight possible endings, the spoken word ''Meet the staff'' insert, and a six-track, 30-minute ''Mad Disco'' EP (from the 1980 special of the same title) that included a [[disco]] version of \"It's a Gas\". The last turntable-playable recording ''Mad'' packaged with its magazines was \"A Mad Look at Graduation\", in a 1982 special. A [[CD-ROM]] containing several audio tracks was included with issue #350 (October 1996). [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] compiled a number of ''Mad''-recorded tracks as ''Mad Grooves'' (1996).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/MAD-Magazine-MAD-Grooves/release/4450478|title=MAD Grooves| work=discogs.com}}</ref>\n\n===Stage show===\nAn [[Off-Broadway]] production, ''[[The Mad Show]]'', was first staged in 1966. The show, which lasted for 871 performances during its initial run, featured sketches written by ''Mad'' regulars Stan Hart and Larry Siegel interspersed with comedic songs (one of which was written by an uncredited [[Stephen Sondheim]]).<ref name=maria/> The cast album is available on CD.

''[[The Mad Magazine Game]]'' was an absurdist version of ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' in which the first player to lose all his money and go bankrupt was the winner. Profusely illustrated with artwork by the magazine's contributors, the game included a $1,329,063 bill that could not be won unless one's name was \"Alfred E. Neuman\". It also featured a deck of cards (called \"Card cards\") with bizarre instructions, such as \"If you can jump up and stay airborne for 37 seconds, you can lose $5,000. If not, jump up and lose $500.\" In 1980 a second game was released: ''[[The Mad Magazine Card Game]]'' by [[Parker Brothers]]. In it, the player who first [[Card game#Shedding games|loses all their cards]] is declared the winner. The game is fairly similar to ''[[Uno (card game)|Uno]]'' by [[Mattel]]. Questions based on the magazine also appeared in the 1999 ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]: Warner Bros. Edition'' (which featured questions based around Time-Warner properties, including WB films and TV shows, the ''[[Looney Tunes]]''/''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons (and follow-up projects from [[Warner Bros. Animation]])), as well as DC Comics, [[Hanna-Barbera]], Cartoon Network and assorted [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] properties owned by [[Turner Entertainment]] Co. that WB had come into possession of following the 1996 Turner/Time-Warner merger.\n\n===Film and television===\nFollowing the success of the ''National Lampoon''-backed ''[[Animal House]]'', ''Mad'' lent its name in 1980 to a similarly risque comedy film, ''[[Up the Academy]]''. It was such a commercial debacle and critical failure that ''Mad'' successfully arranged for all references to the magazine (including a cameo by Alfred E. Neuman) to be removed from future TV and video releases of the film, although those references were eventually restored on the [[DVD-Video|DVD]] version, which was titled ''Mad Magazine Presents Up the Academy''. ''Mad'' also devoted two pages of its magazine to an attack on the movie, titled ''Throw Up the Academy''. The spoof's ending collapsed into a series of interoffice memos between the writer, artist, editor and publisher, all bewailing the fact that they had been forced to satirize such a terrible film.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} On March 2, 2018, ''Mad'' announced via their [[Twitter]] page that a sequel to the original film will be written by an A-list film writer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/MADmagazine/status/969718152312451072|title=Twitter|website=mobile.twitter.com}}</ref>\n\nA 1974 ''Mad'' animated television pilot using selected material from the magazine was commissioned by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] but the network decided to not broadcast it. Dick DeBartolo noted, \"Nobody wanted to sponsor a show that made fun of products that were advertised on TV, like car manufacturers.\" The program was instead created into a TV special, and is available for online viewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/the-mad-magazine-tv-special-1974-17438.html |title=The Mad Magazine TV Special (1974) |publisher=Cartoonbrew.com |date=October 19, 2009 |access-date= February 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, [[Hanna-Barbera]] developed another potential ''Mad'' animated television series that was never broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.bcdb.com/forum/Alfred_E_Neuman_in_animation_P105263/|title=Alfred E.

However, aside from short bumpers which animated existing ''Spy vs. Spy'' (1994\u20131998) and Don Martin (1995\u20132000) cartoons during the show's first three seasons, there was no editorial or stylistic connection between the TV show and the magazine. Produced by [[Quincy Jones]], the sketch comedy series was in the vein of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and [[Global Television Network|Global]]/[[CBC Television|CBC]]'s ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', and ran for 14 seasons and 321 episodes. On January 12, 2016, [[The CW]] aired an hour-long special celebrating the series' 20th anniversary. A large portion of the original cast returned. An eight-episode revival featuring a brand new cast premiered on July 26, 2016.\n\nAnimated ''Spy vs. Spy'' sequences were also seen in TV ads for [[Mountain Dew]] soda in 2004.<ref name=zine/>\n\nIn September 2010, [[Cartoon Network]] began airing the animated series ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'', from [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and executive producer Sam Register. The series aired short animated vignettes about current television shows, films, games and other aspects of popular culture. Much like ''Mad TV''{{'s}}, this series also features appearances by ''Spy vs. Spy'' and Don Martin cartoons. Produced by [[Kevin Shinick]] and Mark Marek,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/17321.html|title=ICv2|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> the series ran from September 6, 2010, to December 2, 2013, lasting for four seasons and 103 episodes.\n\n===Computer software===\nIn 1984, the ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'' characters were given their own computer game [[Spy vs. Spy (1984 video game)|series]], in which players could set traps for each other. The games were made for various computer systems such as the [[Atari 800]], [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. Whereas the original game took place in a nondescript building, the sequels transposed the action to a desert island for ''Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper'' and a polar setting for ''Spy vs. Spy: Arctic Antics''.\n\nNot to be confused with the later television show, ''[[Mad TV (video game)|Mad TV]]'' is a television station management simulation computer game produced in 1991 by Rainbow Arts for the Mad franchise. It was released on the PC and the Amiga. It is faithful to the magazine's general style of cartoon humor but does not include any of the original characters except for a brief closeup of Alfred E. Neuman's eyes during the opening screens.\n\nIn 1996, ''Mad'' #350 included a CD-ROM featuring ''Mad''-related software as well as three audio files.<ref>[http://www.idido.com/MAD/MAD_CD.html \"Mad CD Bytes: Mad Bungles Bundle with Release of First CD-ROM: 27 Megabytes of Dubious Material in PC-Only Format\"], ''idio'', September 18, 1996.</ref> In 1999, [[Broderbund]]/[[The Learning Company]] released ''Totally Mad,'' a [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows 95|95]]/[[Windows 98|98]]-compatible CD-ROM set collecting the magazine's content from #1 through #376 (December 1998), plus over 100 ''Mad Specials'' including most of the recorded audio inserts. Despite the title, it omitted a handful of articles due to problems clearing the rights on some book excerpts and text taken from recordings, such as [[Andy Griffith]]'s \"[[What It Was, Was Football]]\". In 2006, Graphic Imaging Technology's DVD-ROM ''Absolutely Mad'' updated the original ''Totally Mad'' content through 2005. A single seven-gigabyte disc, it is missing the same deleted material from the 1999 collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madcoversite.com/missing.html |title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - Articles mysteriously missing from the Totally Mad CD ROM |website=Madcoversite.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-23}}</ref> It differs from the earlier release in that it is [[Macintosh]] compatible.\n\nAnother [[Spy vs. Spy (2005 video game)|''Spy vs. Spy'']] video game was made in 2005 for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].

Wood, Elder, and Davis were to be the three main illustrators throughout the 23-issue run of the comic book.\n\nTo retain Kurtzman as its editor, the comic book converted to magazine format as of issue #24, in 1955. The switchover induced Kurtzman to remain for one more year, but the move had removed ''Mad'' from the strictures of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. [[William Gaines]] related in 1992 that ''Mad'' \"was not changed [into a magazine] to avoid the Code\" but \"as a result of this [change of format] it ''did'' avoid the Code.\"<ref name=gaines>{{cite journal |last=Riggenberg |first=Steve|date=1992 |title=An Interview with [[William Gaines|William M.

Gaines further stated that \"if Harvey [Kurtzman] had not gotten that offer from ''Pageant'', ''Mad'' probably would not have changed format.\"<ref name=gaines/>\n\nAfter Kurtzman's departure in 1956, new editor [[Al Feldstein]] swiftly brought aboard contributors such as [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]], [[Frank Jacobs]], and [[Mort Drucker]], and later [[Antonio Proh\u00edas]], [[Dave Berg (cartoonist)|Dave Berg]], and [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]]. The magazine's circulation more than quadrupled during Feldstein's tenure, peaking at 2,132,655 in 1974; it later declined to a third of this figure by the end of his time as editor.<ref name=slau>{{cite web|url=http://users.pfw.edu/slaubau/mad/madcirculation.htm|author=Slaubaugh, Mike|title=''Mad Magazine'' circulation figures|work=IPFW|accessdate=February 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315224710/http://users.ipfw.edu/slaubau/madcirc.htm|archive-date=March 15, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn its earliest incarnation, new issues of the magazine appeared erratically, between four and seven times a year.

Long-time production artist Lenny \"The Beard\" Brenner was promoted to art director and [[Joe Raiola]] and [[Charlie Kadau]] joined the staff as junior editors. Following Gaines's death in 1992, ''Mad'' became more ingrained within the Time Warner (now [[WarnerMedia]]) corporate structure. Eventually, the magazine was obliged to abandon its long-time home at 485 Madison Avenue and in the mid-1990s it moved into DC Comics' offices at the same time that DC relocated to 1700 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. In issue #403 of March 2001, the magazine broke its long-standing taboo and began running paid advertising. The outside revenue allowed the introduction of color printing and improved paper stock. After Meglin retired in 2004, the team of Ficarra (as executive editor) Raiola and Kadau (now senior editors), and [[Sam Viviano]], who had taken over as art director in 1999, would helm ''Mad'' for the next 18 years.\n\nThroughout the years, ''Mad'' remained a unique mix of adolescent silliness and political humor.

Throughout the 1950s, ''Mad'' featured groundbreaking parodies combining a sentimental fondness for the familiar staples of American culture\u2014such as [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie]] and [[Superman]]\u2014with a keen joy in exposing the fakery behind the image. Its approach was described by [[Dave Kehr]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \"[[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]] and [[Ray Goulding]] on the radio, [[Ernie Kovacs]] on television, [[Stan Freberg]] on records, [[Harvey Kurtzman]] in the early issues of ''Mad'': all of those pioneering humorists and many others realized that the real world mattered less to people than the sea of sounds and images that the ever more powerful mass media were pumping into American lives.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1D7173EF933A1575BC0A9609C8B63 |last=Kehr|first= Dave|title=When Unmanly Men Met Womanly Women |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 20, 2006 |access-date= February 2, 2011}}</ref> [[Bob and Ray]], Kovacs and Freberg all became contributors to ''Mad''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madcoversite.com/ugoi-master.html|title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - Mad Magazine Contributors - Master List|website=MadCoverSite.com|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Tony Hiss and Jeff Lewis wrote in ''The New York Times'' about the then-25-year-old publication's initial effect:\n\n{{quote|The skeptical generation of kids it shaped in the 1950s is the same generation that, in the 1960s, opposed a war and didn't feel bad when the United States lost for the first time and in the 1970s helped turn out an Administration and didn't feel bad about that either ... It was magical, objective proof to kids that they weren't alone, that in New York City on Lafayette Street, if nowhere else, there were people who knew that there was something wrong, phony and funny about a world of bomb shelters, brinkmanship and toothpaste smiles. ''Mad''{{'}}s consciousness of itself, as trash, as comic book, as enemy of parents and teachers, even as money-making enterprise, thrilled kids. In 1955, such consciousness was possibly nowhere else to be found. In a ''Mad'' parody, comic-strip characters knew they were stuck in a strip. \"Darnold Duck,\" for example, begins wondering why he has only three fingers and has to wear white gloves all the time. He ends up wanting to murder every other Disney character. G.I. Schmoe tries to win the sexy Asiatic Red Army broad by telling her, \"O.K., baby! You're all mine!

The magazine often featured parodies of ongoing American culture, including advertising campaigns, the nuclear family, the media, big business, education and publishing.

The magazine took a generally negative tone towards [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] drugs such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], but it also savaged mainstream drugs such as tobacco and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].

Neuman===\n[[File:MAD Magazine (no. 21, front cover).jpg|right|324px|thumb|First cover appearance (issue 21, March 1955) of Alfred E. Neuman in a fake advertisement satirizing the popular mail-order house [[Johnson Smith Company]]]]\n{{Main|Alfred E. Neuman}}\nThe image most closely associated with the magazine is that of [[Alfred E. Neuman]], the boy with misaligned eyes, a [[Maxillary central incisor|gap-toothed]] smile, and the perennial motto \"What, me worry?\" The original image was a popular humorous graphic for many decades before ''Mad'' adopted it, but the face is now primarily associated with ''Mad''.\n\n''Mad'' initially used the boy's face in November 1954. His first iconic full-cover appearance was as a write-in candidate for President on issue #30 (December 1956), in which he was identified by name and sported his \"What, me worry?\" motto. He has since appeared in a slew of guises and comic situations. According to ''Mad'' writer Frank Jacobs, a letter was once successfully delivered to the magazine through the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. mail]] bearing only Neuman's face, without any address or other identifying information.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Legal disputes==\nThe magazine has been involved in various legal actions over the decades, some of which have reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The most far-reaching was ''[[Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc.|Irving Berlin et al. v. E.C. Publications, Inc.]]'' In 1961, a group of music publishers representing songwriters such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Richard Rodgers]], and [[Cole Porter]] filed a $25&nbsp;million lawsuit against ''Mad'' for [[copyright infringement]] following \"Sing Along With ''Mad''\", a collection of parody lyrics which the magazine said could be \"sung to the tune of\" many popular songs. The publishing group hoped to establish a legal precedent that only a song's composers retained the right to parody that song. Judge Charles Metzner of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled largely in favor of ''Mad'' in 1963, affirming its right to print 23 of the 25 song parodies under dispute. However, in the case of two parodies, \"Always\" (sung to the tune of \"[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]\") and \"There's No Business Like No Business\" (sung to the tune of \"[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]\"), Judge Metzner decided that the issue of [[copyright infringement]] was closer, requiring a trial because in each case the parodies relied on the same verbal hooks (\"always\" and \"business\") as the originals. The music publishers appealed the ruling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals not only upheld the pro-''Mad'' decision in regard to the 23 songs, it adopted an approach that was broad enough to strip the publishers of their limited victory regarding the remaining two songs. Writing a unanimous opinion for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], Circuit Judge [[Irving Kaufman]] observed, \"We doubt that even so eminent a composer as plaintiff Irving Berlin should be permitted to claim a property interest in [[iambic pentameter]].\"<ref name=\"mcir_Musi\">{{cite web | title =  Music Copyright Infringement Resource \u2013 Sponsored By USC Gould School of Law |work = mcir.usc.edu |accessdate = January 17, 2015 | url = http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/1960-1969/Pages/berlinecpublications.html}}</ref> The publishers again appealed, but the Supreme Court refused to hear it, thus allowing the decision to stand.<ref name=jac>Jacobs, Frank.

However, the \"Sing Along With ''Mad''\" songbook was not the magazine's first venture into musical parody. In 1960, ''Mad'' had published \"My Fair Ad-Man\", a full advertising-based spoof of the hit Broadway musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. In 1959, \"If [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert & Sullivan]] wrote ''[[Dick Tracy]]''\" was one of the speculative pairings in \"If Famous Authors Wrote the Comics\".\n\nIn 1966, a series of copyright infringement lawsuits against the magazine regarding ownership of the [[Alfred E. Neuman]] image eventually reached the appellate level. Although Harry Stuff had copyrighted the image in 1914, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that, by allowing many copies of the image to circulate without any copyright notice, the owner of the copyright had allowed the image to pass into the public domain, thus establishing the right of ''Mad''\u2014or anyone else for that matter\u2014to use the image. In addition, ''Mad'' established that Stuff was not himself the creator of the image by producing numerous other examples dating back to the late 19th century. This decision was also allowed to stand.<ref name=maria>Reidelbach, Maria.

Following the magazine's parody of the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', a letter from [[George Lucas]]'s lawyers arrived in ''Mad'''s offices demanding that the issue be recalled for infringement on copyrighted figures. The letter further demanded that the printing plates be destroyed, and that [[Lucasfilm]] must receive all revenue from the issue plus additional punitive damages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/mad-about-star-wars|title=MAD about Star Wars|date=June 23, 2014|website=StarWars.com}}</ref> Unbeknownst to Lucas' lawyers, ''Mad'' had received a letter days earlier from Lucas himself, expressing delight over the parody and calling artist [[Mort Drucker]] and writer [[Dick DeBartolo]] \"the [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] of comic satire.\"<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=mS-OOULG_IcC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=debartolo+lucas+lawyer+star+bores#v=onepage&q=debartolo%20lucas%20lawyer%20star%20bores&f=false | title=Mad About Star Wars| isbn=9780345501646| last1=Bresman| first1=Jonathan| year=2007}}</ref> Publisher Bill Gaines made a copy of Lucas' letter, added the handwritten notation \"Gee, your boss George liked it!\" across the top, and mailed it to the lawyers.

For decades, it was the most successful American magazine to publish ad-free,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119524101/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105083729/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119524101/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 5, 2013 |title=Mad Economics: An Analysis of an Adless Magazine |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1984.tb02984.x |date=February 7, 2006 |accessdate= February 2, 2011 |volume=34 |journal=Journal of Communication |pages=44\u201361|last1=Norris |first1=Vincent P. }}</ref> beginning with issue #33 (April 1957) and continuing through issue #402 (February 2001).\n\nAs a comic book, ''Mad'' had run the same advertisements as the rest of EC's line. The magazine later made a deal with [[Moxie]] soda that involved inserting the Moxie logo into various articles. ''Mad'' ran a limited number of ads in its first two years as a magazine, helpfully labeled \"real advertisement\" to differentiate the real from the parodies. The last authentic ad published under the original ''Mad'' regime was for [[Famous Artists School]]; two issues later, the inside front cover of issue #34 had a parody of the same ad. After this transitional period, the only promotions to appear in ''Mad'' for decades were house ads for ''Mad'''s own books and specials, subscriptions, and promotional items such as ceramic busts, T-shirts, or a line of ''Mad'' jewelry. This rule was bent only a few times to promote outside products directly related to the magazine, such as [[Parker Brothers]] ''Mad Board Game'', the video game based on ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'', and the notorious ''[[Up the Academy]]'' movie (which the magazine later disowned). ''Mad'' explicitly promised that it would never make its mailing list available.\n\nBoth Kurtzman and Feldstein wanted the magazine to solicit advertising, feeling this could be accomplished without compromising ''Mad'''s content or editorial independence. Kurtzman remembered ''[[Ballyhoo (magazine)|Ballyhoo]]'', a boisterous 1930s humor publication that made an editorial point of mocking its own sponsors. Feldstein went so far as to propose an in-house ''Mad'' ad agency, and produced a \"dummy\" copy of what an issue with ads could look like. But Bill Gaines was intractable, telling the television news magazine ''[[60 Minutes]]'', \"We long ago decided we couldn't take money from Pepsi-Cola and make fun of Coca-Cola.\" Gaines' motivation in eschewing ad dollars was less philosophical than practical:\n\n{{quote|We'd have to improve our package. Most advertisers want to appear in a magazine that's loaded with color and has super-slick paper. So you find yourself being pushed into producing a more expensive package. You get bigger and fancier and attract more advertisers. Then you find you're losing some of your advertisers. Your readers still expect the fancy package, so you keep putting it out, but now you don't have your advertising income, which is why you got fancier in the first place\u2014and now you're sunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Jacobs, Frank.

Although several of the contributors earn far more than their ''Mad'' pay in fields such as television and advertising, they have steadily continued to provide material for the publication.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/jackdavs.htm Jack Davis] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Writers such as [[Dick DeBartolo]], [[Stan Hart]], [[Frank Jacobs]], [[Tom Koch]], and [[Arnie Kogen]] appeared regularly in the magazine's pages. In several cases, only infirmity or death has ended a contributor's run at ''Mad.''\n\nWithin the industry, ''Mad'' was known for the uncommonly prompt manner in which its contributors were paid. Publisher Gaines would typically write a personal check and give it to the artist upon receipt of the finished product. Wally Wood said, \"I got spoiled ... Other publishers don't do that. I started to get upset if I had to wait a whole week for my check.\" Another lure for contributors was the annual \"Mad Trip\", an all-expenses-paid tradition that began in 1960. The editorial staff was automatically invited, along with freelancers who had qualified for an invitation by selling a set number of articles or pages during the previous year. Gaines was strict about enforcing this quota, and one year, longtime writer and frequent traveller Arnie Kogen was bumped off the list. Later that year, Gaines' mother died, and Kogen was asked if he would be attending the funeral. \"I can't,\" said Kogen, \"I don't have enough pages.\" Over the years, the ''Mad'' crew traveled to such locales as France, [[Kenya]], Russia, Hong Kong, England, [[Amsterdam]], [[Tahiti]], [[Morocco]], Italy, Greece, and Germany.<ref name=jac/> The tradition ended with Gaines' death, and a 1993 trip to [[Monte Carlo]].\n\nAlthough ''Mad'' was an exclusively freelance publication, it achieved remarkable stability, with numerous contributors remaining prominent for decades.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/bullpen/john_ficarra/backgrounder/ |title=Byline&nbsp;: Published Work \" Arthur L.

''Mad'' has been criticized{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} for its over-reliance on a core group of aging regulars throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and then criticized again{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} for an alleged downturn as those same creators began to leave, die, retire, or contribute less frequently.\n\nIt has been proposed that ''Mad'' is more susceptible to this criticism than many media because a sizable percentage of its readership turns over regularly as it ages, as ''Mad'' focuses greatly on current events and a changing popular culture.<ref name=\"jac\"/> In 2010, [[Sergio Aragones]] said, \"Mad is written by people who never thought 'Okay, I'm going to write for kids,' or 'I'm going to write for adults.' ...

On December 11, the first-ever letter complaining that ''Mad'' 'just isn't as funny and original like it used to be' arrives.\" The magazine's then art director, [[Sam Viviano]], suggested in 2002 that historically, ''Mad'' was at its best \"whenever you first started reading it.\"<ref>Evanier, Mark.

This also meant Kurtzman suffered the bad creative and financial timing of departing before the magazine became a runaway success.<ref name=\"That Old Feeling: Hail, Harvey!\"/>\n\nHowever, just how much of that success was due to the original Kurtzman template that he left for his successor, and how much should be credited to the [[Al Feldstein]] system and the depth of the post-Kurtzman talent pool, can be argued without resolution. In 2009, an interviewer proposed to [[Al Jaffee]], \"There's a group of ''Mad'' aficionados who feel that if Harvey Kurtzman had stayed at ''Mad'', the magazine would not only have been different, but better.\" Jaffee, a Kurtzman enthusiast, replied, \"And then there's a large group who feel that if Harvey had stayed with ''Mad'', he would have upgraded it to the point that only fifteen people would buy it.\"<ref>Sacks, Mike, \"And Here's the Kicker\", ''Writer's Digest' Books'', 2009, p. 222</ref> During Kurtzman's final two-plus years at EC, ''Mad'' appeared erratically (ten issues appeared in 1954, followed by eight issues in 1955 and four issues in 1956). Feldstein was less well regarded creatively, but kept the magazine on a regular schedule, leading to decades of success. (Kurtzman and [[Will Elder]] returned to ''Mad'' for a short time in the mid-1980s as an illustrating team.)\n\nThe magazine's sales peak came with issue #161 (September 1973), which sold 2.4 million copies in 1973. That period coincided with several other magazines' sales peaks, including ''[[TV Guide]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]''. ''Mad''{{'}}s circulation dropped below one million for the first time in 1983.\n\nMany of the magazine's mainstays began retiring or dying by the 1980s. Newer contributors who appeared in the years that followed include [[Joe Raiola]], [[Charlie Kadau]], [[Tony Barbieri]], Scott Bricher, [[Tom Bunk]], [[John Caldwell (cartoonist)|John Caldwell]], [[Desmond Devlin]], [[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew Friedman]], [[Barry Liebmann]], [[Kevin Pope (cartoonist)|Kevin Pope]], Scott Maiko, [[Hermann Mejia]], [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]], Andrew J.

Appearing slightly more frequently were [[Frank Frazetta]] (3 bylines), [[Ernie Kovacs]] (11), [[Bob and Ray]] (12), [[Henry Morgan (humorist)|Henry Morgan]] (3), and [[Sid Caesar]] (4). In its earliest years, before amassing its own staff of regulars, the magazine frequently used outside \"name\" talent. Often, ''Mad'' would simply illustrate the celebrities' preexisting material while promoting their names on the cover.<ref>{{cite magazine | author1-last=Cox | author1-first=Wally | author1link=Wally Cox | author2-last=Woodbridge | author2-first=George | author2link=George Woodbridge |date=December 1957 | title=My Frien' Dufo | publisher=Mad | number=36 | url=http://www.madcoversite.com/missing_dufo.html | access-date=July 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | author1-last=Elliott | author1-first=Bob | author1link=Bob Elliott (comedian) | author2-last=Goulding | author2-first=Ray | author2link=Ray Goulding |author3-last=Drucker | author3-first=Mort | author3link=Mort Drucker | date=December 1957 | title=Paul Sturdley's Secret File | publisher=Mad | number=36 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | author1-last=Morgan | author1-first=Henry | author1link=Henry Morgan (humorist) | author2-last=Wood | author2-first=Wally | author2link=Wally Wood | date=December 1957 | title=Mr. Morgan Tells The Story of The 12 Bottles | publisher=Mad | number=36}}</ref> The Bob and Ray association was particularly fruitful. When the magazine learned that [[Tom Koch]] was the writer behind the Bob and Ray radio sketches adapted by ''Mad'', Koch was sought out by the editors and ultimately wrote more than 300 ''Mad'' articles over the next 37 years.\n\nThe magazine has occasionally run guest articles in which notables from show business or comic books have participated. In 1964, an article called \"Comic Strips They'd Really Like To Do\" featured one-shot proposals by cartoonists including [[Mell Lazarus]] and Charles M. Schulz. More than once, the magazine has enlisted popular comic book artists such as [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] or [[Jim Lee]] to design and illustrate a series of \"Rejected Superheroes.\" In 2008, the magazine got national coverage<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/business/media/04mad.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|work= [[The New York Times]] | title=''Mad Magazine'' Uses Pulitzer Winners to Tweak Bush|date=February 4, 2008|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> for its article \"Why [[George W.

This practice continued into the 2000s, with more than 100 ''Mad'' paperbacks published. Gaines made a special effort to keep the entire line of paperbacks in print at all times, and the books were frequently reprinted in new editions with different covers. There were also dozens of ''Mad'' paperbacks featuring entirely new material by the magazine's contributors.\n\n''Mad'' also frequently repackaged its material in a long series of \"Super Special\" format magazines, beginning in 1958 with two concurrent annual series entitled ''The Worst from Mad'' and ''More Trash from Mad''. Various other titles have been used through the years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.madcoversite.com/allthumbs2.html |title=US Mad Specials Cover Site |publisher=Doug Gilford's madcoversite.com}}</ref> These reprint issues were sometimes augmented by exclusive features such as posters, stickers and, on a few occasions, recordings on [[Flexi disc|flexi-disc]], or comic book-formatted inserts reprinting material from the 1952\u201355 era.\n\n==Spin-offs==\n===''Mad Kids''===\n{{Main|Mad Kids}}\nBetween 2005 and February 17, 2009, the magazine published 14 issues of ''Mad Kids,'' a spinoff publication aimed at a younger demographic.<ref name=newsa>{{cite news|author = Brady, Matt |title=Worrying a Little Bit?

Much of the content of ''Mad Kids'' had originally appeared in the parent publication; reprinted material was chosen and edited to reflect grade schoolers' interests. But the quarterly magazine also included newly commissioned articles and cartoons, as well as puzzles, bonus inserts, a calendar, and the other activity-related content that is common to kids' magazines.\n\n===Foreign editions===\n''Mad'' has been published in local versions in many countries, beginning with the United Kingdom in 1959, and Sweden in 1960. Each new market receives access to the publication's back catalog of articles and is also encouraged to produce its own localized material in the ''Mad'' vein. However, the sensibility of the American ''Mad'' has not always translated to other cultures, and many of the foreign editions have had short lives or interrupted publications. The Swedish, Danish, Italian and Mexican ''Mad''s were each published on three separate occasions; Norway has had four runs canceled. Brazil also had four runs, but without significant interruptions, spanning five decades. Australia (35 years and counting), United Kingdom (35 years), and Sweden (34 years) have produced the longest uninterrupted ''Mad'' variants.\n\n'''Foreign editions as of 2019'''\n* Australia, 1980\u2013present;\n* Poland, 2015\u2013present;\n\n'''Defunct foreign editions'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* United Kingdom, 1959\u20131994; (still use the US version today)\n* Sweden, 1960\u20131993, 1997\u20132002;\n* Denmark, 1962\u20131971, 1979\u20131997, 1998\u20132002;\n* Netherlands, 1964\u20131996; 2011\u20132012;\n* France, 1965, 1982;\n* [[:de:Mad (Magazin)#Deutsches MAD|Germany]], 1967\u201395, 1998\u20132018;\n* Finland, 1970\u20131972, 1982\u20132005;\n* Italy, 1971\u20131974, 1984, 1992\u20131993;\n* Norway, 1971\u20131972, 1981\u20131996, 2001 (one-offs 2002\u20132003);\n* Brazil, 1974\u20131983, 1984\u20132000, 2000\u20132006; 2008\u20132017;\n* Spain, 1974, 1975 (as ''Locuras''), 2006\u20132016;\n* Argentina, 1977\u20131982;\n* Mexico, 1977\u20131983, 1984\u20131986, 1993\u20131998; 2004\u20132010<ref>According to issue #111 of the Mexican edition (January 2010), the magazine folded under pressure from Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico) (SEP) over lewd language, from the Mexican government over political content, and a \"kid-cover\" incident in issue #110 in which an underaged fan tattooed his back on behalf of the magazine without parental permission.</ref>\n* Caribbean, 1977\u20131983;\n* Greece, 1978\u20131985, 1995\u20131999;\n* Japan, 1979\u20131980; (two oversized anthologies were released)\n* Iceland, 1985; 1987\u20131988;\n* South Africa, 1985\u20132009;\n* Taiwan, 1990;\n* Canada (Quebec), 1991\u20131992 (Past material in a \"collection album\" with ''[[Croc (magazine)|Croc]]'', another Quebec humor magazine);\n* Hungary, 1994\u20132009;<ref>{{cite web|author=Marabu |url=http://marabu-bloglap.blogspot.com/2009/12/broaf.html |title=Marabu BlogLap: BRO\u00c1F |website=Marabu-bloglap.blogspot.com |date=2009-12-29 |accessdate=2016-02-23}}</ref>\n* Israel, 1994\u20131995;\n* Turkey, 2000\u20132001;\n{{div col end}}\n\nConflicts over content have occasionally arisen between the parent magazine and its international franchisees. When a comic strip satirizing [[House of Windsor|England's royal family]] was reprinted in a ''Mad'' paperback, it was deemed necessary to rip out the page from 25,000 copies by hand before the book could be distributed in Great Britain.<ref>Jacobs, Frank. ''The Mad World of William M. Gaines'', Lyle Stuart, 1972, pg. 191</ref> But ''Mad'' was also protective of its own editorial standards.

''The Mad World of William M. Gaines'', Lyle Stuart, 1972, pg. 160</ref> ''Mad'' has since relaxed its requirements, and while the U.S. version still eschews overt profanity, the magazine generally poses no objections to more provocative content.\n\n===Other satiric-comics magazines===\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 100\n   | footer    = The success of ''Mad'' inspired a rash of short-lived imitators.\n   | image1    = GetLostNo1.jpg\n   | image2    = MadhouseNo1.jpg\n   | image3    = EhNo2.jpg\n}}\nFollowing the success of ''Mad'', other black-and-white magazines of topical, satiric comics began to be published. Most were short-lived. The three longest-lasting were ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'', ''[[Sick (magazine)|Sick]]'', and ''[[Crazy Magazine]]''. These three and many others featured a cover mascot along the lines of [[Alfred E. Neuman]].\n\nColor comic-book competitors, primarily in the mid-to-late 1950s, were ''Nuts!'', ''Get Lost'', ''Whack'', ''Riot'', ''Flip'', ''Eh!'', ''From Here to Insanity'', and ''Madhouse''; only the last of these lasted as many as eight issues, and some were canceled after an issue or two.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kreiner |first=Rich |url=http://classic.tcj.com/history/rich-kreiner-reviews-humbug-by-harvey-kurtzman-will-elder-arnold-roth-al-jaffee-jack-davis-and-others/ |title=Rich Kreiner reviews Humbug by Harvey Kurtzman, Will Elder, Arnold Roth, Al Jaffee, Jack Davis and others \u00ab The Comics Journal |website=Classic.tcj.com |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2016-02-23}}</ref> Later color satiric comic books included ''Wild'', ''Blast'', ''Parody'', ''Grin'' and ''Gag!''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/the-sincerest-form-of-parody-the-best-1950s-mad-inspired-satirical-comics-dec.-2011-8.html | title=The Sincerest Form of Parody: The Best 1950s MAD-Inspired Satirical Comics [Jan. 2012] | accessdate=January 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023053008/http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/the-sincerest-form-of-parody-the-best-1950s-mad-inspired-satirical-comics-dec.-2011-8.html |archivedate=October 23, 2011 }}</ref> EC Comics itself offered the color comic ''[[Panic (comics)|Panic]]'', produced by future ''Mad'' editor Al Feldstein. Two years after EC's ''Panic'' had ceased publication in 1956, the title was used by another publisher for a similar comic.\n\nIn 1967, [[Marvel Comics]] produced the first of 13 issues of the comic book ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'', which parodied the company's own superhero titles as well as other publishers. From 1973 to 1976, [[DC Comics]] published the comic ''[[Plop!]]'', which featured ''Mad'' stalwart [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]] and frequent cover art by [[Basil Wolverton]]. Another publisher's comic was ''Trash'' (1978){{citation needed|date=December 2013}} featured a blurb on the debut cover reading, \"We mess with ''Mad'' (p. 21)\" and depicted Alfred E. Neuman with a stubbly beard; the fourth and last issue showed two bodybuilders holding up copies of ''Mud'' and ''Crocked'' with the frowning faces of Neuman and ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' cover mascot Sylvester P. Smythe.\n\nAmong other U.S. humor magazines that included some degree of comics art as well as text articles were former ''Mad'' editor Harvey Kurtzman's ''[[Trump (magazine)|Trump]]'', ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]'' and ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]'', as well as ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''.\n\n[[Virginia Commonwealth University|Virginia Commonwealth University's]] Cabell Library has an extensive collection of ''Mad'' along with other comic books and graphic novels.<ref>{{cite web |title=The MAD Fold_in Collection, 1964-2010, cover |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/vculibraries/ |accessdate=29 July 2019 |date=18 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\nOver the years, ''Mad'' has branched out from print into other media. During the Gaines years, the publisher had an aversion to exploiting his fan base and expressed the fear that substandard ''Mad'' products would offend them. He was known to personally issue refunds to anyone who wrote to the magazine with a complaint. Among the few outside ''Mad'' items available in its first 40 years were cufflinks, a T-shirt designed like a [[straitjacket]] (complete with lock), and a small ceramic Alfred E. Neuman bust. For decades, the letters page advertised an inexpensive portrait of Neuman (\"suitable for framing or for wrapping fish\") with misleading slogans such as \"Only 1 Left!\" (The joke being that the picture was so undesirable that only one had left their office since the last ad.) After Gaines' death came an overt absorption into the Time-Warner publishing umbrella, with the result that ''Mad'' merchandise began to appear more frequently. Items were displayed in the [[Warner Bros. Studio Stores]], and in 1994 ''The Mad Style Guide'' was created for licensing use.\n\n===Recordings===\n''Mad'' has sponsored or inspired a number of recordings. In 1959, Bernie Green \"with the Stereo Mad-Men\" recorded the album ''Musically Mad'' for [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]], featuring music inspired by ''Mad'' and an image of Alfred E. Neuman on the cover;<ref>{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,403202,00.html |title=That Old Feeling: What, Me Fifty? |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 31, 2002 |accessdate=February 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204072200/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,403202,00.html |archive-date=February 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> it has been reissued on [[Compact disc|CD]]. That same year, ''The Worst from Mad'' #2 included an original recording, \"Meet the staff of Mad\", on a cardboard [[LP record|33 rpm record]], while a single credited to Alfred E. Neuman & The Furshlugginger Five: \"What \u2013 Me Worry?\" (b/w \"Potrzebie\"), was issued in late 1959 on the ABC Paramount label.\n\nTwo additional albums of novelty songs, written by Norman Blagman and [[Sam Bobrick]] and performed by [[The Dellwoods]], were released by [[Bigtop Records]] in 1962\u201363: \"Mad 'Twists' Rock 'N' Roll\" and \"Fink Along with Mad\". The latter album featured a song titled \"It's a Gas\", which punctuated an instrumental track with [[Burping|belches]] (along with a saxophone break by an uncredited [[King Curtis]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} [[Dr. Demento]] featured this gaseous performance on his radio show in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. ''Mad'' included some of these tracks as plastic-laminated cardboard inserts and (later) [[flexi disc]]s  with their reprinted \"Mad Specials\".\n\nA number of original recordings also were released in this way in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as ''Gall in the Family Fare'' (a [[Radio drama|radio play]] adaptation of their previously illustrated ''[[All in the Family]]'' parody), a single entitled \"Makin' Out\", the octuple-grooved track \"It's a Super Spectacular Day\", which had eight possible endings, the spoken word ''Meet the staff'' insert, and a six-track, 30-minute ''Mad Disco'' EP (from the 1980 special of the same title) that included a [[disco]] version of \"It's a Gas\". The last turntable-playable recording ''Mad'' packaged with its magazines was \"A Mad Look at Graduation\", in a 1982 special. A [[CD-ROM]] containing several audio tracks was included with issue #350 (October 1996). [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] compiled a number of ''Mad''-recorded tracks as ''Mad Grooves'' (1996).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/MAD-Magazine-MAD-Grooves/release/4450478|title=MAD Grooves| work=discogs.com}}</ref>\n\n===Stage show===\nAn [[Off-Broadway]] production, ''[[The Mad Show]]'', was first staged in 1966. The show, which lasted for 871 performances during its initial run, featured sketches written by ''Mad'' regulars Stan Hart and Larry Siegel interspersed with comedic songs (one of which was written by an uncredited [[Stephen Sondheim]]).<ref name=maria/> The cast album is available on CD.

''[[The Mad Magazine Game]]'' was an absurdist version of ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' in which the first player to lose all his money and go bankrupt was the winner. Profusely illustrated with artwork by the magazine's contributors, the game included a $1,329,063 bill that could not be won unless one's name was \"Alfred E. Neuman\". It also featured a deck of cards (called \"Card cards\") with bizarre instructions, such as \"If you can jump up and stay airborne for 37 seconds, you can lose $5,000. If not, jump up and lose $500.\" In 1980 a second game was released: ''[[The Mad Magazine Card Game]]'' by [[Parker Brothers]]. In it, the player who first [[Card game#Shedding games|loses all their cards]] is declared the winner. The game is fairly similar to ''[[Uno (card game)|Uno]]'' by [[Mattel]]. Questions based on the magazine also appeared in the 1999 ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]: Warner Bros. Edition'' (which featured questions based around Time-Warner properties, including WB films and TV shows, the ''[[Looney Tunes]]''/''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons (and follow-up projects from [[Warner Bros. Animation]])), as well as DC Comics, [[Hanna-Barbera]], Cartoon Network and assorted [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] properties owned by [[Turner Entertainment]] Co. that WB had come into possession of following the 1996 Turner/Time-Warner merger.\n\n===Film and television===\nFollowing the success of the ''National Lampoon''-backed ''[[Animal House]]'', ''Mad'' lent its name in 1980 to a similarly risque comedy film, ''[[Up the Academy]]''. It was such a commercial debacle and critical failure that ''Mad'' successfully arranged for all references to the magazine (including a cameo by Alfred E. Neuman) to be removed from future TV and video releases of the film, although those references were eventually restored on the [[DVD-Video|DVD]] version, which was titled ''Mad Magazine Presents Up the Academy''. ''Mad'' also devoted two pages of its magazine to an attack on the movie, titled ''Throw Up the Academy''. The spoof's ending collapsed into a series of interoffice memos between the writer, artist, editor and publisher, all bewailing the fact that they had been forced to satirize such a terrible film.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} On March 2, 2018, ''Mad'' announced via their [[Twitter]] page that a sequel to the original film will be written by an A-list film writer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/MADmagazine/status/969718152312451072|title=Twitter|website=mobile.twitter.com}}</ref>\n\nA 1974 ''Mad'' animated television pilot using selected material from the magazine was commissioned by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] but the network decided to not broadcast it. Dick DeBartolo noted, \"Nobody wanted to sponsor a show that made fun of products that were advertised on TV, like car manufacturers.\" The program was instead created into a TV special, and is available for online viewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/the-mad-magazine-tv-special-1974-17438.html |title=The Mad Magazine TV Special (1974) |publisher=Cartoonbrew.com |date=October 19, 2009 |access-date= February 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, [[Hanna-Barbera]] developed another potential ''Mad'' animated television series that was never broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.bcdb.com/forum/Alfred_E_Neuman_in_animation_P105263/|title=Alfred E.

However, aside from short bumpers which animated existing ''Spy vs. Spy'' (1994\u20131998) and Don Martin (1995\u20132000) cartoons during the show's first three seasons, there was no editorial or stylistic connection between the TV show and the magazine. Produced by [[Quincy Jones]], the sketch comedy series was in the vein of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and [[Global Television Network|Global]]/[[CBC Television|CBC]]'s ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', and ran for 14 seasons and 321 episodes. On January 12, 2016, [[The CW]] aired an hour-long special celebrating the series' 20th anniversary. A large portion of the original cast returned. An eight-episode revival featuring a brand new cast premiered on July 26, 2016.\n\nAnimated ''Spy vs. Spy'' sequences were also seen in TV ads for [[Mountain Dew]] soda in 2004.<ref name=zine/>\n\nIn September 2010, [[Cartoon Network]] began airing the animated series ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'', from [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and executive producer Sam Register. The series aired short animated vignettes about current television shows, films, games and other aspects of popular culture. Much like ''Mad TV''{{'s}}, this series also features appearances by ''Spy vs. Spy'' and Don Martin cartoons. Produced by [[Kevin Shinick]] and Mark Marek,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/17321.html|title=ICv2|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> the series ran from September 6, 2010, to December 2, 2013, lasting for four seasons and 103 episodes.\n\n===Computer software===\nIn 1984, the ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'' characters were given their own computer game [[Spy vs. Spy (1984 video game)|series]], in which players could set traps for each other. The games were made for various computer systems such as the [[Atari 800]], [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. Whereas the original game took place in a nondescript building, the sequels transposed the action to a desert island for ''Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper'' and a polar setting for ''Spy vs. Spy: Arctic Antics''.\n\nNot to be confused with the later television show, ''[[Mad TV (video game)|Mad TV]]'' is a television station management simulation computer game produced in 1991 by Rainbow Arts for the Mad franchise. It was released on the PC and the Amiga. It is faithful to the magazine's general style of cartoon humor but does not include any of the original characters except for a brief closeup of Alfred E. Neuman's eyes during the opening screens.\n\nIn 1996, ''Mad'' #350 included a CD-ROM featuring ''Mad''-related software as well as three audio files.<ref>[http://www.idido.com/MAD/MAD_CD.html \"Mad CD Bytes: Mad Bungles Bundle with Release of First CD-ROM: 27 Megabytes of Dubious Material in PC-Only Format\"], ''idio'', September 18, 1996.</ref> In 1999, [[Broderbund]]/[[The Learning Company]] released ''Totally Mad,'' a [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows 95|95]]/[[Windows 98|98]]-compatible CD-ROM set collecting the magazine's content from #1 through #376 (December 1998), plus over 100 ''Mad Specials'' including most of the recorded audio inserts. Despite the title, it omitted a handful of articles due to problems clearing the rights on some book excerpts and text taken from recordings, such as [[Andy Griffith]]'s \"[[What It Was, Was Football]]\". In 2006, Graphic Imaging Technology's DVD-ROM ''Absolutely Mad'' updated the original ''Totally Mad'' content through 2005. A single seven-gigabyte disc, it is missing the same deleted material from the 1999 collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madcoversite.com/missing.html |title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - Articles mysteriously missing from the Totally Mad CD ROM |website=Madcoversite.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-23}}</ref> It differs from the earlier release in that it is [[Macintosh]] compatible.\n\nAnother [[Spy vs. Spy (2005 video game)|''Spy vs. Spy'']] video game was made in 2005 for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. A ''Mad'' app was released for [[iPad]] on April 1, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.madmagazine.com/blog/2012/03/30/it%E2%80%99s-no-joke-mad-magazine-ipad-app-to-be-released-on-april-fool%E2%80%99s-day-alfred-e|title=IT'S NO JOKE: MAD MAGAZINE iPAD APP TO BE RELEASED ON APRIL FOOL'S DAY (ALFRED E.
