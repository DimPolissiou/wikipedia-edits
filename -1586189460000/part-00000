{"title_page": "Deep Throat (Watergate)", "text_new": "{{short description|Alias of Mark Felt, the whistleblower who exposed the Watergate scandal}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use American English|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:MarkFelt.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Felt]] a.k.a. \"Deep Throat\"]]\n\n'''Deep Throat''' is the [[pseudonym]] given to the secret informant who provided information in 1972 to [[Bob Woodward]], who shared it with [[Carl Bernstein]]. Woodward and Bernstein were reporters for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and Deep Throat provided key details about the involvement of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration in what came to be known as the [[Watergate scandal]]. In 2005, 31 years after Nixon's resignation and 11 years after Nixon's death, a family attorney stated that former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Associate Director '''[[Mark Felt]]''' was Deep Throat. By then, Felt was suffering from dementia and had previously denied being Deep Throat, but Woodward and Bernstein then confirmed the attorney's claim.\n\n==Background==\nDeep Throat was first introduced to the public in the February 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' by ''The Washington Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]]. According to the authors, Deep Throat was a key source of information behind a series of articles that introduced the misdeeds of the Nixon administration to the general public. The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as to prison terms for [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[Egil Krogh]], White House Counsel [[Charles Colson]], former United States Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], [[John Dean]], and presidential adviser [[John Ehrlichman]]. The [[All the President's Men (film)|film based on the book]] was released two years later; having been nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], it won two.\n\n[[Howard Simons]] was the managing editor of the ''Post'' during Watergate. He dubbed the secret informant \"Deep Throat,\" alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation. Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it. [[J. Anthony Lukas]] speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book ''Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years'' (1976), based on three ''New York Times Sunday Magazine'' articles, but he was widely criticized. According to an article in ''Slate'' on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the \"intelligence community\" in a 1989 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview with Lukas.<ref>[[Timothy Noah|Noah, Timothy]]. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2003/04/was_fred_fielding_deep_throat.html \"Was Fred Fielding Deep Throat?\"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', April 28, 2003.</ref>\n\nOn May 31, 2005, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt reportedly said, \"I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat.\" After the ''Vanity Fair'' story broke, Woodward, Bernstein, and [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]], the ''Post''{{'}}s executive editor during Watergate, confirmed Felt's identity as Deep Throat.<ref>Woodward, Bob. ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat'', Simon & Schuster, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-8715-0}}</ref> [[L. Patrick Gray]], former acting Director of the FBI and Felt's overseer, disputed Felt's claim in his book ''In Nixon's Web'', co-written with his son Ed. Gray and others have argued that Deep Throat was a compilation of sources characterized as one person to improve sales of the book and movie. Woodward and Bernstein, however, defended Felt's claims and detailed their relationship with him in Woodward's book ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat''.\n\n==Role in the Watergate scandal==\n{{Main|Watergate scandal}}\n{{Watergate|Intelligence}}\n\nOn June 17, 1972, police arrested five men inside the offices of the [[Democratic National Committee]] in the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In their possession were $2,300 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|2300|1972|r=-2|fmt=c}} today), plastic gloves to hide fingerprints, burglary tools, a walkie-talkie and radio scanner capable of listening to police frequencies, cameras with 40 rolls of film, tear gas guns, multiple electronic devices which they intended to plant in the Democratic Committee offices, and notebooks containing the telephone number of White House official [[E. Howard Hunt]]. One of the men was [[James W. McCord Jr.]], popularly known as \"CREEP\"<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/james-mccord-jr-watergate-conspirator-who-linked-break-in-to-the-white-house-dies-at-93/2019/04/18/11c2082e-6195-11e9-9ff2-abc984dc9eec_story.html</ref>; a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] employee and a security man for Nixon's [[Committee to Re-elect the President]].\n\n''Washington Post'' reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward pursued the story for two years. The scandal eventually implicated many members of Nixon's White House, culminating in Nixon becoming the only United States president to resign. Woodward and Bernstein wrote in ''All the President's Men'' that key information in their investigation had come from an anonymous informant whom they dubbed \"Deep Throat\".\n\n===Methods of communication===\nWoodward, in ''All the President's Men'', first mentions \"Deep Throat\" on page 71; earlier in the book he reports calling \"''an old friend and sometimes source who worked for the federal government and did not like to be called at his office''\". Later, he describes him as \"''a source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP as well as at the White House''\". The book also calls him \"''an incurable gossip''\" and states \"''in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch''\", and as a man \"''whose fight had been worn out in too many battles''\".\n\nWoodward claimed that he would signal to \"Deep Throat\" that he desired a meeting by moving a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment. When \"Deep Throat\" wanted a meeting he would make special marks on page 20 of Woodward's copy of ''[[The New York Times]]''; he would circle the page number and draw clock hands to indicate the hour. They often met \"on the bottom level of an underground [[parking garage|garage]] just over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Key Bridge]] in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]]\", at 2:00 a.m. The garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard and has a historical marker that was erected in 2011. In 2014, the garage was scheduled to be demolished, though the county decided to save the historical marker, and the landowner promised to design a memorial commemorating the Watergate scandal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=|title='Deep Throat' garage from U.S. Watergate scandal to be razed|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/15/usa-watergate-garage-idUSL2N0OW0J320140615|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=Reuters|date=15 June 2014}}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the garage had not been demolished.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goff|first1=Karen|title=Monday Properties asks for more time to redevelop 'Deep Throat' garage|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/03/13/monday-properties-asks-for-more-time-to-redevelop.html|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=Washington Business Journal|date=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany were skeptical of these [[cloak and dagger]] methods. Adrian Havill investigated these claims for his 1993 [[biography]] of Woodward and Bernstein and found them to be factually impossible. He noted that Woodward's apartment 617 at 1718 P Street, Northwest, in Washington faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Havill said anyone regularly checking the balcony, as \"Deep Throat\" was said to have done daily, would have been spotted. Havill also said that copies of ''The New York Times'' were not delivered to individual apartments but delivered in an unaddressed stack at the building's reception desk. There would have been no way to know which copy was intended for Woodward. Woodward, however, has stated that in the early 1970s the interior courtyard was an alleyway and had not yet been bricked off and that his balcony was visible from street level to passing pedestrians. It was also visible, Woodward conjectured, to anyone from the FBI in surveillance of nearby embassies. Also revealed was the fact that Woodward's copy of ''The New York Times'' had his apartment number indicated on it. Former neighbor Herman Knippenberg stated that Woodward would sometimes come to his door looking for his marked copy of the ''Times'', claiming, \"I like to have it in mint condition and I like to have my own copy.\"<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10328832\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10328832 |title=New Zealand man's Deep Throat mystery solved |date=June 3, 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFurther, while Woodward stressed these precautions in his book, he also admits to having called \"Deep Throat\" on the telephone at his home. Felt's wife recalls answering Woodward's telephone calls for Felt.<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2005/07/deepthroat200507</ref>\n\n===Controversy over motives===\nIn public statements following the disclosure of his identity, Felt's family called him an \"American hero\", stating that he leaked information about the Watergate scandal to ''The Washington Post'' for moral and patriotic reasons. Other commentators, however, have speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward.\n\nIn his book ''The Secret Man'', Woodward describes Felt as a loyalist to and admirer of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. After Hoover's death, Felt became angry and disgusted when [[L. Patrick Gray]], a career naval officer and lawyer from the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division|Civil Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] had no law ''enforcement'' experience and was appointed as Director of the FBI over Felt, a 30-year veteran of the FBI. Felt was particularly unhappy with Gray's management style at the FBI, which was markedly different from Hoover's. Felt selected Woodward because he knew Woodward and Bernstein were assigned to investigate the burglary. Instead of seeking out prosecutors at the Justice Department, or the House Judiciary Committee charged with investigating presidential wrongdoing, he methodically leaked information to Woodward to guide their investigation while keeping his own identity and involvement safely concealed.\n\nSome conservatives who worked for Nixon, such as [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[G. Gordon Liddy]], castigated Felt and asserted their belief that Nixon was unfairly hounded from office,<ref name=\"traitor\">Morgan, Dan (June 1, 2005). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053101420.html \"Contemporaries Have Mixed Views\"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 31, 2005.</ref> often claiming it a \"Witch Hunt\"<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14811140/1973-07-22-witch-hunt/</ref>\n\n== Speculation concerning W. Mark Felt ==\n{{Copy edit|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Refimprove|section|date=January 2020}}\n=== Speculation within the White House ===\nAlthough confirmation of Deep Throat's identity remained elusive for over 30 years, there were suspicions that Felt was indeed the reporters' mysterious source long before the public acknowledgment in 2005. In ''Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat'', Max Holland reports that Felt leaked information to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. While the ''Post'' reporters did not reveal their source, ''Time'' correspondent Sandy Smith told ''Time''{{'}}s lawyer, [[Roswell Gilpatric]], a partner of [[Cravath, Swaine & Moore]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=119}}</ref> Gilpatric then passed the information to [[Henry E. Peterson]], the [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in the Department of Criminal Justice. In turn, Peterson revealed the information to White House Counsel [[John W. Dean]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/26/AR2005062600974.html | work=Washington Post | title=Revenge Was Felt's Motive, Former Acting FBI Chief Says | author=Michael Dobbs | date=June 27, 2005 }}</ref> who finally reported it to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=98}}</ref>\n\nNixon did not publicly acknowledge anything about learning Deep Throat's identity. Nixon claimed that if he had done so, Felt would have publicly revealed information that would damage the FBI, as well as other powerful people and institutions. In the [[Nixon White House tapes#The \"smoking_gun\" tape|\"smoking gun\" tape]], Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, stated that Felt \"knows everything there is to know in the FBI.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neikirk |first1=William |last2=Dorning |first2=Mike |title=President Called Felt a 'Traitor' in '73 |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-06-02-0506020166-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2 June 2005}}</ref> Haldeman implied that Nixon's motives for not outing Felt were not entirely altruistic, especially because Nixon may have been damaged by Felt's revelations.\n\n=== Speculation in the press and the public ===\nAmong other evidence, it had previously been revealed publicly that Deep Throat was definitely a man. Using this and other public hints, real or perceived, some members of the press and the public came to suspect Felt of being Deep Throat. For instance, [[George V. Higgins]] wrote in 1975: \"Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a ''Washington Post'' alias borrowed from a dirty movie.\"<ref>[[George V. Higgins]] (1975), ''The Friends of Richard Nixon'', 1976 reprint, New York: Ballantine, Ch. 14, p. 147, {{ISBN|978-0-345-25226-5}}.</ref> However, Woodward and Bernstein were famously tight-lipped concerning their informant's identity. Carl Bernstein did not even share Deep Throat's identity with his immediate family, which included his wife, writer [[Nora Ephron]]. As he said on NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' on June 2, 2005, \"I was never dumb enough to tell her...which was very smart because I would have told the whole world by now.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Ephron became obsessed with figuring out the secret and eventually correctly concluded that he was Mark Felt.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050603041501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 3, 2005 | work=Huffington Post | first=Nora | last=Ephron | title=Deep Throat and Me: Now It Can Be Told and Not for the First Time Either | date=May 9, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, a 19-year-old college freshman, Chase Culeman-Beckman, claimed to have been told by Bernstein's son that Mark Felt was Deep Throat. According to Culeman-Beckman, Jacob Bernstein had said that he was \"100 percent sure that Deep Throat was Mark Felt. He's someone in the FBI.\"<ref name=\"Courant\">{{cite news |last1=Daley |first1=David |title=Deep Throat |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1999-07-28-9907280810-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=The Hartford Courant |date=28 July 1999}}</ref> Jacob had reportedly said this approximately 11 years prior when he and Chase Culeman-Beckman were classmates. Ephron explained that Jacob overheard her \"speculations\"; Carl Bernstein himself also immediately stepped forward to reject the claim, as he and Woodward had done for many others.<ref name=\"Courant\"/> James Mann, who had worked at the ''Post'' at the time of Watergate and was close to the investigation, brought a great deal of evidence together in a 1992 article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.<ref>Mann, James. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199205/mann \"Deep Throat: An Institutional Analysis\"], ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 1992.</ref> Mann recalled that before  the Watergate scandal, Woodward had made references to a high-placed source he had in the FBI. Mann argued that the information that Deep Throat gave Woodward could only have come from FBI files. Felt was also embittered at having been passed over for director of the FBI and believed that the FBI, in general, was hostile to the Nixon administration. In previous unrelated articles, Woodward had made clear he had a highly placed source at the FBI, and there is some evidence he was friends with Felt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nWoodward had kept in close touch with Felt over the years, even showing up unexpectedly at his house in 1999, after Felt's [[dementia]] began and at the home of Felt's daughter, Joan, in [[Santa Rosa, California]]. Some suspected at that time that Woodward might be asking Felt if he could reveal him as Deep Throat, though Felt, when asked directly by others, had consistently denied being Deep Throat. In 2002, [[Timothy Noah]] called Felt \"the best guess going about the identity of Deep Throat\".<ref>Noah, Timothy. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/05/why_did_bob_woodward_lunch_with_mark_felt_in_1999.html \"Why Did Bob Woodward Lunch With Mark Felt in 1999?\"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', May 2, 2002.</ref> In 1976, Assistant Attorney General [[John Stanley Pottinger]] had convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate a series of potentially illegal break-ins that Felt had authorized against various dissident groups. Felt was testifying before the jury when a juror asked him, out of the blue, \"Are you Deep Throat?\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Pottinger reports that Felt \"went white with fear\".{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Pottinger explained to Felt that he was under oath and would have to answer truthfully, but since Pottinger felt the question was outside the purview of the investigation, he offered to withdraw it if Felt wished.\n\nIn his book ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', [[Ronald Kessler]] wrote that Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the Santa Rosa home where Felt was staying with his daughter Joan and took Felt to lunch.<ref name=\"Kessler\">{{cite book|title=The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2016|ISBN=9781250111265|page=201}}</ref> Joan, who was caring for her father, told Kessler that her father had greeted Woodward like an old friend. Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. \"Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area,\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was published in 2002. \"He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine.\"<ref name=\"Kessler\"/> Kessler said in his book that the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent \"credence\" to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. \"There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt&nbsp;... On May 3, 2002, the page reported that Ronald Kessler, author of ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn February 2005, Nixon's former White House Counsel, news columnist John Dean, reported that Woodward had recently informed Bradlee that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing and that Bradlee had written Deep Throat's obituary. Both Woodward and the then-current editor of ''The Washington Post'', [[Leonard Downie]], denied these claims. Felt was something of a suspect, especially after the mysterious meeting that occurred between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999. But others had received more attention over the years, such as [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Henry Kissinger]], then-Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], General [[Alexander Haig]], and before it was revealed that \"Deep Throat\" was definitely not female, [[Diane Sawyer]].\n\n=== Felt's confirmation of his identity ===\nOn May 31, 2005, ''Vanity Fair'' reported that Felt, then aged 91, claimed to be the man once known as \"Deep Throat\".<ref>{{cite news|first=John D.|last= O'Connor|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/07/deepthroat200507?printable=true&currentPage=all|title=I'm the Guy They Called Deep Throat|date=May 31, 2005|accessdate =November 28, 2008|publisher= VanityFair.com}}</ref> Later that day, Woodward, Bernstein, and Bradlee released a statement through ''The Washington Post'' confirming that the story was true. On June 2, 2005, ''The Washington Post'' ran a lengthy front-page column by Woodward in which he detailed his friendship with Felt in the years before Watergate.<ref>{{cite news|first= Bob|last= Woodward|authorlink=Bob Woodward|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060102124_pf.html|title=How Mark Felt Became 'Deep Throat'|date=June 2, 2005 |accessdate =November 28, 2008|work= [[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> Woodward wrote that he first met Felt by chance in 1970 when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant in his mid-20s who was dispatched to deliver a package to the White House's West Wing. Felt arrived soon after, for a separate appointment and sat next to Woodward in the waiting room. Woodward struck up a conversation, eventually learning of Felt's position in the upper echelon of the FBI. Woodward, who was about to get out of the Navy at the time and was unsure about his future direction in life, became determined to use Felt as a [[mentor]] and career advisor, and so he got Felt's phone number and kept in touch with him.\n\nAfter deciding to try a career as a reporter, Woodward eventually joined ''The Washington Post'' in August 1971. Felt, who Woodward writes had long had a dim view of the Nixon administration, began passing pieces of information to Woodward, although he insisted that Woodward keep the FBI and Justice Department out of anything he wrote based on the information. The first time Woodward used information from Felt in a ''Washington Post'' story was in mid-May 1972, a month before the Watergate burglary, when Woodward was reporting on [[Arthur Bremer]], who had attempted to assassinate presidential candidate [[George C. Wallace]]; Nixon had put Felt in charge of investigating the would-be assassin. A month later, just days after the Watergate break-in, Woodward would call Felt at his office, marking the first time Woodward spoke with Felt about Watergate.\n\nCommenting on Felt's motivations for serving as his Deep Throat source, Woodward wrote, \"Felt believed he was protecting the bureau by finding a way, clandestine as it was, to push some of the information from the FBI interviews and files out to the public, to help build public and political pressure to make Nixon and his people answerable. He had nothing but contempt for the Nixon White House and their efforts to manipulate the Bureau for political reasons.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} In 1980, Felt himself was convicted of ordering illegal break-ins at the homes of [[Weatherman (organization)|Weathermen]] suspects and their families. Richard Nixon testified on his behalf. President [[Ronald Reagan]] pardoned Felt and the conviction was subsequently expunged from the record.\n\n==Composite character theory==\nPrior to Felt's revelation and Woodward's confirmation, part of the reason historians and other scholars had so much difficulty in identifying the real Deep Throat is that no single person seemed to truly fit the character described in ''All the President's Men''. This had caused some scholars and commentators to come to the conclusion that Deep Throat could not possibly be a single person, and must be a composite of several sources. Woodward and Bernstein consistently denied the theory.<ref name=\"Greenberg\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=David |date=June 1, 2005 |title=Throat Clearing; Watergate conspiracy theories that still won't die. |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2005/06/throat_clearing.single.html |newspaper=Slate |location= |publisher= |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom a literary business perspective, this theory was further supported by [[David Obst]], the agent who originally marketed the draft for ''All the President's Men'', who stated that the initial typescript of the book contained absolutely no reference to Deep Throat.<ref name=\" Greenberg\"/> Obst believed that Deep Throat was invented by Woodward and Bernstein for dramatic purposes.<ref name=\" Greenberg\"/> It also led to speculation that the authors played at condensing history in the same way [[Hollywood]] scriptwriters do.<ref name=\"Greenberg\"/>\n\nEd Gray, the son of [[L. Patrick Gray III]], stated in ''In Nixon's Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate'' that his examination of Woodward's interview notes pertaining to Deep Throat at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] provided \"convincing evidence that 'Deep Throat' was indeed a fabrication\".<ref name=\" Gray & Gray\">{{cite book |last1=Gray III |first1=L.

Fielding]]. In April 2003 Fielding was presented as a potential candidate as a result of a detailed review of source material by [[William Gaines (professor)|William Gaines]] and his journalism students, as part of a class at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]] journalism school.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194614/http://archive.deepthroatuncovered.com/ Deep Throat: Uncovered] (archived), Department of Journalism, University of Illinois</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Who_Was_Deep_Throat.html Who Was Deep Throat?], ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'', December 2003</ref> Fielding was the assistant to John Dean and as such had access to the files relating to the affair. Gaines felt that statements by Woodward ruled out Deep Throat's being in the FBI and that Deep Throat often had information before the FBI did. H. R. Haldeman himself suspected Fielding as being Deep Throat.\n\nDean had been one of the most dedicated hunters of Deep Throat. Both he and [[Leonard Garment]] dismissed Fielding as a possibility, reporting that he had been cleared by Woodward in 1980 when Fielding was applying for an important position in the Reagan administration. However, this assertion, which comes from Fielding, has not been corroborated.\n\nOne reason that many experts believed that Deep Throat was Fielding and not Felt was due to Woodward's apparent denial in an interview that \"Deep Throat\" worked in the intelligence community:\n\n: LUKAS: Do you resent the implication by some critics that your sources on Watergate\u2014among them the fabled Deep Throat\u2014may have been people in the intelligence community?\n\n: WOODWARD: I resent it because it's untrue.<ref>Noah, Timothy.

More than five months before the Watergate break-in, he was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and it would have been almost impossible for him to have had access to much of the information attributed to \"Deep Throat\". In February 2005, Dean reported that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing, and Rehnquist was known to be suffering from cancer, which caused his death later that year. The report caused a resurgence of speculation that Rehnquist was \"Deep Throat\". However, Woodward later stated that the notion that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing had been a misunderstanding.\n* [[Henry Kissinger]]: Nixon's [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], was out of the country on some of the dates Woodward reported to have met with \"Deep Throat\".\n* [[George H.

Woodward and Bernstein were reporters for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and Deep Throat provided key details about the involvement of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration in what came to be known as the [[Watergate scandal]]. In 2005, 31 years after Nixon's resignation and 11 years after Nixon's death, a family attorney stated that former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Associate Director '''[[Mark Felt]]''' was Deep Throat. By then, Felt was suffering from dementia and had previously denied being Deep Throat, but Woodward and Bernstein then confirmed the attorney's claim.\n\n==Background==\nDeep Throat was first introduced to the public in the February 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' by ''The Washington Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]]. According to the authors, Deep Throat was a key source of information behind a series of articles that introduced the misdeeds of the Nixon administration to the general public. The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as to prison terms for [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[Egil Krogh]], White House Counsel [[Charles Colson]], former United States Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], [[John Dean]], and presidential adviser [[John Ehrlichman]]. The [[All the President's Men (film)|film based on the book]] was released two years later; having been nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], it won two.\n\n[[Howard Simons]] was the managing editor of the ''Post'' during Watergate. He dubbed the secret informant \"Deep Throat\", alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation. Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it. [[J. Anthony Lukas]] speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book ''Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years'' (1976), based on three ''New York Times Sunday Magazine'' articles, but he was widely criticized. According to an article in ''Slate'' on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the \"intelligence community\" in a 1989 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview with Lukas.<ref>[[Timothy Noah|Noah, Timothy]]. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2003/04/was_fred_fielding_deep_throat.html \"Was Fred Fielding Deep Throat?\"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', April 28, 2003.</ref>\n\nOn May 31, 2005, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt reportedly said, \"I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat.\" After the ''Vanity Fair'' story broke, Woodward, Bernstein, and [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]], the ''Post''{{'}}s executive editor during Watergate, confirmed Felt's identity as Deep Throat.<ref>Woodward, Bob. ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat'', Simon & Schuster, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-8715-0}}</ref> [[L. Patrick Gray]], former acting Director of the FBI and Felt's overseer, disputed Felt's claim in his book ''In Nixon's Web'', co-written with his son Ed. Gray and others have argued that Deep Throat was a compilation of sources characterized as one person to improve sales of the book and movie. Woodward and Bernstein, however, defended Felt's claims and detailed their relationship with him in Woodward's book ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat''.\n\n==Role in the Watergate scandal==\n{{Main|Watergate scandal}}\n{{Watergate|Intelligence}}\n\nOn June 17, 1972, police arrested five men inside the offices of the [[Democratic National Committee]] in the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In their possession were $2,300 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|2300|1972|r=-2|fmt=c}} today), plastic gloves to hide fingerprints, burglary tools, a walkie-talkie and radio scanner capable of listening to police frequencies, cameras with 40 rolls of film, tear gas guns, multiple electronic devices which they intended to plant in the Democratic Committee offices, and notebooks containing the telephone number of White House official [[E. Howard Hunt]]. One of the men was [[James W. McCord Jr.]], popularly known as \"CREEP\"<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/james-mccord-jr-watergate-conspirator-who-linked-break-in-to-the-white-house-dies-at-93/2019/04/18/11c2082e-6195-11e9-9ff2-abc984dc9eec_story.html</ref>; a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] employee and a security man for Nixon's [[Committee to Re-elect the President]].\n\n''Washington Post'' reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward pursued the story for two years. The scandal eventually implicated many members of Nixon's White House, culminating in Nixon becoming the only United States president to resign. Woodward and Bernstein wrote in ''All the President's Men'' that key information in their investigation had come from an anonymous informant whom they dubbed \"Deep Throat\".\n\n===Methods of communication===\nWoodward, in ''All the President's Men'', first mentions \"Deep Throat\" on page 71; earlier in the book he reports calling \"''an old friend and sometimes source who worked for the federal government and did not like to be called at his office''\". Later, he describes him as \"''a source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP as well as at the White House''\". The book also calls him \"''an incurable gossip''\" and states \"''in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch''\", and as a man \"''whose fight had been worn out in too many battles''\".\n\nWoodward claimed that he would signal to \"Deep Throat\" that he desired a meeting by moving a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment. When \"Deep Throat\" wanted a meeting he would make special marks on page 20 of Woodward's copy of ''[[The New York Times]]''; he would circle the page number and draw clock hands to indicate the hour. They often met \"on the bottom level of an underground [[parking garage|garage]] just over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Key Bridge]] in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]]\", at 2:00 a.m. The garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard and has a historical marker that was erected in 2011. In 2014, the garage was scheduled to be demolished, though the county decided to save the historical marker, and the landowner promised to design a memorial commemorating the Watergate scandal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=|title='Deep Throat' garage from U.S. Watergate scandal to be razed|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/15/usa-watergate-garage-idUSL2N0OW0J320140615|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=Reuters|date=15 June 2014}}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the garage had not been demolished.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goff|first1=Karen|title=Monday Properties asks for more time to redevelop 'Deep Throat' garage|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/03/13/monday-properties-asks-for-more-time-to-redevelop.html|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=Washington Business Journal|date=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany were skeptical of these [[cloak and dagger]] methods. Adrian Havill investigated these claims for his 1993 [[biography]] of Woodward and Bernstein and found them to be factually impossible. He noted that Woodward's apartment 617 at 1718 P Street, Northwest, in Washington faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Havill said anyone regularly checking the balcony, as \"Deep Throat\" was said to have done daily, would have been spotted. Havill also said that copies of ''The New York Times'' were not delivered to individual apartments but delivered in an unaddressed stack at the building's reception desk. There would have been no way to know which copy was intended for Woodward. Woodward, however, has stated that in the early 1970s the interior courtyard was an alleyway and had not yet been bricked off and that his balcony was visible from street level to passing pedestrians. It was also visible, Woodward conjectured, to anyone from the FBI in surveillance of nearby embassies. Also revealed was the fact that Woodward's copy of ''The New York Times'' had his apartment number indicated on it. Former neighbor Herman Knippenberg stated that Woodward would sometimes come to his door looking for his marked copy of the ''Times'', claiming, \"I like to have it in mint condition and I like to have my own copy.\"<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10328832\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10328832 |title=New Zealand man's Deep Throat mystery solved |date=June 3, 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFurther, while Woodward stressed these precautions in his book, he also admits to having called \"Deep Throat\" on the telephone at his home. Felt's wife recalls answering Woodward's telephone calls for Felt.<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2005/07/deepthroat200507</ref>\n\n===Controversy over motives===\nIn public statements following the disclosure of his identity, Felt's family called him an \"American hero\", stating that he leaked information about the Watergate scandal to ''The Washington Post'' for moral and patriotic reasons. Other commentators, however, have speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward.\n\nIn his book ''The Secret Man'', Woodward describes Felt as a loyalist to and admirer of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. After Hoover's death, Felt became angry and disgusted when [[L. Patrick Gray]], a career naval officer and lawyer from the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division|Civil Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] had no law ''enforcement'' experience and was appointed as Director of the FBI over Felt, a 30-year veteran of the FBI. Felt was particularly unhappy with Gray's management style at the FBI, which was markedly different from Hoover's. Felt selected Woodward because he knew Woodward and Bernstein were assigned to investigate the burglary. Instead of seeking out prosecutors at the Justice Department, or the House Judiciary Committee charged with investigating presidential wrongdoing, he methodically leaked information to Woodward to guide their investigation while keeping his own identity and involvement safely concealed.\n\nSome conservatives who worked for Nixon, such as [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[G. Gordon Liddy]], castigated Felt and asserted their belief that Nixon was unfairly hounded from office,<ref name=\"traitor\">Morgan, Dan (June 1, 2005). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053101420.html \"Contemporaries Have Mixed Views\"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 31, 2005.</ref> often claiming it a \"Witch Hunt\"<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14811140/1973-07-22-witch-hunt/</ref>\n\n== Speculation concerning W. Mark Felt ==\n{{Copy edit|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Refimprove|section|date=January 2020}}\n=== Speculation within the White House ===\nAlthough confirmation of Deep Throat's identity remained elusive for over 30 years, there were suspicions that Felt was indeed the reporters' mysterious source long before the public acknowledgment in 2005. In ''Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat'', Max Holland reports that Felt leaked information to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. While the ''Post'' reporters did not reveal their source, ''Time'' correspondent Sandy Smith told ''Time''{{'}}s lawyer, [[Roswell Gilpatric]], a partner of [[Cravath, Swaine & Moore]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=119}}</ref> Gilpatric then passed the information to [[Henry E. Peterson]], the [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in the Department of Criminal Justice. In turn, Peterson revealed the information to White House Counsel [[John W. Dean]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/26/AR2005062600974.html | work=Washington Post | title=Revenge Was Felt's Motive, Former Acting FBI Chief Says | author=Michael Dobbs | date=June 27, 2005 }}</ref> who finally reported it to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=98}}</ref>\n\nNixon did not publicly acknowledge anything about learning Deep Throat's identity. Nixon claimed that if he had done so, Felt would have publicly revealed information that would damage the FBI, as well as other powerful people and institutions. In the [[Nixon White House tapes#The \"smoking_gun\" tape|\"smoking gun\" tape]], Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, stated that Felt \"knows everything there is to know in the FBI.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neikirk |first1=William |last2=Dorning |first2=Mike |title=President Called Felt a 'Traitor' in '73 |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-06-02-0506020166-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2 June 2005}}</ref> Haldeman implied that Nixon's motives for not outing Felt were not entirely altruistic, especially because Nixon may have been damaged by Felt's revelations.\n\n=== Speculation in the press and the public ===\nAmong other evidence, it had previously been revealed publicly that Deep Throat was definitely a man. Using this and other public hints, real or perceived, some members of the press and the public came to suspect Felt of being Deep Throat. For instance, [[George V. Higgins]] wrote in 1975: \"Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a ''Washington Post'' alias borrowed from a dirty movie.\"<ref>[[George V. Higgins]] (1975), ''The Friends of Richard Nixon'', 1976 reprint, New York: Ballantine, Ch. 14, p. 147, {{ISBN|978-0-345-25226-5}}.</ref> However, Woodward and Bernstein were famously tight-lipped concerning their informant's identity. Carl Bernstein did not even share Deep Throat's identity with his immediate family, which included his wife, writer [[Nora Ephron]]. As he said on NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' on June 2, 2005, \"I was never dumb enough to tell her...which was very smart because I would have told the whole world by now.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Ephron became obsessed with figuring out the secret and eventually correctly concluded that he was Mark Felt.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050603041501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 3, 2005 | work=Huffington Post | first=Nora | last=Ephron | title=Deep Throat and Me: Now It Can Be Told and Not for the First Time Either | date=May 9, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, a 19-year-old college freshman, Chase Culeman-Beckman, claimed to have been told by Bernstein's son that Mark Felt was Deep Throat. According to Culeman-Beckman, Jacob Bernstein had said that he was \"100 percent sure that Deep Throat was Mark Felt. He's someone in the FBI.\"<ref name=\"Courant\">{{cite news |last1=Daley |first1=David |title=Deep Throat |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1999-07-28-9907280810-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=The Hartford Courant |date=28 July 1999}}</ref> Jacob had reportedly said this approximately 11 years prior when he and Chase Culeman-Beckman were classmates. Ephron explained that Jacob overheard her \"speculations\"; Carl Bernstein himself also immediately stepped forward to reject the claim, as he and Woodward had done for many others.<ref name=\"Courant\"/> James Mann, who had worked at the ''Post'' at the time of Watergate and was close to the investigation, brought a great deal of evidence together in a 1992 article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.<ref>Mann, James. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199205/mann \"Deep Throat: An Institutional Analysis\"], ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 1992.</ref> Mann recalled that before  the Watergate scandal, Woodward had made references to a high-placed source he had in the FBI. Mann argued that the information that Deep Throat gave Woodward could only have come from FBI files. Felt was also embittered at having been passed over for director of the FBI and believed that the FBI, in general, was hostile to the Nixon administration. In previous unrelated articles, Woodward had made clear he had a highly placed source at the FBI, and there is some evidence he was friends with Felt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nWoodward had kept in close touch with Felt over the years, even showing up unexpectedly at his house in 1999, after Felt's [[dementia]] began and at the home of Felt's daughter, Joan, in [[Santa Rosa, California]]. Some suspected at that time that Woodward might be asking Felt if he could reveal him as Deep Throat, though Felt, when asked directly by others, had consistently denied being Deep Throat. In 2002, [[Timothy Noah]] called Felt \"the best guess going about the identity of Deep Throat\".<ref>Noah, Timothy.

Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. \"Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area,\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was published in 2002. \"He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away.

He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine.\"<ref name=\"Kessler\"/> Kessler said in his book that the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent \"credence\" to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. \"There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt&nbsp;... On May 3, 2002, the page reported that Ronald Kessler, author of ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn February 2005, Nixon's former White House Counsel, news columnist John Dean, reported that Woodward had recently informed Bradlee that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing and that Bradlee had written Deep Throat's obituary. Both Woodward and the then-current editor of ''The Washington Post'', [[Leonard Downie]], denied these claims. Felt was something of a suspect, especially after the mysterious meeting that occurred between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999. But others had received more attention over the years, such as [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Henry Kissinger]], then-Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], General [[Alexander Haig]], and before it was revealed that \"Deep Throat\" was definitely not female, [[Diane Sawyer]].\n\n=== Felt's confirmation of his identity ===\nOn May 31, 2005, ''Vanity Fair'' reported that Felt, then aged 91, claimed to be the man once known as \"Deep Throat\".<ref>{{cite news|first=John D.|last= O'Connor|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/07/deepthroat200507?printable=true&currentPage=all|title=I'm the Guy They Called Deep Throat|date=May 31, 2005|accessdate =November 28, 2008|publisher= VanityFair.com}}</ref> Later that day, Woodward, Bernstein, and Bradlee released a statement through ''The Washington Post'' confirming that the story was true. On June 2, 2005, ''The Washington Post'' ran a lengthy front-page column by Woodward in which he detailed his friendship with Felt in the years before Watergate.<ref>{{cite news|first= Bob|last= Woodward|authorlink=Bob Woodward|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060102124_pf.html|title=How Mark Felt Became 'Deep Throat'|date=June 2, 2005 |accessdate =November 28, 2008|work= [[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> Woodward wrote that he first met Felt by chance in 1970 when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant in his mid-20s who was dispatched to deliver a package to the White House's West Wing. Felt arrived soon after, for a separate appointment and sat next to Woodward in the waiting room. Woodward struck up a conversation, eventually learning of Felt's position in the upper echelon of the FBI. Woodward, who was about to get out of the Navy at the time and was unsure about his future direction in life, became determined to use Felt as a [[mentor]] and career advisor, and so he got Felt's phone number and kept in touch with him.\n\nAfter deciding to try a career as a reporter, Woodward eventually joined ''The Washington Post'' in August 1971. Felt, who Woodward writes had long had a dim view of the Nixon administration, began passing pieces of information to Woodward, although he insisted that Woodward keep the FBI and Justice Department out of anything he wrote based on the information. The first time Woodward used information from Felt in a ''Washington Post'' story was in mid-May 1972, a month before the Watergate burglary, when Woodward was reporting on [[Arthur Bremer]], who had attempted to assassinate presidential candidate [[George C. Wallace]]; Nixon had put Felt in charge of investigating the would-be assassin. A month later, just days after the Watergate break-in, Woodward would call Felt at his office, marking the first time Woodward spoke with Felt about Watergate.\n\nCommenting on Felt's motivations for serving as his Deep Throat source, Woodward wrote, \"Felt believed he was protecting the bureau by finding a way, clandestine as it was, to push some of the information from the FBI interviews and files out to the public, to help build public and political pressure to make Nixon and his people answerable. He had nothing but contempt for the Nixon White House and their efforts to manipulate the Bureau for political reasons.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} In 1980, Felt himself was convicted of ordering illegal break-ins at the homes of [[Weatherman (organization)|Weathermen]] suspects and their families. Richard Nixon testified on his behalf. President [[Ronald Reagan]] pardoned Felt and the conviction was subsequently expunged from the record.\n\n==Composite character theory==\nPrior to Felt's revelation and Woodward's confirmation, part of the reason historians and other scholars had so much difficulty in identifying the real Deep Throat is that no single person seemed to truly fit the character described in ''All the President's Men''. This had caused some scholars and commentators to come to the conclusion that Deep Throat could not possibly be a single person, and must be a composite of several sources. Woodward and Bernstein consistently denied the theory.<ref name=\"Greenberg\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=David |date=June 1, 2005 |title=Throat Clearing; Watergate conspiracy theories that still won't die. |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2005/06/throat_clearing.single.html |newspaper=Slate |location= |publisher= |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom a literary business perspective, this theory was further supported by [[David Obst]], the agent who originally marketed the draft for ''All the President's Men'', who stated that the initial typescript of the book contained absolutely no reference to Deep Throat.<ref name=\" Greenberg\"/> Obst believed that Deep Throat was invented by Woodward and Bernstein for dramatic purposes.<ref name=\" Greenberg\"/> It also led to speculation that the authors played at condensing history in the same way [[Hollywood]] scriptwriters do.<ref name=\"Greenberg\"/>\n\nEd Gray, the son of [[L. Patrick Gray III]], stated in ''In Nixon's Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate'' that his examination of Woodward's interview notes pertaining to Deep Throat at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] provided \"convincing evidence that 'Deep Throat' was indeed a fabrication\".<ref name=\" Gray & Gray\">{{cite book |last1=Gray III |first1=L.

Fielding]]. In April 2003 Fielding was presented as a potential candidate as a result of a detailed review of source material by [[William Gaines (professor)|William Gaines]] and his journalism students, as part of a class at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]] journalism school.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194614/http://archive.deepthroatuncovered.com/ Deep Throat: Uncovered] (archived), Department of Journalism, University of Illinois</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Who_Was_Deep_Throat.html Who Was Deep Throat?], ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'', December 2003</ref> Fielding was the assistant to John Dean and as such had access to the files relating to the affair. Gaines felt that statements by Woodward ruled out Deep Throat's being in the FBI and that Deep Throat often had information before the FBI did. H. R. Haldeman himself suspected Fielding as being Deep Throat.\n\nDean had been one of the most dedicated hunters of Deep Throat. Both he and [[Leonard Garment]] dismissed Fielding as a possibility, reporting that he had been cleared by Woodward in 1980 when Fielding was applying for an important position in the Reagan administration. However, this assertion, which comes from Fielding, has not been corroborated.\n\nOne reason that many experts believed that Deep Throat was Fielding and not Felt was due to Woodward's apparent denial in an interview that \"Deep Throat\" worked in the intelligence community:\n\n: LUKAS: Do you resent the implication by some critics that your sources on Watergate\u2014among them the fabled Deep Throat\u2014may have been people in the intelligence community?\n\n: WOODWARD: I resent it because it's untrue.<ref>Noah, Timothy.

Mitchell]]. More than five months before the Watergate break-in, he was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and it would have been almost impossible for him to have had access to much of the information attributed to \"Deep Throat\". In February 2005, Dean reported that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing, and Rehnquist was known to be suffering from cancer, which caused his death later that year. The report caused a resurgence of speculation that Rehnquist was \"Deep Throat\". However, Woodward later stated that the notion that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing had been a misunderstanding.\n* [[Henry Kissinger]]: Nixon's [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], was out of the country on some of the dates Woodward reported to have met with \"Deep Throat\".\n* [[George H. W. Bush]]: Was nominated in February 2005 by [[Adrian Havill]]\u2013author of a 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein, ''Deep Truth'' ({{ISBN|1-55972-172-3}})-following the unveiling of Woodward's notes at the [[the University of Texas System|University of Texas]]. Havill had argued in his biography that \"Deep Throat\" was a composite figure, but stated in a letter to ''[[Poynter Online]]'' that based on more recent events and research, he now believed \"Deep Throat\" was George H. W. Bush.\n* General [[Alexander Haig]]: Authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin speculated in their 1991 book ''Silent Coup: The Removal of a President'' that Haig may have been \"Deep Throat\". Died in 2010.\n* [[Diane Sawyer]]: Was hired by White House press secretary Ron Ziegler to serve in the Richard Nixon Administration. On his deathbed, Nixon supporter [[Baruch Korff]] wrongly claimed that Sawyer was Deep Throat.\n* [[Ben Stein]]: A Nixon speechwriter and the son of Nixon economic advisor [[Herbert Stein]]; later an [[actor]], political commentator, and [[game show host]].\n* [[Gerald R. Ford]]: Suggestion that Ford may have been Deep Throat as he was next in line for the presidency.\n* [[Pat Buchanan]]: Served as special assistant to the President, was nominated as a potential candidate by Dean in his June 2002 book ''Unmasking Deep Throat''. Buchanan repeatedly denied the claim, stating in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article on the 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in that \"The last time I cooperated with ''The Washington Post''...was in 1952, when I was a paperboy delivering the damn thing in Northwest Washington.\" Buchanan was very interested in the mystery, however, and had a number of theories. He was most sympathetic to the idea of a composite Deep Throat.\n* [[Richard Nixon]] himself: There was some suggestion that Nixon had used back-channels to communicate with Woodward in a bizarre attempt to showcase his persecution by the media which backfired horrifically. This theory was largely discredited.\n* [[J. Fred Buzhardt]]: White House counsel to President Nixon.\n* [[G. Gordon Liddy]]: Member of the [[White House Plumbers]]. Largely dismissed.\n\n==Fictional portrayals==\n===Audio dramas===\n* 3Sol used the name Deep Throat to lure Tyler Steele to his attempted assassination in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]'s ''[[Torchwood (audio drama series)#Aliens Among Us (2017\u201318)|Torchwood: Aliens Among Us 1]]''.\n\n===Films===\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] portrayed Deep Throat in the film adaptation of ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976), in which he uttered the catchphrase, \"[[Follow the money]]\".\n* In the comedy film ''[[Dick (film)|Dick]]'' (1999), Deep Throat is revealed as being two teenage Washingtonian girls, portrayed by [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], who worked as Nixon's dog walkers.\n* In the Nickelodeon animated film ''[[Hey Arnold!: The Movie]]'' (2002), Helga Pataki takes on a similar role under the guise of Deep Voice. She is a shadowy character who aids Arnold and Gerald in trying to save the neighborhood from the evil developer Alphonse Perrier du von Scheck through a series of anonymous phone calls and cryptic advice. At the end of the film, her identity is revealed, and she finally confesses her love to Arnold and successfully saves the neighborhood.\n* In the [[Spy film|spy]] [[thriller film]] ''[[Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House]]'' (2017), [[Liam Neeson]] portrays Mark Felt.\n\n===Games===\n*In the video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'' (1998), the cyborg ninja informant [[Gray Fox (Metal Gear)|Gray Fox]] goes by the name Deepthroat until revealing his identity to protagonist [[Solid Snake]].\n**Similarly, in the sequel, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' (2001), the name is briefly assumed by [[List of Metal Gear characters#Olga Gurlukovich|Olga Gurlukovich]], until the protagonist [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] realizes her connection to Gray Fox of the previous game, at which point she uses the less explicit name \"Mr. X\", instead.\n\n===Literature===\n* In Terry Pratchett's   [[Discworld]] novel ''The Truth'' (2000), in a reference to or parody of Deep Throat, the talking dog Gaspode takes on the role of Deep Bone, acting as an informant to the novel's protagonist William de Worde regarding the attempted framing of Patrician Vetinari.\n\n===Television===\n* In the ''[[Fairly OddParents]]'' episode \"[[Channel Chasers]]\", Tootie uses the \"Deep Toot\" undercover persona to help out Mr. and Mrs. Turner against Vicky.\n*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Deep Throats]]\", [[Kermit the Frog]] plays a similar role to provide evidence of [[Mayor West|Mayor Adam West]]'s corruption to [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]].\n*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]\", [[Waylon Smithers]] played a similar role to Deep Throat's when covertly helping the Simpson children find a way to depose the newly elected mayor of Springfield, Sideshow Bob (he even paraphrased one of Deep Throat's statements).\n*''[[The X-Files]]'' featured an informant who was identified by the name \"[[Deep Throat (The X-Files)|Deep Throat]]\".  This \"Deep Throat\" leaked secret government information to the series character [[Agent Mulder]] in a manner similar to the meetings described by Woodward. The character never identified himself as \"Deep Throat\"\u2014the name was used by other characters when referring to him.  It was never specifically mentioned whether he was initially intended to be the same Deep Throat from Watergate; eventually, the character was revealed to be a government official named Ronald Pakula.\n* In season 1 of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', Perry White has a government contact called Sore Throat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0635154/|title=Honeymoon in Metropolis|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n*In ''[[Frasier]]'', season 4 episode 11 \"[[Three Days of the Condo]]\", [[Frasier Crane|Frasier]] meets a secretive informant in an underground parking garage who supplies him with information.\n*In the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Drippy Pony\", there is a sketch where a shadowed man approaches a man in a parking garage.

Since its first show in 1948, Farnborough has seen the debut of many famous planes, including the [[Vickers VC10]], [[Concorde]], the [[Eurofighter]], the Airbus [[A380]], and the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter]]. At the 1958 show, the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]\u2019s [[Black Arrows]] executed a 22-plane formation loop, setting a world record.\n\nThe international trade show is put together every two years by FIL Farnborough International Ltd. and takes over the entire course of a week. Trade visitors attend on the first five days and the weekend is reserved for the general public. Programming takes place at the Farnborough Airfield, which lies roughly 50 kilometres south-west of London.<ref>{{cite web |title=Farnborough International Airshow UK Overview |url=https://trade-fair-trips.com/exhibitions/farnborough-international-airshow |website=trade-fair-trips.com |accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref> \n\n==Status==\nThe Farnborough International Airshow is the second-largest show of its kind after the [[Paris Air Show]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2017-11-08/2017-dubai-airshow-expected-be-largest-yet |title= 2017 Dubai Airshow Expected To Be Largest Yet |author= Peter Shaw-Smith |date= November 8, 2017 |work= AIN}}</ref> It is a biennial week-long  event to demonstrate civilian and military aircraft to potential customers and investors, and to announce new developments and orders.\n\nThe event is held in mid-July in even-numbered years at [[Farnborough Airport]] in [[Hampshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. Flying occurs on all five days, and there are also static displays of aircraft outside and booths and stands in the indoor exhibition halls. The airshow alternates with the Paris Air Show, which is held in odd-numbered years and has a similar format, and is held in the same years as the [[ILA Berlin Air Show|Berlin Air Show]]. It is organised by Farnborough International Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[ADS Group]].
