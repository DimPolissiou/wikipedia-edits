{"title_page": "Joseph Strutt (MP)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2016}}\n'''Joseph Holden Strutt''' (21 November 1758 \u2013 11/18 February 1845), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] soldier and long-standing [[Member of Parliament]]. He served in the Army and achieved the rank of [[Colonel]], and also sat as Member of Parliament for [[Maldon (UK Parliament constituency)|Maldon]] from 1790 to 1826 and for [[Okehampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Okehampton]] from 1826 to 1830.\n\n== Education ==\n[[Felsted School|Felsted schoo]]<nowiki/>l; [[Winchester College|Winchester]] 1768; [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] 1778.\n\n== Family ==\nStrutt was the 2nd son of [[John Strutt (1727\u20131816)|John Strutt]] of Terling Place by Anne, daughter of Reverend William Goodday, rector of [[Strelley, Nottinghamshire]]. His elder brother John died in 1781.\n\nHe married [[Charlotte Strutt, 1st Baroness Rayleigh|Lady Charlotte FitzGerald]], daughter of [[James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster]], and [[Emily FitzGerald, Duchess of Leinster|Lady Emily Lennox]], in [[Toulouse]] on 21/23 February 1789. With her he had one son and two daughters.\n\n== Military career ==\nStrutt was Lieutenant Colonel of the western battalion of the Essex militia from 1783\u201396, Colonel of the South Essex militia in 1798, 1803-5 and 1809, and West Essex militia 1823\u201331;\n\nWhen the supplementary militia was reduced, Strutt offered [[William Pitt the Younger]], and subsequently [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Henry Addington]], his services in raising a regiment: the advent of peace rendered his offer superfluous.\n\n== Parliamentary career ==\nStrutt returned from France to contest his father's seat in Maldon on the latter's retirement in 1790. A mostly silent but conscientious parliamentarian, Strutt made little mark in Parliament; but, he set great store by his and his father's services to government in Essex, where his father was \u2018a constitutional pillar\u2019 and where Strutt was active as a militia colonel. They were proudly insistent that Maldon was \u2018a county, not a borough interest\u2019 and, waiving pretensions to a county seat, resisted moves by government to influence Maldon elections.<ref>C.

However, when he was offered a British peerage in 1821 for his services in the Army and Parliament he proposed that the honour be given to his wife, Charlotte, [[suo jure|in her own right]] as [[Baroness Rayleigh]].\n\nAfter a peerage for his wife had been granted as one of the coronation creations in 1821, Strutt, returning thanks to Liverpool, described the honour as \u2018requiting the long constitutional conduct in and out of Parliament of my ... father and of my humble constant exertions within the sphere of a country gentleman\u2019.<ref>Add. 38575, ff. 8, 10; Strutt, 50-51; Lord Rayleigh, ''Baron Rayleigh'', 5.</ref> However, Lady Rayleigh died in 1836 and Strutt survived her by nine years, which gave his son precedence of rank over him.\n\n== Death ==\nIn his declining years he was consoled and nursed by his unmarried daughter Emily Anne (1790-1865), for whose future comfort he bought in 1840 [[St Catherine's Court|St. Catherine's Court]], near Bath, where he mostly spent the last five years of his life.<ref>Sir W.

As a result of such wholesale adoption of radically-different ideas, the changes to Japan were profound, and affected its social structure, internal politics, economy, military, and foreign relations. The period corresponded to the reign of [[Emperor Meiji]]. It was preceded by the [[Kei\u014d]] era and was succeeded by the [[Taish\u014d]] era, upon the accession of [[Emperor Taish\u014d]].\n\n== Meiji Restoration ==\n{{main|Meiji Restoration}} \n{{see also|Abolition of the han system}}\n\nOn February 3, 1867, the 14-year-old [[Emperor Meiji|Prince Mutsuhito]] succeeded his father, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]], to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] as the 122nd emperor.\n\nOn November 9, 1867, then-''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] tendered his resignation to the Emperor, and formally stepped down ten days later.<ref>Takano, p. 256.</ref> [[Meiji Restoration|Imperial restoration]] occurred the next year on January 3, 1868, with the formation of [[Meiji government|the new government]]. The [[fall of Edo]] in the summer of 1868 marked the end of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and a new era, ''Meiji'', was proclaimed.\n\nThe first reform was the promulgation of the [[Five Charter Oath]] in 1868, a general statement of the aims of the [[Meiji oligarchy|Meiji leaders]] to boost morale and win financial support for the [[Government of Meiji Japan|new government]]. Its five provisions consisted of:\n\n1. Deliberative assembly shall be widely established and all matters decided by public discussion\n\n2. All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying out the administration of the affairs of state\n\n3. The common people, no less than the civil and military of officials, shall each be allowed to pursue his own calling so that there may be no discontent. \n\n4. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything based upon the just laws of nature.\n\n5. Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of imperial rule\n\n\nImplicit in the Charter Oath was an end to exclusive political rule by the [[sh\u014dgun|bakufu]] (a ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s direct administration including officers), and a move toward more democratic participation in government. To implement the Charter Oath, a rather short-lived constitution with eleven articles was drawn up in June 1868. Besides providing for a new [[Daij\u014d-kan|Council of State]], legislative bodies, and systems of ranks for nobles and officials, it limited office tenure to four years, allowed public balloting, provided for a new taxation system, and ordered new local administrative rules.\n\n[[File:MeijiJoukyou.jpg|thumb|left|The fifteen-year-old [[Meiji Emperor]], moving from [[Kyoto]] to Tokyo at the end of 1868, after the [[fall of Edo]]]]\n\nThe Meiji government assured the foreign powers that it would follow the old treaties negotiated by the bakufu and announced that it would act in accordance with international law. Mutsuhito, who was to reign until 1912, selected a new reign title\u2014''Meiji'', or Enlightened Rule\u2014to mark the beginning of a new era in Japanese history. To further dramatize the new order, the capital was relocated from [[Kyoto]], where it had been situated since 794, to [[Tokyo]] (Eastern Capital), the new name for [[Edo]]. In a move critical for the consolidation of the new regime, most ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' voluntarily surrendered their land and census records to the Emperor in the [[Abolition of the han system|abolition of the Han system]], symbolizing that the land and people were under the Emperor's jurisdiction.\n\nConfirmed in their hereditary positions, the daimyo became governors, and the central government assumed their administrative expenses and paid [[samurai]] stipends. The han were replaced with [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] in 1871, and authority continued to flow to the national government. Officials from the favored former han, such as [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]], [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]], [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], and [[Hizen]] staffed the new ministries. Formerly [[Kuge|old court nobles]], and lower-ranking but more radical samurai, replaced bakufu appointees and daimyo as a new ruling class appeared.\n\n[[File:Meiji tenno1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Meiji]] in his fifties.]]\n\nIn as much as the Meiji Restoration had sought to return the Emperor to a preeminent position, efforts were made to establish a [[Shinto]]-oriented state much like it was 1,000 years earlier. Since Shinto and Buddhism [[Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d|had molded into a syncretic belief]] in the prior one-thousand years and Buddhism had been closely connected with the shogunate, this involved the separation of Shinto and Buddhism ([[shinbutsu bunri]]) and the associated destruction of various Buddhist temples and related violence ([[haibutsu kishaku]]). Furthermore, a new [[State Shinto]] had to be constructed for the purpose. In 1871, the [[Office of Shinto Worship]] ([[:ja:\u795e\u7947\u7701]]) was established, ranking even above the Council of State in importance. The ''[[kokutai]]'' ideas of the Mito school were embraced, and the divine ancestry of the [[Imperial Household of Japan|Imperial House]] was emphasized. The government supported Shinto teachers, a small but important move. Although the Office of Shinto Worship was demoted in 1872, by 1877 the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Ministry]] controlled all Shinto shrines and certain Shinto sects were given state recognition. Shinto was released from Buddhist administration and its properties restored. Although Buddhism suffered from state sponsorship of Shinto, it had its own resurgence. Christianity also was legalized, and Confucianism remained an important ethical doctrine. Increasingly, however, Japanese thinkers identified with Western ideology and methods.\n\n== Politics ==\n{{main|Meiji oligarchy|Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji Constitution}}\n\nA major proponent of representative government was [[Itagaki Taisuke]] (1837\u20131919), a powerful [[Tosa Province|Tosa]] leader who had resigned from the Council of State over the [[Seikanron|Korean affair]] in 1873. Itagaki sought peaceful, rather than rebellious, means to gain a voice in government. He started a school and a movement aimed at establishing a [[constitutional monarchy]] and a [[legislative assembly]]. Such movements were called [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|The Freedom and People's Rights Movement]]. Itagaki and others wrote the [[Tosa Memorial]] ([[:ja:\u6c11\u64b0\u8b70\u9662\u8a2d\u7acb\u5efa\u767d\u66f8]]) in 1874, criticizing the unbridled power of the oligarchy and calling for the immediate establishment of representative government.\n\nBetween 1871 and 1873, a series of [[Land Tax Reform (Japan 1873)|land and tax laws]] were enacted as the basis for modern fiscal policy. Private ownership was legalized, deeds were issued, and lands were assessed at fair market value with taxes paid in cash rather than in kind as in pre-Meiji days and at slightly lower rates.\n\nDissatisfied with the pace of reform after having rejoined the Council of State in 1875, Itagaki organized his followers and other democratic proponents into the nationwide [[Aikokusha]] (Society of Patriots) to push for representative government in 1878. In 1881, in an action for which he is best known, Itagaki helped found the [[Liberal Party of Japan (1881)|Jiy\u016bt\u014d]] (Liberal Party), which favored French political doctrines.\n\n[[File:Japanese Parliament in session.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of [[National Diet]], showing Minister speaking at the tribune from which members address the House.]]\n\nIn 1882, [[\u014ckuma Shigenobu]] established the [[Rikken Kaishint\u014d]] (Constitutional Progressive Party), which called for a British-style constitutional democracy. In response, government bureaucrats, local government officials, and other conservatives established the [[Rikken Teiseit\u014d]] (Imperial Rule Party), a pro-government party, in 1882. Numerous political demonstrations followed, some of them violent, resulting in further government restrictions. The restrictions hindered the political parties and led to divisions within and among them. The Jiy\u016bt\u014d, which had opposed the Kaishinto, was disbanded in 1884 and \u014ckuma resigned as Kaishint\u014d president.\n\nGovernment leaders, long preoccupied with violent threats to stability and the serious leadership split over the Korean affair, generally agreed that [[constitutional government]] should someday be established. The [[Nagato Province|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] leader [[Kido Takayoshi]] had favored a constitutional form of government since before 1874, and several proposals for constitutional guarantees had been drafted. While acknowledging the realities of political pressure, however, the oligarchy was determined to keep control. Thus, modest steps were taken.\n\nThe Osaka Conference in 1875 resulted in the reorganization of government with an independent judiciary and an appointed [[Chamber of Elders]] (Genr\u014din) tasked with reviewing proposals for a legislature. The Emperor declared that \"constitutional government shall be established in gradual stages\" as he ordered the [[Genr\u014d|Council of Elders]] to draft a constitution.\n\nThree years later, the Conference of Prefectural Governors established elected prefectural assemblies. Although limited in their authority, these assemblies represented a move in the direction of representative government at the national level, and by 1880 assemblies also had been formed in villages and towns. In 1880 delegates from twenty-four prefectures held a national convention to establish the [[League for the Establishment of a National Assembly|Kokkai Kisei D\u014dmei]].\n\nAlthough the government was not opposed to parliamentary rule, confronted with the drive for \"people's rights\", it continued to try to control the political situation. New laws in 1875 prohibited press criticism of the government or discussion of national laws. The [[Public Assembly Law, 1880|Public Assembly Law]] (1880) severely limited public gatherings by disallowing attendance by civil servants and requiring police permission for all meetings.\n\nWithin the ruling circle, however, and despite the conservative approach of the leadership, Okuma continued as a lone advocate of British-style government, a government with political parties and a cabinet organized by the majority party, answerable to the national assembly. He called for elections to be held by 1882 and for a national assembly to be convened by 1883; in doing so, he precipitated a political crisis that ended with an 1881 imperial rescript declaring the establishment of a national assembly in 1890 and dismissing Okuma.\n\nRejecting the British model, [[Iwakura Tomomi|Iwakura]] and other conservatives borrowed heavily from the [[Constitution of the German Empire|Prussian constitutional system]]. One of the Meiji oligarchy, [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] (1841\u20131909), a Ch\u014dsh\u016b native long involved in government affairs, was charged with drafting Japan's constitution. He led a constitutional study mission abroad in 1882, spending most of his time in Germany. He rejected the [[United States Constitution]] as \"too liberal\", and the British system as too unwieldy, and having a parliament with too much control over the monarchy; the French and Spanish models were rejected as tending toward despotism.\n\nIto was put in charge of the new Bureau for Investigation of Constitutional Systems in 1884, and the Council of State was replaced in 1885 with a cabinet headed by Ito as prime minister. The positions of chancellor (or chief-minister), [[Sadaijin|minister of the left]], and [[Udaijin|minister of the right]], which had existed since the seventh century as advisory positions to the Emperor, were all abolished. In their place, the [[Privy Council of Japan|Privy Council]] was established in 1888 to evaluate the forthcoming constitution and to advise the Emperor.\n\nTo further strengthen the authority of the State, the Supreme War Council was established under the leadership of [[Yamagata Aritomo]] (1838\u20131922), a Ch\u014dsh\u016b native who has been credited with the founding of the modern Japanese army and was to become the first constitutional [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. The [[Supreme War Council (Japan)|Supreme War Council]] developed a German-style general staff system with a chief of staff who had direct access to the Emperor and who could operate independently of the army minister and civilian officials.\n\nThe [[Meiji Constitution|Constitution of the Empire of Japan]] was enacted on November 29, 1890.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Meiji-Constitution|title=Meiji Constitution {{!}} 1889, Japan|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}</ref> It was a form of mixed [[Constitutional_monarchy|constitutional]] and [[absolute monarchy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hein|first1=Patrick|title=How the Japanese became foreign to themselves : the impact of globalization on the private and public spheres in Japan|date=2009|publisher=Lit|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3643100856|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5QJsvhHwjVMC&lpg=PA72&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The [[Emperor of Japan]] was legally the [[Supreme leader|supreme leader]], and the Cabinet were his followers. The Prime Minister would be elected by a [[Privy Council of Japan|Privy Council]]. In reality, the Emperor was [[head of state]] but the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] was the actual head of government. \n\nClass distinctions were mostly eliminated during modernization to create a [[representative democracy]]. The [[samurai]] lost their status as the only class with military privileges. However, during the [[Meiji period]], most leaders in Japanese society (politics, business and military) were ex-samurai or descendants of [[samurai]]. \n\nThe 1889 [[Constitution of the Empire of Japan|Meiji Constitution]] made relatively small concessions to [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|civil rights]] and parliamentary mechanisms. Party participation was recognized as part of the political process. The Emperor shared his authority and give rights and liberties to his subjects. It provided for the Imperial Diet (Teikoku Gikai), composed of a popularly elected [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] with a very limited franchise of male citizens who were over twenty-five years of age and paid fifteen yen in national taxes (approximately 1% of the population). The [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] was composed of nobility and imperial appointees. A cabinet was responsible to the Emperor and independent of the legislature. The Diet could approve government legislation and initiate laws, make representations to the government, and submit petitions to the Emperor. The Meiji Constitution lasted as the fundamental law until 1947. \n\nIn the early years of constitutional government, the strengths and weaknesses of the Meiji Constitution were revealed. A small clique of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] elite continued to rule Japan, becoming institutionalized as an extra-constitutional body of [[genr\u014d]] (elder statesmen). Collectively, the genro made decisions reserved for the Emperor, and the genro, not the Emperor, controlled the government politically.\n\nThroughout the period, however, political problems usually were solved through compromise, and political parties gradually increased their power over the government and held an ever-larger role in the political process as a result. Between 1891 and 1895, Ito served as Prime Minister with a cabinet composed mostly of genro who wanted to establish a government party to control the House of Representatives. Although not fully realized, the trend toward party politics was well established.\n\n== Society ==\n{{expand section|with=an overview of art and design style changes in the Meiji era, and their indelible influence on (and later recursively by) European [[Art Nouveau]]|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:Ginza in 1880s.JPG|thumb|[[Ginza]] in 1880s.]]\n[[File:Iwakura und Damen.jpg|thumb|Japanese of the era (circa 1872).]]\n\nOn its return, one of the first acts of the government was to establish new ranks for the nobility. Five hundred people from the old court nobility, former daimyo, and samurai who had provided valuable service to the Emperor were organized into a new peerage, the [[Kazoku]], consisting of five ranks: prince, [[Marquess|marquis]], [[count]], [[viscount]], and [[baron]].\n\nIn the transition between the [[Edo period]] and the Meiji era, the [[Ee ja nai ka]] movement, a spontaneous outbreak of ecstatic behavior, took place.\n\nIn 1885, noted public intellectual [[Yukichi Fukuzawa]] wrote the influential essay \"[[Datsu-A Ron|Leaving Asia]]\", arguing that Japan should orient itself at the \"civilized countries of the West\", leaving behind the \"hopelessly backward\" Asian neighbors, namely [[Korea]] and China. This essay certainly encouraged the economic and technological rise of Japan in the Meiji era, but it also may have laid the intellectual foundations for later Japanese [[colonialism]] in the region.\n\nThe Meiji era saw a flowering of public discourse on the direction of Japan. Works like [[Nakae Ch\u014dmin]]'s A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government<ref>Nakae, C. and Tsukui, N. and Hammond, J. A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government. 1984.</ref> debated how best to blend the new influences coming from the West with local Japanese culture. Grassroots movements like the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]] called for the establishment of a formal legislature, civil rights, and greater pluralism in the Japanese political system. Journalists, politicians, and writers actively participated in the movement, which attracted an array of interest groups, including women's rights activists.<ref>Hane, M. Reflections on the Way to the Gallows: Rebel Women in Prewar Japan. University of California Press. 1988.</ref>\n\nThe elite class of the Meiji era adapted many aspects of Victorian taste, as seen in the construction of Western-style pavilions and reception rooms called ''y\u014dkan or y\u014dma'' in their homes. These parts of Meiji homes were displayed in popular magazines of the time, such as ''Ladies' Graphic,'' which portrayed the often empty rooms of the homes of the aristocracy of all levels, including the imperial palaces. Integrating Western cultural forms with an assumed, untouched native Japanese spirit was characteristic of Meiji society, especially at the top levels, and represented Japan's search for a place within a new world power system in which European colonial empires dominated.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Was Meiji Taste in Interiors \"Orientalist?\"|last = Sand|first = Jordan|date = 2000|journal = Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique|publisher = Duke University Press|issue = 3|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pos/summary/v008/8.3sand.html|volume = 8|pages = 637\u2013673|doi = 10.1215/10679847-8-3-637}}</ref>\n\n=== Fashion ===\n[[File:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|thumb|right|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}), 1880\u20131890, the [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\nThe production of [[kimono]] started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]]'s descriptions of Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles.

The industrial revolution began about 1870 as Meiji era leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (O-yatoi gaikokujin).\n\nIn 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the US to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1877, used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories.\n\nModern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.<ref>G.C. Allen, Short Economic History of Modern Japan (1972)</ref>  Due to the importing of new textile manufacturing technology from Europe, between 1886 and 1897, Japan's total value of yarn output rose from 12 million to 176 million yen. In 1886, 62% of yarn in Japan was imported; by 1902, most yarn was produced locally. By 1913, Japan was producing 672 million pounds of yarn per year, becoming the fourth largest exporter of cotton yarn.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor|last=Landes|first=David S.|publisher=Norton|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=379\u201380}}</ref>\n\nThe first railway was opened between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1872; and railway was rapidly developed throughout Japan well into the twentieth century. The introduction of railway transportation led to more efficient production due to the decline in transport costs; allowing for manufacturing firms to move into more populated interior regions of Japan in search for labour input. The railway also enabled a new-found access to raw materials that had previously been too difficult or costly to transport.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=John P.|date=September 2014|title=Railroad Expansion and Industrialization: Evidence from Meiji Japan|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume= 74|issue=3|pages=863\u2013886|via=CRKN Cambridge University Press Journals|doi=10.1017/S002205071400062X}}</ref>\n\nThere were at least two reasons for the speed of Japan's modernization: the employment of more than 3,000 foreign experts (called ''[[o-yatoi gaikokujin]]'' or 'hired foreigners') in a variety of specialist fields such as teaching English, science, engineering, the army and navy, among others; and the dispatch of many Japanese students overseas to Europe and America, based on the fifth and last article of the Charter Oath of 1868: 'Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of Imperial rule.' This process of modernization was closely monitored and heavily subsidized by the Meiji government, enhancing the power of the great [[zaibatsu]] firms such as [[Mitsui]] and [[Mitsubishi]].\n\nHand in hand, the zaibatsu and government guided the nation, borrowing technology from the West. Japan gradually took control of much of Asia's market for manufactured goods, beginning with textiles. The economic structure became very [[mercantilism|mercantilistic]], importing raw materials and exporting finished products\u2014a reflection of Japan's relative poverty in raw materials.\n\nJapan emerged from the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]]\u2013[[Emperor of Japan|Tenn\u014d]] ([[Kei\u014d]]\u2013Meiji) transition in 1868 as the first Asian industrialized nation. Domestic commercial activities and limited foreign trade had met the demands for material culture until the Kei\u014d era, but the modernized Meiji era had radically different requirements. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced the concept of a market economy and adopted British and North American forms of free enterprise capitalism. The private sector\u2014in a nation with an abundance of aggressive entrepreneurs\u2014welcomed such change.\n\n[[File:Tokyo Industrial Exhibition.JPG|thumb|1907 Tokyo Industrial Exhibition]]\n\nEconomic reforms included a unified modern currency based on the yen, banking, commercial and tax laws, stock exchanges, and a communications network. Establishment of a modern institutional framework conducive to an advanced capitalist economy took time, but was completed by the 1890s. By this time, the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process, primarily for budgetary reasons.\n\nMany of the former daimyo, whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum, benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries. Those who had been informally involved in foreign trade before the Meiji Restoration also flourished. Old bakufu-serving firms that clung to their traditional ways failed in the new business environment.\n\nThe government initially was involved in economic modernization, providing a number of \"model factories\" to facilitate the transition to the modern era. After the first twenty years of the Meiji era, the industrial economy expanded rapidly until about 1920 with inputs of advanced Western technology and large private investments. Stimulated by wars and through cautious economic planning, Japan emerged from World War I as a major industrial nation.\n\nIn 1885, the Meiji government sponsored a telegraph system, throughout Japan, situating the telegraphs in all major Japanese cities at the time.\n\n== Military ==\n{{main|Japanese military modernization of 1868\u20131931|Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese Navy}}\n\n===Overview===\nUndeterred by opposition, the Meiji leaders continued to modernize the nation through government-sponsored telegraph cable links to all major Japanese cities and the Asian mainland and construction of railroads, shipyards, munitions factories, mines, textile manufacturing facilities, factories, and experimental agriculture stations. Greatly concerned about national security, the leaders made significant efforts at military modernization, which included establishing a small standing army, a large reserve system, and compulsory militia service for all men. Foreign military systems were studied, foreign advisers, especially French ones, were brought in, and Japanese cadets sent abroad to Europe and the United States to attend military and naval schools.\n\n===Early Meiji period (1868\u201377)===\nIn 1854, after Admiral Matthew C. Perry forced the signing of the [[Treaty of Kanagawa]], Japanese elites took the position that they needed to modernize the state's military capacities, or risk further coercion from Western powers.<ref>Gordon (2000).</ref> The Tokugawa shogunate did not officially share this point of view, however, as evidenced by the imprisonment of the Governor of Nagasaki, Shanan Takushima for voicing his views of military reform and weapons modernization.<ref name=gs08>GlobalSecurity.org (2008).</ref>\n\nIn 1868, the Japanese government established the Tokyo Arsenal. This arsenal was responsible for the development and manufacture of small arms and associated ammunition.<ref name=gs08/> The same year, [[\u014cmura Masujir\u014d]] established Japan's first military academy in Kyoto. \u014cmura further proposed military [[billets]] be filled by all classes of people including farmers and merchants. The ''sh\u014dgun'' class,{{clarify|reason=Thre was a \"sh\u014dgun class\"?|date=January 2018}} not happy with \u014cmura's views on conscription, assassinated him the following year.<ref>Shinsengumihq.com, n.d.</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Japan expanded its military production base by opening another arsenal in Osaka. The Osaka Arsenal was responsible for the production of machine guns and ammunition.<ref>National Diet Library (2008).</ref> Also, four gunpowder facilities also were opened at this site. Japan's production capacity gradually expanded.\n\nIn 1872, Yamagata Aritomo and [[Saig\u014d J\u016bd\u014d]], both new field marshals, founded the Corps of the Imperial Guards. This corps was composed of the warrior classes from the [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]], and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] clans.<ref name=gs08/> Also, in the same year, the hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years, when in January the Conscription Law of 1873 was passed. This law required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves.<ref name=gs08/> This monumental law, signifying the beginning of the end for the samurai class, initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki (blood tax) literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. Avoidance methods included maiming, self-mutilation, and local uprisings.{{sfn|Kublin|1949|p=32}} The samurai were generally resentful of the new, western-style military and at first, refused to stand in formation with the peasant class.<ref name=gs08/>\n\n[[File:MikadoWithFrenchMission.jpg|thumb|Emperor Meiji receives the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1872\u20131880)|second French Military Mission to Japan]] (1872).]]\n\nIn conjunction with the new conscription law, the Japanese government began modeling their ground forces after the French military. Indeed, the new Japanese army used the same rank structure as the French.{{sfn|Kublin|1949|p=31}} The enlisted corps ranks were: private, noncommissioned officers, and officers. The private classes were: j\u014dt\u014d-hei or upper soldier, itt\u014d-sotsu or first-class soldier, and nit\u014d-sotsu or second-class soldier. The noncommissioned officer class ranks were: goch\u014d or corporal, guns\u014d or sergeant, s\u014dch\u014d or sergeant major, and tokumu-s\u014dch\u014d or special sergeant major. Finally, the officer class is made up of: sh\u014di or second lieutenant, ch\u016bi or first lieutenant, tai or captain, sh\u014dsa or major, ch\u016bsa or lieutenant colonel, taisa or colonel, sh\u014dsh\u014d or major general, ch\u016bj\u014d or lieutenant general, taish\u014d or general, and gensui or field marshal.<ref name=gs08/> The French government also contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks.<ref name=gs08/>\n\nDespite the Conscription Law of 1873, and all the reforms and progress, the new Japanese army was still untested. That all changed in 1877, when [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] led the last rebellion of the samurai in Ky\u016bsh\u016b. In February 1877, Saig\u014d left Kagoshima with a small contingent of soldiers on a journey to Tokyo. Kumamoto castle was the site of the first major engagement when garrisoned forces fired on Saig\u014d's army as they attempted to force their way into the castle. Rather than leave an enemy behind him, Saig\u014d laid siege to the castle. Two days later, Saig\u014d's rebels, while attempting to block a mountain pass, encountered advanced elements of the national army en route to reinforce Kumamoto castle. After a short battle, both sides withdrew to reconstitute their forces. A few weeks later the national army engaged Saig\u014d's rebels in a frontal assault at what now is called the Battle of Tabaruzuka. During this eight-day-battle, Saig\u014d's nearly ten thousand strong army battled hand-to-hand the equally matched national army. Both sides suffered nearly four thousand casualties during this engagement. Due to conscription, however, the Japanese army was able to reconstitute its forces, while Saig\u014d's was not. Later, forces loyal to the emperor broke through rebel lines and managed to end the siege on [[Kumamoto Castle]] after fifty-four days. Saig\u014d's troops fled north and were pursued by the national army. The national army caught up with Saig\u014d at Mt. [[Enodake]]. Saig\u014d's army was outnumbered seven-to-one, prompting a mass surrender of many samurai. The remaining five hundred samurai loyal to Saig\u014d escaped, travelling south to Kagoshima.  The rebellion ended on September 24, 1877, following the final engagement with Imperial forces which resulted in the deaths of the remaining forty samurai including Saig\u014d, who, having suffered a fatal bullet wound in the abdomen, was honourably beheaded by his retainer. The national army's victory validated the current course of the modernization of the Japanese army as well as ended the era of the samurai.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n{{main|Foreign relations of Meiji Japan}}\n\nWhen the United States Navy ended Japan's [[Sakoku|sakoku policy]], and thus its isolation, the latter found itself defenseless against military pressures and economic exploitation by the Western powers. For Japan to emerge from the feudal period, it had to avoid the colonial fate of other Asian countries by establishing genuine national independence and equality. Following the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident]], Japan released the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident|Chinese coolies from a western ship]] in 1872, after which the [[Qing dynasty|Qing imperial government of China]] gave thanks to Japan.\n\nFollowing Japan's victory over China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895), Japan broke through as an international power with a victory against Russia in [[Manchuria]] (north-eastern China) in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. Allied with Britain since the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] signed in London on January 30, 1902, Japan joined the Allies in World War I, seizing German-held territory in China and the Pacific in the process, but otherwise remained largely out of the conflict.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], a weakened Europe left a greater share in international markets to the United States and Japan, which emerged greatly strengthened. Japanese competition made great inroads into hitherto-European-dominated markets in Asia, not only in China, but even in European colonies such as India and [[Indonesia]], reflecting the development of the Meiji era.\n\nThe final years of the Meiji era were also marked by the annexation of [[Korea]] in 1911; Japan's [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupation]] of the peninsula nation would persist until Japan's loss in [[World War II]] in 1945, during the middle of the [[Sh\u014dwa period]], and would have lasting negative repercussions on foreign relations between Japan and [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]].\n\n==Conversion table==\nTo convert any [[Gregorian calendar]] year between 1868 and 1912 to [[Japanese calendar]] year in Meiji era, 1867 needs to be subtracted from the year in question.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Meiji|| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15\n|-\n|AD|| 1868 || 1869 || 1870 || 1871 || 1872 || 1873 || 1874 || 1875 || 1876 || 1877 || 1878 || 1879 || 1880 || 1881 || 1882\n|-\n!Meiji|| 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28 || 29 || 30\n|-\n|AD|| 1883 || 1884 || 1885 || 1886 || 1887 || 1888 || 1889 || 1890 || 1891 || 1892 || 1893 || 1894 || 1895 || 1896 || 1897\n|-\n!Meiji|| 31 || 32 || 33 || 34 || 35 || 36 || 37 || 38 || 39 || 40 || 41 || 42 || 43 || 44 || 45\n|-\n|AD|| 1898 || 1899 || 1900 || 1901 || 1902 || 1903 || 1904 || 1905 || 1906 || 1907 || 1908 || 1909 || 1910 || 1911 || 1912\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Japan|History}}\n* [[Japanese nationalism]]\n* [[List of political figures of Meiji Japan]]\n* [[Amakusa coalfield]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{loc}}\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0080440118000063|title=Castles and the Militarisation of Urban Society in Imperial Japan|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|volume=28|pages=107\u2013134|year=2018|last1=Benesch|first1=Oleg|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/133333/1/Benesch_Castles_and_the_Militarisation_of_Urban_Society_in_Imperial_Japan_TRHS_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf|access-date=November 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120055147/http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/133333/1/Benesch_Castles_and_the_Militarisation_of_Urban_Society_in_Imperial_Japan_TRHS_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf|archive-date=November 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}\n* GlobalSecurity.org (2008).

As a result of such wholesale adoption of radically-different ideas, the changes to Japan were profound, and affected its social structure, internal politics, economy, military, and foreign relations. The period corresponded to the reign of [[Emperor Meiji]]. It was preceded by the [[Kei\u014d]] era and was succeeded by the [[Taish\u014d]] era, upon the accession of [[Emperor Taish\u014d]].\n\n== Meiji Restoration ==\n{{main|Meiji Restoration}} \n{{see also|Abolition of the han system}}\n\nOn February 3, 1867, the 14-year-old [[Emperor Meiji|Prince Mutsuhito]] succeeded his father, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]], to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] as the 122nd emperor.\n\nOn November 9, 1867, then-''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] tendered his resignation to the Emperor, and formally stepped down ten days later.<ref>Takano, p. 256.</ref> [[Meiji Restoration|Imperial restoration]] occurred the next year on January 3, 1868, with the formation of [[Meiji government|the new government]]. The [[fall of Edo]] in the summer of 1868 marked the end of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and a new era, ''Meiji'', was proclaimed.\n\nThe first reform was the promulgation of the [[Five Charter Oath]] in 1868, a general statement of the aims of the [[Meiji oligarchy|Meiji leaders]] to boost morale and win financial support for the [[Government of Meiji Japan|new government]]. Its five provisions consisted of:\n\n1. Deliberative assembly shall be widely established and all matters decided by public discussion\n\n2. All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying out the administration of the affairs of state\n\n3. The common people, no less than the civil and military of officials, shall each be allowed to pursue his own calling so that there may be no discontent. \n\n4. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything based upon the just laws of nature.\n\n5. Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of imperial rule\n\n\nImplicit in the Charter Oath was an end to exclusive political rule by the [[sh\u014dgun|bakufu]] (a ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s direct administration including officers), and a move toward more democratic participation in government. To implement the Charter Oath, a rather short-lived constitution with eleven articles was drawn up in June 1868. Besides providing for a new [[Daij\u014d-kan|Council of State]], legislative bodies, and systems of ranks for nobles and officials, it limited office tenure to four years, allowed public balloting, provided for a new taxation system, and ordered new local administrative rules.\n\n[[File:MeijiJoukyou.jpg|thumb|left|The fifteen-year-old [[Meiji Emperor]], moving from [[Kyoto]] to Tokyo at the end of 1868, after the [[fall of Edo]]]]\n\nThe Meiji government assured the foreign powers that it would follow the old treaties negotiated by the bakufu and announced that it would act in accordance with international law. Mutsuhito, who was to reign until 1912, selected a new reign title\u2014''Meiji'', or Enlightened Rule\u2014to mark the beginning of a new era in Japanese history. To further dramatize the new order, the capital was relocated from [[Kyoto]], where it had been situated since 794, to [[Tokyo]] (Eastern Capital), the new name for [[Edo]]. In a move critical for the consolidation of the new regime, most ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' voluntarily surrendered their land and census records to the Emperor in the [[Abolition of the han system|abolition of the Han system]], symbolizing that the land and people were under the Emperor's jurisdiction.\n\nConfirmed in their hereditary positions, the daimyo became governors, and the central government assumed their administrative expenses and paid [[samurai]] stipends. The han were replaced with [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] in 1871, and authority continued to flow to the national government. Officials from the favored former han, such as [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]], [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]], [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], and [[Hizen]] staffed the new ministries. Formerly [[Kuge|old court nobles]], and lower-ranking but more radical samurai, replaced bakufu appointees and daimyo as a new ruling class appeared.\n\n[[File:Meiji tenno1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Meiji]] in his fifties.]]\n\nIn as much as the Meiji Restoration had sought to return the Emperor to a preeminent position, efforts were made to establish a [[Shinto]]-oriented state much like it was 1,000 years earlier. Since Shinto and Buddhism [[Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d|had molded into a syncretic belief]] in the prior one-thousand years and Buddhism had been closely connected with the shogunate, this involved the separation of Shinto and Buddhism ([[shinbutsu bunri]]) and the associated destruction of various Buddhist temples and related violence ([[haibutsu kishaku]]). Furthermore, a new [[State Shinto]] had to be constructed for the purpose. In 1871, the [[Office of Shinto Worship]] ([[:ja:\u795e\u7947\u7701]]) was established, ranking even above the Council of State in importance. The ''[[kokutai]]'' ideas of the Mito school were embraced, and the divine ancestry of the [[Imperial Household of Japan|Imperial House]] was emphasized. The government supported Shinto teachers, a small but important move. Although the Office of Shinto Worship was demoted in 1872, by 1877 the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Ministry]] controlled all Shinto shrines and certain Shinto sects were given state recognition. Shinto was released from Buddhist administration and its properties restored. Although Buddhism suffered from state sponsorship of Shinto, it had its own resurgence. Christianity also was legalized, and Confucianism remained an important ethical doctrine. Increasingly, however, Japanese thinkers identified with Western ideology and methods.\n\n== Politics ==\n{{main|Meiji oligarchy|Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji Constitution}}\n\nA major proponent of representative government was [[Itagaki Taisuke]] (1837\u20131919), a powerful [[Tosa Province|Tosa]] leader who had resigned from the Council of State over the [[Seikanron|Korean affair]] in 1873. Itagaki sought peaceful, rather than rebellious, means to gain a voice in government. He started a school and a movement aimed at establishing a [[constitutional monarchy]] and a [[legislative assembly]]. Such movements were called [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|The Freedom and People's Rights Movement]]. Itagaki and others wrote the [[Tosa Memorial]] ([[:ja:\u6c11\u64b0\u8b70\u9662\u8a2d\u7acb\u5efa\u767d\u66f8]]) in 1874, criticizing the unbridled power of the oligarchy and calling for the immediate establishment of representative government.\n\nBetween 1871 and 1873, a series of [[Land Tax Reform (Japan 1873)|land and tax laws]] were enacted as the basis for modern fiscal policy. Private ownership was legalized, deeds were issued, and lands were assessed at fair market value with taxes paid in cash rather than in kind as in pre-Meiji days and at slightly lower rates.\n\nDissatisfied with the pace of reform after having rejoined the Council of State in 1875, Itagaki organized his followers and other democratic proponents into the nationwide [[Aikokusha]] (Society of Patriots) to push for representative government in 1878. In 1881, in an action for which he is best known, Itagaki helped found the [[Liberal Party of Japan (1881)|Jiy\u016bt\u014d]] (Liberal Party), which favored French political doctrines.\n\n[[File:Japanese Parliament in session.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of [[National Diet]], showing Minister speaking at the tribune from which members address the House.]]\n\nIn 1882, [[\u014ckuma Shigenobu]] established the [[Rikken Kaishint\u014d]] (Constitutional Progressive Party), which called for a British-style constitutional democracy. In response, government bureaucrats, local government officials, and other conservatives established the [[Rikken Teiseit\u014d]] (Imperial Rule Party), a pro-government party, in 1882. Numerous political demonstrations followed, some of them violent, resulting in further government restrictions. The restrictions hindered the political parties and led to divisions within and among them. The Jiy\u016bt\u014d, which had opposed the Kaishinto, was disbanded in 1884 and \u014ckuma resigned as Kaishint\u014d president.\n\nGovernment leaders, long preoccupied with violent threats to stability and the serious leadership split over the Korean affair, generally agreed that [[constitutional government]] should someday be established. The [[Nagato Province|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] leader [[Kido Takayoshi]] had favored a constitutional form of government since before 1874, and several proposals for constitutional guarantees had been drafted. While acknowledging the realities of political pressure, however, the oligarchy was determined to keep control. Thus, modest steps were taken.\n\nThe Osaka Conference in 1875 resulted in the reorganization of government with an independent judiciary and an appointed [[Chamber of Elders]] (Genr\u014din) tasked with reviewing proposals for a legislature. The Emperor declared that \"constitutional government shall be established in gradual stages\" as he ordered the [[Genr\u014d|Council of Elders]] to draft a constitution.\n\nThree years later, the Conference of Prefectural Governors established elected prefectural assemblies. Although limited in their authority, these assemblies represented a move in the direction of representative government at the national level, and by 1880 assemblies also had been formed in villages and towns. In 1880 delegates from twenty-four prefectures held a national convention to establish the [[League for the Establishment of a National Assembly|Kokkai Kisei D\u014dmei]].\n\nAlthough the government was not opposed to parliamentary rule, confronted with the drive for \"people's rights\", it continued to try to control the political situation. New laws in 1875 prohibited press criticism of the government or discussion of national laws. The [[Public Assembly Law, 1880|Public Assembly Law]] (1880) severely limited public gatherings by disallowing attendance by civil servants and requiring police permission for all meetings.\n\nWithin the ruling circle, however, and despite the conservative approach of the leadership, Okuma continued as a lone advocate of British-style government, a government with political parties and a cabinet organized by the majority party, answerable to the national assembly. He called for elections to be held by 1882 and for a national assembly to be convened by 1883; in doing so, he precipitated a political crisis that ended with an 1881 imperial rescript declaring the establishment of a national assembly in 1890 and dismissing Okuma.\n\nRejecting the British model, [[Iwakura Tomomi|Iwakura]] and other conservatives borrowed heavily from the [[Constitution of the German Empire|Prussian constitutional system]]. One of the Meiji oligarchy, [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] (1841\u20131909), a Ch\u014dsh\u016b native long involved in government affairs, was charged with drafting Japan's constitution. He led a constitutional study mission abroad in 1882, spending most of his time in Germany. He rejected the [[United States Constitution]] as \"too liberal\", and the British system as too unwieldy, and having a parliament with too much control over the monarchy; the French and Spanish models were rejected as tending toward despotism.\n\nIto was put in charge of the new Bureau for Investigation of Constitutional Systems in 1884, and the Council of State was replaced in 1885 with a cabinet headed by Ito as prime minister. The positions of chancellor (or chief-minister), [[Sadaijin|minister of the left]], and [[Udaijin|minister of the right]], which had existed since the seventh century as advisory positions to the Emperor, were all abolished. In their place, the [[Privy Council of Japan|Privy Council]] was established in 1888 to evaluate the forthcoming constitution and to advise the Emperor.\n\nTo further strengthen the authority of the State, the Supreme War Council was established under the leadership of [[Yamagata Aritomo]] (1838\u20131922), a Ch\u014dsh\u016b native who has been credited with the founding of the modern Japanese army and was to become the first constitutional [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. The [[Supreme War Council (Japan)|Supreme War Council]] developed a German-style general staff system with a chief of staff who had direct access to the Emperor and who could operate independently of the army minister and civilian officials.\n\nThe [[Meiji Constitution|Constitution of the Empire of Japan]] was enacted on November 29, 1890.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Meiji-Constitution|title=Meiji Constitution {{!}} 1889, Japan|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}</ref> It was a form of mixed [[Constitutional_monarchy|constitutional]] and [[absolute monarchy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hein|first1=Patrick|title=How the Japanese became foreign to themselves : the impact of globalization on the private and public spheres in Japan|date=2009|publisher=Lit|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3643100856|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5QJsvhHwjVMC&lpg=PA72&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The [[Emperor of Japan]] was legally the [[Supreme leader|supreme leader]], and the Cabinet were his followers. The Prime Minister would be elected by a [[Privy Council of Japan|Privy Council]]. In reality, the Emperor was [[head of state]] but the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] was the actual head of government. \n\nClass distinctions were mostly eliminated during modernization to create a [[representative democracy]]. The [[samurai]] lost their status as the only class with military privileges. However, during the [[Meiji period]], most leaders in Japanese society (politics, business and military) were ex-samurai or descendants of [[samurai]]. \n\nThe 1889 [[Constitution of the Empire of Japan|Meiji Constitution]] made relatively small concessions to [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|civil rights]] and parliamentary mechanisms. Party participation was recognized as part of the political process. The Emperor shared his authority and give rights and liberties to his subjects. It provided for the Imperial Diet (Teikoku Gikai), composed of a popularly elected [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] with a very limited franchise of male citizens who were over twenty-five years of age and paid fifteen yen in national taxes (approximately 1% of the population). The [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] was composed of nobility and imperial appointees. A cabinet was responsible to the Emperor and independent of the legislature. The Diet could approve government legislation and initiate laws, make representations to the government, and submit petitions to the Emperor. The Meiji Constitution lasted as the fundamental law until 1947. \n\nIn the early years of constitutional government, the strengths and weaknesses of the Meiji Constitution were revealed. A small clique of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] elite continued to rule Japan, becoming institutionalized as an extra-constitutional body of [[genr\u014d]] (elder statesmen). Collectively, the genro made decisions reserved for the Emperor, and the genro, not the Emperor, controlled the government politically.\n\nThroughout the period, however, political problems usually were solved through compromise, and political parties gradually increased their power over the government and held an ever-larger role in the political process as a result. Between 1891 and 1895, Ito served as Prime Minister with a cabinet composed mostly of genro who wanted to establish a government party to control the House of Representatives. Although not fully realized, the trend toward party politics was well established.\n\n== Society ==\n{{expand section|with=an overview of art and design style changes in the Meiji era, and their indelible influence on (and later recursively by) European [[Art Nouveau]]|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:Ginza in 1880s.JPG|thumb|[[Ginza]] in 1880s.]]\n[[File:Iwakura und Damen.jpg|thumb|Japanese of the era (circa 1872).]]\n\nOn its return, one of the first acts of the government was to establish new ranks for the nobility. Five hundred people from the old court nobility, former daimyo, and samurai who had provided valuable service to the Emperor were organized into a new peerage, the [[Kazoku]], consisting of five ranks: prince, [[Marquess|marquis]], [[count]], [[viscount]], and [[baron]].\n\nIn the transition between the [[Edo period]] and the Meiji era, the [[Ee ja nai ka]] movement, a spontaneous outbreak of ecstatic behavior, took place.\n\nIn 1885, noted public intellectual [[Yukichi Fukuzawa]] wrote the influential essay \"[[Datsu-A Ron|Leaving Asia]]\", arguing that Japan should orient itself at the \"civilized countries of the West\", leaving behind the \"hopelessly backward\" Asian neighbors, namely [[Korea]] and China. This essay certainly encouraged the economic and technological rise of Japan in the Meiji era, but it also may have laid the intellectual foundations for later Japanese [[colonialism]] in the region.\n\nThe Meiji era saw a flowering of public discourse on the direction of Japan. Works like [[Nakae Ch\u014dmin]]'s A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government<ref>Nakae, C. and Tsukui, N. and Hammond, J. A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government. 1984.</ref> debated how best to blend the new influences coming from the West with local Japanese culture. Grassroots movements like the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]] called for the establishment of a formal legislature, civil rights, and greater pluralism in the Japanese political system. Journalists, politicians, and writers actively participated in the movement, which attracted an array of interest groups, including women's rights activists.<ref>Hane, M. Reflections on the Way to the Gallows: Rebel Women in Prewar Japan. University of California Press. 1988.</ref>\n\nThe elite class of the Meiji era adapted many aspects of Victorian taste, as seen in the construction of Western-style pavilions and reception rooms called ''y\u014dkan or y\u014dma'' in their homes. These parts of Meiji homes were displayed in popular magazines of the time, such as ''Ladies' Graphic,'' which portrayed the often empty rooms of the homes of the aristocracy of all levels, including the imperial palaces. Integrating Western cultural forms with an assumed, untouched native Japanese spirit was characteristic of Meiji society, especially at the top levels, and represented Japan's search for a place within a new world power system in which European colonial empires dominated.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Was Meiji Taste in Interiors \"Orientalist?\"|last = Sand|first = Jordan|date = 2000|journal = Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique|publisher = Duke University Press|issue = 3|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pos/summary/v008/8.3sand.html|volume = 8|pages = 637\u2013673|doi = 10.1215/10679847-8-3-637}}</ref>\n\n=== Fashion ===\n[[File:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|thumb|right|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}), 1880\u20131890, the [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\nThe production of [[kimono]] started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]]'s descriptions of Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles.

The industrial revolution began about 1870 as Meiji era leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (O-yatoi gaikokujin).\n\nIn 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the US to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1877, used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories.\n\nModern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.<ref>G.C. Allen, Short Economic History of Modern Japan (1972)</ref>  Due to the importing of new textile manufacturing technology from Europe, between 1886 and 1897, Japan's total value of yarn output rose from 12 million to 176 million yen. In 1886, 62% of yarn in Japan was imported; by 1902, most yarn was produced locally. By 1913, Japan was producing 672 million pounds of yarn per year, becoming the fourth largest exporter of cotton yarn.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor|last=Landes|first=David S.|publisher=Norton|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=379\u201380}}</ref>\n\nThe first railway was opened between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1872; and railway was rapidly developed throughout Japan well into the twentieth century. The introduction of railway transportation led to more efficient production due to the decline in transport costs; allowing for manufacturing firms to move into more populated interior regions of Japan in search for labour input. The railway also enabled a new-found access to raw materials that had previously been too difficult or costly to transport.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=John P.|date=September 2014|title=Railroad Expansion and Industrialization: Evidence from Meiji Japan|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume= 74|issue=3|pages=863\u2013886|via=CRKN Cambridge University Press Journals|doi=10.1017/S002205071400062X}}</ref>\n\nThere were at least two reasons for the speed of Japan's modernization: the employment of more than 3,000 foreign experts (called ''[[o-yatoi gaikokujin]]'' or 'hired foreigners') in a variety of specialist fields such as teaching English, science, engineering, the army and navy, among others; and the dispatch of many Japanese students overseas to Europe and America, based on the fifth and last article of the Charter Oath of 1868: 'Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of Imperial rule.' This process of modernization was closely monitored and heavily subsidized by the Meiji government, enhancing the power of the great [[zaibatsu]] firms such as [[Mitsui]] and [[Mitsubishi]].\n\nHand in hand, the zaibatsu and government guided the nation, borrowing technology from the West. Japan gradually took control of much of Asia's market for manufactured goods, beginning with textiles. The economic structure became very [[mercantilism|mercantilistic]], importing raw materials and exporting finished products\u2014a reflection of Japan's relative poverty in raw materials.\n\nJapan emerged from the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]]\u2013[[Emperor of Japan|Tenn\u014d]] ([[Kei\u014d]]\u2013Meiji) transition in 1868 as the first Asian industrialized nation. Domestic commercial activities and limited foreign trade had met the demands for material culture until the Kei\u014d era, but the modernized Meiji era had radically different requirements. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced the concept of a market economy and adopted British and North American forms of free enterprise capitalism. The private sector\u2014in a nation with an abundance of aggressive entrepreneurs\u2014welcomed such change.\n\n[[File:Tokyo Industrial Exhibition.JPG|thumb|1907 Tokyo Industrial Exhibition]]\n\nEconomic reforms included a unified modern currency based on the yen, banking, commercial and tax laws, stock exchanges, and a communications network. Establishment of a modern institutional framework conducive to an advanced capitalist economy took time, but was completed by the 1890s. By this time, the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process, primarily for budgetary reasons.\n\nMany of the former daimyo, whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum, benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries. Those who had been informally involved in foreign trade before the Meiji Restoration also flourished. Old bakufu-serving firms that clung to their traditional ways failed in the new business environment.\n\nThe government initially was involved in economic modernization, providing a number of \"model factories\" to facilitate the transition to the modern era. After the first twenty years of the Meiji era, the industrial economy expanded rapidly until about 1920 with inputs of advanced Western technology and large private investments. Stimulated by wars and through cautious economic planning, Japan emerged from World War I as a major industrial nation.\n\nIn 1885, the Meiji government sponsored a telegraph system, throughout Japan, situating the telegraphs in all major Japanese cities at the time.\n\n== Military ==\n{{main|Japanese military modernization of 1868\u20131931|Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese Navy}}\n\n===Overview===\nUndeterred by opposition, the Meiji leaders continued to modernize the nation through government-sponsored telegraph cable links to all major Japanese cities and the Asian mainland and construction of railroads, shipyards, munitions factories, mines, textile manufacturing facilities, factories, and experimental agriculture stations. Greatly concerned about national security, the leaders made significant efforts at military modernization, which included establishing a small standing army, a large reserve system, and compulsory militia service for all men. Foreign military systems were studied, foreign advisers, especially French ones, were brought in, and Japanese cadets sent abroad to Europe and the United States to attend military and naval schools.\n\n===Early Meiji period (1868\u201377)===\nIn 1854, after Admiral Matthew C. Perry forced the signing of the [[Treaty of Kanagawa]], Japanese elites took the position that they needed to modernize the state's military capacities, or risk further coercion from Western powers.<ref>Gordon (2000).</ref> The Tokugawa shogunate did not officially share this point of view, however, as evidenced by the imprisonment of the Governor of Nagasaki, Shanan Takushima for voicing his views of military reform and weapons modernization.<ref name=gs08>GlobalSecurity.org (2008).</ref>\n\nIn 1868, the Japanese government established the Tokyo Arsenal. This arsenal was responsible for the development and manufacture of small arms and associated ammunition.<ref name=gs08/> The same year, [[\u014cmura Masujir\u014d]] established Japan's first military academy in Kyoto. \u014cmura further proposed military [[billets]] be filled by all classes of people including farmers and merchants. The ''sh\u014dgun'' class,{{clarify|reason=Thre was a \"sh\u014dgun class\"?|date=January 2018}} not happy with \u014cmura's views on conscription, assassinated him the following year.<ref>Shinsengumihq.com, n.d.</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Japan expanded its military production base by opening another arsenal in Osaka. The Osaka Arsenal was responsible for the production of machine guns and ammunition.<ref>National Diet Library (2008).</ref> Also, four gunpowder facilities also were opened at this site. Japan's production capacity gradually expanded.\n\nIn 1872, Yamagata Aritomo and [[Saig\u014d J\u016bd\u014d]], both new field marshals, founded the Corps of the Imperial Guards. This corps was composed of the warrior classes from the [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]], and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] clans.<ref name=gs08/> Also, in the same year, the hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years, when in January the Conscription Law of 1873 was passed. This law required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves.<ref name=gs08/> This monumental law, signifying the beginning of the end for the samurai class, initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki (blood tax) literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. Avoidance methods included maiming, self-mutilation, and local uprisings.<ref>Kublin (1949) p.32.</ref>  The samurai were generally resentful of the new, western-style military and at first, refused to stand in formation with the peasant class.<ref name=gs08/>\n\n[[File:MikadoWithFrenchMission.jpg|thumb|Emperor Meiji receives the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1872\u20131880)|second French Military Mission to Japan]] (1872).]]\n\nIn conjunction with the new conscription law, the Japanese government began modeling their ground forces after the French military. Indeed, the new Japanese army used the same rank structure as the French.<ref>Kublin (1949) p.31.</ref> The enlisted corps ranks were: private, noncommissioned officers, and officers. The private classes were: j\u014dt\u014d-hei or upper soldier, itt\u014d-sotsu or first-class soldier, and nit\u014d-sotsu or second-class soldier. The noncommissioned officer class ranks were: goch\u014d or corporal, guns\u014d or sergeant, s\u014dch\u014d or sergeant major, and tokumu-s\u014dch\u014d or special sergeant major. Finally, the officer class is made up of: sh\u014di or second lieutenant, ch\u016bi or first lieutenant, tai or captain, sh\u014dsa or major, ch\u016bsa or lieutenant colonel, taisa or colonel, sh\u014dsh\u014d or major general, ch\u016bj\u014d or lieutenant general, taish\u014d or general, and gensui or field marshal.<ref name=gs08/> The French government also contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks.<ref name=gs08/>\n\nDespite the Conscription Law of 1873, and all the reforms and progress, the new Japanese army was still untested. That all changed in 1877, when [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] led the last rebellion of the samurai in Ky\u016bsh\u016b. In February 1877, Saig\u014d left Kagoshima with a small contingent of soldiers on a journey to Tokyo. Kumamoto castle was the site of the first major engagement when garrisoned forces fired on Saig\u014d's army as they attempted to force their way into the castle. Rather than leave an enemy behind him, Saig\u014d laid siege to the castle. Two days later, Saig\u014d's rebels, while attempting to block a mountain pass, encountered advanced elements of the national army en route to reinforce Kumamoto castle. After a short battle, both sides withdrew to reconstitute their forces. A few weeks later the national army engaged Saig\u014d's rebels in a frontal assault at what now is called the Battle of Tabaruzuka. During this eight-day-battle, Saig\u014d's nearly ten thousand strong army battled hand-to-hand the equally matched national army. Both sides suffered nearly four thousand casualties during this engagement. Due to conscription, however, the Japanese army was able to reconstitute its forces, while Saig\u014d's was not. Later, forces loyal to the emperor broke through rebel lines and managed to end the siege on [[Kumamoto Castle]] after fifty-four days. Saig\u014d's troops fled north and were pursued by the national army. The national army caught up with Saig\u014d at Mt. [[Enodake]]. Saig\u014d's army was outnumbered seven-to-one, prompting a mass surrender of many samurai. The remaining five hundred samurai loyal to Saig\u014d escaped, travelling south to Kagoshima.  The rebellion ended on September 24, 1877, following the final engagement with Imperial forces which resulted in the deaths of the remaining forty samurai including Saig\u014d, who, having suffered a fatal bullet wound in the abdomen, was honourably beheaded by his retainer. The national army's victory validated the current course of the modernization of the Japanese army as well as ended the era of the samurai.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n{{main|Foreign relations of Meiji Japan}}\n\nWhen the United States Navy ended Japan's [[Sakoku|sakoku policy]], and thus its isolation, the latter found itself defenseless against military pressures and economic exploitation by the Western powers. For Japan to emerge from the feudal period, it had to avoid the colonial fate of other Asian countries by establishing genuine national independence and equality. Following the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident]], Japan released the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident|Chinese coolies from a western ship]] in 1872, after which the [[Qing dynasty|Qing imperial government of China]] gave thanks to Japan.\n\nFollowing Japan's victory over China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895), Japan broke through as an international power with a victory against Russia in [[Manchuria]] (north-eastern China) in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. Allied with Britain since the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] signed in London on January 30, 1902, Japan joined the Allies in World War I, seizing German-held territory in China and the Pacific in the process, but otherwise remained largely out of the conflict.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], a weakened Europe left a greater share in international markets to the United States and Japan, which emerged greatly strengthened. Japanese competition made great inroads into hitherto-European-dominated markets in Asia, not only in China, but even in European colonies such as India and [[Indonesia]], reflecting the development of the Meiji era.\n\nThe final years of the Meiji era were also marked by the annexation of [[Korea]] in 1911; Japan's [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupation]] of the peninsula nation would persist until Japan's loss in [[World War II]] in 1945, during the middle of the [[Sh\u014dwa period]], and would have lasting negative repercussions on foreign relations between Japan and [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]].\n\n==Conversion table==\nTo convert any [[Gregorian calendar]] year between 1868 and 1912 to [[Japanese calendar]] year in Meiji era, 1867 needs to be subtracted from the year in question.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Meiji|| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15\n|-\n|AD|| 1868 || 1869 || 1870 || 1871 || 1872 || 1873 || 1874 || 1875 || 1876 || 1877 || 1878 || 1879 || 1880 || 1881 || 1882\n|-\n!Meiji|| 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28 || 29 || 30\n|-\n|AD|| 1883 || 1884 || 1885 || 1886 || 1887 || 1888 || 1889 || 1890 || 1891 || 1892 || 1893 || 1894 || 1895 || 1896 || 1897\n|-\n!Meiji|| 31 || 32 || 33 || 34 || 35 || 36 || 37 || 38 || 39 || 40 || 41 || 42 || 43 || 44 || 45\n|-\n|AD|| 1898 || 1899 || 1900 || 1901 || 1902 || 1903 || 1904 || 1905 || 1906 || 1907 || 1908 || 1909 || 1910 || 1911 || 1912\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Japan|History}}\n* [[Japanese nationalism]]\n* [[List of political figures of Meiji Japan]]\n* [[Amakusa coalfield]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{loc}}\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0080440118000063|title=Castles and the Militarisation of Urban Society in Imperial Japan|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|volume=28|pages=107\u2013134|year=2018|last1=Benesch|first1=Oleg|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/133333/1/Benesch_Castles_and_the_Militarisation_of_Urban_Society_in_Imperial_Japan_TRHS_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf|access-date=November 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120055147/http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/133333/1/Benesch_Castles_and_the_Militarisation_of_Urban_Society_in_Imperial_Japan_TRHS_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf|archive-date=November 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}\n* GlobalSecurity.org (2008).

Opened in 1852, the Devil's Island system received convicts from the [[Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni]]. All had been deported from all parts of the [[Second French Empire]], and was infamous for its harsh treatment of detainees, with a death rate of 75% at their worst, until it was closed down in 1953.<ref name=\"toth\"/> Devil's Island was notorious for being used for the [[internal exile]] of French [[political prisoner]]s, with the most famous being Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]].<ref name=\"prison closure date\">{{cite web|year=1981 |url=http://www.trivia-library.com/b/famous-lasts-the-last-prisoner-on-devil-island.htm |title=The Last Prisoner on Devil's Island |accessdate=2012-04-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720041238/http://www.trivia-library.com/b/famous-lasts-the-last-prisoner-on-devil-island.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 }} Excerpt from the ''People's Almanac'', posted at \"trivia-library.com. Archive.org</ref><ref>http://www.prisonhistory.net/famous-prisons/devils-island/</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe prison system stretched over several locations, on the mainland and in the off-shore [[Salvation's Islands]]. [[\u00cele Royale]] was the reception centre for the general population of the [[penal colony]]; they were housed in moderate freedom due to the difficulty of escape from the island. [[Saint-Joseph Island]] was the ''Reclusion'', where inmates were sent to be punished by solitary confinement in silence and darkness for escapes or offences committed in the penal colony. [[Devil's Island (Kourou)|Devil's Island]] was for political prisoners. In the 19th century, the most famous such prisoner was Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]]. In addition to the prisons on each of the three islands in the Salut island group, the French constructed three related prison facilities on the South American mainland, just across the straits at [[Kourou#The Prisons|Kourou]]; {{convert|50|km|mi|sigfig=1}} east in [[Cayenne]], which later became the capital of French Guiana; and {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} west at [[Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni|St.&nbsp;Laurent]].\n\n==Early penal system==\n[[Image:Lebreton engraving-09-hulk.jpg|thumb|A prison hulk in [[Toulon]] harbour.]]\nPrisoners convicted of felonies in the 17th and 18th centuries were sentenced to serve as oarsmen in the French [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] [[galley]] fleet. Given the harsh conditions, this was virtually a death sentence. Following the decommissioning of the Mediterranean galley fleet in 1666, the majority of prisoners were paired together in chains aboard galley [[Hulk (ship type)|hulks]] (''bagnes'') moored in French harbours until the barges rotted and sank. The prisoners were moved to live on the adjacent pontoons. Prisoners relied on charity or their families for food, bedding and clothing. They were required to work 12 hours a day in the docks, earning 10-15 centimes, which they could spend on food and wine. Other prisoners were housed in prisons onshore, where conditions were apparently so bad that many prisoners would beg to be transferred to the hulks.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the French urban population had increased from under six million to over 16 million,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with a commensurate increase in crime. In 1832 legislation was passed mandating the state's provision of basic necessities to prisoners; however, prison reform changed the previous reliance on corporal punishment to imprisonment with a goal of vengeance and deterrence, with imprisonment considered a way to remove offenders from society. [[Recidivism]] of up to 75% had become a major problem; unemployed released prisoners began flooding the cities. In the 1840s, the state set up internal agricultural penal colonies as a place to receive prisoners, thereby removing them from urban environments and giving them employment. Prisoners were commonly sentenced under ''doublage'' by which, on completion of their sentence, they were required to work as employees at the penal colony for an additional period equal to their original sentence.<ref name = \"toth\">Toth, Stephen (2006) ''Beyond Papillon: The French Overseas Penal Colonies, 1854-(666),'' University of Nebraska Press {{ISBN|9780803244498}}</ref>\n\nThe French Navy, which had been tasked with managing the prison hulks, complained strongly about the cost of guarding the hulks and the disruption they caused to the shipyards. Following his coup in 1851, [[Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon&nbsp;III]] ordered that the hulks be permanently closed and that [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] convicts be transferred overseas to colonies. Debate over where the convicts would be sent was prolonged. [[Algeria]] was ruled out by the Navy as it was controlled by the French Army; [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Texas]] were considered, but the government eventually chose [[French Guiana]].\n\nFrance had repeatedly failed since 1604 to colonize French Guiana. The last attempt at colonization was in 1763, and 75% of the 12,000 colonists that had been sent there died in their first year. By the 1850s, the declining number of survivors were on the brink of extinction. In 1852, Napoleon called for volunteer prisoners from the hulks to transfer to the new ''Bagne de Cayenne'' (Cayennes penal colony) at French Guiana; 3,000 convicts applied. Two categories of prisoners were eligible for transportation: ''transport\u00e9s,'' those civil-law prisoners sentenced under ''doublage,'' and ''d\u00e9port\u00e9s,'' prisoners convicted of political crimes, such as espionage or conspiracy. The hulks continued to be used, housing an average of 5,400 prisoners at a time, until they were finally closed around the end of the 19th century. The agricultural penal colonies continued to be used for juveniles until the last was closed in 1939.<ref name = \"toth\"/>\n\n==Use as penal colony==\nThe islands were part of a penal colony from 1852 onwards for criminals of France, who were convicted by juries rather than [[magistrate]]s. The main part of the penal colony was a labor camp that stretched along the border with Dutch Guiana (present-day [[Suriname]]). This penal colony was controversial as it had a reputation for harshness and brutality. Prisoner-on-prisoner violence was common; tropical diseases were rife. Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was; they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight.  This system was gradually phased out and has been completely shut down since 1953. Since the late 20th century, the islands have been tourist destinations. The islands were featured in the book ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' (1969), published as a memoir by [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]], a former prisoner who escaped.\n\nDevil's Island and associated prisons eventually became one of the most infamous prison systems in history. While the prison system was in use (1852\u20131953),<ref name = \"prison closure date\"/> inmates included [[political prisoner]]s (such as 239&nbsp;republicans who opposed [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|Napoleon III's coup d'\u00e9tat]] in 1851) and the most hardened of thieves and murderers. The vast majority of the more than 80,000&nbsp;prisoners sent to the Devil's Island prison system never made it back to France.  Many died due to disease and harsh conditions. Sanitary systems were limited, and the region was mosquito-infested, with [[endemic]] tropical diseases. The only exit from the island prisons was by water, and few convicts escaped.\n\nConvicts who were lucky enough to have family or friends willing to send them money had to have it sent to them in care of a prison guard. The standard practice was for the guard to keep for himself a quarter of the amount sent and give the rest to the prisoner.\n\nOn 30 May 1854, France passed a new law of forced residency.  It required convicts to stay in French Guiana after completion of sentence for a time equal to their forced labour time. If the original sentence exceeded eight years, they were forced to stay as residents for the remainder of their lives and were provided land to settle on.

Opened in 1852, the Devil's Island system received convicts from the [[Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni]].

Archive.org</ref><ref>http://www.prisonhistory.net/famous-prisons/devils-island/</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe prison system stretched over several locations, on the mainland and in the off-shore [[Salvation's Islands]]. [[\u00cele Royale]] was the reception centre for the general population of the [[penal colony]]; they were housed in moderate freedom due to the difficulty of escape from the island. [[Saint-Joseph Island]] was the ''Reclusion'', where inmates were sent to be punished by solitary confinement in silence and darkness for escapes or offences committed in the penal colony. [[Devil's Island (Kourou)|Devil's Island]] was for political prisoners. In the 19th century, the most famous such prisoner was Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]]. In addition to the prisons on each of the three islands in the Salut island group, the French constructed three related prison facilities on the South American mainland, just across the straits at [[Kourou#The Prisons|Kourou]]; {{convert|50|km|mi|sigfig=1}} east in [[Cayenne]], which later became the capital of French Guiana; and {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} west at [[Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni|St.&nbsp;Laurent]].\n\n==Early penal system==\n[[Image:Lebreton engraving-09-hulk.jpg|thumb|A prison hulk in [[Toulon]] harbour.]]\nPrisoners convicted of felonies in the 17th and 18th centuries were sentenced to serve as oarsmen in the French [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] [[galley]] fleet. Given the harsh conditions, this was virtually a death sentence. Following the decommissioning of the Mediterranean galley fleet in 1666, the majority of prisoners were paired together in chains aboard galley [[Hulk (ship type)|hulks]] (''bagnes'') moored in French harbours until the barges rotted and sank. The prisoners were moved to live on the adjacent pontoons. Prisoners relied on charity or their families for food, bedding and clothing. They were required to work 12 hours a day in the docks, earning 10-15 centimes, which they could spend on food and wine. Other prisoners were housed in prisons onshore, where conditions were apparently so bad that many prisoners would beg to be transferred to the hulks.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the French urban population had increased from under six million to over 16 million,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with a commensurate increase in crime. In 1832 legislation was passed mandating the state's provision of basic necessities to prisoners; however, prison reform changed the previous reliance on corporal punishment to imprisonment with a goal of vengeance and deterrence, with imprisonment considered a way to remove offenders from society. [[Recidivism]] of up to 75% had become a major problem; unemployed released prisoners began flooding the cities. In the 1840s, the state set up internal agricultural penal colonies as a place to receive prisoners, thereby removing them from urban environments and giving them employment. Prisoners were commonly sentenced under ''doublage'' by which, on completion of their sentence, they were required to work as employees at the penal colony for an additional period equal to their original sentence.<ref name = \"toth\">Toth, Stephen (2006) ''Beyond Papillon: The French Overseas Penal Colonies, 1854-(666),'' University of Nebraska Press {{ISBN|9780803244498}}</ref>\n\nThe French Navy, which had been tasked with managing the prison hulks, complained strongly about the cost of guarding the hulks and the disruption they caused to the shipyards. Following his coup in 1851, [[Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon&nbsp;III]] ordered that the hulks be permanently closed and that [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] convicts be transferred overseas to colonies. Debate over where the convicts would be sent was prolonged. [[Algeria]] was ruled out by the Navy as it was controlled by the French Army; [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Texas]] were considered, but the government eventually chose [[French Guiana]].\n\nFrance had repeatedly failed since 1604 to colonize French Guiana. The last attempt at colonization was in 1763, and 75% of the 12,000 colonists that had been sent there died in their first year. By the 1850s, the declining number of survivors were on the brink of extinction. In 1852, Napoleon called for volunteer prisoners from the hulks to transfer to the new ''Bagne de Cayenne'' (Cayennes penal colony) at French Guiana; 3,000 convicts applied. Two categories of prisoners were eligible for transportation: ''transport\u00e9s,'' those civil-law prisoners sentenced under ''doublage,'' and ''d\u00e9port\u00e9s,'' prisoners convicted of political crimes, such as espionage or conspiracy. The hulks continued to be used, housing an average of 5,400 prisoners at a time, until they were finally closed around the end of the 19th century. The agricultural penal colonies continued to be used for juveniles until the last was closed in 1939.<ref name = \"toth\"/>\n\n==Use as penal colony==\nThe islands were part of a penal colony from 1852 onwards for criminals of France, who were convicted by juries rather than [[magistrate]]s. The main part of the penal colony was a labor camp that stretched along the border with Dutch Guiana (present-day [[Suriname]]). This penal colony was controversial as it had a reputation for harshness and brutality. Prisoner-on-prisoner violence was common; tropical diseases were rife. Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was; they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight.  This system was gradually phased out and has been completely shut down since 1953. Since the late 20th century, the islands have been tourist destinations. The islands were featured in the book ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' (1969), published as a memoir by [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]], a former prisoner who escaped.\n\nDevil's Island and associated prisons eventually became one of the most infamous prison systems in history. While the prison system was in use (1852\u20131953),<ref name = \"prison closure date\"/> inmates included [[political prisoner]]s (such as 239&nbsp;republicans who opposed [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|Napoleon III's coup d'\u00e9tat]] in 1851) and the most hardened of thieves and murderers. The vast majority of the more than 80,000&nbsp;prisoners sent to the Devil's Island prison system never made it back to France.  Many died due to disease and harsh conditions. Sanitary systems were limited, and the region was mosquito-infested, with [[endemic]] tropical diseases. The only exit from the island prisons was by water, and few convicts escaped.\n\nConvicts who were lucky enough to have family or friends willing to send them money had to have it sent to them in care of a prison guard. The standard practice was for the guard to keep for himself a quarter of the amount sent and give the rest to the prisoner.\n\nOn 30 May 1854, France passed a new law of forced residency.  It required convicts to stay in French Guiana after completion of sentence for a time equal to their forced labour time. If the original sentence exceeded eight years, they were forced to stay as residents for the remainder of their lives and were provided land to settle on. In time, a variety of penal regimes emerged, as convicts were divided into categories according to the severity of their crimes and the terms of their imprisonment or \"forced residence\" regime.<ref name=\"krakovitch\"/>\n\nAn 1885 law provided for repeat offenders for minor crimes to be sent to the French Guiana prison system, previously reserved for serious offenders and political prisoners. A limited number of convicted women were also sent to French Guiana, with the intent that they marry freed male inmates to aid in settlement and development of the colony.

{"title_page": "Sir James Steuart Denham, 8th Baronet", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\nGeneral '''Sir James Steuart Denham, 8th and 4th Baronet''' (August 1744 \u2013 12 August 1839) was a Scottish soldier of the [[British Army]].\n\n==Birth and education==\nHe was born '''James Steuart''', the only son of [[Sir James Steuart, 2nd Baronet]], of [[Coltness]] in [[Lanarkshire]], by his wife Lady Frances, daughter of [[David Wemyss, 4th Earl of Wemyss]]. The year after his birth, during the [[Jacobite Rising of 1745]], his father attended the court of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] at Holyroodhouse, and consequently had to leave Scotland with his wife. Young James was left with the family of [[William Mure (1718\u20131776)|William Mure of Caldwell]]. He was then educated at [[Angoul\u00eame]] from 1749 until he and his parents were forced by the looming [[Seven Years' War]] to move to Flanders in 1755. He attended the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] from 1757 to 1761.\n\n==Early military career==\nOn 17 March 1761 Steuart was made a [[cornet (military rank)|cornet]] in the [[1st (Royal) Regiment of Dragoons]] ([[Henry Seymour Conway|General Conway]]'s regiment), through the influence of his father's friend [[William Wildman Shute Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington|Lord Barrington]]. He served with the regiment in Germany until the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763. On 13 January 1763, passing over the rank of [[lieutenant]], he was promoted to [[captain (British Army)|captain]] in the [[105th Regiment of Foot (Queen's Own Royal Regiment of Highlanders)]], but when the regiment was disbanded in 1764 he was placed on [[half pay]].\n\nFrom 1764 to 1766 he travelled in France and Germany, studying the cavalry tactics and organisation there, and then was appointed to command a troop of the [[5th (or Royal Irish) Regiment of Dragoons]], joining the regiment in Ireland. In 1769 he was an [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|Lord Townshend]]. He was promoted to [[major (British Army)|major]] in the [[13th Regiment of Dragoons]] on 6 November 1772, transferring to the [[1st Irish Horse]] on 26 September 1775. On 15 July 1776 he went back to the 13th (now [[light cavalry|Light Dragoons]]) as [[lieutenant-colonel (British Army)|lieutenant-colonel]], a command he would hold for the next fifteen years.\n\n==Succession and Member of Parliament==\nSteuart's father had been allowed to return home after [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|the end of the war]] in 1763, and was formally pardoned in 1771. In 1773 he succeeded his cousin [[Sir Archibald Steuart Denham, 6th Baronet|Sir Archibald Steuart Denham]] as 7th Baronet, of Coltness (his own baronetcy was \"of [[Goodtrees]]\", which he had sold in 1756; Coltness had been purchased from the senior branch of the family in 1712). In 1776 he inherited the estate of Westshield from [[Sir William Lockhart Denham, 6th Baronet]], and the Steuarts father and son adopted the surname of '''Denham''', being known as Denham in England and Steuart in Scotland. James Steuart Denham the younger succeeded his father in the baronetcies of Coltness and Goodtrees and the estates of Coltness and Westshield on 26 November 1780.\n\nOn [[1784 British general election|29 April 1784]] Denham was elected Member of Parliament for [[Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Lanarkshire]] through the influence of [[Douglas Hamilton, 8th Duke of Hamilton|the Duke of Hamilton]]. Though a cousin of the Whigs [[Henry Erskine (lawyer)|Henry]] and [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]] and the independent [[Francis Charteris (1749\u20131808)|Francis Charteris]], he had been elected as a supporter of [[William Pitt the Younger]] and voted with [[first Pitt the Younger ministry|the government]], including for parliamentary reform in 1785. At the general elections of [[1790 British general election|1790]] and [[1796 British general election|1796]] he was re-elected unopposed.<ref name=thorne/> He is not known to have spoken in Parliament and devoted most of his time to his military career.\n\n==Later military career==\nDenham spent much time and money on the command of the 13th, showing himself a capable commander in the transition to the light cavalry role and in devising new exercises. He was promoted [[brevet rank|brevet]] [[colonel (British Army)|colonel]] on 20 November 1782, and in 1788 was appointed by [[William Augustus Pitt|Sir William Augustus Pitt]], the [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland|commander-in-chief in Ireland]], as President of a commission to improve the discipline and organisation of the cavalry in Ireland. His recommendations were favourably received, and officially adopted after review by [[David Dundas (British Army officer)|David Dundas]]. In March 1789, having commanded his regiment thirteen years, he requested to be made [[Colonel of the Regiment|colonel]] of an infantry regiment, hoping for the [[20th Regiment of Foot|20th]] or [[71st Regiment of Foot|71st]]. He made further requests for the [[14th Regiment of Foot|14th]] in October, the [[41st Regiment of Foot|41st]] in December, the [[56th Regiment of Foot|56th]] in January 1790 and the [[74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot|74th]] in April 1791, all without success. He was finally appointed colonel of the [[12th (The Prince of Wales's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons]] on 9 November 1791.\n\nIn 1793 the 12th were ordered to [[Siege of Toulon|Toulon]] and Denham was to have gone out as a [[brigadier general (United Kingdom)|brigadier-general]], but never sailed and was instead promoted to [[major-general (United Kingdom)|major-general]] in October that year. In 1794 he was intended to command the cavalry to be sent to [[Flanders Campaign|Flanders]] under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], but the expedition was cancelled. Instead he was appointed (at the suggestion of [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]]) to organise regiments of [[fencible]] cavalry in Scotland, and he commanded them in summer camps in 1795, 1796 and 1797, though initially refusing the post owing to [[rheumatism]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]].\n\nIn autumn 1797 he went back to Ireland as commander of the forces in [[Munster]], with local rank of [[lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]]. With the approval of the commander-in-chief, [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]], he ensured that military officers in his district would not act as [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]], and in March 1798 he organised the [[yeomanry]] and [[militia]] of Munster into night patrols, improving discipline for the volunteers and relieving the burden on the regular forces. He was made substantive lieutenant-general on 1 January 1798.\n\nDenham's \"nervous complaint\" meant that he relied increasingly on his subordinates. When the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] broke out, its suppression in Munster was largely the work of Major-General [[Sir Henry Johnson, 1st Baronet|Henry Johnson]], who won the [[Battle of New Ross (1798)|Battle of New Ross]], Brigadier-General [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John Moore]], who won the [[Battle of Foulksmills]] and took Wexford, and the new commander-in-chief [[Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake|Gerard Lake]].\n\n==Retirement and death==\nDenham finally resigned his command in Ireland in 1799, though he denied this was because of his health. 1799 also saw the death of Denham's political patron the Duke of Hamilton, and [[Archibald Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton|the new Duke]] had two sons with parliamentary ambitions. Denham reminded the government of his consistent support, but when [[Lord Archibald Hamilton (1770\u20131827)|Lord Archibald Hamilton]] declared himself as prospective candidate in 1801 the Hamilton influence was too strong. Not wanting to be defeated, Denham withdrew his candidacy on 11 July 1802 and Hamilton was returned unopposed in [[1802 United Kingdom general election|the general election]].\n\nHe saw no further military service, but was made full general in 1803, colonel of the [[2nd (Royal North British) Regiment of Dragoons]] in 1815, and a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]]. At the [[1818 United Kingdom general election|1818 general election]] he was a noted supporter of [[Alexander Forrester Inglis Cochrane|Sir Alexander Cochrane]] against Hamilton in Lanarkshire, without success.<ref name=thorne>R.G.

He had married on 30 September 1772 Alicia, daughter of William Blacker of [[Carrick Blacker]], [[County Armagh]], but they had no children, so he was succeeded in the baronetcies by his second cousin [[Sir Henry Steuart Barclay, 9th Baronet|Henry Steuart Barclay]].\n\n==References==\n* G.E.C.

He had married on 30 September 1772 Alicia, daughter of William Blacker of [[Carrick Blacker]], [[County Armagh]], but they had no children, so he was succeeded in the baronetcies by his second cousin [[Sir Henry Steuart Barclay, 9th Baronet|Henry Steuart Barclay]].\n\n==References==\n* G.E.C.

It takes place based on the role of Indian army who came forward to help in the freedom of Bangladesh from Pakistan on the orders from then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The title of the movie alludes to the year when this War between Bangladesh and Pakistan took place.\n\nThe scene opens to show a POW camp at an undisclosed location in Pakistan. Indian soldiers are holding a morning parade. As the Pakistanis Major Karamat and Colonel Sheriar Khan walk by, the Indians turn their backs on them in a gesture of disrespect. The cause for this disrespect is soon known as we see the Indian Major Suraj Singh (Manoj Bajpayee) being called out of barrack Number 6 for interrogation by the Pakistanis. He is from the 18 Rajputana Rifles and was caught in the Uri sector in December 1971 as he ran out of ammunition. Before being brought to this camp, he was held in Kot Lakhpat, Lahore, where he was punished twice for attempting to escape. Now, he was put in barrack Number 6 as punishment for a third attempt. Colonel Sheriar Khan taunts him as to the condition of his fellow POWs in the barracks and asks him who else aided him in his escape attempt. Major Suraj Singh refuses to reveal his accomplices, and is sent back to barrack Number 6 for a few more days. He has already spent three days there.\n\nWe see some of the other POWs; Captain Kabir (Kumud Mishra), Captain Jacob (Ravi Kishan) and Pali discussing the camp in general. They wonder why the Indians, who were so far held in various jails all over Pakistan, have been brought to this camp. They take note of the fact that the camp is well-facilitated and that they are receiving good treatment as POWs. We also see Karamat and Khan discussing the inmates of barrack Number 6. The inmates are Indian POWs from the 1965 and 1971 wars who have lost their sanity. This is Major Suraj Singh's punishment; to be imprisoned in this part of the POW camp. Out of magnanimityColonel Sheriar Khan orders that Suraj be released the next morning.\n\n===Arrival Of More POWs===\nThe next morning, an army truck is driving towards the camp.  This truck has a few more Indian POWs.  This group includes Flight Lieutenant Ram (Manav Kaul), Flight Lieutenant Gurtu (Deepak Dobriyal) and Colonel Puri.  The Flight Lieutenants, being youngsters, are of a bright disposition, and look for something or the other to be cheerful about despite their being captive.  When the truck stops at a side road and the POWs are allowed to relieve themselves, Ram and Gurtu contemplate the idea of jumping into the valley and running away.  Then, they give up the idea, as they are too weak to do so.  For consolation, they steal a guard's wallet and get a Pakistani army ID card.\n\nThey reach the camp and are introduced to the other inmates already present. No one has any idea as to the reason they were taken there.\n\n===Hope Against Hope===\nMajor Suraj Singh and his men, especially Captain Kabir, Captain Jacob and Subedar Ahmed, keep their own spirits alive by caring for the broken souls in barrack Number 6, and by remembering their own kin back home.  No matter how good the facilities in the camp, they are still prisoners and they hope to return home someday.\n\nBy asking the guards a few innocuous questions and putting their answers together, the POWs realize that they are in a place less than 200&nbsp;km from the Indo-Pak border.  (The place, it is revealed later, is Chaklala.) When Colonel Puri is told of this and the idea of an escape is put forward, he overrules it.  His reasons are that perhaps they will finally be repatriated and that a failed attempt could result in all of them being killed.\n\n===The Reason===\nA jail in Multan, Pakistan, is being examined by a joint delegation of the International Red Cross Society and the Pakistan Human Rights Commission.  They are accompanied by some Indian ladies who claim that their kin are held prisoner.  Their proof is that letters written by their missing kin bear the addresses of Pakistani jails.  The women are being shown around by Colonel Shakoor, and they are distraught to see no trace of their loved ones here.  The head of the Human Rights Commission, Sabeena Jahangir, signs a document stating that they are satisfied with the results of the search.\n\nHere we understand the reason why the Indian POWs were brought to Chaklala: The Pakistani military/government bowed to international pressure and allowed the delegation to examine the jails.  The POWs has to be hidden away in a secret camp for the duration of the delegation's visit in Pakistan.\n\n===The Repatriation And The Realization===\nColonel Shakoor arrives at the Chaklala camp; he informs Colonel Puri and Major Singh that all the POWs will be repatriated.  He also says that as there are some formalities to be fulfilled, they will have to remain there for nearly two months.  The POWs are further informed that the same night they will be treated to an open-air screening of a recent popular movie followed by a banquet. Major Singh, Captain Kabir and Subedar Ahmed are distrustful of Colonel Shakoor's words, although the other prisoners celebrate their imminent return home.\n\nThat night, while the movie is being screened, Ahmed steals a newspaper from an army jeep and calls Major Singh and Captains Kabir and Jacob into the barracks.  From reading the newspaper, they learn that [[General Zia Ul-Haq]] has overthrown [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in a military coup and formed a new government.  Further, General Zia has stated that all Indian soldiers who were taken prisoner so far have been returned and, as proof, he has allowed the International Red Cross Society to inspect the Pakistani jails.  Since no POW was found, General Zia has reasserted the Pakistani government's innocence in this matter.  The four soldiers now understand the reason why they were taken to this camp.  Also, that they were being provided with good facilities so that they would not think of escaping.  Then, they realize that they are being overheard and discover that the eavesdroppers are Ram and Gurtu.  They overpower them and are about to thrash the two, when the Flight Lieutenants inform them that they too wish to escape to India. They prove their willingness by producing the ID card they had stolen earlier.\n\n===The First Steps===\nThe six soldiers decide to escape, and they must waste no time.  They take two steps the same night. First, they request the Pakistanis for a group photo.  This request is granted. Second, at the dinner, Ahmed attempts to strike Jacob, for which he is punished by Colonel Puri the next morning.  When Ahmed refuses to bear out his punishment, Colonel Puri wishes to court-martial him. The POWs ask for the use of a barrack to serve as a courtroom, a request that is also granted.\n\nThe Pakistanis are preparing to celebrate the Pakistani Independence Day (14 August) by having a song performance by Ms. Sultana Khanum, a ghazal singer.  The Indians, who wish to celebrate the Indian Independence Day (15 August), ask for fresh uniforms, paints to make an Indian flag and jaggery for making a sweet drink.  The Pakistanis grant them all their requests in order to keep them pacified.\n\nWhile the court martial is going on, Ram and Gurtu combine the paints to dye the uniforms in the colours of the Pakistani Army.  Maj. Karamat is presiding over the court martial.  Here, with Kabir as the prosecutor and Suraj as the defense, the would-be escapees impress upon Karamat that Puri hates Ahmed simply because he is a Muslim.  This prompts Karamat into starting the proceedings to implant Ahmed as a spy in the Indian Army.\n\n===Initial Success===\nWhile Karamat is interviewing Ahmed to offer sending him back to India so that he can spy for the Pakistanis, Kabir and Jacob stealthily make their way to the camp periphery.  They trigger the alarm and run back into the camp before they can be seen. The guards conclude that it must have been triggered by a wild animal.  At this, Karamat switches off the alarm from the electricity room adjacent to his own office.  Ahmed follows him like a dimwitted man and sees the location of the switch.\n\nAs Ahmed's repatriation formalities are being fulfilled, he manages to steal from Karamat's office the accessories and insignia that are present on Pakistani uniforms.  Ahmed also learns that the electricity room houses the communications line and the power generator.  He passes on this information to Suraj Singh and the others (Kabir, Jacob, Ram and Gurtu).\n\nThe plan is to create a stampede on the night of 14 August and escape under the pretext of escorting the ghazal singer out of the camp.  But to cause a stampede, they need to detonate a bomb. For this, Ram and Gurtu go on a pickpocketing spree and bring back to Jacob (an explosives and topography expert) a lot of matchboxes.  They remove the phosphorus heads of the matchsticks and make a crude bomb out of the combined match-heads.  They intend to throw this bomb into the ammunitions room to create a blast.  Once the bomb is ready, they tie it to the lower side of the floorboards to hide it.\n\nThe group photograph has been given to Colonel Puri.  To steal it from him, Ram and Gurtu make an alcoholic drink out of the jaggery and soon many of the POWs are drunk.  Colonel Puri is too drunk to notice the real reason behind the drinking session.  The photo is stolen.  Out of this, the face of Suraj Singh is cut out and stuck onto the stolen ID card.\n\nThe fake Pakistani uniforms are ready. So are the bomb and the ID card. The six men just have to wait for the song performance before starting their action. At this point, Suraj tells the others that the real intent of the mission is to alert the Indian authorities of the presence of Indian POWs in Pakistan. He also tells them that one or more of them may die while escaping and that their only consolation will be that they will have died as escapees instead of as prisoners.\n\n===The Breakout===\nWhile the floor is being cleaned with water that morning, the bomb gets soaked, but the escape team does not know this. As 14 August dawns, the six men wear two layers of uniforms; the Indian uniforms on top of the Pakistani ones. By evening, the ghazal singer is ready to give her song performance.\n\nThe senior Pakistani officers, including Shakoor and Karamat, are among the audience. The Indian POWs are allowed to sit as a separate audience to enjoy the songs. As the performance begins, Jacob and Kabir sneak away from the main POW group at separate times. Ahmed goes into Karamat's office, telling the guard that the Major has asked for his jacket. Once inside, he knocks the guard unconscious and through a side door lets in Kabir, who has changed into his Pakistani uniform. He goes into the electricity room to disconnect the communication lines and power lines. He cuts the communication lines first, then, as per the plan, he must wait for the blast before he can cut the power line.\n\nJacob reaches the crude bomb and realizes that it is now soaked. He tells Ahmed, who is now by his side, that the mission must be called off. Then he rushes off to stop Suraj. However, before Ahmed can stop Kabir, he impatiently cuts the power line, plunging the camp in darkness. Ahmed does the last thing left to him to save his friends. He runs to the ammunitions room, forces his way in, locks himself in and primes one of the grenades. In the few seconds before the blast, he closes his eyes and thinks of his family; his aged parents, his wife and his daughter whom he has never seen and who would now be six. The room blows up into a ball of fire.\n\nThe remaining five men carry out the plan as conceived. There is a stampede and a general confusion as the soldiers attempt to put out the fire. Suraj and his men escort the ghazal singer out of the camp in an army truck. A few Pakistani soldiers already inside the truck become their unwitting captives. The Indians are no longer POWs, they are now soldiers on a mission.\n\n===The Aftermath===\nAt the camp, the Pakistani guards take a head count of the prisoners and, seeing six of them missing, including Suraj Singh, discover that an escape has taken place. They try to locate the truck escorting Sultana Khanum. They also alert Major Bilal Mallik (Piyush Mishra), who is in charge of a helicopter, to help in their search.\n\nMeanwhile, the escape truck has gone on a highway to Abbottabad. At a lonely spot, the escapees decide to get rid of their captives. One of them tries to rush his captors and in a scuffle shoots Jacob in the stomach. Suraj and Kabir shoot the Pakistani dead. Jacob lies to his comrades, saying that the bullet has just grazed him. The escapees relieve the Pakistani soldiers of their weapons and wallets and knock them unconscious. They also hide the body of the dead soldier. They are about to render Sultana unconscious, when she says that she was once the head of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission. She says that she was aware of the Red Cross raids across Pakistan in search of the Indian POWs. She is sympathetic to the plight of the POWs and promises to misguide the search party if she is left unharmed. In a touching line, she says to Suraj, \"Hamaare mulk se thhoda yakeen hee lekar jaao.\" (\"If nothing else, at least take home some trust from our country.\")\n\n===The Night===\nThe escapees are in a different truck now. They remember the blast at the camp and understand that it was done by Ahmed. They have gone off the highway to Abbottabad and are on another one, which leads to Muzaffarabad. The search party, including Major Mallik, has reached the escape truck, where they find Sultana Khanum, who has been left unharmed. She says that the escapees were in plain clothes and were talking of going towards Islamabad. The searchers believe her and arrange for her to be sent to her home. However, Major Mallik notices that the military map is missing from the truck's dashboard. When he asks Colonel Shakoor if the escapees were in any way connected to the army, Shakoor answers that it does not matter and that the escaped prisoners have to be brought back. In the meanwhile, the Chaklala camp is hurriedly closed and the Indian POWs are moved out of there.\n\nMajor Mallik separates from the search party and heads out in his chopper to cover the highway to Muzaffarabad. At a checkpoint, the escapees, led by Suraj Singh, gain access with the help of the fake ID card. Suraj asks the guard the reason for the checkpoint and is told that there is a search on for six fugitives. From this, he understands that the Pakistanis do not want it to be known that the fugitives are actually POWs.\n\nSultana Khanum phones Sabeena Jahangir from a wayside hotel and informs her of the presence of Indian POWs in a camp in Chaklala. She says that she is ready to provide testimony to that effect.\n\nBy early dawn, the searchers converge at the military hospital in Abbottabad to glean information from the injured soldiers. Here, Colonel Sheriar Khan and Major Azzam Baig berate Major Karamat and Colonel Shakoor for letting the escape take place. When Major Mallik asks if the escapees are Indian POWs, they grudgingly tell him the truth, and he agrees to maintain the secrecy of the search. They then talk to an injured soldier, who tells them about the preparedness of the fugitives. When the soldier mentions that they even have an ID card, Major Mallik realizes that he had actually seen them passing through the checkpoint on the highway to Muzaffarabad. The searchers prepare to go there.\n\n===The Wild Chase At Muzaffarabad===\nOn the morning of 15 August, the escapees arrive at Muzaffarabad. The truck-driver goes on his way, and the soldiers check into a hotel. Once inside the hotel room, Suraj instructs Ram and Gurtu to purchase some necessary medical items from the local stores. He then asks Jacob to plot out an escape route on the map they took off the first escape truck. He charts out a route going up to Baramulla, India. This route avoids the main highway and goes through hills and villages. The last twenty kilometres have to be covered on foot, because the heavy snowfall makes it impossible for any vehicle to pass. Jacob then collapses and the others realize that he was not merely grazed by the bullet, but that his gunshot wound was life-threatening. Kabir holds him tightly while Suraj attempts to remove the bullet from his stomach.\n\nMeanwhile, in the town, while Ram and Gurtu are purchasing medicines and painkillers for Jacob, Ram notices a military convoy approaching. The search party is here. He and Gurtu run to the hotel to warn the others. Although they were not seen by the searchers, the place is soon swarming with soldiers. In the hotel room, Jacob finds the pain unbearable and reaches for a pistol. Ram and Gurtu reach the room just in time to see him shoot himself in the head. Although the four men are stunned, they have no time to waste. They cover Jacob in a blanket, take the map and the bags, and flee through the window.\n\nAs they run through the side streets of the town, the Pakistanis are on their heels. When the fugitives reach the main street, they have to hide behind a truck as it is crowded with soldiers led by Colonel Shakoor. They cannot remain behind the truck for long, because the column of soldiers chasing them is getting closer. Then Ram spots a motorbike, he tells Suraj and the others to be ready to take it. Before they can stop him, he runs into Colonel Shakoor's view, shoots his guard and runs into a side-lane. As the soldiers run after him, the fugitives hide themselves under the tarpaulin of another truck, thereby escaping notice by the column that was chasing them. This column joins the other soldiers in the chase. As a straggler is attempting to start the motorbike, the escapees (Suraj, Kabir and Gurtu) run out of their hiding place, beat him unconscious and ride away on it.\n\nRam has taken control of an army jeep after killing a few soldiers, including Major Azzam Baig. He too has sustained a few bullet injuries, and is now leading the Pakistanis away from his friends. He now has only one pistol and one grenade for weapons. He leads the soldiers out of the town as far away as he can. The chasing convoy is led by Colonel Shakoor, who is berating his men to drive faster. Major Mallik is in the second jeep. Suddenly, Major Suraj Singh turns in from a dirt road and is riding next to the leading jeep. Colonel Shakoor stares into the faces of Suraj, Gurtu and Kabir. The jeep driver's face registers terror as he sees Kabir priming a grenade. Kabir lobs the grenade into the jeep as Suraj picks up speed and races away. In the next few seconds, the convoy comes to a standstill and Colonel Shakoor leaps out of his jeep. He runs a few steps and throws himself flat on the ground. The jeep explodes as the Indians race away. A stunned Major Mallik is unable to believe his eyes. The expression on his face sums up the scene: he did not expect the Indians to pull off a move like that.\n\n===The Sacrifice===\nThe men on the bike catch up with Ram, who is relieved to see them safe. Gurtu asks innocently, \"Listen, sir, is this the road to Delhi?\" then tells him to watch where he is driving. But their victory is short-lived as they are attacked by a truck coming from the opposite direction. Although Kabir and Gurtu manage to shoot the driver of the truck and the shooters in its front, Suraj is forced to divert the bike into a ditch. Ram stops the jeep and watches his friends careening wildly downslope. They hit a rock and the bike cartwheels, then lands on Kabir's right leg. As the bike slides down the slope, it drags him with it. Suraj and Gurtu are lucky to survive with only a few scratches.\n\nRam is shot by the soldiers who are climbing out of the back of the truck. Gurtu is climbing upslope to rush to his aid with a furious Suraj attempting to stop him. Ram, still alive, sees the scene: Shakoor and Mallik have caught up and are driving towards him, the soldiers from the truck ahead are running towards him, and Gurtu and Suraj are dangerously close to revealing their position in the ditch. He quickly turns his jeep around and, with the soldiers still running after him, drives straight at Shakoor's vehicle. Mallik, seated next to Shakoor, orders the driver to stop and reverse. He is sure that Ram is playing a fresh new trick, while Shakoor wants to get closer to Ram so that he can shoot him dead. Ram slams into them at high speed, causing serious injury to Shakoor, the soldiers in Shakoor's truck and to himself. Shakoor, who is now unconscious, is laid on the ground as Mallik orders for an ambulance. Mallik then walks to Ram's jeep to see what he was trying to do.\n\nRam is bleeding profusely, he has a few breaths' worth of life left in him and he has primed a grenade. When Mallik sees the grenade, he shouts a warning for everyone to run away. As they all run away from the jeep, Mallik leading them, it explodes. In the ditch, Suraj and Gurtu see the explosion. Suraj covers Gurtu's mouth so that his cries cannot be heard by the men on the road. They watch the jeep and the truck go up in flames, then Suraj forcibly turns Gurtu around and they come back to the motorbike, which has Kabir still partially pinned underneath it. The blast has claimed many lives, including Colonel Shakoor's. As Mallik directs the rescue, Colonel Sheriar Khan catches up. Simultaneously, the fugitives get the bike upright and drive away.\n\n===The Intervention===\nWhile Mallik and Khan are directing the rescue, Sabeena Jahangir arrives there with the Red Cross delegates and questions Khan as to his lies regarding the Indian POWs. Mallik explains that this blast was the result of an accident involving two vehicles and that they are in no way connected to the POW issue. They go to the Muzaffarabad base, where in a closed room, Colonel Sheriar Khan is informed on the phone that a delegate has been sent to recall Sabeena Jahangir. When he expresses disbelief and frustration that the POW matter is now known, Mallik tells him that catching the POWs is now difficult. He says that in addition to being highly motivated, they are also military experts. He mentions Ram's suicide bombing of the trucks as proof of how far they are willing to go. But until the arrival of the delegate, he says, Colonel Sheriar Khan must keep Jahangir pacified. When Khan attempts to tell Jahangir that there is a misunderstanding regarding the accident and the blast, she says that the occurrence of one blast at Chaklala and within one day another one at Muzaffarabad is highly suspicious. She alleges that the Pakistani military have deceived the Red Cross and the Pakistani public by lying that there are no Indian POWs in the country. Just then, the High Commission delegate arrives and shows Jahangir an order to vacate the area immediately. She glares at Mallik and Khan, then leaves with her colleagues. As soon as she is gone, the soldiers spring into action resuming their search.\n\n===Saluting Fallen Comrades===\nHowever, this intervention has bought off valuable time for the escapees. They have gone on the route marked by Jacob and reached the point from where they have to go by foot. The bike is anyway out of petrol. While Suraj Singh throws the bike down a mountainside, Gurtu has leaned Kabir against a tree and is making three mounds in the snow; one for each man who died on this mission. Seeing this, Suraj points out that they sacrificed their lives for their battle, so they must be respected as martyrs. He, Kabir and Gurtu stand up and salute this memorial. Then, they walk on into the snow, Kabir being held up by the others.\n\n===The Cold Night===\nThe Indian soldiers have reached a point where they must stop and wait until dark before resuming their journey. They risk being caught if they go any further while there is still light. Suraj and Gurtu tie a splint improvised out of twigs onto Kabir's fractured leg.\n\nBy nightfall, the Pakistanis have reached a stream where they retrieve the bike that was thrown down the mountain. Khan and Mallik disagree in their conclusions. While Khan is certain that the fugitives have died and that their bodies should be lying close by, Mallik thinks that they could have thrown the bike down the mountainside and continued on foot. Khan berates Mallik for overestimating the fugitives. Mallik steps aside, and while Khan continues the search in the vicinity, gives voice to his own thoughts: \"When the bloody war was over, there was never any need to detain these soldiers. Not only have we incurred the curses of their kin, we have also created a nuisance for ourselves. If I say this aloud, I will be declared a traitor. If I don't, then this Pakistani conscience of mine will torment me for life.\"\n\nSuraj awakens Gurtu and Kabir to continue their journey. Kabir is not able to move his leg. Suraj removes the shoe on his injured leg only to see that it has turned black. Kabir says that it is frostbite and that it will climb up his body. However, when he requests to be left behind, Suraj will not hear of it. He carries Kabir bodily on his back, and their trek continues. They can do nothing but walk on. They keep themselves sane by exchanging little jokes and talking about their hometowns. When Suraj stumbles under Kabir's weight, Kabir points out that this way a two-hour journey will stretch to six hours. Suraj will again hear none of it. Sometime later, Kabir tells Suraj that he respects him more than he would respect his own father. Suraj replies that in the army a senior officer is like a father anyway.\n\n===Unparalleled Heroism===\nIt is dawn. The three soldiers have stopped to rest by the side of a path winding through the mountains. Kabir and Gurtu are asleep; Suraj is sitting huddled next to them. He sees something far below him in the valley. He rises, then wakes up Gurtu and asks him to take a look. They strain their eyes. They cannot believe what they are seeing. It is an Indian army outpost with the Indian Flag raised above it. They cheer, scream, and laugh in jubilation. But when Gurtu tries to rouse Kabir, he falls limply to one side. He is dead. With nothing else left to do, Suraj and Gurtu bury Kabir in the snow and walk on towards the Indian side of the border. It is about a few hundred yards away.\n\nSuddenly they hear the sound of a helicopter. It carries Colonel Sheriar Khan and Major Bilal Mallik. As Khan fires at them with a machine gun, Mallik cautions him that they are too close to the Line Of Control (LOC). As Suraj and Gurtu attempt to run, they end up taking a few bullet wounds. Gurtu is shot in his leg, which disables him from standing up. The Indian soldiers at the outpost, who see the helicopter, think that the Pakistanis are starting a skirmish. They get ready to fire a rocket.\n\nGurtu crawls into a rock alcove and asks Suraj to proceed alone without him. Suraj replies that he has no family back home in India and that if he reaches home he will do so with his companions. Suraj then says that they must survive for the sake of their comrades who died in the escape and for the sake of those who are still prisoners. Meanwhile, Mallik mutinies against Khan and orders the pilot to turn the chopper around. The Indians fire a rocket at the chopper. As the helicopter turns around and flies away behind the mountains, the rocket explodes harmlessly on a mountainside. On the ground, Gurtu is unable to walk, so Suraj seats him against a rock. He promises to bring help from the Indian side.\n\nMajor Suraj Singh calls out to the Indians, but he has been a prisoner for six years. As he calls for help, his voice stammers and fails many times. The Indians simply do not or cannot hear him. Then suddenly gunshots are heard and Suraj collapses. A column of Pakistani soldiers is running towards the two fugitives. Suraj is shot badly. The Indian soldiers rush to their defensive positions. As Gurtu is still recovering from the shock, Suraj struggles to his feet. He tells Gurtu that he will be back with help even before the Pakistanis arrive. He is still the father figure his men loved him for being. The Pakistanis are rushing on, screaming obscenities. Suraj runs towards the Indian outpost. As the Pakistanis fire at him, the Indians, thinking that a skirmish is on, fire back at the Pakistanis. This pins them down considerably so their firing on Suraj does not have much effect. Then the Indian officer sees Suraj through his binoculars and orders his men to stop firing as he realizes that the Pakistanis were chasing a fugitive. Then the Pakistanis are able to come out into the open and fire at Suraj. He nevertheless runs as hard as he can. There is an explosion close to his feet, probably a land mine, and he is thrown forward to the ground by the force of the blast.\n\nGurtu is looking at Suraj over the distance. His face has a look of peace. Suraj has reached the Indian side. He slowly stands up and looks ahead. He is home. He looks at the soldiers and at the flag above them. He is too overcome by emotion to say even a word. The Indians see a man in Pakistani army uniform before them. Suraj raises his right hand as if reaching for the flag. Then the Pakistanis fire one shot, which goes through Suraj's heart. He falls to the ground and dies.\n\nThe Pakistani soldiers have reached the border. Khan and Mallik make their way to their head. The Indian officer shouts a question across the no-man's-land, asking what the matter is. Khan replies that the dead fugitive was a deserter from the Pakistani army who was court-martialled and had killed two civilians while escaping. He asks the Indians to search the dead man for an ID card, which should confirm his identity. The Indians find on Suraj's person the fake ID card, which had got him through the Pakistani check post. The officer grants permission for the Pakistanis to take away the corpse and warns them to be careful in future. As Suraj's body is dragged back to the Pakistani side, Mallik removes his beret in a gesture of respect to the man who, in his own way, did reach his country.\n\n===Epilogue===\nIt is now 2007. The place is Multan Jail in Pakistan. We see an old man walking in the prison compound. He has made five little mounds of earth and he is putting a few flowers on them. He sits on the ground next to them and leafs through what was once Major Suraj Singh's prison diary. This old man is Gurtu. He now has only two motives in his life: to hope to return home and to keep alive the memory of his five friends.\n\nThe screen now blurs, and a Voice over informs us that there are still 54 Indian [[POW]]'s of the 1971 and the 1965 Indo Pak wars who are languishing in Pakistani Jails. They were last seen alive in 1988. Copies of original letters posted by them come up as the credits Roll\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Manoj Bajpayee]] as Major Suraj Dahiya\n* [[Ravi Kishan]] as Capt.

It takes place based on the role of Indian army who came forward to help in the freedom of Bangladesh from Pakistan on the orders from then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The title of the movie alludes to the year when this War between Bangladesh and Pakistan took place.\n\nThe scene opens to show a POW camp at an undisclosed location in Pakistan. Indian soldiers are holding a morning parade. As the Pakistanis Major Karamat and Colonel Sheriar Khan walk by, the Indians turn their backs on them in a gesture of disrespect. The cause for this disrespect is soon known as we see the Indian Major Suraj Singh (Manoj Bajpayee) being called out of barrack Number 6 for interrogation by the Pakistanis. He is from the 18 Rajputana Rifles and was caught in the Uri sector in December 1971 as he ran out of ammunition. Before being brought to this camp, he was held in Kot Lakhpat, Lahore, where he was punished twice for attempting to escape. Now, he was put in barrack Number 6 as punishment for a third attempt. Colonel Sheriar Khan taunts him as to the condition of his fellow POWs in the barracks and asks him who else aided him in his escape attempt. Major Suraj Singh refuses to reveal his accomplices, and is sent back to barrack Number 6 for a few more days. He has already spent three days there.\n\nWe see some of the other POWs; Captain Kabir (Kumud Mishra), Captain Jacob (Ravi Kishan) and Pali discussing the camp in general. They wonder why the Indians, who were so far held in various jails all over Pakistan, have been brought to this camp. They take note of the fact that the camp is well-facilitated and that they are receiving good treatment as POWs. We also see Karamat and Khan discussing the inmates of barrack Number 6. The inmates are Indian POWs from the 1965 and 1971 wars who have lost their sanity. This is Major Suraj Singh's punishment; to be imprisoned in this part of the POW camp. Out of magnanimityColonel Sheriar Khan orders that Suraj be released the next morning.\n\n===Arrival Of More POWs===\nThe next morning, an army truck is driving towards the camp.  This truck has a few more Indian POWs.  This group includes Flight Lieutenant Ram (Manav Kaul), Flight Lieutenant Gurtu (Deepak Dobriyal) and Colonel Puri.  The Flight Lieutenants, being youngsters, are of a bright disposition, and look for something or the other to be cheerful about despite their being captive.  When the truck stops at a side road and the POWs are allowed to relieve themselves, Ram and Gurtu contemplate the idea of jumping into the valley and running away.  Then, they give up the idea, as they are too weak to do so.  For consolation, they steal a guard's wallet and get a Pakistani army ID card.\n\nThey reach the camp and are introduced to the other inmates already present. No one has any idea as to the reason they were taken there.\n\n===Hope Against Hope===\nMajor Suraj Singh and his men, especially Captain Kabir, Captain Jacob and Subedar Ahmed, keep their own spirits alive by caring for the broken souls in barrack Number 6, and by remembering their own kin back home.  No matter how good the facilities in the camp, they are still prisoners and they hope to return home someday.\n\nBy asking the guards a few innocuous questions and putting their answers together, the POWs realize that they are in a place less than 200&nbsp;km from the Indo-Pak border.  (The place, it is revealed later, is Chaklala.) When Colonel Puri is told of this and the idea of an escape is put forward, he overrules it.  His reasons are that perhaps they will finally be repatriated and that a failed attempt could result in all of them being killed.\n\n===The Reason===\nA jail in Multan, Pakistan, is being examined by a joint delegation of the International Red Cross Society and the Pakistan Human Rights Commission.  They are accompanied by some Indian ladies who claim that their kin are held prisoner.  Their proof is that letters written by their missing kin bear the addresses of Pakistani jails.  The women are being shown around by Colonel Shakoor, and they are distraught to see no trace of their loved ones here.  The head of the Human Rights Commission, Sabeena Jahangir, signs a document stating that they are satisfied with the results of the search.\n\nHere we understand the reason why the Indian POWs were brought to Chaklala: The Pakistani military/government bowed to international pressure and allowed the delegation to examine the jails.  The POWs has to be hidden away in a secret camp for the duration of the delegation's visit in Pakistan.\n\n===The Repatriation And The Realization===\nColonel Shakoor arrives at the Chaklala camp; he informs Colonel Puri and Major Singh that all the POWs will be repatriated.  He also says that as there are some formalities to be fulfilled, they will have to remain there for nearly two months.  The POWs are further informed that the same night they will be treated to an open-air screening of a recent popular movie followed by a banquet. Major Singh, Captain Kabir and Subedar Ahmed are distrustful of Colonel Shakoor's words, although the other prisoners celebrate their imminent return home.\n\nThat night, while the movie is being screened, Ahmed steals a newspaper from an army jeep and calls Major Singh and Captains Kabir and Jacob into the barracks.  From reading the newspaper, they learn that [[General Zia Ul-Haq]] has overthrown [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in a military coup and formed a new government.  Further, General Zia has stated that all Indian soldiers who were taken prisoner so far have been returned and, as proof, he has allowed the International Red Cross Society to inspect the Pakistani jails.  Since no POW was found, General Zia has reasserted the Pakistani government's innocence in this matter.  The four soldiers now understand the reason why they were taken to this camp.  Also, that they were being provided with good facilities so that they would not think of escaping.  Then, they realize that they are being overheard and discover that the eavesdroppers are Ram and Gurtu.  They overpower them and are about to thrash the two, when the Flight Lieutenants inform them that they too wish to escape to India. They prove their willingness by producing the ID card they had stolen earlier.\n\n===The First Steps===\nThe six soldiers decide to escape, and they must waste no time.  They take two steps the same night. First, they request the Pakistanis for a group photo.  This request is granted. Second, at the dinner, Ahmed attempts to strike Jacob, for which he is punished by Colonel Puri the next morning.  When Ahmed refuses to bear out his punishment, Colonel Puri wishes to court-martial him. The POWs ask for the use of a barrack to serve as a courtroom, a request that is also granted.\n\nThe Pakistanis are preparing to celebrate the Pakistani Independence Day (14 August) by having a song performance by Ms. Sultana Khanum, a ghazal singer.  The Indians, who wish to celebrate the Indian Independence Day (15 August), ask for fresh uniforms, paints to make an Indian flag and jaggery for making a sweet drink.  The Pakistanis grant them all their requests in order to keep them pacified.\n\nWhile the court martial is going on, Ram and Gurtu combine the paints to dye the uniforms in the colours of the Pakistani Army.  Maj. Karamat is presiding over the court martial.  Here, with Kabir as the prosecutor and Suraj as the defense, the would-be escapees impress upon Karamat that Puri hates Ahmed simply because he is a Muslim.  This prompts Karamat into starting the proceedings to implant Ahmed as a spy in the Indian Army.\n\n===Initial Success===\nWhile Karamat is interviewing Ahmed to offer sending him back to India so that he can spy for the Pakistanis, Kabir and Jacob stealthily make their way to the camp periphery.  They trigger the alarm and run back into the camp before they can be seen. The guards conclude that it must have been triggered by a wild animal.  At this, Karamat switches off the alarm from the electricity room adjacent to his own office.  Ahmed follows him like a dimwitted man and sees the location of the switch.\n\nAs Ahmed's repatriation formalities are being fulfilled, he manages to steal from Karamat's office the accessories and insignia that are present on Pakistani uniforms.  Ahmed also learns that the electricity room houses the communications line and the power generator.  He passes on this information to Suraj Singh and the others (Kabir, Jacob, Ram and Gurtu).\n\nThe plan is to create a stampede on the night of 14 August and escape under the pretext of escorting the ghazal singer out of the camp.  But to cause a stampede, they need to detonate a bomb. For this, Ram and Gurtu go on a pickpocketing spree and bring back to Jacob (an explosives and topography expert) a lot of matchboxes.  They remove the phosphorus heads of the matchsticks and make a crude bomb out of the combined match-heads.  They intend to throw this bomb into the ammunitions room to create a blast.  Once the bomb is ready, they tie it to the lower side of the floorboards to hide it.\n\nThe group photograph has been given to Colonel Puri.  To steal it from him, Ram and Gurtu make an alcoholic drink out of the jaggery and soon many of the POWs are drunk.  Colonel Puri is too drunk to notice the real reason behind the drinking session.  The photo is stolen.  Out of this, the face of Suraj Singh is cut out and stuck onto the stolen ID card.\n\nThe fake Pakistani uniforms are ready. So are the bomb and the ID card. The six men just have to wait for the song performance before starting their action. At this point, Suraj tells the others that the real intent of the mission is to alert the Indian authorities of the presence of Indian POWs in Pakistan. He also tells them that one or more of them may die while escaping and that their only consolation will be that they will have died as escapees instead of as prisoners.\n\n===The Breakout===\nWhile the floor is being cleaned with water that morning, the bomb gets soaked, but the escape team does not know this. As 14 August dawns, the six men wear two layers of uniforms; the Indian uniforms on top of the Pakistani ones. By evening, the ghazal singer is ready to give her song performance.\n\nThe senior Pakistani officers, including Shakoor and Karamat, are among the audience. The Indian POWs are allowed to sit as a separate audience to enjoy the songs. As the performance begins, Jacob and Kabir sneak away from the main POW group at separate times. Ahmed goes into Karamat's office, telling the guard that the Major has asked for his jacket. Once inside, he knocks the guard unconscious and through a side door lets in Kabir, who has changed into his Pakistani uniform. He goes into the electricity room to disconnect the communication lines and power lines. He cuts the communication lines first, then, as per the plan, he must wait for the blast before he can cut the power line.\n\nJacob reaches the crude bomb and realizes that it is now soaked. He tells Ahmed, who is now by his side, that the mission must be called off. Then he rushes off to stop Suraj. However, before Ahmed can stop Kabir, he impatiently cuts the power line, plunging the camp in darkness. Ahmed does the last thing left to him to save his friends. He runs to the ammunitions room, forces his way in, locks himself in and primes one of the grenades. In the few seconds before the blast, he closes his eyes and thinks of his family; his aged parents, his wife and his daughter whom he has never seen and who would now be six. The room blows up into a ball of fire.\n\nThe remaining five men carry out the plan as conceived. There is a stampede and a general confusion as the soldiers attempt to put out the fire. Suraj and his men escort the ghazal singer out of the camp in an army truck. A few Pakistani soldiers already inside the truck become their unwitting captives. The Indians are no longer POWs, they are now soldiers on a mission.\n\n===The Aftermath===\nAt the camp, the Pakistani guards take a head count of the prisoners and, seeing six of them missing, including Suraj Singh, discover that an escape has taken place. They try to locate the truck escorting Sultana Khanum. They also alert Major Bilal Mallik (Piyush Mishra), who is in charge of a helicopter, to help in their search.\n\nMeanwhile, the escape truck has gone on a highway to Abbottabad. At a lonely spot, the escapees decide to get rid of their captives. One of them tries to rush his captors and in a scuffle shoots Jacob in the stomach. Suraj and Kabir shoot the Pakistani dead. Jacob lies to his comrades, saying that the bullet has just grazed him. The escapees relieve the Pakistani soldiers of their weapons and wallets and knock them unconscious. They also hide the body of the dead soldier. They are about to render Sultana unconscious, when she says that she was once the head of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission. She says that she was aware of the Red Cross raids across Pakistan in search of the Indian POWs. She is sympathetic to the plight of the POWs and promises to misguide the search party if she is left unharmed. In a touching line, she says to Suraj, \"Hamaare mulk se thhoda yakeen hee lekar jaao.\" (\"If nothing else, at least take home some trust from our country.\")\n\n===The Night===\nThe escapees are in a different truck now. They remember the blast at the camp and understand that it was done by Ahmed. They have gone off the highway to Abbottabad and are on another one, which leads to Muzaffarabad. The search party, including Major Mallik, has reached the escape truck, where they find Sultana Khanum, who has been left unharmed. She says that the escapees were in plain clothes and were talking of going towards Islamabad. The searchers believe her and arrange for her to be sent to her home. However, Major Mallik notices that the military map is missing from the truck's dashboard. When he asks Colonel Shakoor if the escapees were in any way connected to the army, Shakoor answers that it does not matter and that the escaped prisoners have to be brought back. In the meanwhile, the Chaklala camp is hurriedly closed and the Indian POWs are moved out of there.\n\nMajor Mallik separates from the search party and heads out in his chopper to cover the highway to Muzaffarabad. At a checkpoint, the escapees, led by Suraj Singh, gain access with the help of the fake ID card. Suraj asks the guard the reason for the checkpoint and is told that there is a search on for six fugitives. From this, he understands that the Pakistanis do not want it to be known that the fugitives are actually POWs.\n\nSultana Khanum phones Sabeena Jahangir from a wayside hotel and informs her of the presence of Indian POWs in a camp in Chaklala. She says that she is ready to provide testimony to that effect.\n\nBy early dawn, the searchers converge at the military hospital in Abbottabad to glean information from the injured soldiers. Here, Colonel Sheriar Khan and Major Azzam Baig berate Major Karamat and Colonel Shakoor for letting the escape take place. When Major Mallik asks if the escapees are Indian POWs, they grudgingly tell him the truth, and he agrees to maintain the secrecy of the search. They then talk to an injured soldier, who tells them about the preparedness of the fugitives. When the soldier mentions that they even have an ID card, Major Mallik realizes that he had actually seen them passing through the checkpoint on the highway to Muzaffarabad. The searchers prepare to go there.\n\n===The Wild Chase At Muzaffarabad===\nOn the morning of 15 August, the escapees arrive at Muzaffarabad. The truck-driver goes on his way, and the soldiers check into a hotel. Once inside the hotel room, Suraj instructs Ram and Gurtu to purchase some necessary medical items from the local stores. He then asks Jacob to plot out an escape route on the map they took off the first escape truck. He charts out a route going up to Baramulla, India. This route avoids the main highway and goes through hills and villages. The last twenty kilometres have to be covered on foot, because the heavy snowfall makes it impossible for any vehicle to pass. Jacob then collapses and the others realize that he was not merely grazed by the bullet, but that his gunshot wound was life-threatening. Kabir holds him tightly while Suraj attempts to remove the bullet from his stomach.\n\nMeanwhile, in the town, while Ram and Gurtu are purchasing medicines and painkillers for Jacob, Ram notices a military convoy approaching. The search party is here. He and Gurtu run to the hotel to warn the others. Although they were not seen by the searchers, the place is soon swarming with soldiers. In the hotel room, Jacob finds the pain unbearable and reaches for a pistol. Ram and Gurtu reach the room just in time to see him shoot himself in the head. Although the four men are stunned, they have no time to waste. They cover Jacob in a blanket, take the map and the bags, and flee through the window.\n\nAs they run through the side streets of the town, the Pakistanis are on their heels. When the fugitives reach the main street, they have to hide behind a truck as it is crowded with soldiers led by Colonel Shakoor. They cannot remain behind the truck for long, because the column of soldiers chasing them is getting closer. Then Ram spots a motorbike, he tells Suraj and the others to be ready to take it. Before they can stop him, he runs into Colonel Shakoor's view, shoots his guard and runs into a side-lane. As the soldiers run after him, the fugitives hide themselves under the tarpaulin of another truck, thereby escaping notice by the column that was chasing them. This column joins the other soldiers in the chase. As a straggler is attempting to start the motorbike, the escapees (Suraj, Kabir and Gurtu) run out of their hiding place, beat him unconscious and ride away on it.\n\nRam has taken control of an army jeep after killing a few soldiers, including Major Azzam Baig. He too has sustained a few bullet injuries, and is now leading the Pakistanis away from his friends. He now has only one pistol and one grenade for weapons. He leads the soldiers out of the town as far away as he can. The chasing convoy is led by Colonel Shakoor, who is berating his men to drive faster. Major Mallik is in the second jeep. Suddenly, Major Suraj Singh turns in from a dirt road and is riding next to the leading jeep. Colonel Shakoor stares into the faces of Suraj, Gurtu and Kabir. The jeep driver's face registers terror as he sees Kabir priming a grenade. Kabir lobs the grenade into the jeep as Suraj picks up speed and races away. In the next few seconds, the convoy comes to a standstill and Colonel Shakoor leaps out of his jeep. He runs a few steps and throws himself flat on the ground. The jeep explodes as the Indians race away. A stunned Major Mallik is unable to believe his eyes. The expression on his face sums up the scene: he did not expect the Indians to pull off a move like that.\n\n===The Sacrifice===\nThe men on the bike catch up with Ram, who is relieved to see them safe. Gurtu asks innocently, \"Listen, sir, is this the road to Delhi?\" then tells him to watch where he is driving. But their victory is short-lived as they are attacked by a truck coming from the opposite direction. Although Kabir and Gurtu manage to shoot the driver of the truck and the shooters in its front, Suraj is forced to divert the bike into a ditch. Ram stops the jeep and watches his friends careening wildly downslope. They hit a rock and the bike cartwheels, then lands on Kabir's right leg. As the bike slides down the slope, it drags him with it. Suraj and Gurtu are lucky to survive with only a few scratches.\n\nRam is shot by the soldiers who are climbing out of the back of the truck. Gurtu is climbing upslope to rush to his aid with a furious Suraj attempting to stop him. Ram, still alive, sees the scene: Shakoor and Mallik have caught up and are driving towards him, the soldiers from the truck ahead are running towards him, and Gurtu and Suraj are dangerously close to revealing their position in the ditch. He quickly turns his jeep around and, with the soldiers still running after him, drives straight at Shakoor's vehicle. Mallik, seated next to Shakoor, orders the driver to stop and reverse. He is sure that Ram is playing a fresh new trick, while Shakoor wants to get closer to Ram so that he can shoot him dead. Ram slams into them at high speed, causing serious injury to Shakoor, the soldiers in Shakoor's truck and to himself. Shakoor, who is now unconscious, is laid on the ground as Mallik orders for an ambulance. Mallik then walks to Ram's jeep to see what he was trying to do.\n\nRam is bleeding profusely, he has a few breaths' worth of life left in him and he has primed a grenade. When Mallik sees the grenade, he shouts a warning for everyone to run away. As they all run away from the jeep, Mallik leading them, it explodes. In the ditch, Suraj and Gurtu see the explosion. Suraj covers Gurtu's mouth so that his cries cannot be heard by the men on the road. They watch the jeep and the truck go up in flames, then Suraj forcibly turns Gurtu around and they come back to the motorbike, which has Kabir still partially pinned underneath it. The blast has claimed many lives, including Colonel Shakoor's. As Mallik directs the rescue, Colonel Sheriar Khan catches up. Simultaneously, the fugitives get the bike upright and drive away.\n\n===The Intervention===\nWhile Mallik and Khan are directing the rescue, Sabeena Jahangir arrives there with the Red Cross delegates and questions Khan as to his lies regarding the Indian POWs. Mallik explains that this blast was the result of an accident involving two vehicles and that they are in no way connected to the POW issue. They go to the Muzaffarabad base, where in a closed room, Colonel Sheriar Khan is informed on the phone that a delegate has been sent to recall Sabeena Jahangir. When he expresses disbelief and frustration that the POW matter is now known, Mallik tells him that catching the POWs is now difficult. He says that in addition to being highly motivated, they are also military experts. He mentions Ram's suicide bombing of the trucks as proof of how far they are willing to go. But until the arrival of the delegate, he says, Colonel Sheriar Khan must keep Jahangir pacified. When Khan attempts to tell Jahangir that there is a misunderstanding regarding the accident and the blast, she says that the occurrence of one blast at Chaklala and within one day another one at Muzaffarabad is highly suspicious. She alleges that the Pakistani military have deceived the Red Cross and the Pakistani public by lying that there are no Indian POWs in the country. Just then, the High Commission delegate arrives and shows Jahangir an order to vacate the area immediately. She glares at Mallik and Khan, then leaves with her colleagues. As soon as she is gone, the soldiers spring into action resuming their search.\n\n===Saluting Fallen Comrades===\nHowever, this intervention has bought off valuable time for the escapees. They have gone on the route marked by Jacob and reached the point from where they have to go by foot. The bike is anyway out of petrol. While Suraj Singh throws the bike down a mountainside, Gurtu has leaned Kabir against a tree and is making three mounds in the snow; one for each man who died on this mission. Seeing this, Suraj points out that they sacrificed their lives for their battle, so they must be respected as martyrs. He, Kabir and Gurtu stand up and salute this memorial. Then, they walk on into the snow, Kabir being held up by the others.\n\n===The Cold Night===\nThe Indian soldiers have reached a point where they must stop and wait until dark before resuming their journey. They risk being caught if they go any further while there is still light. Suraj and Gurtu tie a splint improvised out of twigs onto Kabir's fractured leg.\n\nBy nightfall, the Pakistanis have reached a stream where they retrieve the bike that was thrown down the mountain. Khan and Mallik disagree in their conclusions. While Khan is certain that the fugitives have died and that their bodies should be lying close by, Mallik thinks that they could have thrown the bike down the mountainside and continued on foot. Khan berates Mallik for overestimating the fugitives. Mallik steps aside, and while Khan continues the search in the vicinity, gives voice to his own thoughts: \"When the bloody war was over, there was never any need to detain these soldiers. Not only have we incurred the curses of their kin, we have also created a nuisance for ourselves. If I say this aloud, I will be declared a traitor. If I don't, then this Pakistani conscience of mine will torment me for life.\"\n\nSuraj awakens Gurtu and Kabir to continue their journey. Kabir is not able to move his leg. Suraj removes the shoe on his injured leg only to see that it has turned black. Kabir says that it is frostbite and that it will climb up his body. However, when he requests to be left behind, Suraj will not hear of it. He carries Kabir bodily on his back, and their trek continues. They can do nothing but walk on. They keep themselves sane by exchanging little jokes and talking about their hometowns. When Suraj stumbles under Kabir's weight, Kabir points out that this way a two-hour journey will stretch to six hours. Suraj will again hear none of it. Sometime later, Kabir tells Suraj that he respects him more than he would respect his own father. Suraj replies that in the army a senior officer is like a father anyway.\n\n===Unparalleled Heroism===\nIt is dawn. The three soldiers have stopped to rest by the side of a path winding through the mountains. Kabir and Gurtu are asleep; Suraj is sitting huddled next to them. He sees something far below him in the valley. He rises, then wakes up Gurtu and asks him to take a look. They strain their eyes. They cannot believe what they are seeing. It is an Indian army outpost with the Indian Flag raised above it. They cheer, scream, and laugh in jubilation. But when Gurtu tries to rouse Kabir, he falls limply to one side. He is dead. With nothing else left to do, Suraj and Gurtu bury Kabir in the snow and walk on towards the Indian side of the border. It is about a few hundred yards away.\n\nSuddenly they hear the sound of a helicopter. It carries Colonel Sheriar Khan and Major Bilal Mallik. As Khan fires at them with a machine gun, Mallik cautions him that they are too close to the Line Of Control (LOC). As Suraj and Gurtu attempt to run, they end up taking a few bullet wounds. Gurtu is shot in his leg, which disables him from standing up. The Indian soldiers at the outpost, who see the helicopter, think that the Pakistanis are starting a skirmish. They get ready to fire a rocket.\n\nGurtu crawls into a rock alcove and asks Suraj to proceed alone without him. Suraj replies that he has no family back home in India and that if he reaches home he will do so with his companions. Suraj then says that they must survive for the sake of their comrades who died in the escape and for the sake of those who are still prisoners. Meanwhile, Mallik mutinies against Khan and orders the pilot to turn the chopper around. The Indians fire a rocket at the chopper. As the helicopter turns around and flies away behind the mountains, the rocket explodes harmlessly on a mountainside. On the ground, Gurtu is unable to walk, so Suraj seats him against a rock. He promises to bring help from the Indian side.\n\nMajor Suraj Singh calls out to the Indians, but he has been a prisoner for six years. As he calls for help, his voice stammers and fails many times. The Indians simply do not or cannot hear him. Then suddenly gunshots are heard and Suraj collapses. A column of Pakistani soldiers is running towards the two fugitives. Suraj is shot badly. The Indian soldiers rush to their defensive positions. As Gurtu is still recovering from the shock, Suraj struggles to his feet. He tells Gurtu that he will be back with help even before the Pakistanis arrive. He is still the father figure his men loved him for being. The Pakistanis are rushing on, screaming obscenities. Suraj runs towards the Indian outpost. As the Pakistanis fire at him, the Indians, thinking that a skirmish is on, fire back at the Pakistanis. This pins them down considerably so their firing on Suraj does not have much effect. Then the Indian officer sees Suraj through his binoculars and orders his men to stop firing as he realizes that the Pakistanis were chasing a fugitive. Then the Pakistanis are able to come out into the open and fire at Suraj. He nevertheless runs as hard as he can. There is an explosion close to his feet, probably a land mine, and he is thrown forward to the ground by the force of the blast.\n\nGurtu is looking at Suraj over the distance. His face has a look of peace. Suraj has reached the Indian side. He slowly stands up and looks ahead. He is home. He looks at the soldiers and at the flag above them. He is too overcome by emotion to say even a word. The Indians see a man in Pakistani army uniform before them. Suraj raises his right hand as if reaching for the flag. Then the Pakistanis fire one shot, which goes through Suraj's heart. He falls to the ground and dies.\n\nThe Pakistani soldiers have reached the border. Khan and Mallik make their way to their head. The Indian officer shouts a question across the no-man's-land, asking what the matter is. Khan replies that the dead fugitive was a deserter from the Pakistani army who was court-martialled and had killed two civilians while escaping. He asks the Indians to search the dead man for an ID card, which should confirm his identity. The Indians find on Suraj's person the fake ID card, which had got him through the Pakistani check post. The officer grants permission for the Pakistanis to take away the corpse and warns them to be careful in future. As Suraj's body is dragged back to the Pakistani side, Mallik removes his beret in a gesture of respect to the man who, in his own way, did reach his country.\n\n===Epilogue===\nIt is now 2007. The place is Multan Jail in Pakistan. We see an old man walking in the prison compound. He has made five little mounds of earth and he is putting a few flowers on them. He sits on the ground next to them and leafs through what was once Major Suraj Singh's prison diary. This old man is Gurtu. He now has only two motives in his life: to hope to return home and to keep alive the memory of his five friends.\n\nThe screen now blurs, and a Voice over informs us that there are still 54 Indian [[POW]]'s of the 1971 and the 1965 Indo Pak wars who are languishing in Pakistani Jails. They were last seen alive in 1988. Copies of original letters posted by them come up as the credits Roll\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Manoj Bajpayee]] as Major Suraj Dahiya\n* [[Ravi Kishan]] as Capt.

Her home was at Wyke House, and all her children were born there.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nBy his will Robinson left legacies to Captain John Wordsworth and Richard Wordsworth of Staple Inn, London. His means were comparatively small. After his death his accounts were called for, and it was some time before they were passed, and the embargo placed by the crown on the transfer of his Isleworth property to [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey]] removed. Robinson was benefactor to Isleworth, Appleby, and Harwich, leaving books to the grammar schools in the last two towns.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nRobinson's correspondence and official papers, including many communications from George III, went to the Marquis of Abergavenny at [[Eridge Castle]]. The substance of part of them was described in the 10th Report of the [[Historical Manuscripts Commission]]. Excerpts from the whole collections were edited by [[Benjamin Franklin Stevens]] for the [[Royal Historical Society]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nWyke House in the 19th century became a school, run by [[Alexander Jamieson]], and then a private lunatic asylum.<ref name=\"Wise2012\">{{cite book|author=Sarah Wise|title=Inconvenient People: Lunacy, Liberty and the Mad-Doctors in Victorian England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQ-eTrSJuY4C&pg=PT466|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=4 October 2012|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-2795-9|page=466}}</ref><ref>{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Bloxam, John Rouse}}</ref><ref>[http://studymore.org.uk/3_06.htm#WykeHouse ''The 1832 Madhouse Act and the Metropolitan Commission in Lunacy from 1832''.]</ref> One of the proprietors was [[William Birmingham Costello]];<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|id=6381|title=Costello, William Birmingham|first=John|last=Symons}}</ref> later physicians there were [[John Stevenson Bushnan]] and then [[Robert Gardiner Hill]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=4165|title=Bushnan, John Stevenson|first=Nick|last=Hervey}}</ref><ref>{{cite ODNB|id=13294|title=Hill, Robert Gardiner|first= Akihito|last=Suzuki}}</ref> Hill parted company with his partner Edmund Sparke Willett in 1860; Willett was listed as proprietor in 1874.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=22431 |date=5 October 1860 |page=3608}}</ref><ref>Lyttleton Forbes Winslow, ''Manual of Lunacy; a handbook relating to the legal care and treatment of the insane in the public and private asylums of Great Britain, Ireland, United States of America, and the Continent'' (1874), p. 78; [https://archive.org/stream/manualoflunacyha00wins#page/78/mode/2up archive.org.]</ref> It was still in use as a mental hospital in 1958.<ref name=\"VCH\"/> In 1970 it was being used for mental health rehabilitation, and was [[Grade II listed]].
