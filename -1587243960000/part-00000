At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

Following the move-in, the HouseGuests joined each other in the living room for formal introductions over champagne. As the HouseGuests began to settle in to the House, Julie informed them that they would vote for a Camp Director, who would be safe from the first eviction and have unprecedented power in the game.

He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced. David returned to the house from sequester and the next three evicted HouseGuests (Ovi, Kemi and Cliff) remained in the house after getting voted out of the game.

Christie's nomination did not require a replacement if the veto was used to save her.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: Week 9 was ''Prank Week'' and featured the ''America's Prankster'' power. America voted for Nick to be ''America's Prankster'' and took half of Holly's Head of Household power by anonymously nominating one HouseGuest at the Nomination Ceremony (denoted in '''bold''') and naming a replacement nominee if the Power of Veto is used on his nominee. Nick was not given immunity with his power and could be nominated by Holly.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week.

The HouseGuests are sequestered in the ''Big Brother House'' with no contact with the outside world. During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced.

No woman, by contrast, agreed to such propositions from men of average attractiveness. While men were in general comfortable with the requests, regardless of their '''willingness, women responded with shock and disgust.<ref name=\"clarkhatfield1989\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/79.pdf | title=Gender Differences in Receptivity to Sexual Offers | author1=Clark, Russell D.

A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above. About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19374216|title=Average man sleeps with 7 women - Health - Sexual health - NBC News|work=NBC News}}</ref> Studies of the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s consistently demonstrate a small percentage of the studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the [[epidemiology]] of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at''' random with sexual partners from throughout a population or [[assortative mixing|within their social groups]].\n\nA 2006 [[systematic review]] analyzing data from 59 countries worldwide found no association between regional sexual behavior tendencies, such as number of sexual partners, and sexual-health status.

Different standards are often applied to different genders and civil statutes. [[Feminism|Feminists]] have traditionally argued a significant [[double standard]] exists between how men and women are judged for promiscuity. Historically, stereotypes of the promiscuous woman have tended to be pejorative, such as \"the [[slut]]\" or \"the harlot\", while male stereotypes have been more varied, some expressing approval, such as \"the stud\" or \"the player\", while others imply societal deviance, such as \"the womanizer\" or \"the philanderer\". A scientific study published in 2005 found that promiscuous men and women are both prone to derogatory judgment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = Michael | last2 = Fraley | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = The Sexual Double Standard: Fact or Fiction? | url = | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 52 | issue = 3\u20134| pages = 175\u2013186 | doi=10.1007/s11199-005-1293-5}}</ref>\n\nPromiscuity is common in many animal species.<ref name=\"Barash Lipton 2001\"/> Some species have promiscuous [[mating system]]s, ranging from [[polyandry]] and [[polygyny]] to mating systems with no stable relationships where mating between two individuals is a one-time event. Many species form stable [[pair bond]]s, but still mate with other individuals outside the pair. In [[biology]], incidents of promiscuity in species that form pair bonds are usually called [[extra-pair copulations]].\n\n==Humans==\nAccurately assessing people's [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] is difficult, since strong social and personal motivations occur, depending on social [[Social control|sanctions]] and [[taboo]]s, for either minimizing or exaggerating reported sexual activity.\n\nAmerican experiments in 1978 and 1982 found the great majority of men were willing to have sex with women they did not know, of average attractiveness, who propositioned them. No woman, by contrast, agreed to such propositions from men of average attractiveness. While men were in general comfortable with the requests, regardless of their willingness, women responded with shock and disgust.<ref name=\"clarkhatfield1989\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/79.pdf | title=Gender Differences in Receptivity to Sexual Offers | author1=Clark, Russell D.

A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above. About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19374216|title=Average man sleeps with 7 women - Health - Sexual health - NBC News|work=NBC News}}</ref> Studies of the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s consistently demonstrate a small percentage of the studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the [[epidemiology]] of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random with sexual partners from throughout a population or [[assortative mixing|within their social groups]].\n\nA 2006 [[systematic review]] analyzing data from 59 countries worldwide found no association between regional sexual behavior tendencies, such as number of sexual partners, and sexual-health status.

Gohad fort\n\n==History==\nAccording to [[Alexander Cunningham]] and William Cook, people of the [[Jat]] caste from village Bamrauli (near [[Agra]]) settled the town of [[Gohad]] in 1505. This later developed into an important Jat stronghold. The Jat rulers of Gohad were awarded the title of rana. The Rana Jat ruler Singhandev II founded Gohad fort and the Gohad state in  1505. Gohad state had 360 forts and fortresses all around for the protection of their people. Out of these Gohad fort is most important and unique example architecture of Jat rulers. It had the same style of architecture as used by the Jat rulers in Bharatpur Fort.<ref>Dr Ajay Kumar Agnihotri: ''Gohad ke Jaton ka Itihas'' (History of Jats of Gohad), Nav Sahitya Bhawan, Delhi, 1985</ref>\nSome old stories also mention that this fort was gifted to the Wazir of Scindia's Court, Shivaddin Pakhre for his years of service to the emperor. Currently the fort is under tha ASI.\n\n==The site of fort==\nThe site of Gohad fort was selected strategically on the Vaisli River where it takes a circular turn. The Gohad fort is in circular shape. It is protected by the rampart constructed around the fort in a length of 5&nbsp;km. The river was dug and flow of river was extended up to the fort to take a semi circular shape.<ref name=\"Jatvir smarika, 1992\">Jatvir smarika, 1992</ref>\n\nThe fort has 11 gates named after the villages to which they face and the way they lead to.

Constructing an outer rampart of 10-metre height surrounded with a trench created the first line of defence.  Depositing the soil dug out from the trench inside the outer rampart created the second line of defence. Constructing a pucca trench with higher wall created the third line of defence. This wall 1&nbsp;km in length, was safeguarded by Laxman Tal (pond) and deep Vaisli River. This wall had two gates namely \u2018Hathai paur\u2019 (east) and Sankal gate (west). Constructing a very high and the strongest wall half km long created the fourth line of defence. This was for the personal safety of the King and his places.
