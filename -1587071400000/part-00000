Their parents originally asked for the priests to be removed from ministry but pressed criminal and civil charges after reflecting on their moral duty to protect others. Bishop Wuerl's advisors unanimously suggested that he not visit the family. Bishop Wuerl decided that it was his duty to minister to their pain. Wuerl said, \"The lawyers could talk to one another, but I wasn't ordained to oversee a legal structure. As their bishop I was responsible for the Church's care of that family, and the only way I could do that was to go see them.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}  Father Zubik accompanied him to this meeting. The diocese settled the civil suit, and two of the priests in question were sentenced to prison. They were never allowed to return to ministry. Charges against the third priest were impossible due to the statute of limitations. This priest was forced to retire and forbidden to say mass for anyone by nuns in the convent he was assigned to live in.<ref name=\"Book1\"/> After seeing the damage inflicted upon their lives and faith, Wuerl implemented a \"zero tolerance\" policy against sexual abuse. The Diocese of Pittsburgh was among the first Catholic authorities to seriously address sexual abuse. Carefully preparing candidates for the priesthood for a life of celibacy was a key part of Wuerl's reforms.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nBishop Wuerl called a mandatory meeting to inform all priests that sexual contact with a minor was not merely a sin that could be forgiven, but a crime that would result in permanent removal from the ministry and maybe prison. Priests were instructed to report any allegation of sexual abuse committed by a priest or church employee to the chancery. The diocese created the Diocesan Review Board in 1989 to offer evaluations and recommendations to the bishop on the handling of all sexual abuse cases.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nIt is the policy of the Diocese of Pittsburgh to refer all allegations of child sexual abuse to law enforcement regardless of their credibility. Credible allegations of sexual abuse result in immediate removal from ministry. By direction of Bishop Wuerl, the diocese has had an internal policy on sexual misconduct since 1989. This policy was formalized in 1993, updated in 2002, and updated again in 2003.<ref name=\"Policy\">{{cite news |last1=Moody |first1=Chuck |title=Diocese has lengthy history of dealing with the issue |publisher=Pittsburgh Catholic |date=27 February 2004}}{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"release\"/>\n\nBishop Zubik handed off the case of Rev.

Their parents originally asked for the priests to be removed from ministry but pressed criminal and civil charges after reflecting on their moral duty to protect others. Bishop Wuerl's advisors unanimously suggested that he not visit the family. Bishop Wuerl decided that it was his duty to minister to their pain. Wuerl said, \"The lawyers could talk to one another, but I wasn't ordained to oversee a legal structure. As their bishop I was responsible for the Church's care of that family, and the only way I could do that was to go see them.\"{{cn|date=September 2019}}  Father Zubik accompanied him to this meeting. The diocese settled the civil suit, and two of the priests in question were sentenced to prison. They were never allowed to return to ministry. Charges against the third priest were impossible due to the statute of limitations. This priest was forced to retire and forbidden to say mass for anyone by nuns in the convent he was assigned to live in.<ref name=\"Book1\"/> After seeing the damage inflicted upon their lives and faith, Wuerl implemented a \"zero tolerance\" policy against sexual abuse. The Diocese of Pittsburgh was among the first Catholic authorities to seriously address sexual abuse. Carefully preparing candidates for the priesthood for a life of celibacy was a key part of Wuerl's reforms.<ref name=\"Book1\"/> \n\nBishop Wuerl called a mandatory meeting to inform all priests that sexual contact with a minor was not merely a sin that could be forgiven, but a crime that would result in permanent removal from the ministry and maybe prison. Priests were instructed to report any allegation of sexual abuse committed by a priest or church employee to the chancery. The diocese created the Diocesan Review Board in 1989 to offer evaluations and recommendations to the bishop on the handling of all sexual abuse cases.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nIt is the policy of the Diocese of Pittsburgh to refer all allegations of child sexual abuse to law enforcement regardless of their credibility. Credible allegations of sexual abuse result in immediate removal from ministry. By direction of Bishop Wuerl, the diocese has had an internal policy on sexual misconduct since 1989. This policy was formalized in 1993, updated in 2002, and updated again in 2003.<ref name=\"Policy\">{{cite news |last1=Moody |first1=Chuck |title=Diocese has lengthy history of dealing with the issue |publisher=Pittsburgh Catholic |date=27 February 2004}}{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"release\"/>\n\nBishop Zubik handed off the case of Rev.

Its chancery office and the residence of the Archbishop are located at 66 Riverview Avenue in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It is distinguished from the [[Latin Church]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|Diocese of Pittsburgh]].\n\nThe current archbishop is the Most Reverend William C. Skurla.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Exarchate ===\nIn 1924, the church had been established by the Holy See as an [[exarchate]], known as the '\"Apostolic Exarchate of Pittsburgh for Faithful of the Oriental Rite (Ruthenian)'\". Exarchate is an ecclesiastical term which indicates a \"missionary diocese\" or territory. \n \nThis move separated the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church in the United States into two distinct groups: one for those originating from Galicia (in modern-day Ukraine) with its [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia|see in Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, and the other for those who were from the Carpathian Mountain region (in modern-day Ukraine and Slovakia), as well as those from Hungary and Croatia. In time, the two groups would come to be known as Ukrainian Greek Catholics and Ruthenian Byzantine Catholics, respectively.\n\n=== (Arch)Eparchy ===\nThe Exarchate of Pittsburgh was elevated to the status of an eparchy (diocese) in 1963.\n\nByzantine Catholics in the United States were given ''[[sui iuris]]'' (self-governing) status as a Metropolia (archdiocese) by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1969. Archbishop [[Stephen Kocisko]] was installed as the first Metropolitan-Archbishop on June 11, 1969, at Holy Spirit Church in Oakland (Pittsburgh). He was the first prelate in the history of people from the [[Subcarpathian Rus]] region (of present-day Ukraine and Slovakia) to hold this rank.\n\n== Operations ==\nThe seat of the Archeparchy is the [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral (Pittsburgh)|St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral]] in [[Munhall, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Archeparchy of Pittsburgh also operates [[SS. Cyril and Methodius Byzantine Catholic Seminary]] in the North Side section of the city, for the training of candidates for the priesthood and diaconate, cantors and those in other ministries. Established in 1950 by Bishop [[Daniel Ivancho]], the seminary serves all four eparchies of the [[Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh]].\n\n=== Parishes ===\n{{As of|2010}}, the Archeparchy has 85 parishes under its canonical jurisdiction.\n\nThe majority of the archepachy's parishes are located in [[Western Pennsylvania]], particularly in the [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] metropolitan areas.\n \nAlthough most [[Ohio]] parishes are under the jurisdiction of the [[Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Parma]], 5 churches in metropolitan [[Youngstown]] and 5 churches in [[Ohio River]] communities are governed by the archeparchy.\n \nAdditionally, there are churches in the following states: [[Louisiana]] (1), [[Tennessee]] (1), [[Texas]] (4), and [[West Virginia]] (2).\n\n== Hierarchs ==\n; Apostolic Exarchs\n* [[Basil Takach]] (1924\u20131948)\n* [[Daniel Ivancho]] (1948\u20131954)\n\n; Eparchs\n* [[Nicholas Thomas Elko]] (1955\u20131967)\n\n; Archeparchs\n* [[Stephen Kocisko|Stephen John Kocisko]] (1967\u20131991)\n* [[Thomas Dolinay|Thomas Victor Dolinay]] (1991\u20131993)\n* [[Judson Procyk|Judson Michael Procyk]] (1994\u20132001)\n* [[Basil Myron Schott]], O.F.M.

The Goose Creek men became leaders of the early Indian trade, and by the 1690s many held important offices in the colonial government. At first the Goose Creek men dealt mainly in [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slaves]], while later the [[deerskin trade]] dominated. Several colonial governors were Goose Creek men, such as [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]] and [[Robert Daniell]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Oatis |first= Steven J. |title= A colonial complex: South Carolina's frontiers in the era of the Yamasee War, 1680\u20131730 |year= 2004 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |isbn= 0-8032-3575-5}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofgoosecreek.com/?id=75668&action=detail&catID=15201&parentID=15195  Overview of the History of Goose Creek], City of Goose Creek.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 29 | pages = 1\u201325, 71\u201396, 167\u201392, 265\u201379 | last = Smith | first = Henry A.

During the Cold War, the Naval Base (1902\u20131996) became the third largest U.S. homeport serving over 80 ships and submarines. In addition, the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, sub tenders, and submarines. The shipyard was also equipped for the refueling of nuclear subs.\n\nDuring this period, the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet's loadout base for all nuclear [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Two SSBN \"Boomer\" squadrons and a sub tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, [[Submarine Squadron 4]], and a sub tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the Station's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their [[UGM-27 Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon]], and [[UGM-96 Trident I]] delivery missiles ([[SLBM]]) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company.\n\nIn 2010, the Air Force base (3,877 acres) and Naval Weapons Station (>17,000 acres) merged to form [[Joint Base Charleston]].

The Goose Creek men became leaders of the early Indian trade, and by the 1690s many held important offices in the colonial government. At first the Goose Creek men dealt mainly in [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slaves]], while later the [[deerskin trade]] dominated. Several colonial governors were Goose Creek men, such as [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]] and [[Robert Daniell]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Oatis |first= Steven J. |title= A colonial complex: South Carolina's frontiers in the era of the Yamasee War, 1680\u20131730 |year= 2004 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |isbn= 0-8032-3575-5}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofgoosecreek.com/?id=75668&action=detail&catID=15201&parentID=15195  Overview of the History of Goose Creek], City of Goose Creek.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 29 | pages = 1\u201325, 71\u201396, 167\u201392, 265\u201379 | last = Smith | first = Henry A.

During the Cold War, the Naval Base (1902\u20131996) became the third largest U.S. homeport serving over 80 ships and submarines. In addition, the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, sub tenders, and submarines. The shipyard was also equipped for the refueling of nuclear subs.\n\nDuring this period, the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet's loadout base for all nuclear [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Two SSBN \"Boomer\" squadrons and a sub tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, [[Submarine Squadron 4]], and a sub tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the Station's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their [[UGM-27 Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon]], and [[UGM-96 Trident I]] delivery missiles ([[SLBM]]) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company.\n\nIn 2010, the Air Force base (3,877 acres) and Naval Weapons Station (>17,000 acres) merged to form [[Joint Base Charleston]].
