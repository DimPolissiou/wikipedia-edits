Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' \"participation in the Divine Nature\" and the possibility of understanding \"intellectual existences.\" Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of [[Common Sense Realism]] derived from Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Dugald Stewart]], whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by [[Ralph Cudworth]], [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] and, in a Romantic vein, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the \"official philosophy\" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.<ref>{{cite journal|first=David K.|last=Nartonis|title=Louis Agassiz and the Platonist Story of Creation at Harvard, 1795\u20131846|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2005|volume=66|issue=3|pages=437\u2013449|jstor=3654189|doi=10.1353/jhi.2005.0045}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles W.

While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] convictions.

He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty to make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as at the college level.

In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, [[Walter Camp]], former captain of the Yale football team, suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface, so other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html|title=History of American Football|publisher=Newsdial.com|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n[[File:Harvard stadium 2009h.JPG|thumb|[[Harvard Stadium]], home of [[Harvard Crimson]] and the [[Boston Cannons]]]]\n\n[[File:Harvard Rowing Crew at Henley 2004 -2.JPG|thumb|left|Harvard men's eight crew at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], 2004]]\n\nEven older than Harvard{{ndash}}Yale football rivalry, the Harvard\u2013Yale Regatta is held each June on the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] in eastern Connecticut.

Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' \"participation in the Divine Nature\" and the possibility of understanding \"intellectual existences.\" Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of [[Common Sense Realism]] derived from Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Dugald Stewart]], whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by [[Ralph Cudworth]], [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] and, in a Romantic vein, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the \"official philosophy\" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.<ref>{{cite journal|first=David K.|last=Nartonis|title=Louis Agassiz and the Platonist Story of Creation at Harvard, 1795\u20131846|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2005|volume=66|issue=3|pages=437\u2013449|jstor=3654189|doi=10.1353/jhi.2005.0045}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles W.

In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, [[Walter Camp]], former captain of the Yale football team, suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface, so other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html|title=History of American Football|publisher=Newsdial.com|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n[[File:Harvard stadium 2009h.JPG|thumb|[[Harvard Stadium]], home of [[Harvard Crimson]] and the [[Boston Cannons]]]]\n\n[[File:Harvard Rowing Crew at Henley 2004 -2.JPG|thumb|left|Harvard men's eight crew at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], 2004]]\n\nEven older than Harvard{{ndash}}Yale football rivalry, the Harvard\u2013Yale Regatta is held each June on the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] in eastern Connecticut.

The reservoir commenced supplying water in 1864. The Maroondah Aqueduct was built in 1886\u20131891 to supply water to the Preston Reservoir from a diversion weir on the [[Watts River]], which was dammed in 1927 to form [[Maroondah Reservoir]]. Until 1881 Preston Reservoir was Melbourne\u2019s only service reservoir. By 1884 it was determined that Preston Reservoir needed additional water storage and an area of approximately 11ha was purchased on the east side of High Street. Reservoirs No.2 and No.3 were constructed in 1909 and 1913 respectively. Eventually reservoirs No.2 and No.3 were covered to prevent dust entering the water supply.<ref>[https://www.melbournewater.com.au/what-we-are-doing/works-and-projects-near-me/all-projects/preston-reservoir-landscape-master-plan Preston Reservoir landscape master plan]</ref>\n\nIn 1914 Thomas Dyer Edwardes donated an area of 34 acres of land to the people of the former City of Preston, which was developed into Edwardes Lake Park.<ref name = \"EdwardesLake\">{{Citation | last = Edwardes Lake Park  | title = Darebin City Council | url = http://www.darebin.vic.gov.au/Page/page.aspx?page_Id=3382 | accessdate = 24 April 2014}}</ref> Between 1919 and 1939 swimming was officially permitted with the presence of the Preston Lifesaving Club and regular demonstrations of swimming and lifesaving techniques during this time.<ref name = \"EdwardesSwimming\">{{Citation | last = Swimming at Edwardes Lake  | title = Darebin Heritage | url = http://heritage.darebinlibraries.vic.gov.au/article/429 | accessdate = 24 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nReservoir is close to the [[Northland Shopping Centre]], Preston Market, [http://www.prestoncentral.org.au/directory.html#37 High Street food quarter], [[Sydney Road, Melbourne|Sydney Road]] shops and restaurants and one of three remaining drive-in cinemas in Melbourne, the [[Village Roadshow|Village]] in [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]].

The reservoir commenced supplying water in 1864. The Maroondah Aqueduct was built in 1886\u20131891 to supply water to the Preston Reservoir from a diversion weir on the [[Watts River]], which was dammed in 1927 to form [[Maroondah Reservoir]]. Until 1881 Preston Reservoir was Melbourne\u2019s only service reservoir. By 1884 it was determined that Preston Reservoir needed additional water storage and an area of approximately 11ha was purchased on the east side of High Street. Reservoirs No.2 and No.3 were constructed in 1909 and 1913 respectively. Eventually reservoirs No.2 and No.3 were covered to prevent dust entering the water supply.<ref>[https://www.melbournewater.com.au/what-we-are-doing/works-and-projects-near-me/all-projects/preston-reservoir-landscape-master-plan Preston Reservoir landscape master plan]</ref>\n\nIn 1914 Thomas Dyer Edwardes donated an area of 34 acres of land to the people of the former City of Preston, which was developed into Edwardes Lake Park.<ref name = \"EdwardesLake\">{{Citation | last = Edwardes Lake Park  | title = Darebin City Council | url = http://www.darebin.vic.gov.au/Page/page.aspx?page_Id=3382 | accessdate = 24 April 2014}}</ref> Between 1919 and 1939 swimming was officially permitted with the presence of the Preston Lifesaving Club and regular demonstrations of swimming and lifesaving techniques during this time.<ref name = \"EdwardesSwimming\">{{Citation | last = Swimming at Edwardes Lake  | title = Darebin Heritage | url = http://heritage.darebinlibraries.vic.gov.au/article/429 | accessdate = 24 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nReservoir is close to the [[Northland Shopping Centre]], Preston Market, [http://www.prestoncentral.org.au/directory.html#37 High Street food quarter], [[Sydney Road, Melbourne|Sydney Road]] shops and restaurants and one of three remaining drive-in cinemas in Melbourne, the [[Village Roadshow|Village]] in [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]].

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

Both Super Bowls were against the [[New England Patriots]]. McMahon was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1998.\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], McMahon moved with his family to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]] when he was three.<ref name=\"ESPN Classic\" /> He played high school football his freshman and sophomore years at [[Andrew Hill High School]] in San Jose, then moved with his family in the summer of 1975 to [[Roy, Utah]].

Also he played baseball (1977), but he played enough at quarterback to throw his first-ever collegiate touchdown pass against [[UTEP Miners football|UTEP]]. He continued as the Cougars' punter as the [[1978 BYU Cougars football team|1978]] season began, but when [[Marc Wilson (American football)|Marc Wilson]] was injured in the third game of the season (against [[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State]]), McMahon became the starting quarterback. McMahon led BYU to victory against CSU, accounting for 112 passing yards, 80 rushing yards, and two touchdowns. He was named Chevrolet Player of the Game and [[Western Athletic Conference|WAC]] Player of the Week for his performance. McMahon and Wilson shared quarterback duties for the rest of the season; McMahon played well enough to earn All-WAC honors and [[Associated Press]] Honorable Mention [[All-America]]. The best game of his sophomore year was against [[Wyoming Cowboys football|Wyoming]]: he passed for 317 yards and rushed for 49 more yards, earning another WAC Player of the Week award.\n\nMcMahon had suffered a knee injury towards the end of the 1978 season and BYU coaches chose to [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] him in [[1979 BYU Cougars football team|1979]]. McMahon watched from the sidelines as Wilson set nine [[NCAA]] records, tied two others, and became the first BYU player to earn consensus first team [[1979 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] honors; he finished third in [[Heisman Trophy]] [[1979 NCAA Division I-A football season#Heisman Trophy|balloting]].\n\nWith Wilson graduated and in the [[1980 NFL season|NFL]] with the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]], McMahon beat out Royce Bybee to claim the starting quarterback position in [[1980 BYU Cougars football team|1980]]. BYU lost the opener 25\u201321 against [[New Mexico Lobos football|New Mexico]], but then won eleven straight to claim the WAC championship. McMahon set 32 NCAA records, including single-season records for yards of total offense (4,627), passing yards (4,571), touchdown passes (47), and passing efficiency (176.9). His best game was against [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]]; he completed 21 of 33 passes for 485 yards and six touchdowns, and added two rushing touchdowns. That performance earned him ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'''s National Player of the Week award. McMahon's season statistics might have been even better, but he spent significant time on the sidelines because the Cougars won many games by wide margins. Although he started all 12 regular season games, he only finished three of them.\n\nBYU led the nation in passing offense, total offense, and scoring offense during the regular season. McMahon earned numerous awards for his individual accomplishments, being named WAC Player of the Year, unanimous First Team All-WAC, Utah Sportsman of the Year, and [[Deseret News]] Athlete of the Year. He was named to four All-America teams and finished fifth in Heisman Trophy voting.\n\nIn the [[1980 Holiday Bowl|Holiday Bowl]], the Cougars faced an [[1980 SMU Mustangs football team|SMU]] team led by star running backs [[Craig James (running back)|Craig James]] and [[Eric Dickerson]], and the Mustangs built a 45\u201325 lead over BYU with just four minutes left in the game. As Cougar fans headed for the exits, McMahon screamed that the game was not over yet.

For his efforts, he was named WAC Player of the Year and unanimous First Team All-WAC. On a national level, he was named [[1981 College Football All-America Team|First-team All-American]] by five different organizations and finished third in Heisman Trophy balloting. He received the [[Davey O'Brien]] Trophy and the [[Sammy Baugh]] Award, and he shared the Pigskin Club NCAA Offensive Player of the Year award with [[University of Southern California|USC]]'s [[Marcus Allen]]. He earned ''Sports Illustrated'''s Player of the Week award after his performance against Colorado State, in which he tied a school record with 7 touchdown passes.\n\nIn his last game as a Cougar, McMahon passed for 342 yards and 3 touchdowns to lead BYU over [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]] in the 1981 Holiday Bowl. His career totals were 9,536 passing yards and 84 touchdown passes (not including bowl games). McMahon left college with 70 NCAA records{{r|rock20100904}} and tied for one other.

On October 2, 2014, after completing his degree in communications, McMahon was inducted into the BYU Athletics Hall of Fame as part of the 2014 class.<ref>{{cite web|title=McMahon Inducted into BYU Hall of Fame|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865612288/Five-All-Americans-including-McMahon-inducted-into-BYU-Athletic-Hall-of-Fame.html}}</ref> BYU honored McMahon by retiring his No. 9 jersey during a halftime ceremony at the BYU vs. Utah State football game on Friday, October 3, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=McMahon's BYU jersey to be retired Oct. 3|url=http://byucougars.com/m-football/mcmahon's-byu-jersey-be-retired-oct-3}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===Chicago Bears===\nThe [[1982 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] selected McMahon in the first round (fifth overall) of the [[1982 NFL Draft]]. New head coach [[Mike Ditka]] made McMahon his first first-round selection. McMahon, thrilled to be free from what he considered a restrictive culture at BYU, strolled into his first public function with the Bears holding a cold beer in his hand. Ditka was not impressed, nor was Bears owner and founder [[George Halas]]. McMahon was to find the atmosphere in Chicago almost as challenging as that at Brigham Young, and he would lock horns with Ditka routinely during his seven years with the Bears.\n\nMcMahon won the Bears' starting quarterback job as a rookie in [[1982 Chicago Bears season|1982]], and was named to several All-Rookie teams when he nearly led the team to the playoffs, despite the NFL only playing two games before a [[1982 NFL strike|players' strike]] that cancelled nearly half the season. McMahon quickly displayed a natural ability to read defenses and an athletic versatility that surprised many.\n\nMcMahon also made a case for being the best rollout passer at that time. He explained that coaching in his youth had taught him to square his shoulders to the direction he wanted to throw the football, and he was thus able to execute passes with tight spirals and a high degree of accuracy when running to either his left or his right. The Bears finished the strike-shortened season at 3\u20136, but due to an expanded playoff format and conference-wide seeding the Bears missed a playoff berth by only one victory. McMahon was named [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Offensive Rookie of the Year, losing the league-wide honor to [[Marcus Allen]].\n\nIn [[1983 Chicago Bears season|1983]], McMahon continued to improve as a passer and as a field general. He made a habit of changing the play both in the huddle and at the line of scrimmage, a practice which frustrated Ditka but usually led to success. His knowledge of the game and an instinctive, intuitive grasp of in-game situations were significant. He became a frequent scorer in goal line situations, after the dying Halas instructed Ditka to make the quarterback sneak a bigger part of the Bears' offense. He also began to catch touchdown passes on option plays, and was the emergency punter. Chicago finished the season at 8\u20138, missing the division title and a playoff berth by one victory again.\n\nIn [[1984 Chicago Bears season|1984]], the Bears broke through, reaching the conference title game before losing to the [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]]. McMahon started the season strongly, though nursing minor injuries like those that would plague him throughout his career. In a violent game against the [[1984 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] in Chicago, McMahon sustained a season-ending injury when he was brutally tackled by two Los Angeles defenders. He suffered bruised ribs and a lacerated kidney on the play, but limped to the huddle and breathlessly called the next play, despite difficulty breathing and increasing pain. The players could barely hear him in the huddle, and when McMahon attempted an audible at the line of scrimmage the Bears receivers were unable to hear his call. McMahon was on the verge of collapsing on the field, clutching his flank and rasping in his attempts to convey his situation. Offensive linemen helped McMahon stand and leave the field. McMahon went to the locker room, and reported urine that \"looked like grape juice.\"\n\n====1985====\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 11 - Jim McMahon (Jim McMahon crop).jpg|thumb|150px|right|Jim McMahon dives into the end zone to score a touchdown during Super Bowl XX.]]\n[[File:1985 Chicago Bears Visit the White House.webm|thumb|right|300px|'1985 Chicago Bears Visit the White House' - video from White House]]\nIn [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]], the Bears won their first 12 games and finished at 15\u20131. McMahon became a media darling, not only for his outstanding play on the field, but also for his personality. He appeared in a [[hip hop music|rap]] record made by the team, \"The [[Super Bowl Shuffle]],\" in which he proclaimed ''\"I'm the punky QB known as McMahon.\"'' He ended the season with a strong performance in [[Super Bowl XX]], which the Bears won 46\u201310 over the [[1985 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. In that game, McMahon became the first quarterback in the history of the Super Bowl to rush for two touchdowns.<ref>NFL 2001 Record and Fact Book, Edited by Randall Liu, p. 349, Workman Publishing, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7611-2480-2}}</ref> McMahon earned a spot in his only [[1986 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]].\n\nMcMahon was notorious for head-first [[baseball]]-style slides when running the football, despite being coached to slide feet-first to protect his body. In the playoffs McMahon heeded this coaching advice and was speared by a defender's helmet squarely in his buttocks, causing a painful deep bruise for which McMahon sought [[acupuncture]] treatment.<ref>In Life, First You Kick Ass: Reflections on the 1985 Bears and Wisdom from Da Coach, Mike Ditka with Rick Telander, Sports Publishing, 2005, {{ISBN|978-1-58261-977-4}}</ref> This led to a point of controversy before the [[Super Bowl]] in New Orleans, when McMahon \"[[Mooning|mooned]]\" journalists who were inquiring as to the status of the injury. \n\nIn an early-season Thursday night game at Minnesota, McMahon was slated to back up [[Steve Fuller (American football)|Steve Fuller]], as McMahon had missed practice time earlier in the week due to a neck injury that required an overnight hospital stay. Midway into the third quarter, the Vikings held a 17\u20139 lead. McMahon lobbied to get into the game until well into the third quarter. Once finally on the field, his first play was an opportunistic 70-yard touchdown pass to [[Willie Gault]]. After an interception by Wilber Marshall on the Vikings ensuing possession, McMahon's very next offensive play was a 25-yard touchdown pass to [[Dennis McKinnon]], making him 2\u20132 for 95 yards and two [[touchdown]]s. He followed up with another successful offensive drive, including a crucial third and short sneak to set up another 43-yard touchdown pass to McKinnon. The Bears led 30\u201317 and went on to win the game 33\u201324.\n\nMcMahon was fined $5,000 for violating the league's dress code by wearing an [[Adidas]] headband.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-11-15/sports/0911140277_1_chad-ochocinco-nfl-halas | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Chicago Bears' Jim McMahon was the Chad Ochocinco of his day | date=November 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====1986\u20131988====\n{{Further|Charles Martin (American football)#1986 McMahon incident}}\nIn week 12 of the 1986 NFL regular season, McMahon was playing against the Green Bay Packers, while dealing with an existing rotator cuff injury to his right shoulder. After throwing a 3rd down interception and at least two seconds after his pass was thrown, Green Bay nose tackle [[Charles Martin (football player)|Charles Martin]] grabbed McMahon from behind and body-slammed him to the ground. McMahon hit the frozen artificial turf at Soldier Field shoulder first, exacerbating his existing rotator cuff injury. He briefly returned to the game, but it soon became apparent that he couldn't throw effectively, and he left the game in the third quarter, never to play again in 1986. Martin was immediately ejected from the game and later suspended for two additional games \u2014 the first multi-game suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history. Without McMahon, and despite finishing tied for the league's best record at 14\u20132, the Bears were unable to defend their Super Bowl championship and lost in the Divisional Playoff round to the [[1986 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]].\n\nMcMahon battled injuries for the rest of his career although at one point between the 1984 and [[1987 Chicago Bears season|1987]] seasons, he won 22 consecutive regular-season (25 including playoffs and the Super Bowl) starts, the longest \"regular season winning streak\" by an NFL quarterback at the time, now held by [[Peyton Manning]], who won 23 in 2008 to 2009 (but lost a wildcard playoff game to the Chargers during his \"winning streak\").\n\nIn 1987, he came right back from a head injury in a game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. McMahon brought the Chicago Bears back in the first game following the [[1987 NFL strike|1987 NFL players strike]] to defeat the Buccaneers, 27\u201326. The Bears went on to an 11\u20134 record with many expecting McMahon to lead the Bears back to the Super Bowl. However, 1987 ended exactly the same way 1986 did with the Bears eliminated by the [[1987 Washington Redskins season|eventual Super Bowl champion Redskins]].\n\nMcMahon returned for the [[1988 Chicago Bears season|1988]] season with a much more serious attitude. His main offensive weapon in [[Walter Payton]] had retired and McMahon publicly expressed his desire to win a Super Bowl again. The Bears looked strong all season and went 12\u20134, again winning the NFC Central, and finishing with the NFC's top seed, ensuring they would host the NFC Championship Game at Soldier Field if they advanced that far. McMahon was unable to get the Bears back to the Super Bowl, as they were routed by the eventual Super Bowl champion [[1988 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in the NFC Championship which saw McMahon benched in favor of [[Mike Tomczak]] in the fourth quarter.\n\nDuring the offseason, McMahon and Bears president [[Michael McCaskey]] had a major falling out with each other. He also fell out of favor with head coach [[Mike Ditka]], and after spending his first seven seasons in the league with Chicago, McMahon was traded to the [[1989 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]].\n\n{{As of|2017}}'s NFL off-season, Jim McMahon held at least 15 Bears franchise records, including:\n* Completions: playoffs (70)\n* Passing Yards: playoffs (967), playoff season (636 in 1985)\n* Passing TDs: playoffs (4), playoff season (3 in 1985; with [[Rex Grossman]]), playoff game (2 on 1986-01-05 NYG; with [[Steve Walsh (American football)|Steve Walsh]] and [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]), rookie season (9 in 1982; with [[Kyle Orton]])\n* Passer Rating: playoffs (77.1), playoff season (106.6 in 1985), rookie season (79.9 in 1982)\n* Sacked: playoffs (10), rookie game (7 on 1982-11-28 @MIN)\n* Yds/Pass Att: playoffs (7.61), playoff season (9.64 in 1985)\n* Pass Yds/Game: rookie season (187.6 in 1982)\n\n===San Diego Chargers===\nMcMahon started 12 games for the 6\u201310 [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]] team in 1989. He went 4\u20138 in the games he started, though the team lost 4 of those games by a combined 11 points. He had only 4 games over 200 yards, but had 389 yards against the [[Houston Oilers]] in a Week 2 loss.\n\nHowever, McMahon again found himself in trouble when he fell out of favor with his coach, [[Dan Henning]], his teammates, and the team's front office staff. He was benched for the final four games in favor of [[Billy Joe Tolliver]] and finished the year with 2,132 yards, 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He was released after the season.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Jim McMahon and Obama.jpg|thumb|upright|McMahon at the [[White House]] with [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] in 2011.]]\nMcMahon signed with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], who were coached by former Bears assistant [[Buddy Ryan]], for the 1990 season. For the first time in his career he served as a full-time backup as [[Randall Cunningham]] was entrenched as the starter. After Cunningham tore his ACL in the opening game of the following season, new coach [[Rich Kotite]] named McMahon his starter. He led the Eagles to a 10\u20136 record, including a Week 17 win over the 14\u20131 [[Washington Redskins]], and earned the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] award. He stayed with the Eagles for one additional season as the backup to Cunningham.\n\nMcMahon's last chance to be a full-time starter came with the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in [[1993 NFL season|1993]]. Supplanting [[Sean Salisbury]] as the team's starter, McMahon led the Vikings to eight wins in twelve starts and returned to the postseason as a starter for the first time since 1988. However, the Vikings lost to the [[New York Giants]].\n\nAfter the season, McMahon joined the [[Arizona Cardinals]], now coached by Ryan, for the 1994 season, where he made his final career start in Week 3 against the [[Cleveland Browns]]. He finished the season as the team's third quarterback behind [[Steve Beuerlein]] and [[Jay Schroeder]] and left the team at its conclusion. After failing to catch on with the Browns in the 1995 preseason, McMahon joined the [[Green Bay Packers]]. He retired following the [[1996 NFL season|1996]] season, which finished with a Green Bay Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots in New Orleans, eleven years to the day of the Bears' Super Bowl victory over the Patriots in the same venue.\n\nMcMahon caused some controversy when he showed up to the Packers' reception at the [[White House]] wearing his Bears jersey, due to the rivalry between the two teams. McMahon later explained that he did so because he was unable to visit the White House when he led the Bears to victory in Super Bowl XX; two days after the Bears won the game, the crew of [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-51-L]] were killed in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|explosion]] of their craft, Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', and the Bears' scheduled visit was cancelled. McMahon and his surviving teammates and coaches were eventually received in 2011 by President [[Barack Obama]], himself a Bears fan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/ChalkTalkStory.asp?STORY_ID=4853|title=The Official Website of the Chicago Bears|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Post-retirement==\n\n===Legal trouble===\nSince retiring from football in [[1997 NFL season|1997]], he has worked as a restaurant owner and motivational speaker. He was apprehended in Florida for [[drunk driving]] in 2003. Upon being pulled over, McMahon allegedly got out of his car and said to the police, \"I'm too drunk; you got me.\"<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1658175 \"McMahon 'wasted' while driving\"], ESPN.com, Accessed December 10, 2006</ref>\n\nOn April 9, 2012 it was reported by the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', that McMahon was targeted by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) for $104 million in bad loans made by the now closed, Chicago-based [[Broadway Bank (Illinois)|Broadway Bank]], of which he was a member of the board. The FDIC wanted to recover $104 million in loans made by the bank before it was shut down, according to the newspaper. In addition to McMahon, six other former Broadway Bank board members and two former bank executives had been targeted. It is said that McMahon had only approved one loan out of the 17 bad loans for a $28 million Miami beach condo project. The FDIC said the bank lost $19.5 million on the loan, according to the ''Sun-Times''. McMahon said in a statement to the ''Sun-Times'' that the FDIC's claims were without merit and he expected to be vindicated. \"I am proud to have served as an outside, independent director for a brief part of the bank's history,\" he wrote, according to the ''Sun-Times''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/chicago/feds-target-former-bears-qb-mcmahon-145949993.html/|title=Feds target former Bears QB McMahon|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Concussions===\nIn a November 6, 2010, interview, McMahon admitted to having memory problems due to injuries suffered on the football field.

Most famously, his wearing of a [[headband]] while on the sidelines once led to him being fined by then NFL commissioner, [[Pete Rozelle]], as it had an unauthorized corporate logo (Adidas) on it. The next week his headband simply said \"Rozelle\". (The commissioner later admitted in a letter to McMahon that the headband with Rozelle's name was \"funny as hell\", but declined to rescind the $5,000 fine.) Reportedly before Super Bowl XX hundreds of fans mailed McMahon headbands in hopes he would wear them during the game; Rozelle warned the quarterback not to wear anything \"unacceptable\". In response, McMahon decided to help bring attention to [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Juvenile Diabetes]] by wearing a headband simply stating \"JDF Cure\", before switching to one stating \"[[National League of Families POW/MIA Flag|POW-MIA]]\", and finally one with the word \"Pluto\", the nickname of his close friend and favorite collegiate receiving target, former BYU wide receiver Danny Plater, who was afflicted with a brain tumor.<ref>Benson, Lee.

is an American former [[American football|football]] player. He played [[college football]] at [[Brigham Young University]], where he was a two-time All-American ([[1980 College Football All-America Team|1980]], [[1981 College Football All-America Team|1981]]) and later in the professional ranks with the [[Chicago Bears]], [[San Diego Chargers]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Arizona Cardinals]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and [[Green Bay Packers]].\n\nHe won two Super Bowl titles, the first with the Bears in [[Super Bowl XX]] where he was the starting quarterback, and the second with their rivals, the Green Bay Packers, in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] where he was a backup to [[Brett Favre]]. Both Super Bowls were against the [[New England Patriots]]. McMahon was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1998.\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], McMahon moved with his family to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]] when he was three.<ref name=\"ESPN Classic\" /> He played high school football his freshman and sophomore years at [[Andrew Hill High School]] in San Jose, then moved with his family in the summer of 1975 to [[Roy, Utah]]. He played his junior and senior years at [[Roy High School (Utah)|Roy High School]] and graduated in 1977.<ref name=\"ESPN Classic\">{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Bob|title=McMahon was a rebel without pause|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/McMahon_Jim.html|publisher=ESPN Classic|accessdate=July 1, 2011|year=2007}}</ref><ref name=rbanaa>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r9BSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KX8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5962%2C4783960 |work=Deseret News |location=(Salt Lake City, Utah) |last=Blodgett |first=Gary R. |title=Roy back an All-American |date=December 15, 1976 |page=6D}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nMcMahon mainly served as [[BYU]]'s punter during his [[1977 BYU Cougars football team|freshman season]]. Also he played baseball (1977), but he played enough at quarterback to throw his first-ever collegiate touchdown pass against [[UTEP Miners football|UTEP]]. He continued as the Cougars' punter as the [[1978 BYU Cougars football team|1978]] season began, but when [[Marc Wilson (American football)|Marc Wilson]] was injured in the third game of the season (against [[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State]]), McMahon became the starting quarterback. McMahon led BYU to victory against CSU, accounting for 112 passing yards, 80 rushing yards, and two touchdowns. He was named Chevrolet Player of the Game and [[Western Athletic Conference|WAC]] Player of the Week for his performance. McMahon and Wilson shared quarterback duties for the rest of the season; McMahon played well enough to earn All-WAC honors and [[Associated Press]] Honorable Mention [[All-America]]. The best game of his sophomore year was against [[Wyoming Cowboys football|Wyoming]]: he passed for 317 yards and rushed for 49 more yards, earning another WAC Player of the Week award.\n\nMcMahon had suffered a knee injury towards the end of the 1978 season and BYU coaches chose to [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] him in [[1979 BYU Cougars football team|1979]]. McMahon watched from the sidelines as Wilson set nine [[NCAA]] records, tied two others, and became the first BYU player to earn consensus first team [[1979 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] honors; he finished third in [[Heisman Trophy]] [[1979 NCAA Division I-A football season#Heisman Trophy|balloting]].\n\nWith Wilson graduated and in the [[1980 NFL season|NFL]] with the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]], McMahon beat out Royce Bybee to claim the starting quarterback position in [[1980 BYU Cougars football team|1980]]. BYU lost the opener 25\u201321 against [[New Mexico Lobos football|New Mexico]], but then won eleven straight to claim the WAC championship. McMahon set 32 NCAA records, including single-season records for yards of total offense (4,627), passing yards (4,571), touchdown passes (47), and passing efficiency (176.9). His best game was against [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]]; he completed 21 of 33 passes for 485 yards and six touchdowns, and added two rushing touchdowns. That performance earned him ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'''s National Player of the Week award. McMahon's season statistics might have been even better, but he spent significant time on the sidelines because the Cougars won many games by wide margins. Although he started all 12 regular season games, he only finished three of them.\n\nBYU led the nation in passing offense, total offense, and scoring offense during the regular season. McMahon earned numerous awards for his individual accomplishments, being named WAC Player of the Year, unanimous First Team All-WAC, Utah Sportsman of the Year, and [[Deseret News]] Athlete of the Year. He was named to four All-America teams and finished fifth in Heisman Trophy voting.\n\nIn the [[1980 Holiday Bowl|Holiday Bowl]], the Cougars faced an [[1980 SMU Mustangs football team|SMU]] team led by star running backs [[Craig James (running back)|Craig James]] and [[Eric Dickerson]], and the Mustangs built a 45\u201325 lead over BYU with just four minutes left in the game. As Cougar fans headed for the exits, McMahon screamed that the game was not over yet. He guided BYU's offense to three quick touchdowns, including a 41-yard [[Hail Mary pass]] to Clay Brown to win the game<ref name=\"rock20100904\">{{cite news|last=Rock|first=Brad|title= Jim McMahon forever BYU's favorite rebel|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/print/700062850/Jim-McMahon-forever-BYUs-favorite-rebel.html|accessdate=September 4, 2010|newspaper=Deseret News|date=September 4, 2010}}</ref> as time expired.

ESPN, November 11, 2010.</ref> BYU fans refer to it as the \"Miracle Bowl\".\n\nIn McMahon's senior season in [[1981 BYU Cougars football team|1981]], despite missing two games due to injuries, he passed for 3,555 yards and 30 touchdowns in the regular season, again leading BYU to a WAC championship. For his efforts, he was named WAC Player of the Year and unanimous First Team All-WAC. On a national level, he was named [[1981 College Football All-America Team|First-team All-American]] by five different organizations and finished third in Heisman Trophy balloting. He received the [[Davey O'Brien]] Trophy and the [[Sammy Baugh]] Award, and he shared the Pigskin Club NCAA Offensive Player of the Year award with [[University of Southern California|USC]]'s [[Marcus Allen]]. He earned ''Sports Illustrated'''s Player of the Week award after his performance against Colorado State, in which he tied a school record with 7 touchdown passes.\n\nIn his last game as a Cougar, McMahon passed for 342 yards and 3 touchdowns to lead BYU over [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]] in the 1981 Holiday Bowl. His career totals were 9,536 passing yards and 84 touchdown passes (not including bowl games). McMahon left college with 70 NCAA records{{r|rock20100904}} and tied for one other. He entered the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1999.<ref>{{College Football HoF|id=2043|name=Jim \"Jimmy Mac\" McMahon  |accessdate=September 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, McMahon announced he would complete his coursework at BYU, which would qualify him for induction into the Brigham Young University Athletics Hall of Fame. On October 2, 2014, after completing his degree in communications, McMahon was inducted into the BYU Athletics Hall of Fame as part of the 2014 class.<ref>{{cite web|title=McMahon Inducted into BYU Hall of Fame|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865612288/Five-All-Americans-including-McMahon-inducted-into-BYU-Athletic-Hall-of-Fame.html}}</ref> BYU honored McMahon by retiring his No. 9 jersey during a halftime ceremony at the BYU vs. Utah State football game on Friday, October 3, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=McMahon's BYU jersey to be retired Oct. 3|url=http://byucougars.com/m-football/mcmahon's-byu-jersey-be-retired-oct-3}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===Chicago Bears===\nThe [[1982 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] selected McMahon in the first round (fifth overall) of the [[1982 NFL Draft]]. New head coach [[Mike Ditka]] made McMahon his first first-round selection. McMahon, thrilled to be free from what he considered a restrictive culture at BYU, strolled into his first public function with the Bears holding a cold beer in his hand. Ditka was not impressed, nor was Bears owner and founder [[George Halas]]. McMahon was to find the atmosphere in Chicago almost as challenging as that at Brigham Young, and he would lock horns with Ditka routinely during his seven years with the Bears.\n\nMcMahon won the Bears' starting quarterback job as a rookie in [[1982 Chicago Bears season|1982]], and was named to several All-Rookie teams when he nearly led the team to the playoffs, despite the NFL only playing two games before a [[1982 NFL strike|players' strike]] that cancelled nearly half the season. McMahon quickly displayed a natural ability to read defenses and an athletic versatility that surprised many.\n\nMcMahon also made a case for being the best rollout passer at that time. He explained that coaching in his youth had taught him to square his shoulders to the direction he wanted to throw the football, and he was thus able to execute passes with tight spirals and a high degree of accuracy when running to either his left or his right. The Bears finished the strike-shortened season at 3\u20136, but due to an expanded playoff format and conference-wide seeding the Bears missed a playoff berth by only one victory. McMahon was named [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Offensive Rookie of the Year, losing the league-wide honor to [[Marcus Allen]].\n\nIn [[1983 Chicago Bears season|1983]], McMahon continued to improve as a passer and as a field general. He made a habit of changing the play both in the huddle and at the line of scrimmage, a practice which frustrated Ditka but usually led to success. His knowledge of the game and an instinctive, intuitive grasp of in-game situations were significant. He became a frequent scorer in goal line situations, after the dying Halas instructed Ditka to make the quarterback sneak a bigger part of the Bears' offense. He also began to catch touchdown passes on option plays, and was the emergency punter. Chicago finished the season at 8\u20138, missing the division title and a playoff berth by one victory again.\n\nIn [[1984 Chicago Bears season|1984]], the Bears broke through, reaching the conference title game before losing to the [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]]. McMahon started the season strongly, though nursing minor injuries like those that would plague him throughout his career. In a violent game against the [[1984 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] in Chicago, McMahon sustained a season-ending injury when he was brutally tackled by two Los Angeles defenders. He suffered bruised ribs and a lacerated kidney on the play, but limped to the huddle and breathlessly called the next play, despite difficulty breathing and increasing pain. The players could barely hear him in the huddle, and when McMahon attempted an audible at the line of scrimmage the Bears receivers were unable to hear his call. McMahon was on the verge of collapsing on the field, clutching his flank and rasping in his attempts to convey his situation. Offensive linemen helped McMahon stand and leave the field. McMahon went to the locker room, and reported urine that \"looked like grape juice.\"\n\n====1985====\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 11 - Jim McMahon (Jim McMahon crop).jpg|thumb|150px|right|Jim McMahon dives into the end zone to score a touchdown during Super Bowl XX.]]\n[[File:1985 Chicago Bears Visit the White House.webm|thumb|right|300px|'1985 Chicago Bears Visit the White House' - video from White House]]\nIn [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]], the Bears won their first 12 games and finished at 15\u20131. McMahon became a media darling, not only for his outstanding play on the field, but also for his personality. He appeared in a [[hip hop music|rap]] record made by the team, \"The [[Super Bowl Shuffle]],\" in which he proclaimed ''\"I'm the punky QB known as McMahon.\"'' He ended the season with a strong performance in [[Super Bowl XX]], which the Bears won 46\u201310 over the [[1985 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. In that game, McMahon became the first quarterback in the history of the Super Bowl to rush for two touchdowns.<ref>NFL 2001 Record and Fact Book, Edited by Randall Liu, p. 349, Workman Publishing, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7611-2480-2}}</ref> McMahon earned a spot in his only [[1986 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]].\n\nMcMahon was notorious for head-first [[baseball]]-style slides when running the football, despite being coached to slide feet-first to protect his body. In the playoffs McMahon heeded this coaching advice and was speared by a defender's helmet squarely in his buttocks, causing a painful deep bruise for which McMahon sought [[acupuncture]] treatment.<ref>In Life, First You Kick Ass: Reflections on the 1985 Bears and Wisdom from Da Coach, Mike Ditka with Rick Telander, Sports Publishing, 2005, {{ISBN|978-1-58261-977-4}}</ref> This led to a point of controversy before the [[Super Bowl]] in New Orleans, when McMahon \"[[Mooning|mooned]]\" journalists who were inquiring as to the status of the injury. \n\nIn an early-season Thursday night game at Minnesota, McMahon was slated to back up [[Steve Fuller (American football)|Steve Fuller]], as McMahon had missed practice time earlier in the week due to a neck injury that required an overnight hospital stay. Midway into the third quarter, the Vikings held a 17\u20139 lead. McMahon lobbied to get into the game until well into the third quarter. Once finally on the field, his first play was an opportunistic 70-yard touchdown pass to [[Willie Gault]]. After an interception by Wilber Marshall on the Vikings ensuing possession, McMahon's very next offensive play was a 25-yard touchdown pass to [[Dennis McKinnon]], making him 2\u20132 for 95 yards and two [[touchdown]]s. He followed up with another successful offensive drive, including a crucial third and short sneak to set up another 43-yard touchdown pass to McKinnon. The Bears led 30\u201317 and went on to win the game 33\u201324.\n\nMcMahon was fined $5,000 for violating the league's dress code by wearing an [[Adidas]] headband.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-11-15/sports/0911140277_1_chad-ochocinco-nfl-halas | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Chicago Bears' Jim McMahon was the Chad Ochocinco of his day | date=November 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====1986\u20131988====\n{{Further|Charles Martin (American football)#1986 McMahon incident}}\nIn week 12 of the 1986 NFL regular season, McMahon was playing against the Green Bay Packers, while dealing with an existing rotator cuff injury to his right shoulder. After throwing a 3rd down interception and at least two seconds after his pass was thrown, Green Bay nose tackle [[Charles Martin (football player)|Charles Martin]] grabbed McMahon from behind and body-slammed him to the ground. McMahon hit the frozen artificial turf at Soldier Field shoulder first, exacerbating his existing rotator cuff injury. He briefly returned to the game, but it soon became apparent that he couldn't throw effectively, and he left the game in the third quarter, never to play again in 1986. Martin was immediately ejected from the game and later suspended for two additional games \u2014 the first multi-game suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history. Without McMahon, and despite finishing tied for the league's best record at 14\u20132, the Bears were unable to defend their Super Bowl championship and lost in the Divisional Playoff round to the [[1986 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]].\n\nMcMahon battled injuries for the rest of his career although at one point between the 1984 and [[1987 Chicago Bears season|1987]] seasons, he won 22 consecutive regular-season (25 including playoffs and the Super Bowl) starts, the longest \"regular season winning streak\" by an NFL quarterback at the time, now held by [[Peyton Manning]], who won 23 in 2008 to 2009 (but lost a wildcard playoff game to the Chargers during his \"winning streak\").\n\nIn 1987, he came right back from a head injury in a game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. McMahon brought the Chicago Bears back in the first game following the [[1987 NFL strike|1987 NFL players strike]] to defeat the Buccaneers, 27\u201326. The Bears went on to an 11\u20134 record with many expecting McMahon to lead the Bears back to the Super Bowl. However, 1987 ended exactly the same way 1986 did with the Bears eliminated by the [[1987 Washington Redskins season|eventual Super Bowl champion Redskins]].\n\nMcMahon returned for the [[1988 Chicago Bears season|1988]] season with a much more serious attitude. His main offensive weapon in [[Walter Payton]] had retired and McMahon publicly expressed his desire to win a Super Bowl again. The Bears looked strong all season and went 12\u20134, again winning the NFC Central, and finishing with the NFC's top seed, ensuring they would host the NFC Championship Game at Soldier Field if they advanced that far. McMahon was unable to get the Bears back to the Super Bowl, as they were routed by the eventual Super Bowl champion [[1988 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in the NFC Championship which saw McMahon benched in favor of [[Mike Tomczak]] in the fourth quarter.\n\nDuring the offseason, McMahon and Bears president [[Michael McCaskey]] had a major falling out with each other. He also fell out of favor with head coach [[Mike Ditka]], and after spending his first seven seasons in the league with Chicago, McMahon was traded to the [[1989 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]].\n\n{{As of|2017}}'s NFL off-season, Jim McMahon held at least 15 Bears franchise records, including:\n* Completions: playoffs (70)\n* Passing Yards: playoffs (967), playoff season (636 in 1985)\n* Passing TDs: playoffs (4), playoff season (3 in 1985; with [[Rex Grossman]]), playoff game (2 on 1986-01-05 NYG; with [[Steve Walsh (American football)|Steve Walsh]] and [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]), rookie season (9 in 1982; with [[Kyle Orton]])\n* Passer Rating: playoffs (77.1), playoff season (106.6 in 1985), rookie season (79.9 in 1982)\n* Sacked: playoffs (10), rookie game (7 on 1982-11-28 @MIN)\n* Yds/Pass Att: playoffs (7.61), playoff season (9.64 in 1985)\n* Pass Yds/Game: rookie season (187.6 in 1982)\n\n===San Diego Chargers===\nMcMahon started 12 games for the 6\u201310 [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]] team in 1989. He went 4\u20138 in the games he started, though the team lost 4 of those games by a combined 11 points. He had only 4 games over 200 yards, but had 389 yards against the [[Houston Oilers]] in a Week 2 loss.\n\nHowever, McMahon again found himself in trouble when he fell out of favor with his coach, [[Dan Henning]], his teammates, and the team's front office staff. He was benched for the final four games in favor of [[Billy Joe Tolliver]] and finished the year with 2,132 yards, 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He was released after the season.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Jim McMahon and Obama.jpg|thumb|upright|McMahon at the [[White House]] with [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] in 2011.]]\nMcMahon signed with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], who were coached by former Bears assistant [[Buddy Ryan]], for the 1990 season. For the first time in his career he served as a full-time backup as [[Randall Cunningham]] was entrenched as the starter. After Cunningham tore his ACL in the opening game of the following season, new coach [[Rich Kotite]] named McMahon his starter. He led the Eagles to a 10\u20136 record, including a Week 17 win over the 14\u20131 [[Washington Redskins]], and earned the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] award. He stayed with the Eagles for one additional season as the backup to Cunningham.\n\nMcMahon's last chance to be a full-time starter came with the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in [[1993 NFL season|1993]]. Supplanting [[Sean Salisbury]] as the team's starter, McMahon led the Vikings to eight wins in twelve starts and returned to the postseason as a starter for the first time since 1988. However, the Vikings lost to the [[New York Giants]].\n\nAfter the season, McMahon joined the [[Arizona Cardinals]], now coached by Ryan, for the 1994 season, where he made his final career start in Week 3 against the [[Cleveland Browns]]. He finished the season as the team's third quarterback behind [[Steve Beuerlein]] and [[Jay Schroeder]] and left the team at its conclusion. After failing to catch on with the Browns in the 1995 preseason, McMahon joined the [[Green Bay Packers]]. He retired following the [[1996 NFL season|1996]] season, which finished with a Green Bay Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots in New Orleans, eleven years to the day of the Bears' Super Bowl victory over the Patriots in the same venue.\n\nMcMahon caused some controversy when he showed up to the Packers' reception at the [[White House]] wearing his Bears jersey, due to the rivalry between the two teams. McMahon later explained that he did so because he was unable to visit the White House when he led the Bears to victory in Super Bowl XX; two days after the Bears won the game, the crew of [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-51-L]] were killed in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|explosion]] of their craft, Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', and the Bears' scheduled visit was cancelled. McMahon and his surviving teammates and coaches were eventually received in 2011 by President [[Barack Obama]], himself a Bears fan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/ChalkTalkStory.asp?STORY_ID=4853|title=The Official Website of the Chicago Bears|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Post-retirement==\n\n===Legal trouble===\nSince retiring from football in [[1997 NFL season|1997]], he has worked as a restaurant owner and motivational speaker. He was apprehended in Florida for [[drunk driving]] in 2003. Upon being pulled over, McMahon allegedly got out of his car and said to the police, \"I'm too drunk; you got me.\"<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1658175 \"McMahon 'wasted' while driving\"], ESPN.com, Accessed December 10, 2006</ref>\n\nOn April 9, 2012 it was reported by the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', that McMahon was targeted by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) for $104 million in bad loans made by the now closed, Chicago-based [[Broadway Bank (Illinois)|Broadway Bank]], of which he was a member of the board. The FDIC wanted to recover $104 million in loans made by the bank before it was shut down, according to the newspaper. In addition to McMahon, six other former Broadway Bank board members and two former bank executives had been targeted. It is said that McMahon had only approved one loan out of the 17 bad loans for a $28 million Miami beach condo project. The FDIC said the bank lost $19.5 million on the loan, according to the ''Sun-Times''. McMahon said in a statement to the ''Sun-Times'' that the FDIC's claims were without merit and he expected to be vindicated. \"I am proud to have served as an outside, independent director for a brief part of the bank's history,\" he wrote, according to the ''Sun-Times''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/chicago/feds-target-former-bears-qb-mcmahon-145949993.html/|title=Feds target former Bears QB McMahon|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Concussions===\nIn a November 6, 2010, interview, McMahon admitted to having memory problems due to injuries suffered on the football field.

The procedure had positive results. \u201cThe first time he did it, my head was so full of stuff it literally felt like the toilet flushing,\u201d he said. \u201cI could actually feel the stuff draining out of my head.\u201d McMahon had daily adjustments for a week and now only returns for an adjustment every 3 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pilotonline.com/sports/columnist/harry-minium/article_0cb3ba9f-4b24-551d-98c5-30a86b8a83d8.html|title=Ex-NFL star Jim McMahon was nearly driven to suicide by headaches from too many head blows|last=Minium|first=Harry|website=Virginian-Pilot|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> This treatment has led to improvement in his short term memory and the elimination of his headaches.<ref name=\"sfchronicle.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/ostler/article/Ex-NFL-star-Jim-McMahon-spreading-gospel-of-golf-11290279.php|title=Ex-NFL star Jim McMahon spreading gospel of golf, new treatment -

Most famously, his wearing of a [[headband]] while on the sidelines once led to him being fined by then NFL commissioner, [[Pete Rozelle]], as it had an unauthorized corporate logo (Adidas) on it. The next week his headband simply said \"Rozelle\". (The commissioner later admitted in a letter to McMahon that the headband with Rozelle's name was \"funny as hell\", but declined to rescind the $5,000 fine.) Reportedly before Super Bowl XX hundreds of fans mailed McMahon headbands in hopes he would wear them during the game; Rozelle warned the quarterback not to wear anything \"unacceptable\". In response, McMahon decided to help bring attention to [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Juvenile Diabetes]] by wearing a headband simply stating \"JDF Cure\", before switching to one stating \"[[National League of Families POW/MIA Flag|POW-MIA]]\", and finally one with the word \"Pluto\", the nickname of his close friend and favorite collegiate receiving target, former BYU wide receiver Danny Plater, who was afflicted with a brain tumor.<ref>Benson, Lee.

''Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 Ireland 1965'' came about when director [[Michael Gochanour]] discovered additional unprocessed footage of the 1965 Rolling Stones screen test. Gochanour spent two years editing and remixing the '60s material, adding a story line and synching music to Rolling Stones concert footage that had originally been filmed without sound. The result was ''Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 1965''. One of Gochanour's objectives in making the film was \"to show The Rolling Stones in a way the world had never seen them before; as a band just coming into their own \u2013 raw, visceral, innocent and with purpose.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mickgochanour.com/directors-statement-2.html | title=Director's statement - The Rolling Stones - Ireland 1965 (a/k/a Charlie is my Darling) | date=2013 | publisher=Mick Gochanour | accessdate=9 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe 64-minute documentary, ''Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 Ireland 1965'', follows the group from their car trip out of London to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], and from there to [[Dublin]] where they had two concerts at the Adelphi Theatre on 3 September. The next day they take a train up to [[Belfast]] for two concerts at the ABC Theatre, before returning to London by plane the following day.Besides stage shots from the concerts (where the second Dublin concert ends in total chaos as fans storm the stage), the film contains scenes from a hotel room in Dublin (where Keith and Mick for fun do a few [[Beatles]] songs as well as a couple of their own), scenes from their train trip to Belfast, another impromptu song session by a piano (with both Keith and Andrew Oldham playing the piano while Mick impersonates [[Elvis Presley]] and sings [[Fats Domino]]'s version of \"[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]\"), and finally their flight back to London. Intermixed with this are interviews with the band members where they talk about fame, fans and future.\n \n''Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 Ireland 1965'' premiered at the Walter Reade Theater in New York City on 29 September 2012, as part of the 2012 [[New York Film Festival]], and was released on DVD and Blu-ray in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rolling-stones-set-premiere-date-for-tour-documentary-20120827 |date=27 August 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2012 |title=Rolling Stones Set Premiere Date for Tour Documentary |work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> On 25 November 2012, it was shown by [[BBC Two]] as part of BBC's \"The Rolling Stones at 50\" celebrations.\n\n==Charts==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2012)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Argentinian Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adminlic.capif.org.ar/sis_resultados_rankings_web.aspx |title=Rankings |work=[[Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers|CAPIF]] |language=Spanish |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110035036/http://adminlic.capif.org.ar/sis_resultados_rankings_web.aspx |archivedate=10 November 2011 }} ''Select'' Ranking Mensual de DVD ''under the first drop-down menu and select'' 1 November 2012 ''under the second menu.''</ref>\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australian Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite journal |date=19 November 2012 |title=ARIA Top 40 Music DVD |journal=[[ARIA Charts|The ARIA Report]] |issue=1186 |page=23 |format=PDF |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20121204-1257/Issue1186.pdf}}</ref>\n|13\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Austrian Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/weekchart.asp?cat=d&year=2012&date=20121116 |title=Austria Top 40 \u2013 Musik-DVDs Top 10 16.11.2012 |publisher=Austriancharts.com |language=German |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102180938/http://austriancharts.at/weekchart.asp?cat=d&year=2012&date=20121116 |archivedate=2 November 2013 }}</ref>\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Danish Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitlisterne.dk/lister.asp?w=46&y=2012&list=v10 |title=Musik DVD Top-10 |work=Hitlisten.nu |publisher=[[IFPI Denmark]] |language=Danish |accessdate=7 February 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130412102403/http://www.hitlisterne.dk/lister.asp?w=46&y=2012&list=v10 |archive-date=12 April 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n|5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Dutch Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/weekchart.asp?cat=d&year=2012&date=20121110 |title=Dutch Charts Portal |work=[[GfK]] Dutch Charts |publisher=Hung Medien |language=Dutch |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324115809/http://www.dutchcharts.nl/weekchart.asp?cat=d&year=2012&date=20121110 |archivedate=24 March 2015 }}</ref>\n|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|German Albums Chart<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.de/album.asp?artist=The+Rolling+Stones&title=Charlie+Is+My+Darling+-+Ireland+1965+&#91;DVD&#93;&country=de |title=Album \u2013 The Rolling Stones, Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 Ireland 1965 &#91;DVD&#93;

''Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 Ireland 1965'' came about when director [[Michael Gochanour|Michael (Mick) Gochanour]] discovered additional unprocessed footage of the 1965 Rolling Stones screen test. Gochanour spent two years editing and remixing the 60's material, adding a story line and synching music to Rolling Stones concert footage that had originally been filmed without sound. The result was ''Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 1965'' directed by Peter Whitehead and Michael Gochanour. One of Gochanour's objectives in making the film was \"to show The Rolling Stones in a way the world had never seen them before; as a band just coming into their own \u2013 raw, visceral, innocent and with purpose.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mickgochanour.com/directors-statement-2.html | title=Director's statement - The Rolling Stones - Ireland 1965 (a/k/a Charlie is my Darling) | date=2013 | publisher=Mick Gochanour | accessdate=9 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe 64-minute documentary, ''Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 Ireland 1965'', follows the group from their car trip out of London to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], and from there to [[Dublin]] where they had two concerts at the Adelphi Theatre on 3 September. The next day they take a train up to [[Belfast]] for two concerts at the ABC Theatre, before returning to London by plane the following day.Besides stage shots from the concerts (where the second Dublin concert ends in total chaos as fans storm the stage), the film contains scenes from a hotel room in Dublin (where Keith and Mick for fun do a few Beatles songs as well as a couple of their own), scenes from their train trip to Belfast, another impromptu song session by a piano (with both Keith and Andrew Oldham playing the piano while Mick impersonates Elvis Presley and sings Fats Domino's version of \"[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]\"), and finally their flight back to London. Intermixed with this are interviews with the band members where they talk about fame, fans and future.\n \n''Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 Ireland 1965'' premiered at the Walter Reade Theater in New York City on 29 September 2012, as part of the 2012 [[New York Film Festival]], and was released on DVD and Blu-ray in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rolling-stones-set-premiere-date-for-tour-documentary-20120827 |date=27 August 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2012 |title=Rolling Stones Set Premiere Date for Tour Documentary |work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> On 25 November 2012, it was shown by [[BBC Two]] as part of BBC's \"The Rolling Stones at 50\" celebrations.\n\n==Charts==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2012)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Argentinian Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adminlic.capif.org.ar/sis_resultados_rankings_web.aspx |title=Rankings |work=[[Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers|CAPIF]] |language=Spanish |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110035036/http://adminlic.capif.org.ar/sis_resultados_rankings_web.aspx |archivedate=10 November 2011 }} ''Select'' Ranking Mensual de DVD ''under the first drop-down menu and select'' 1 November 2012 ''under the second menu.''</ref>\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australian Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite journal |date=19 November 2012 |title=ARIA Top 40 Music DVD |journal=[[ARIA Charts|The ARIA Report]] |issue=1186 |page=23 |format=PDF |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20121204-1257/Issue1186.pdf}}</ref>\n|13\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Austrian Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/weekchart.asp?cat=d&year=2012&date=20121116 |title=Austria Top 40 \u2013 Musik-DVDs Top 10 16.11.2012 |publisher=Austriancharts.com |language=German |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102180938/http://austriancharts.at/weekchart.asp?cat=d&year=2012&date=20121116 |archivedate=2 November 2013 }}</ref>\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Danish Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitlisterne.dk/lister.asp?w=46&y=2012&list=v10 |title=Musik DVD Top-10 |work=Hitlisten.nu |publisher=[[IFPI Denmark]] |language=Danish |accessdate=7 February 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130412102403/http://www.hitlisterne.dk/lister.asp?w=46&y=2012&list=v10 |archive-date=12 April 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n|5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Dutch Music DVDs Chart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/weekchart.asp?cat=d&year=2012&date=20121110 |title=Dutch Charts Portal |work=[[GfK]] Dutch Charts |publisher=Hung Medien |language=Dutch |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324115809/http://www.dutchcharts.nl/weekchart.asp?cat=d&year=2012&date=20121110 |archivedate=24 March 2015 }}</ref>\n|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|German Albums Chart<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.de/album.asp?artist=The+Rolling+Stones&title=Charlie+Is+My+Darling+-+Ireland+1965+&#91;DVD&#93;&country=de |title=Album \u2013 The Rolling Stones, Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 Ireland 1965 &#91;DVD&#93;

All four were composers. Their aggregate body of musical compositions in the Hawaiian language numbers in the hundreds.
