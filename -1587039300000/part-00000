Kivim\u00e4ki was sentenced to five years in prison after being found responsible for the [[Continuation War]]. After Finland signed the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]], and the  Finno&ndash;Soviet [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]], 1948, the international situation was deemed somewhat stabilized, and Kivim\u00e4ki was pardoned. He returned to his career in academia.\n\n=== Legacy ===\nAs with all politicians connected with the Continuation War, Kivim\u00e4ki was for decades seen in a somewhat critical light. During the era of [[finlandization]], many prominent Finns expressed themselves cautiously on such subjects in order not to disturb sensitive Allied victors of the war; a cautiousness that without doubt influenced Finland's post-war generation's understanding and views.\n\n* As Prime Minister, Kivim\u00e4ki headed Finland's (until 1987) most long-lived [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], aiming at stabilizing the turbulent politics in Finland after the semi-[[fascist]] [[M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 Rebellion]] had been put down.\n* He achieved the reversal of Finland's foreign policy into a [[neutralist]] pro-[[Scandinavia]]n stance, and a Swedish rapprochement, that may well have been prepared for in the most initiated circles, but that in the contemporary tense phase of the [[language strife in Finland]] was not at all easy to explain to the public opinion.\n* As an Envoy to the [[Third Reich]], Kivim\u00e4ki was in a position to observe the anti-Semitic nature of the Nazi regime and the disappearance of German Jews to concentration camps.

Kivim\u00e4ki was sentenced to five years in prison after being found responsible for the [[Continuation War]]. After Finland signed the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]], and the  Finno&ndash;Soviet [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]], 1948, the international situation was deemed somewhat stabilized, and Kivim\u00e4ki was pardoned. He returned to his career in academia.\n\n=== Legacy ===\nAs with all politicians connected with the Continuation War, Kivim\u00e4ki was for decades seen in a somewhat critical light. During the era of [[finlandization]], many prominent Finns expressed themselves cautiously on such subjects in order not to disturb sensitive Allied victors of the war; a cautiousness that without doubt influenced Finland's post-war generation's understanding and views.\n\n* As Prime Minister, Kivim\u00e4ki headed Finland's (until 1987) most long-lived [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], aiming at stabilizing the turbulent politics in Finland after the semi-[[fascist]] [[M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 Rebellion]] had been put down.\n* He achieved the reversal of Finland's foreign policy into a [[neutralist]] pro-[[Scandinavia]]n stance, and a Swedish rapprochement, that may well have been prepared for in the most initiated circles, but that in the contemporary tense phase of the [[language strife in Finland]] was not at all easy to explain to the public opinion.\n* As an Envoy to the [[Third Reich]], Kivim\u00e4ki was in a position to observe the anti-Semitic nature of the Nazi regime and the disappearance of German Jews to concentration camps. Kivim\u00e4ki succeeded in reversing Nazi Germany's anti-Finnish stance, obtaining support and favours but at the price of Finland having to form an alliance with Hitler. Finland avoided formal treaties with Nazi Germany up until the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]], which was signed after the fall of [[Viipuri]] in June 1944.\n\nSeveral individuals and factors were critical for the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]].

Student numbers continued to increase, and the Faculty of Engineering eventually needed the new premises that were to become Queen's Building in 1955. This substantial building housed all of the university's engineers until 1996, when the department of [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol|Department of Computer Science]] moved over the road into the new Merchant Venturers' Building to make space for these rapidly expanding fields. Today, Queen's Building caters for most of the teaching needs of the Faculty and provides academic space for the \"heavy\" engineering subjects ([[civil engineering|civil]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], and [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]]).\n\nWith unprecedented growth in the 1960s, particularly in undergraduate numbers, the Students' Union eventually acquired larger premises in a new building in the [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] area of the city, in 1965. This building was more spacious than the Victoria Rooms, which were now given over to the Department of Music. The [[University of Bristol Union|new Union]] provides many practice and performance rooms, some specialist rooms, as well as three bars: Bar 100; the Mandela (also known as AR2) and the Avon Gorge.

In 1968, many students marched in support of the [[Anderson Report (British Education)|Anderson Report]], which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in at the Senate House (the administrative headquarters of the university).<ref name=\"BristolUniversityHistory\" /> A series of chancellors and vice-chancellors led the university through these decades, with [[Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort]] taking over from Churchill as chancellor in 1965 before being succeeded by [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] in 1970 who spent the next 18 years in the office.<ref name=\"past-officers\" />\n\nAs the age of mass higher education dawned, Bristol continued to build its student numbers. The various undergraduate residences were repeatedly expanded and, more recently, some postgraduate residences have been constructed. These more recent ventures have been funded (and are run) by external companies in agreement with the university.\n\nSince 1988, there have been only three further chancellors; Sir [[Jeremy Morse]], then chairman of [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] who handed over in 2003 to [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Brenda Hale]], the first female [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]].<ref name=\"archives-hub\" /><ref name=\"past-officers\" /> [[Paul Nurse|Sir Paul Nurse]] succeeded Lady Hale as Chancellor on 1 January 2017.\n\n[[File:Victoria Rooms (750px).jpg|thumb|The Victoria Rooms, housing the School of Music]]\nOne of the few [[Centre for Deaf Studies, Bristol|Centres for Deaf Studies]] in the United Kingdom was established in Bristol in 1981, followed in 1988 by the Norah Fry Centre for research into learning difficulties.

These buildings suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. George Oatley added to them a tower in memory of Albert Fry which can still be seen on University Road. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building which it was hoped would be a symbol of academic permanence for the university and a memorial to the chief benefactor of the university, [[Henry Overton Wills]]. It was requested to the architect [[George Oatley]] that the building be built to last at least 400 years but the site purchased, at the top of [[Park Street, Bristol|Park Street]] suffered from an awkward slope and a desirability to link the building with the Museum and Art Gallery situated adjacent to the plot. The architecture critic [[Roger Gill (architecture critic)|Roger Gill]] has stated that the building is \"remarkable in size\" but noted that the \"ambience of a medieval University was strangely lacking\". He goes on to criticise the building as a \"sham\" and a \"folly\".<ref>Carleton (1984), p129</ref> The armorials on the Founder's Window represent all of the interests present at the founding of the University of Bristol including the Wills and Fry families. The [[Tyndalls Park]] Estate and [[Royal Fort House]] were also purchased from the trustees of the Tyndall family allowing the university to expand. Many Departments in the Faculty of Arts are housed in large Victorian houses which have been converted for teaching.<ref>Higher Education Quality Council (1993), p2</ref>\n\n[[Goldney gardens]] entered the property of the University of Bristol through [[George Alfred Wills|George Wills]] who had hoped to build an all-male hall of residence there.

University records show that Miss Starvey was prepared to resign over the issue and that she had the support of the then Chancellor [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]].<ref>Carleton (1984), p132</ref> Eventually land was purchased in [[Stoke Bishop]] allowing [[Wills Hall]] to be bought, allowing the building of what has been described as a \"quasi-[[Oxbridge]]\" hall, to which was added the Dame Monica Wills Chapel by George Wills' widow after his death.

It has since been restored to its former glory, complete with oak panelled walls and a new organ.\n\n==== Post-war development ====\n\nIn 1946, the university established the first drama department in the country.<ref name=\"BristolUniversityHistory\" /> In the same year, Bristol began offering special entrance [[exam]]s and [[Grant (money)|grants]] to aid the resettlement of servicemen returning home. Student numbers continued to increase, and the Faculty of Engineering eventually needed the new premises that were to become Queen's Building in 1955. This substantial building housed all of the university's engineers until 1996, when the department of [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol|Department of Computer Science]] moved over the road into the new Merchant Venturers' Building to make space for these rapidly expanding fields. Today, Queen's Building caters for most of the teaching needs of the Faculty and provides academic space for the \"heavy\" engineering subjects ([[civil engineering|civil]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], and [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]]).\n\nWith unprecedented growth in the 1960s, particularly in undergraduate numbers, the Students' Union eventually acquired larger premises in a new building in the [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] area of the city, in 1965. This building was more spacious than the Victoria Rooms, which were now given over to the Department of Music. The [[University of Bristol Union|new Union]] provides many practice and performance rooms, some specialist rooms, as well as three bars: Bar 100; the Mandela (also known as AR2) and the Avon Gorge. Whilst spacious, the Union building is thought by many to be ugly<ref>{{cite web | title = The Students' Union | publisher = University of Bristol Union | accessdate =6 December 2007 | url = http://www.bristol.ac.uk/union/altprospectus/unilife/union |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126124416/http://www.bristol.ac.uk/union/altprospectus/unilife/union |archivedate = 26 November 2007}}</ref> and out of character compared to the architecture of the rest of the Clifton area, having been mentioned in a [[BBC]] poll to find the worst architectural eyesores in Britain.<ref>{{cite news | title = What is the worst eyesore in the UK? |work=BBC News | date = 21 November 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3266673.stm}}</ref> The university has proposed relocating the Union to a more central location as part of its development 'masterplan'.<ref>{{cite web | title = University of Bristol Strategic Masterplan | publisher = University of Bristol | page = 64 | accessdate =6 December 2007 | url = http://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/Bursar/masterplan06/1masterplan.pdf |date=July 2006 }}</ref> More recently, plans for redevelopment of the current building have been proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ubu.org.uk/build |title=Building Project \u2013 A Better Building for the Students' Union |publisher=Ubu.org.uk |accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 1960s were a time of considerable student activism in the United Kingdom, and Bristol was no exception. In 1968, many students marched in support of the [[Anderson Report (British Education)|Anderson Report]], which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in at the Senate House (the administrative headquarters of the university).<ref name=\"BristolUniversityHistory\" /> A series of chancellors and vice-chancellors led the university through these decades, with [[Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort]] taking over from Churchill as chancellor in 1965 before being succeeded by [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] in 1970 who spent the next 18 years in the office.<ref name=\"past-officers\" />\n\nAs the age of mass higher education dawned, Bristol continued to build its student numbers. The various undergraduate residences were repeatedly expanded and, more recently, some postgraduate residences have been constructed. These more recent ventures have been funded (and are run) by external companies in agreement with the university.\n\nSince 1988, there have been only three further chancellors; Sir [[Jeremy Morse]], then chairman of [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] who handed over in 2003 to [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Brenda Hale]], the first female [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]].<ref name=\"archives-hub\" /><ref name=\"past-officers\" /> [[Paul Nurse|Sir Paul Nurse]] succeeded Lady Hale as Chancellor on 1 January 2017.\n\n[[File:Victoria Rooms (750px).jpg|thumb|The Victoria Rooms, housing the School of Music]]\nOne of the few [[Centre for Deaf Studies, Bristol|Centres for Deaf Studies]] in the United Kingdom was established in Bristol in 1981, followed in 1988 by the Norah Fry Centre for research into learning difficulties.

On both occasions, however, the subsequent referendum of all students reversed that decision and Bristol remains affiliated to the NUS.\n\nIn 2002, the university was involved in an argument over press intrusion after details of then-prime minister [[Tony Blair]]'s son's application to university were published in national newspapers.\n\nAs the number of postgraduate students has grown (particularly the numbers pursuing taught master's degrees), there eventually became a need for separate representation on university bodies and the Postgraduate Union (PGU) was established in 2000.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.pgu.org.uk/yourpgu/| title = General introduction of the PGU| accessdate =20 December 2007| publisher = University of Bristol Postgraduate Union|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227191758/http://www.pgu.org.uk/yourpgu/ |archivedate = 27 December 2007}}</ref>\nUniversities are increasingly expected to exploit the intellectual property generated by their research activities and, in 2000, Bristol established the Research and Enterprise Division (RED) to further this cause (particularly for technology-based businesses).

These buildings were designed by [[Charles Hansom]], the younger brother of [[Joseph Hansom]], Joseph being the inventor of the [[Hansom Cab]]. These buildings suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. George Oatley added to them a tower in memory of Albert Fry which can still be seen on University Road. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building which it was hoped would be a symbol of academic permanence for the university and a memorial to the chief benefactor of the university, [[Henry Overton Wills]]. It was requested to the architect [[George Oatley]] that the building be built to last at least 400 years but the site purchased, at the top of [[Park Street, Bristol|Park Street]] suffered from an awkward slope and a desirability to link the building with the Museum and Art Gallery situated adjacent to the plot. The architecture critic [[Roger Gill (architecture critic)|Roger Gill]] has stated that the building is \"remarkable in size\" but noted that the \"ambience of a medieval University was strangely lacking\". He goes on to criticise the building as a \"sham\" and a \"folly\".<ref>Carleton (1984), p129</ref> The armorials on the Founder's Window represent all of the interests present at the founding of the University of Bristol including the Wills and Fry families. The [[Tyndalls Park]] Estate and [[Royal Fort House]] were also purchased from the trustees of the Tyndall family allowing the university to expand. Many Departments in the Faculty of Arts are housed in large Victorian houses which have been converted for teaching.<ref>Higher Education Quality Council (1993), p2</ref>\n\n[[Goldney gardens]] entered the property of the University of Bristol through [[George Alfred Wills|George Wills]] who had hoped to build an all-male hall of residence there. This was prevented due to the moral objection of the then warden of Clifton Hall House who objected to the idea of male and female residences being in such close proximity. University records show that Miss Starvey was prepared to resign over the issue and that she had the support of the then Chancellor [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]].<ref>Carleton (1984), p132</ref> Eventually land was purchased in [[Stoke Bishop]] allowing [[Wills Hall]] to be bought, allowing the building of what has been described as a \"quasi-[[Oxbridge]]\" hall, to which was added the Dame Monica Wills Chapel by George Wills' widow after his death. [[File:Goldney2.jpg|thumb|200px|The Gardens of Goldney Hall were acquired by the Wills family]]Burwalls, a mansion house on the other side of the [[Avon Gorge]], was used as a halls of residence in the past and was a home of [[Sir George Oatley]].

He is also responsible for the extension to the Wills Memorial Building library which was completed to such standard that few now realise that is an extension to the original building.<ref>Carleton (1984), p138</ref> Brentnall oversaw the rebuilding of the Great Hall of the Wills Memorial Building after it was partly destroyed during the [[Bristol Blitz]] of World War II.
