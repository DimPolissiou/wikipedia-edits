Provision was thus made to extend the line to Dubbo, reaching [[Wellington railway station, New South Wales|Wellington]] in 1880 and [[Dubbo railway station|Dubbo]] in 1881. At the time, Dubbo had grown into a town of strategic importance on the stock routes between northern New South Wales and the Victorian goldfields.\n\nBeyond Dubbo, the railway opened up new land to European settlement, and was directly responsible for the development of townships. The line reached the future site of [[Narromine]] in 1883, and the railway station was the first building in the future settlement. The line reached the site of [[Nevertire]] in 1882, serving the nearby established village of [[Warren, New South Wales|Warren]] (a branch opened to Warren in 1898). Construction reached the site of [[Nyngan]] in 1883, with the nearby coach-stop village of Canonbar moving in its entirely to establish the town of Nyngan. Beyond Nyngan, the line swept across the plains in a straight line for {{convert|116|mi}}, then the longest stretch of straight railway line in the world. It reached the temporary terminus of [[Byrock, New South Wales|Byrock]] in 1884 before reaching its final destination of Bourke in 1885.<ref>\"Developing the Inland - The Great Western Railway to Bourke\" MacKillop, Bob [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], September, 2002 pp328-340</ref> The now-gone [[Station master|Station Master]]'s residence was completed in the same year.\n\nA loading bank was built in 1890.

[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]]. Vol 53, no 779. September 2002.</ref> The town of Bourke had become the key centre for pastoralists in western New South Wales since its formation in 1861. Provision was thus made to extend the line to Dubbo, reaching [[Wellington railway station, New South Wales|Wellington]] in 1880 and [[Dubbo railway station|Dubbo]] in 1881. At the time, Dubbo had grown into a town of strategic importance on the stock routes between northern New South Wales and the Victorian goldfields.\n\nBeyond Dubbo, the railway opened up new land to European settlement, and was directly responsible for the development of townships. The line reached the future site of [[Narromine]] in 1883, and the railway station was the first building in the future settlement. The line reached the site of [[Nevertire]] in 1882, serving the nearby established village of [[Warren, New South Wales|Warren]] (a branch opened to Warren in 1898). Construction reached the site of [[Nyngan]] in 1883, with the nearby coach-stop village of Canonbar moving in its entirely to establish the town of Nyngan. Beyond Nyngan, the line swept across the plains in a straight line for {{convert|116|mi}}, then the longest stretch of straight railway line in the world. It reached the temporary terminus of [[Byrock, New South Wales|Byrock]] in 1884 before reaching its final destination of Bourke in 1885.<ref>\"Developing the Inland - The Great Western Railway to Bourke\" MacKillop, Bob [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], September, 2002 pp328-340</ref> The now-gone [[Station master|Station Master]]'s residence was completed in the same year.\n\nA loading bank was built in 1890.

Masvidal's early years were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar with [[Carlos Molina (guitarist)|Carlos Molina]], and in college, with jazz musician, Dave Weissbrot who inspired his love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Masvidal developed an interest in mysticism and esoteric topics from a young age, becoming an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and eventually a practitioner of [[Buddhist meditation]] by his late 20s. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] In Miami, where the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed. Masvidal's eclectic musical tastes ranging from classical to rock, jazz, fusion, and metal along with a innate passion for mysticism came to inform much of his work with Cynic and other projects. Masvidal wrote in detail about early life experiences in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.

He is the guitarist, singer, and a founding member of the progressive rock band, [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]]. He has remained a continual member for nearly three decades and has developed numerous other projects including [[\u00c6on Spoke]], Onward with Love, and recent his solo work. Masvidal was ranked in ''[[Loudwire]]''<nowiki/>'s Best 66 Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists Of All Time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/top-hard-rock-metal-guitarists-of-all-time/|title=The 66 Best Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All Time|last=Staff|first=Loudwire|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> and 50 Best Metal Songwriters Of All Time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/best-metal-songwriters/|title=50 Best Metal Songwriters of All Time|last=DiVita|first=Joe|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early years were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar with [[Carlos Molina (guitarist)|Carlos Molina]], and in college, with jazz musician, Dave Weissbrot who inspired his love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Masvidal developed an interest in mysticism and esoteric topics from a young age, becoming an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and eventually a practitioner of [[Buddhist meditation]] by his late 20s. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] In Miami, where the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed. Masvidal's eclectic musical tastes ranging from classical to rock, jazz, fusion, and metal along with a innate passion for mysticism came to inform much of his work with Cynic and other projects. Masvidal wrote in detail about early life experiences in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.

His interest in [[Cosmology]], [[Consciousness]], [[Extra-terrestrials|Extra-Terrestrials]], [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], [[Crop circle|crop circles]] and their connection to his spiritual interests have become integral to his work as an artist.\n\n==Gear==\n[[File:Masvidalien Cosmo.png|thumb|152x152px|The Masvidalien Cosmo|alt=]]Masvidal has been playing [[Steinberger]] GM & GR headless 6-string guitars since his beginnings as a professional musician. Although he was seen by far the most with this instrument, he was also seen playing a Gibson SG with \u00c6on Spoke. Since Masvidal's association with the DTA (earlier called ''Death To All'') tours in 2013, a touring tribute to his former band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and the songs of [[Chuck Schuldiner]], he has been playing his signature Strandberg ''Masvidalien'' headless 6-string guitar. He also had his recording debut with this new Strandberg guitar on Cynic's 2014 release, ''[[Kindly Bent to Free Us]]''.\nMasvidal lent his name to a line of signature instruments aptly named, ''Masvidalien Cosmo''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strandbergguitars.com/artists/paul-masvidal/|title=Paul Masvidal|website=.strandberg* Guitars|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> produced by Sweden's award-winning '''[https://strandbergguitars.com/ .strandberg* Guitars]'''. \n\n<br /> \n==Discography==\n\n=== Cynic ===\n\n* ''[[Focus (Cynic album)|Focus]]'' (1993)\n*''Focus'' 'Remastered Re-Issue with bonus tracks' (2004)\n* ''[[Traced in Air]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Re-Traced]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Carbon-Based Anatomy]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Portal Tapes]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Kindly Bent to Free Us]]'' (2014)\n*''Uroboric Forms - The Complete Demo Recordings'' (2017)\n*''Humanoid'' single release (2018)\n*''Traced In Air''\u00a0'Remixed' (2019)\n\n=== Solo ===\n\n* ''Mythical'' (2019)\n* ''Human'' (2019)\n* ''Vessel'' (2020) \n\n=== Other ===\n\n* [[Death (metal band)|Death]] \u2212 ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]'' (1991)\n*[[\u00c6on Spoke]] \u2212 ''[[Above the Buried Cry]]'' (2004)\n* [[\u00c6on Spoke]] \u2212 ''[[\u00c6on Spoke (album)|\u00c6on Spoke]]'' (2007)\n\n=== Guest/Session ===\n\n*[[Master (American band)|Master]] \u2013 ''On The Seventh Day God Created...
