Her one hand is always on abhayamudra from which she blesses all her devotees. She rides on a tiger.\n\n==Origin==\nIt is about the time when the universe was no more than a void full of darkness.

The birth of the universe occurred because of the silent smile of Goddess Kushmanda. She was the one who produced the Cosmic egg. Her smile sent away the entirety of the darkness and thus formed a new creation of the universe.\nShe gave light and life to the entire universe with her silent smile.

It is her power that makes him capable of doing so, and when Mahashakti appears in the form of Kushmanda, it is what she does.\nFrom her smile, a body of energy came forth from her and from that potent energy, came forth light and creation. She always smiles when the Gods, inferior people and other celestial beings honored her.\n\nWhen the universe was non-existent and darkness prevailed everywhere, Maa Kushmanda produced the [[World egg|Cosmic egg]], bringing light to the universe. Kushmanda has the power and strength to live in the core of Sun. Her luminosity gives the Sun its brightness.

She was clad in space except a girdle of severed arms and a [[Mundamala|garland of skulls]]. She was seated on a burning [[funeral pyre]] and cackled in a ghastly manner. She was armed with cleaver, trident, discus, arrow, shield, severed head, skull-cup, conch-shell, cross-bow and a club. She was collecting blood dripping from the severed head in the skull-cup and sipped it while eating carrion. Kushmanda named her [[Mahakali]].\n\n===Creation of Mahalakshmi===\n\nFrom the glance of Kushmanda's [[third eye]], a ferocious lady with complexion of [[lava]] was created. She had eighteen arms. She was clad in saffron clothes and wore a warrior's armour and helmet. She was armed with battle-axe, trident, discus, mace, thunderbolt, arrow, sword, lotus, rosary, conch-shell, bell, noose, spear, goad, bow, shield, a waterpot with handle. She was seated on a jeweled throne and roared viciously. Kushmanda named her [[Mahalakshmi]].\n\n===Creation of Mahasaraswati===\n\nFrom the glance of Kushmanda's right eye, a benevolent lady with complexion of milk was created. She had eight arms and three placid eyes. She was clad in white clothes and wore a crescent moon on her forehead. She was armed with trident, discus, pestle, arrow, conch shell, bell, bow and a ploughshare. Her face was glorious like the full moon and she wore pearl ornaments. She was seated on a fully bloomed lotus and maintained a serene smile. Kushmanda named her [[Mahasaraswati]].\n\n===Creation of Brahma and Saraswati===\n\nKushmanda's person from her feet fell upon Mahasarawati. Immediately, a man and a woman sprang out of Mahasarawati's body. The man had four faces and four arms. His complexion was red and he was clad in saffron clothes. He wore expensive ornaments. He held lotus, book, rosary and a waterpot. Kushmanda named him [[Brahma]]. The woman had four arms and complexion of milk. Clad in white, she held a goad, a rosary, a book and a lotus. She wore white ornaments. Kushmanda named her Saraswati.\n\n===Creation of Vishnu and Lakshmi===\n\nKushmanda's person from her arms fell upon Mahalakshmi. Immediately, a man and a woman sprang out of Mahaslakshmi's body. The man had four arms. His complexion was dark and he was clad in yellow clothes. He was heavily decked with ornaments. He held a discus, a conch-shell, a mace and a lotus. Kushmanda named him [[Vishnu]]. The woman had four arms and fair complexion. Clad in gold, she held two lotus buds in her two upper arms while her two lower hands were held open. She was heavily decked with ornaments. Kushmanda named her Lakshmi.\n\n===Chandi===\n\nShakti and Shiva then created this universe together, by merging with each other into the half-and-half form [[Ardhanarishvara]].

At various points some or all of these eleven unsolved murders of women have been ascribed to the notorious unidentified [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]].\n\nMost, if not all, of the victims\u2014[[Emma Elizabeth Smith]], [[Martha Tabram]], [[Mary Ann Nichols|Mary Ann \"Polly\" Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman]], [[Elizabeth Stride]], [[Catherine Eddowes]], [[Mary Jane Kelly]], Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an unidentified woman\u2014were prostitutes. Smith was [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] and robbed by a gang. Tabram was stabbed 39 times. Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes, Kelly, McKenzie and Coles had their throats cut. Eddowes and Stride were murdered on the same night, within approximately an hour and less than a mile apart; their murders are known as the \"double event\", after a phrase in a [[Saucy Jacky postcard|postcard sent to the press]] by an individual claiming to be the Ripper. The bodies of Nichols, Chapman, Eddowes and Kelly had abdominal [[mutilation|mutilations]]. Mylett was [[strangulation|strangled]]. The body of the unidentified woman was [[Dismemberment|dismembered]], but the exact cause of her death is unclear.\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], [[City of London Police]], and private organisations such as the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] were actively involved in the search for the perpetrator or perpetrators. Despite extensive enquiries and several arrests, the culprit or culprits evaded capture, and the murders were never solved. The Whitechapel murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were subsequently improved. The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public imagination to the present day.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Dorset-street-1902.jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]], [[Spitalfields]], seen here in 1902]]\nIn the late [[Victorian era]], Whitechapel was considered to be the most notorious criminal [[Rookery (slum)|rookery]] in London. The area around [[Flower and Dean Street]] was described as \"perhaps the foulest and most dangerous street in the whole metropolis\";<ref>Greenwood, James (1883), ''In Strange Company'', London, p. 158, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 21, 45</ref> [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]] was called \"the worst street in London\".<ref>''Daily Mail'', 16 July 1901, quoted in Werner (ed.), pp. 62, 179</ref> Assistant Police Commissioner [[Robert Anderson (police official)|Robert Anderson]] recommended Whitechapel to \"those who take an interest in the dangerous classes\" as one of London's prime criminal \"show places\".<ref>''Pall Mall Gazette'', 4 November 1889, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 225 and Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 516</ref> Robbery and violence were commonplace. The district was characterised by extreme poverty, sub-standard housing, poor sanitation, homelessness, drunkenness and endemic prostitution. These factors were focused in the institution of the [[common lodging-house]], which provided cheap communal lodgings for the desperate and the destitute, among whom the Whitechapel murder victims were numbered.<ref>Werner (ed.), pp. 42\u201344, 118\u2013122, 141\u2013170</ref> All the identified victims lived in the heart of the rookery in [[Spitalfields]], including three in George Street (later named Lolesworth Street), two in Dorset Street, two in Flower and Dean Street and one in Thrawl Street.<ref>White, Jerry (2007), ''London in the Nineteenth Century'', London: Jonathan Cape, {{ISBN|978-0-224-06272-5}}, pp. 323\u2013332</ref>\n\nPolice work and criminal prosecutions at the time relied heavily on confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators in the act of committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. [[Forensic science|Forensic techniques]], such as [[fingerprint]] analysis, were not in use.<ref>Marriott, p. 207</ref> Policing in London was\u2014and still is\u2014divided between two forces: the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the [[City of London Police]] with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the city centre. The [[Home Secretary]], a senior minister of the United Kingdom government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the [[Corporation of London]]. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 14</ref>\n\nEleven deaths in or near Whitechapel between 1888 and 1891 were gathered into a single file, referred to in the police docket as the Whitechapel murders.<ref name=met>[http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm \"The Enduring Mystery of Jack the Ripper\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204014147/http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm |date=4 February 2010 }}, Metropolitan Police, retrieved 1 May 2009</ref><ref>Cook, pp. 33\u201334; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 3</ref> Much of the original material has been either stolen or destroyed.<ref name=met/>\n\n==Victims and investigation==\n[[File:Spitalfields rookery.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Map of about a dozen interconnecting London streets|Map of the Spitalfields rookery, where the victims lived.

Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the [[London Hospital]], where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her [[peritoneum]].

Her body was discovered by cart driver Charles Cross at 3:45&nbsp;am on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance. Her throat had been slit twice from left to right and her abdomen was mutilated by a deep jagged wound. Several shallower incisions across the abdomen, and three or four similar cuts on the right side were caused by the same knife used violently and downwards.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 60\u201361; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 35; Rumbelow, pp. 24\u201327</ref> As the murder occurred in the territory of the J or [[Bethnal Green]] Division of the Metropolitan Police, it was at first investigated by the local detectives. On the same day, [[James Monro]] resigned as the head of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID) over differences with [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]] Sir [[Charles Warren]].<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 64</ref> Initial investigations into the murder had little success, although elements of the press linked it to the two previous murders and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang, as in the case of Smith.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 98; Cook, pp. 25\u201328; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 62\u201363</ref> ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' newspaper suggested instead that a single killer was responsible and other newspapers took up their storyline.<ref>Cook, pp. 25\u201328; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 21\u201322</ref> Suspicions of a serial killer at large in London led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors [[Frederick Abberline]], [[Henry Moore (police officer)|Henry Moore]] and [[Walter Simon Andrews|Walter Andrews]] from the Central Office at [[Scotland Yard]].<ref>Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 676, 678</ref> On the available evidence, [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Coroner Baxter]] concluded that Nichols was murdered at just after 3&nbsp;am where she was found.

She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, [[George Bagster Phillips]], was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6\u20138&nbsp;inches (15\u201320&nbsp;cm) long.<ref>Cook, p. 221; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 71\u201372; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 67\u201368, 87; Marriott, pp. 26\u201329; Rumbelow, p. 42</ref> However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts.<ref>Fido, p. 35; Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref> As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.<ref>Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref>\n\nOn 10 September, the police arrested a notorious local called [[John Pizer]], dubbed \"Leather Apron\", who had a reputation for terrorising local prostitutes.

At various points some or all of these eleven unsolved murders of women have been ascribed to the notorious unidentified [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]].\n\nMost, if not all, of the victims\u2014[[Emma Elizabeth Smith]], [[Martha Tabram]], [[Mary Ann Nichols|Mary Ann \"Polly\" Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman]], [[Elizabeth Stride]], [[Catherine Eddowes]], [[Mary Jane Kelly]], Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an unidentified woman\u2014were prostitutes. Smith was [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] and robbed by a gang. Tabram was stabbed 39 times. Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes, Kelly, McKenzie and Coles had their throats cut. Eddowes and Stride were murdered on the same night, within approximately an hour and less than a mile apart; their murders are known as the \"double event\", after a phrase in a [[Saucy Jacky postcard|postcard sent to the press]] by an individual claiming to be the Ripper. The bodies of Nichols, Chapman, Eddowes and Kelly had abdominal [[mutilation|mutilations]]. Mylett was [[strangulation|strangled]]. The body of the unidentified woman was [[Dismemberment|dismembered]], but the exact cause of her death is unclear.\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], [[City of London Police]], and private organisations such as the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] were actively involved in the search for the perpetrator or perpetrators. Despite extensive enquiries and several arrests, the culprit or culprits evaded capture, and the murders were never solved. The Whitechapel murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were subsequently improved. The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public imagination to the present day.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Dorset-street-1902.jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]], [[Spitalfields]], seen here in 1902]]\nIn the late [[Victorian era]], Whitechapel was considered to be the most notorious criminal [[Rookery (slum)|rookery]] in London.

The district was characterised by extreme poverty, sub-standard housing, homelessness, drunkenness and endemic prostitution. These factors were focused in the institution of the [[common lodging-house]], which provided cheap communal lodgings for the desperate and the destitute, among whom the Whitechapel murder victims were numbered.<ref>Werner (ed.), pp. 42\u201344, 118\u2013122, 141\u2013170</ref> All the identified victims lived in the heart of the rookery in [[Spitalfields]], including three in George Street (later named Lolesworth Street), two in Dorset Street, two in Flower and Dean Street and one in Thrawl Street.<ref>White, Jerry (2007), ''London in the Nineteenth Century'', London: Jonathan Cape, {{ISBN|978-0-224-06272-5}}, pp. 323\u2013332</ref>\n\nPolice work and criminal prosecutions at the time relied heavily on confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators in the act of committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. [[Forensic science|Forensic techniques]], such as [[fingerprint]] analysis, were not in use.<ref>Marriott, p. 207</ref> Policing in London was\u2014and still is\u2014divided between two forces: the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the [[City of London Police]] with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the city centre.

She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the [[London Hospital]], where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her [[peritoneum]]. She developed [[peritonitis]] and died at 9&nbsp;am the following day.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 27\u201329; Cook, pp. 34\u201335; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 47\u201350; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 4\u20137</ref>\n\nThe [[inquest]] was conducted on 7 April by the [[coroner]] for East [[Middlesex]], [[Wynne Edwin Baxter]], who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims.<ref>Whitehead and Rivett, p. 18</ref> The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police, [[Edmund Reid]] of H Division Whitechapel, investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 47\u201350</ref> [[Walter Dew]], a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper,<ref>Dew, Walter (1938), ''I Caught Crippen'', London: Blackie and Son, p. 92, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 29</ref> but his colleagues suspected it was the work of a criminal gang.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 29</ref> Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men, but either refused to or could not describe them. East End prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as an act of intimidation.<ref>Marriott, pp. 5\u20137</ref> She may not have identified her attackers because she feared reprisal.

[[Walter Dew]] wrote in his memoirs, that \"there can be no doubt that the August Bank Holiday murder&nbsp;... was the handiwork of the Ripper\" (''I Caught Crippen'', p. 97, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 56).

Her body was discovered by cart driver Charles Cross at 3:45&nbsp;am on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance. Her throat had been slit twice from left to right and her abdomen was mutilated by a deep jagged wound. Several shallower incisions across the abdomen, and three or four similar cuts on the right side were caused by the same knife used violently and downwards.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 60\u201361; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 35; Rumbelow, pp. 24\u201327</ref> As the murder occurred in the territory of the J or [[Bethnal Green]] Division of the Metropolitan Police, it was at first investigated by the local detectives. On the same day, [[James Monro]] resigned as the head of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID) over differences with [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]] Sir [[Charles Warren]].<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 64</ref> Initial investigations into the murder had little success, although elements of the press linked it to the two previous murders and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang, as in the case of Smith.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 98; Cook, pp. 25\u201328; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 62\u201363</ref> ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' newspaper suggested instead that a single killer was responsible and other newspapers took up their storyline.<ref>Cook, pp. 25\u201328; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 21\u201322</ref> Suspicions of a serial killer at large in London led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors [[Frederick Abberline]], [[Henry Moore (police officer)|Henry Moore]] and [[Walter Simon Andrews|Walter Andrews]] from the Central Office at [[Scotland Yard]].<ref>Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 676, 678</ref> On the available evidence, [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Coroner Baxter]] concluded that Nichols was murdered at just after 3&nbsp;am where she was found. In his summing up, he dismissed the possibility that her murder was connected with those of Smith and Tabram, as the lethal weapons were different in those cases, and neither of the earlier cases involved a slash to the throat.<ref>Marriott, pp. 21\u201322</ref> However, by the time the inquest into Nichols' death had concluded, a fourth woman had been murdered, and Baxter noted \"The similarity of the injuries in the two cases is considerable.\"<ref>Marriott, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\n===Annie Chapman===\n[[File:Annie Chapman2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|alt=Mortuary photograph of Chapman: a middle-aged woman with short, curly hair|[[Annie Chapman]], 47, lived in a lodging-house at 35 Dorset Street.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 66\u201373; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 33\u201334</ref>]]\nThe mutilated body of the fourth woman, [[Annie Chapman]], was discovered at about 6:00&nbsp;am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway in the back yard of 29 [[Hanbury Street]], Spitalfields.

She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, [[George Bagster Phillips]], was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6\u20138&nbsp;inches (15\u201320&nbsp;cm) long.<ref>Cook, p. 221; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 71\u201372; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 67\u201368, 87; Marriott, pp. 26\u201329; Rumbelow, p. 42</ref> However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts.<ref>Fido, p. 35; Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref> As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.<ref>Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref>\n\nOn 10 September, the police arrested a notorious local called [[John Pizer]], dubbed \"Leather Apron\", who had a reputation for terrorising local prostitutes.

Like most of the previous murders, her left carotid artery was severed from left to right and there were wounds on her abdomen. However, her wounds were not as deep as in previous murders, and a shorter blade was used. Commissioner Monro<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 207\u2013208; Evans and Skinner (2001), p. 137</ref> and one of the pathologists examining the body, Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though another of the pathologists, Phillips, and Robert Anderson disagreed,<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 208\u2013209; Marriott, pp. 182\u2013183</ref> as did Inspector Abberline.<ref>Interview in ''Cassell's Saturday Journal'', 28 May 1892, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 225</ref> Later writers are also divided, and either suggest that McKenzie was a Ripper victim,<ref>Marriott, p. 195</ref> or that the unknown murderer tried to make it look like a Ripper killing to deflect suspicion from himself.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 209</ref> At the inquest, Coroner Baxter acknowledged both possibilities, and concluded: \"There is great similarity between this and the other class of cases, which have happened in this neighbourhood, and if the same person has not committed this crime, it is clearly an imitation of the other cases.\"<ref>Coroner Baxter's summing up, 14 August 1888, quoted in Marriott, p. 193</ref>\n\n===Pinchin Street torso===\nA woman's torso was found at 5:15&nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday 10 September 1889 under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel. No other body parts were found, despite a search of the area, and neither the victim nor the culprit were ever identified. [[Donald Swanson|Chief Inspector Swanson]] and [[James Monro|Commissioner Monro]] noted that the presence of blood within the torso indicated that death was not from haemorrhage or cutting of the throat.<ref>Report to the Home Office by Swanson, 10 September 1889, MEPO 3/140 ff. 136\u201340, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 480\u2013482; Report to the Home Office by Monro, 11 September 1889, HO 144/221/A49301K ff. 1\u20138, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 492\u2013494</ref> The pathologists, however, noted that the general bloodlessness of the tissues and vessels indicated that haemorrhage was the cause of death.<ref>Report of Dr Charles A.
