He served as a general in the [[United States Army]] from 1814 to 1861, taking part in the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the early stages of the [[American Civil War]], and various [[American Indian Wars|conflicts]] with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Scott was the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]'s presidential nominee in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Franklin Pierce]]. He was known as '''Old Fuss and Feathers''' for his insistence on proper military etiquette, and as the '''Grand Old Man of the Army''' for his many years of service.\n\nScott was born near [[Petersburg, Virginia]], in 1786. After training as a lawyer and brief militia service, he joined the army in 1808 as a captain of the light artillery. In the War of 1812, Scott served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front, taking part in the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] and the [[Battle of Fort George]], and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in early 1814. He served with distinction in the [[Battle of Chippawa]], but was badly wounded in the subsequent [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]]. After the conclusion of the war, Scott was assigned to command army forces in a district containing much of the Northeastern United States, and he and his family made their home near New York City. During the 1830s, Scott negotiated an end to the [[Black Hawk War]], took part in the [[Second Seminole War]] and the [[Creek War of 1836]], and presided over the [[Indian removal|removal]] of the [[Cherokee]]. Scott also helped to avert war with Britain, defusing tensions arising from the [[Patriot War]] and the [[Aroostook War]]. \n\nIn 1841, Scott became the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]], beating out his rival, [[Edmund P. Gaines]], for the position. After the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, Scott initially served as an administrator, but in 1847 he led a campaign against the [[Mexico|Mexican]] capital of [[Mexico City]]. After [[Siege of Veracruz|capturing]] the port city of [[Veracruz]], he defeated Mexican General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s armies at the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], the [[Battle of Contreras]], and the [[Battle of Churubusco]] and [[Battle for Mexico City|captured Mexico City]]. He maintained order in the Mexican capital and indirectly helped envoy [[Nicholas Trist]] negotiate the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which brought an end to the war.\n\nScott was a candidate for the Whig presidential nomination in 1840, 1844, and 1848, and he finally won the Whig presidential nomination at the [[1852 Whig National Convention]]. The Whigs were badly divided over the [[Compromise of 1850]], and Pierce won a decisive victory over his former commander. Nonetheless, Scott remained popular among the public, and in 1855 he received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to the rank of [[lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], becoming the first U.S. Army officer to hold that rank since [[George Washington]]. Despite being a Virginia native, Scott stayed loyal to the Union and served as an important adviser to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the opening stages of the Civil War. He developed a strategy known as the [[Anaconda Plan]], but retired in late 1861 after Lincoln increasingly relied on General [[George B. McClellan]] for military advice and leadership. Scott's military talent was highly regarded by contemporaries, and historians generally consider him to be one of the most accomplished generals in U.S. history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Winfield Scott.svg|upright=1|thumb|Scott used this [[coat of arms]] for his [[bookplate]].{{sfn|''Hobbies magazine'' |page=139}} It has been incorporated into the heraldry of various units of the U.S. Army, including the [[1st Engineer Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[7th Engineer Battalion (United States)|7th]] Engineer Battalions.{{sfn|''U.S. Army Heraldic Crests''|pages=108\u2013109}}]]\n\nWinfield Scott was born on June 13, 1786, to Ann Mason and her husband, William Scott, a farmer, veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and officer in the [[Dinwiddie County, Virginia|Dinwiddie County]] militia.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=1\u20132}} At the time, the Scott family resided at Laurel Hill, a plantation near [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=219}} Ann Mason Scott was the daughter of Daniel Mason and Elizabeth Winfield, and it was Ann's mother's maiden name that William and Ann Scott selected for their son.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=1}} Scott's paternal grandfather, James Scott, had migrated from [[Scotland]] after the defeat of [[Charles Edward Stuart]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Culloden]].

Scott convinced a family friend, [[William Branch Giles]], to help him obtain a commission in the newly-expanded army.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=9\u201310}}  In May 1808, shortly before his twenty-second birthday, Scott was commissioned as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] in the [[light artillery]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} Tasked with recruiting a [[company (military unit)|company]], he raised his troops from the Petersburg and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] areas, and then traveled with his unit to [[New Orleans]] to join his [[regiment]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} Scott was deeply disturbed by what he viewed as the unprofessionalism of the army, which at the time consisted of just 2,700 soldiers. He later wrote that \"the old officers had, very generally, sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=13\u201314}} \n\nHe soon clashed with his commander, General [[James Wilkinson]], over Wilkinson's refusal to follow the orders of Secretary of War [[William Eustis]] to remove troops from an unhealthy bivouac site.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} Wilkinson owned the site, and while the poor location caused several illnesses and deaths among his soldiers, Wilkinson refused to relocate them because he personally profited.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} In addition, staying near New Orleans enabled Wilkinson to pursue his private business interests and continue the courtship of Celestine Trudeau, whom he later married.<ref name=\"Johnson1998\">{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Timothy D. |title=Winfield Scott: The Quest for Military Glory |date=1998 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |url=https://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/DCARead?standardNo=0700609148&standardNoType=1&excerpt=true |page=14 |isbn=0-7006-0914-8|ref=harv}}<ref/> Scott briefly resigned his commission over his dissatisfaction with Wilkinson, but before his resignation had been accepted, he withdrew it and returned to the army.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pages=17\u201318}} In January 1810, Scott was convicted in a court-martial, partly for making disrespectful comments about Wilkinson's integrity,{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pages=18\u201319}} and partly because of a $50 shortage in the $400 account he had been provided to conduct recruiting duty in Virginia after receiving his commission.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=9\u201310}} With respect to the money, the court-martial members indicated that Scott had not been intentionally dishonest, but had failed to keep accurate records.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=10}} His commission was suspended for one year.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=18\u201319}} After the trial, Scott fought a duel with William Upshaw, an army medical officer and Wilkinson friend who Scott blamed for causing the court-martial; each fired at the other, but both emerged unharmed.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|page=19}}\n\nAfter the duel, Scott returned to Virginia, where he spent the year studying military tactics and strategy,{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} and practicing law in partnership with [[Benjamin Watkins Leigh]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pages=20\u201321}} Meanwhile, Wilkinson was removed from command for insubordination, and was succeeded by General [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=16\u201317}} The rousing reception Scott received from his army peers as he began his suspension led him to believe that most officers approved of his anti-Wilkinson comments, at least tacitly; their high opinion of him, coupled with Leigh's counsel to remain in the army, convinced Scott to resume his military career once his suspension had been served.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=20\u201321}} He rejoined the army in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], where one of his first duties was to serve as judge advocate in the court-martial of Colonel [[Thomas Humphrey Cushing]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=22\u201323}}\n\n===War of 1812===\n[[File:Anglo American War 1812 Locations map-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Map showing the northern theater of the [[War of 1812]]]]\n{{Further|Presidency of James Madison}}\n\nTensions between Britain and the United States continued to rise as Britain attacked American shipping, [[impressment|impressed]] American sailors, and encouraged [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] resistance to American settlement. In July 1812, Congress [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]] against Britain.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=23\u201325}} After the declaration of war, Scott was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and assigned as the second-in-command of the 2d Artillery, serving under [[George Izard]]. While Izard continued to recruit soldiers, Scott led two companies north to join General [[Stephen Van Rensselaer]]'s militia force, which was preparing for an invasion of [[Canada]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=27\u201328}} President [[James Madison]] made the invasion the central part of his administration's war strategy in 1812, as he sought to capture [[Montreal]] and thereby take control of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and cut off [[Upper Canada]] from [[Lower Canada]]. The invasion would begin with an attack on the town of [[Queenston, Ontario|Queenston]], which was just across the [[Niagara River]] from [[New York (state)|New York]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n[[File:Winfield Scott, ca. War of 1812.jpg|thumb|right|Scott during the War of 1812]]\n\nIn October 1812, Van Rensselaer's force attacked British forces in the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]]. Scott led an artillery bombardment that supported an American crossing of the Niagara River, and he took command of American forces at Queenston after Colonel [[Solomon Van Rensselaer]] was badly wounded.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=37\u201339}} Shortly after Scott took command, a British column under [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]] arrived. Sheaffe's numerically-superior forces compelled an American retreat, ultimately forcing Scott to surrender after reinforcements from the militia failed to materialize.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=39\u201341}} As a [[prisoner of war]], Scott was treated hospitably by the British, although two [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leaders nearly killed him while he was in British custody.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=42\u201343}} As part of a prisoner exchange, Scott was released in late November; upon his return to the United States, he was promoted to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and made the commander of the 2d Artillery.

With help from naval commanders [[Isaac Chauncey]] and [[Oliver Hazard Perry]], Scott landed American forces behind the fort, forcing its surrender. Scott was widely praised for his conduct in the battle, although he was personally disappointed that the bulk of the British garrison escaped capture.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=55\u201359}} As part of another campaign to capture Montreal, Scott forced the British to withdrawal from Hoople Creek in November 1813. Despite this success, the campaign fell apart after the American defeat at [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]], and after General Wilkinson (who had taken command of the front in August) and General Hampton failed to cooperate on a strategy to take Montreal.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=66\u201371}} With the failure of the campaign, President Madison and Secretary of War [[John Armstrong Jr.]] relieved Wilkinson{{efn|Wilkinson was exonerated in a subsequent court-martial but was honorably discharged from the army.

Mather, to ask whether Scott would remain loyal to the United States and keep order during [[first inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's inauguration]]. Scott responded to Mather, \"I shall consider myself responsible for [Lincoln's] safety. If necessary, I shall plant cannon at both ends of [[Pennsylvania Avenue]], and if any of the Maryland or Virginia gentlemen who have become so threatening and troublesome show their heads or even venture to raise a finger, I shall blow them to hell.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=349\u2013352}} Scott helped ensure that Lincoln arrived in Washington safely, and ensured the security of Lincoln's inauguration, which ultimately was conducted without a major incident.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=352\u2013355}}\n\n===Lincoln administration===\n{{Further|Presidency of Abraham Lincoln}}\n[[File:Currier & Ives - The champions of the Union 1861.jpg|thumb|left|1861 Currier & Ives engraving of Winfield Scott and other Union generals, indicative of the Northern sentiment towards him and others in 1861]]\n\nBy the time Lincoln assumed office, seven states had declared their secession and had seized federal property within their bounds, but the United States retained control of the military installations at Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens.{{sfn|McPherson|2008|p=13}} Scott advised evacuating the forts on the grounds that an attempted re-supply would inflame tensions with the South, and that Confederate shore batteries made re-supply impossible.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=358\u2013361}} Lincoln rejected the advice and chose to re-supply the forts; although Scott accepted the orders, his resistance to the re-supply mission, along with poor health, undermined his status within the administration. Nonetheless, he remained a key military adviser and administrator.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=360\u2013363, 381}} On April 12, Confederate forces began an [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack]] on Fort Sumter, forcing its surrender the following day.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=366\u2013367}} On April 15, Lincoln declared that a state of rebellion existed and [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|called up tens of thousands of militiamen]]. On the advice of Scott, Lincoln offered Robert E. Lee command of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces, but Lee ultimately chose to serve the Confederacy.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=408\u2013417}}\n\n[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb |upright=1|1861 characterized map of Scott's \"Anaconda Plan\" to squeeze the South]]\n\nScott took charge of molding Union military personnel into a cohesive fighting force.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=379, 384}} Lincoln rejected Scott's proposal to build up the regular army,{{efn|The regular army consisted of just 17,000 men at the start of the Civil War.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|p=381}}}} and the administration would largely rely on volunteers to fight the war.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=382\u2013383}} Scott developed a strategy, later known as the [[Anaconda Plan]], that called for the capture of the Mississippi River and a blockade of Southern ports. By cutting off the eastern states of the Confederacy, Scott hoped to force the surrender of Confederate forces with a minimal loss of life on both sides. Scott's plan was leaked to the public, and was derided by most Northern newspapers, which tended to favor an immediate assault on the Confederacy.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=385\u2013387}} As Scott was too old for battlefield command, Lincoln selected General [[Irvin McDowell]], an officer whom Scott saw as unimaginative and inexperienced, to lead the main Union army in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|eastern theater]] of the war.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=387\u2013388}} Though Scott counseled that the army needed more time to train, Lincoln ordered an offensive against the Confederate capital of Richmond. Irvin McDowell led a force of 30,000 men south, where he met Confederate Army at [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. The Confederate army dealt the Union a major defeat, ending any hope of a quick end to the war.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=429\u2013435}}\n\nMcDowell took the brunt of public vituperation for the defeat at Bull Run, but Scott, who had helped plan the battle, also received criticism.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=388\u2013392}} Lincoln replaced McDowell with McClellan, and the president began meeting with McClellan without Scott in attendance.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=393\u2013394}} Frustrated with his diminished standing, Scott submitted his resignation in October 1861. Though Scott favored General [[Henry Halleck]] as his successor, Lincoln instead made McClellan the army's senior officer.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=393\u2013398}}\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Winfield Scott Seated 1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Scott in 1861]]\n\nAfter retiring, Scott traveled to Europe with his daughter, Cornelia, and her husband, H. L. Scott. In [[Paris]], he helped American consul [[John Bigelow]] defuse the [[Trent Affair]], a diplomatic incident with Britain.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=400\u2013401}} On his return from Europe in December 1861, he lived alone in New York City and at [[West Point, New York]], where he wrote his memoirs and closely followed the ongoing civil war. After McClellan's defeat in the [[Seven Days Battles]], Lincoln accepted Scott's advice and appointed General Halleck as the army's senior general. In 1864, Scott sent a copy of his newly-published memoirs to Ulysses S. Grant, who had succeeded Halleck as the lead Union general. The copy that Scott sent was inscribed, \"from the oldest to the greatest general.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=402\u2013404}} Following a strategy similar to Scott's Anaconda Plan, Grant led the Union to victory, and the Confederate army [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|surrendered]] in April 1865.<ref name=\"malanga\" />\n\nScott died at the West Point on May 29, 1866.{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=220}} President [[Andrew Johnson]] ordered the flags flown at half-staff to honor Scott, and Scott's funeral was attended by many of the leading Union generals, including Grant, George G. Meade, [[George H. Thomas]], and [[John Schofield]]. He is buried at the [[West Point Cemetery]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n[[File:General Winfield Scott statue (45726769).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Brevet Lt.

Steven Malanga of ''[[City Journal]]'' writes that \"Scott was one of America\u2019s greatest generals ... but he had the misfortune to serve in two conflicts\u2014the War of 1812 and the controversial Mexican-American War\u2014bracketed by the far more significant American Revolution and Civil War.\"<ref name=\"4PNmt\" /> Biographer John Eisenhower writes that Scott \"was an astonishing man\" who was the country's \"most prominent general\" between the retirement of Andrew Jackson in 1821 and the onset of the Civil War in 1861.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|p=xiii}} The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] proclaimed Scott \"the greatest living general\" after his capture of Mexico City.{{sfn|Johnson|1998|p=1}} Robert E. Lee wrote, \"the great cause of our success [in Mexico] was in our leader [Scott]\".{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|p=315}} Historians Scott Kaufman and John A. Soares Jr. write that Scott was \"an able diplomat who proved crucial in helping avert war between Britain and the United States in period after the War of 1812.\"{{sfn|Kaufman|Soares|2006|p=58}} [[Fanny Crosby]], the hymn writer, recalled that Scott's \"gentle manner did not indicate a hero of so many battles; yet there was strength beneath the exterior appearance and a heart of iron within his breast. But from him I learned that the warrior only it is, who can fully appreciate the blessing of peace.\"<ref name=\"7TErp\" />\n\nIn addition to his reputation as a tactician and strategist, Scott's career was also noteworthy for his concern about the welfare of his subordinates, as demonstrated by his willingness to risk his career in the dispute with Wilkinson over the Louisiana bivouac site.{{sfn|Johnson|1998|pages=13-14}}  In another example, when cholera broke out among his soldiers while they were aboard ship during the Black Hawk campaign and the ship's surgeon was incapacitated by the disease, Scott received a treatment tutorial from the surgeon and risked his own health by tending to the sick men himself.<ref name=\"XTEwe\" />\n\n===Memorials===\n[[File:Winfield Scott44 1870 issue-24c.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|First Winfield Scott stamp, issue of 1870]]\n\nScott has been memorialized in numerous ways.

He served as a general in the [[United States Army]] from 1814 to 1861, taking part in the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the early stages of the [[American Civil War]], and various [[American Indian Wars|conflicts]] with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Scott was the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]'s presidential nominee in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Franklin Pierce]]. He was known as '''Old Fuss and Feathers''' for his insistence on proper military etiquette, and as the '''Grand Old Man of the Army''' for his many years of service.\n\nScott was born near [[Petersburg, Virginia]], in 1786. After training as a lawyer and brief militia service, he joined the army in 1808 as a captain of the light artillery. In the War of 1812, Scott served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front, taking part in the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] and the [[Battle of Fort George]], and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in early 1814. He served with distinction in the [[Battle of Chippawa]], but was badly wounded in the subsequent [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]]. After the conclusion of the war, Scott was assigned to command army forces in a district containing much of the Northeastern United States, and he and his family made their home near New York City. During the 1830s, Scott negotiated an end to the [[Black Hawk War]], took part in the [[Second Seminole War]] and the [[Creek War of 1836]], and presided over the [[Indian removal|removal]] of the [[Cherokee]]. Scott also helped to avert war with Britain, defusing tensions arising from the [[Patriot War]] and the [[Aroostook War]]. \n\nIn 1841, Scott became the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]], beating out his rival, [[Edmund P. Gaines]], for the position. After the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, Scott initially served as an administrator, but in 1847 he led a campaign against the [[Mexico|Mexican]] capital of [[Mexico City]]. After [[Siege of Veracruz|capturing]] the port city of [[Veracruz]], he defeated Mexican General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s armies at the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], the [[Battle of Contreras]], and the [[Battle of Churubusco]] and [[Battle for Mexico City|captured Mexico City]]. He maintained order in the Mexican capital and indirectly helped envoy [[Nicholas Trist]] negotiate the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which brought an end to the war.\n\nScott was a candidate for the Whig presidential nomination in 1840, 1844, and 1848, and he finally won the Whig presidential nomination at the [[1852 Whig National Convention]]. The Whigs were badly divided over the [[Compromise of 1850]], and Pierce won a decisive victory over his former commander. Nonetheless, Scott remained popular among the public, and in 1855 he received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to the rank of [[lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], becoming the first U.S. Army officer to hold that rank since [[George Washington]]. Despite being a Virginia native, Scott stayed loyal to the Union and served as an important adviser to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the opening stages of the Civil War. He developed a strategy known as the [[Anaconda Plan]], but retired in late 1861 after Lincoln increasingly relied on General [[George B. McClellan]] for military advice and leadership. Scott's military talent was highly regarded by contemporaries, and historians generally consider him to be one of the most accomplished generals in U.S. history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Winfield Scott.svg|upright=1|thumb|Scott used this [[coat of arms]] for his [[bookplate]].{{sfn|''Hobbies magazine'' |page=139}} It has been incorporated into the heraldry of various units of the U.S. Army, including the [[1st Engineer Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[7th Engineer Battalion (United States)|7th]] Engineer Battalions.{{sfn|''U.S. Army Heraldic Crests''|pages=108\u2013109}}]]\n\nWinfield Scott was born on June 13, 1786, to Ann Mason and her husband, William Scott, a farmer, veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and officer in the [[Dinwiddie County, Virginia|Dinwiddie County]] militia.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=1\u20132}} At the time, the Scott family resided at Laurel Hill, a plantation near [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=219}} Ann Mason Scott was the daughter of Daniel Mason and Elizabeth Winfield, and it was Ann's mother's maiden name that William and Ann Scott selected for their son.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=1}} Scott's paternal grandfather, James Scott, had migrated from [[Scotland]] after the defeat of [[Charles Edward Stuart]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Culloden]]. Scott's father died when Scott was six years old; his mother did not remarry, and she continued to raise Scott, his brother, and his two sisters until her death in 1803.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=1\u20132}} Although Scott's family held considerable wealth, most of the family fortune went to his older brother, James.{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=220}}\n\nIn 1805, Scott began attending the [[College of William and Mary]], but he soon left in order to study law in the office of attorney David Robinson, where his contemporaries included [[Thomas Ruffin]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=4}} While apprenticing under Robinson, he attended the trial of [[Aaron Burr]], who had been accused of [[treason]] for his role in events now known as the [[Burr conspiracy]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=56}} During the trial, Scott developed a negative opinion of the [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the United States Army]], General [[James Wilkinson]], as the result of Wilkinson's obvious efforts to minimize his complicity in Burr's actions by providing forged evidence and false, self-serving testimony.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=8\u201310}} In 1807, Scott gained his initial military experience as a [[Corporal#United States|corporal]] of [[cavalry]] in the Virginia [[militia]], serving in the midst of the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=6}}  Scott led a detachment that captured eight [[United Kingdom|British]] sailors who had attempted to land in order to purchase provisions.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=6}} Virginia authorities did not approve of this action, fearing it might spark a wider conflict, and they soon ordered the release of the prisoners.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=6}} Later that year, Scott attempted to establish a legal practice in [[South Carolina]], but was unable to obtain a law license because he did not meet the state's one-year residency requirement.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7\u20139}}\n\n==Early career, 1807\u20131815==\n===First years in the army===\n{{see also|Origins of the War of 1812}}\n\nIn early 1808, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] asked Congress to authorize an expansion of the [[United States Army]] after the British announced an escalation of their naval blockade of [[France]], thereby threatening American shipping. Scott convinced a family friend, [[William Branch Giles]], to help him obtain a commission in the newly-expanded army.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=9\u201310}}  In May 1808, shortly before his twenty-second birthday, Scott was commissioned as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] in the [[light artillery]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} Tasked with recruiting a [[company (military unit)|company]], he raised his troops from the Petersburg and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] areas, and then traveled with his unit to [[New Orleans]] to join his [[regiment]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} Scott was deeply disturbed by what he viewed as the unprofessionalism of the army, which at the time consisted of just 2,700 soldiers. He later wrote that \"the old officers had, very generally, sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=13\u201314}} \n\nHe soon clashed with his commander, General [[James Wilkinson]], over Wilkinson's refusal to follow the orders of Secretary of War [[William Eustis]] to remove troops from an unhealthy bivouac site.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} Wilkinson owned the site, and while the poor location caused several illnesses and deaths among his soldiers, Wilkinson refused to relocate them because he personally profited.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} In addition, staying near New Orleans enabled Wilkinson to pursue his private business interests and continue the courtship of Celestine Trudeau, whom he later married.<ref name=\"Johnson1998\"/> Scott briefly resigned his commission over his dissatisfaction with Wilkinson, but before his resignation had been accepted, he withdrew it and returned to the army.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pages=17\u201318}} In January 1810, Scott was convicted in a court-martial, partly for making disrespectful comments about Wilkinson's integrity,{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pages=18\u201319}} and partly because of a $50 shortage in the $400 account he had been provided to conduct recruiting duty in Virginia after receiving his commission.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=9\u201310}} With respect to the money, the court-martial members indicated that Scott had not been intentionally dishonest, but had failed to keep accurate records.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=10}} His commission was suspended for one year.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=18\u201319}} After the trial, Scott fought a duel with William Upshaw, an army medical officer and Wilkinson friend who Scott blamed for causing the court-martial; each fired at the other, but both emerged unharmed.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|page=19}}\n\nAfter the duel, Scott returned to Virginia, where he spent the year studying military tactics and strategy,{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} and practicing law in partnership with [[Benjamin Watkins Leigh]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pages=20\u201321}} Meanwhile, Wilkinson was removed from command for insubordination, and was succeeded by General [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=16\u201317}} The rousing reception Scott received from his army peers as he began his suspension led him to believe that most officers approved of his anti-Wilkinson comments, at least tacitly; their high opinion of him, coupled with Leigh's counsel to remain in the army, convinced Scott to resume his military career once his suspension had been served.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=20\u201321}} He rejoined the army in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], where one of his first duties was to serve as judge advocate in the court-martial of Colonel [[Thomas Humphrey Cushing]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=22\u201323}}\n\n===War of 1812===\n[[File:Anglo American War 1812 Locations map-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Map showing the northern theater of the [[War of 1812]]]]\n{{Further|Presidency of James Madison}}\n\nTensions between Britain and the United States continued to rise as Britain attacked American shipping, [[impressment|impressed]] American sailors, and encouraged [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] resistance to American settlement. In July 1812, Congress [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]] against Britain.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=23\u201325}} After the declaration of war, Scott was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and assigned as the second-in-command of the 2d Artillery, serving under [[George Izard]]. While Izard continued to recruit soldiers, Scott led two companies north to join General [[Stephen Van Rensselaer]]'s militia force, which was preparing for an invasion of [[Canada]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=27\u201328}} President [[James Madison]] made the invasion the central part of his administration's war strategy in 1812, as he sought to capture [[Montreal]] and thereby take control of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and cut off [[Upper Canada]] from [[Lower Canada]]. The invasion would begin with an attack on the town of [[Queenston, Ontario|Queenston]], which was just across the [[Niagara River]] from [[New York (state)|New York]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n[[File:Winfield Scott, ca. War of 1812.jpg|thumb|right|Scott during the War of 1812]]\n\nIn October 1812, Van Rensselaer's force attacked British forces in the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]]. Scott led an artillery bombardment that supported an American crossing of the Niagara River, and he took command of American forces at Queenston after Colonel [[Solomon Van Rensselaer]] was badly wounded.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=37\u201339}} Shortly after Scott took command, a British column under [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]] arrived. Sheaffe's numerically-superior forces compelled an American retreat, ultimately forcing Scott to surrender after reinforcements from the militia failed to materialize.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=39\u201341}} As a [[prisoner of war]], Scott was treated hospitably by the British, although two [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leaders nearly killed him while he was in British custody.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=42\u201343}} As part of a prisoner exchange, Scott was released in late November; upon his return to the United States, he was promoted to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and made the commander of the 2d Artillery. He also became the chief of staff to General [[Henry Dearborn]], who was the senior general of the army and personally led operations against Canada in the area around Lake Ontario.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=46, 51\u201354}}\n\nDearborn assigned Scott to lead an [[Battle of Fort George|attack]] against [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]], which commanded a strategic position on the Niagara River. With help from naval commanders [[Isaac Chauncey]] and [[Oliver Hazard Perry]], Scott landed American forces behind the fort, forcing its surrender. Scott was widely praised for his conduct in the battle, although he was personally disappointed that the bulk of the British garrison escaped capture.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=55\u201359}} As part of another campaign to capture Montreal, Scott forced the British to withdrawal from Hoople Creek in November 1813. Despite this success, the campaign fell apart after the American defeat at [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]], and after General Wilkinson (who had taken command of the front in August) and General Hampton failed to cooperate on a strategy to take Montreal.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=66\u201371}} With the failure of the campaign, President Madison and Secretary of War [[John Armstrong Jr.]] relieved Wilkinson{{efn|Wilkinson was exonerated in a subsequent court-martial but was honorably discharged from the army. He later published an autobiography that was strongly critical of Scott.

Clay, [[Daniel Webster]], and General Zachary Taylor were also candidates for the nomination. As in 1840, Whigs were looking for a non-ideological war hero to be their candidate. Scott's main appeal was to anti-slavery \"conscience Whigs\", who were dismayed by the fact that two of the leading contenders, Clay and Taylor, were slaveholders. Ultimately, however, the delegates passed on Scott for a second time, nominating Taylor on the fourth ballot. Many anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] Whigs then defected to support the nominee of the [[Free-Soil Party]], former President Martin Van Buren. Taylor went on to win the general election.<ref name=\"cDbYx\" />\n\nAfter the war, Scott returned to his administrative duties as the army's senior general.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=321\u2013322}} Congress became engaged in a divisive debate over the status of slavery in the territories, and Scott joined with Whig leaders Henry Clay and [[Daniel Webster]] in advocating for passage of what became known as the [[Compromise of 1850]]. Meanwhile, Taylor died of an illness in July 1850 and was succeeded by Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=322\u2013324}} The Compromise of 1850 and the enforcement of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] badly divided the country as a whole and the Whig Party in particular. Northerners strongly objected to the stringent provisions of the act, while Southerners complained bitterly about any perceived slackness in enforcement.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=208\u2013213}} Despite Scott's support for the Compromise of 1850, he became the chosen candidate of [[William Seward]], a leading Northern Whig who objected to the Compromise of 1850 partly because of the fugitive slave act.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=324\u2013325}}\n\n===Presidential election of 1852===\n[[File:Scott vs Pierce campaign.jpg|thumb|''The Game-cock & the Goose'', an 1852 Whig cartoon favoring Winfield Scott]]\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1852.svg|thumb|right|Democrat [[Franklin Pierce]] defeated Whig Winfield Scott in the 1852 election]]\n\nBy early 1852, the three leading candidates for the Whig presidential nomination were Scott, who was backed by anti-Compromise Northern Whigs, President Fillmore, the first choice of most Southern Whigs, and Secretary of State Webster, whose support was concentrated in New England.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=325\u2013327}} The [[1852 Whig National Convention]] convened on June 16, and Southern delegates won approval of a [[party platform]] endorsing the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement of the slavery question.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=244\u2013247}} On the convention's first presidential ballot, Fillmore received 133 of the necessary 147 votes, while Scott won 131 and Webster won 29. After the 46th ballot still failed to produce a presidential nominee, the delegates voted to adjourn until the following Monday. Over the weekend, Fillmore and Webster supporters conducted unsuccessful negotiations to unite behind one candidate.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=244\u2013247}} On the 48th ballot, Webster delegates began to defect to Scott, and the general gained the nomination on the 53rd ballot.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=244\u2013247}} Fillmore accepted his defeat with equanimity and endorsed Scott, but many Northern Whigs were dismayed when Scott publicly endorsed the party's pro-Compromise platform.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=327\u2013328}} Despite the party's effort to appeal to southerners by nominating [[William Alexander Graham]] of [[North Carolina]] for vice president, many Southern Whigs, including [[Alexander H. Stephens]] and [[Robert Toombs]], refused to support Scott.{{sfn|McPherson|p=118}}\n\nThe [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] nominated [[dark horse]] candidate [[Franklin Pierce]], a Northerner sympathetic to the Southern view on slavery.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=237\u2013239, 244}} Pierce had resigned from the U.S. Senate in 1842, and had briefly held only the minor office of [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|District of New Hampshire]] since then, but emerged as a compromise candidate partly because of his service under Scott in the Mexican\u2013American War.<ref name=\"l9Tkf\" /> The Democrats attacked Scott for various incidents from his long public career, including his court-martial in 1809 and the hanging of members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion during the Mexican\u2013American War.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=328\u2013329}} Scott proved to be a poor candidate who lacked popular appeal, and he suffered the worst defeat in Whig history.{{sfn|Holt|1999|pp=754\u2013755}} In the South, distrust and apathy towards Scott led many Southern Whigs to vote for Pierce or to sit out the election, and in the North, many anti-slavery Whigs voted for [[John P. Hale]] of the [[Free Soil Party]].{{sfn|Holt|1999|pp=758\u2013761}} Scott won just four states and 44 percent of the popular vote, while Pierce won just under 51 percent of the popular vote and a large majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]].{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=246\u2013247}}\n\n===Pierce and Buchanan administrations===\n{{Further|Presidency of Franklin Pierce|Presidency of James Buchanan|Origins of the American Civil War}}\n[[File:Winfield Scott - National Portrait Gallery.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Scott in 1855, painted by [[Robert Walter Weir]]]]\n\nAfter the 1852 election, Scott continued his duties as the senior officer of the army. He maintained cordial relations with President Pierce but frequently clashed with Pierce's Secretary of War, [[Jefferson Davis]], over issues like travel expenses.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=331\u2013332}} Despite his defeat in the 1852 presidential election, Scott remained broadly popular, and on Pierce's recommendation, in 1855 Congress passed a resolution promoting Scott to brevet lieutenant general.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=331\u2013333}}<ref name=\"12Aj5\" /> Scott was the [[List of lieutenant generals in the United States Army before 1960|first]] U.S. Army officer since [[George Washington]] to hold the rank of lieutenant general.<ref name=\"ltgen\" />{{efn|Prior to the [[American Civil War]], Washington and Scott were the only U.S. Army officers to hold the rank of lieutenant general, although Washington held the rank as a permanent, rather than brevet, appointment.

Pierce was denied re-nomination in favor of James Buchanan, while the Whig Party collapsed. In the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], Buchanan defeated [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] of the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and former President Fillmore, the candidate of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Know Nothing|American Party]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=334\u2013337}} Sectional tensions continued to escalate after the Supreme Court handed down its decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''. Buchanan proved incapable of healing sectional divides, and some leading Southerners became increasingly vocal in their desire to secede from the union.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=337\u2013338}} In 1859, Buchanan assigned Scott to lead a mission to settle a dispute with Britain over the ownership of the [[San Juan Islands]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Scott reached an agreement with British official [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] to reduce military forces on the islands, thereby resolving the so-called \"[[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]]\".{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=338\u2013341}} \n\nIn the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], the Republicans nominated [[Abraham Lincoln]], while the Democrats split along sectional lines, with Northern Democrats supporting Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] and Southern Democrats supporting Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]]. Lincoln won the election, taking just 44 percent of the popular vote but winning a majority of the electoral vote due to his support in the North.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=345\u2013346}} Fearing the possibility of imminent secession, Scott advised Buchanan and Secretary of War [[John B. Floyd]] to reinforce federal forts in the South. He was initially ignored, but Scott gained new influence within the administration after Floyd was replaced by [[Joseph Holt]] in mid-December. With assistance from Holt and newly-appointed Secretary of State [[Jeremiah S. Black]], Scott convinced Buchanan to reinforce or resupply Washington, D.C., [[Fort Sumter]] (near Charleston, South Carolina), and [[Fort Pickens]] (near [[Pensacola, Florida]]). Meanwhile, several Southern states seceded, formed the [[Confederate States of America]], and chose Jefferson Davis as president.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=346\u2013350}} \n\nBecause Scott was from Virginia, Lincoln sent an envoy, Thomas S. Mather, to ask whether Scott would remain loyal to the United States and keep order during [[first inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's inauguration]]. Scott responded to Mather, \"I shall consider myself responsible for [Lincoln's] safety. If necessary, I shall plant cannon at both ends of [[Pennsylvania Avenue]], and if any of the Maryland or Virginia gentlemen who have become so threatening and troublesome show their heads or even venture to raise a finger, I shall blow them to hell.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=349\u2013352}} Scott helped ensure that Lincoln arrived in Washington safely, and ensured the security of Lincoln's inauguration, which ultimately was conducted without a major incident.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=352\u2013355}}\n\n===Lincoln administration===\n{{Further|Presidency of Abraham Lincoln}}\n[[File:Currier & Ives - The champions of the Union 1861.jpg|thumb|left|1861 Currier & Ives engraving of Winfield Scott and other Union generals, indicative of the Northern sentiment towards him and others in 1861]]\n\nBy the time Lincoln assumed office, seven states had declared their secession and had seized federal property within their bounds, but the United States retained control of the military installations at Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens.{{sfn|McPherson|2008|p=13}} Scott advised evacuating the forts on the grounds that an attempted re-supply would inflame tensions with the South, and that Confederate shore batteries made re-supply impossible.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=358\u2013361}} Lincoln rejected the advice and chose to re-supply the forts; although Scott accepted the orders, his resistance to the re-supply mission, along with poor health, undermined his status within the administration. Nonetheless, he remained a key military adviser and administrator.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=360\u2013363, 381}} On April 12, Confederate forces began an [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack]] on Fort Sumter, forcing its surrender the following day.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=366\u2013367}} On April 15, Lincoln declared that a state of rebellion existed and [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|called up tens of thousands of militiamen]].

By cutting off the eastern states of the Confederacy, Scott hoped to force the surrender of Confederate forces with a minimal loss of life on both sides. Scott's plan was leaked to the public, and was derided by most Northern newspapers, which tended to favor an immediate assault on the Confederacy.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=385\u2013387}} As Scott was too old for battlefield command, Lincoln selected General [[Irvin McDowell]], an officer whom Scott saw as unimaginative and inexperienced, to lead the main Union army in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|eastern theater]] of the war.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=387\u2013388}} Though Scott counseled that the army needed more time to train, Lincoln ordered an offensive against the Confederate capital of Richmond. Irvin McDowell led a force of 30,000 men south, where he met Confederate Army at [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. The Confederate army dealt the Union a major defeat, ending any hope of a quick end to the war.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=429\u2013435}}\n\nMcDowell took the brunt of public vituperation for the defeat at Bull Run, but Scott, who had helped plan the battle, also received criticism.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=388\u2013392}} Lincoln replaced McDowell with McClellan, and the president began meeting with McClellan without Scott in attendance.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=393\u2013394}} Frustrated with his diminished standing, Scott submitted his resignation in October 1861. Though Scott favored General [[Henry Halleck]] as his successor, Lincoln instead made McClellan the army's senior officer.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=393\u2013398}}\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Winfield Scott Seated 1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Scott in 1861]]\n\nAfter retiring, Scott traveled to Europe with his daughter, Cornelia, and her husband, H.

In [[Paris]], he helped American consul [[John Bigelow]] defuse the [[Trent Affair]], a diplomatic incident with Britain.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=400\u2013401}} On his return from Europe in December 1861, he lived alone in New York City and at [[West Point, New York]], where he wrote his memoirs and closely followed the ongoing civil war. After McClellan's defeat in the [[Seven Days Battles]], Lincoln accepted Scott's advice and appointed General Halleck as the army's senior general. In 1864, Scott sent a copy of his newly-published memoirs to Ulysses S. Grant, who had succeeded Halleck as the lead Union general. The copy that Scott sent was inscribed, \"from the oldest to the greatest general.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=402\u2013404}} Following a strategy similar to Scott's Anaconda Plan, Grant led the Union to victory, and the Confederate army [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|surrendered]] in April 1865.<ref name=\"malanga\" />\n\nScott died at the West Point on May 29, 1866.{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=220}} President [[Andrew Johnson]] ordered the flags flown at half-staff to honor Scott, and Scott's funeral was attended by many of the leading Union generals, including Grant, George G.

Steven Malanga of ''[[City Journal]]'' writes that \"Scott was one of America\u2019s greatest generals ... but he had the misfortune to serve in two conflicts\u2014the War of 1812 and the controversial Mexican-American War\u2014bracketed by the far more significant American Revolution and Civil War.\"<ref name=\"4PNmt\" /> Biographer John Eisenhower writes that Scott \"was an astonishing man\" who was the country's \"most prominent general\" between the retirement of Andrew Jackson in 1821 and the onset of the Civil War in 1861.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|p=xiii}} The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] proclaimed Scott \"the greatest living general\" after his capture of Mexico City.{{sfn|Johnson|1998|p=1}} Robert E.

The adoption of the bill in its original form proposed by the government would have prevented Agora S.A. from buying [[Polsat]], one of Polish private TV stations. This case, called the [[Rywin affair]], led to the establishment of an investigation commission by the [[Polish Parliament]].

JAK-STAT signalling is made of three major proteins: cell-surface receptors, Janus kinases (JAKs), and signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STATs).

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania. [[Mojo Rawley]] then joined Gronkowski to continue the hype.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]]. In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win and become the first two-time champions with the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] faced [[Baron Corbin|King Corbin]].

Elias then performed a roll-up on Corbin to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a triple threat tag team ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the grave, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Part 2 Kickoff pre-show will feature a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\n====Main event====\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania. [[Mojo Rawley]] then joined Gronkowski to continue the hype.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]]. In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win and become the first two-time champions with the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] faced [[Baron Corbin|King Corbin]]. In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin. Elias then performed a roll-up on Corbin to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a triple threat tag team ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the grave, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Part 2 Kickoff pre-show will feature a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\n====Main event====\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

In 2006 nobody had heard of him. In 2007 he free soloed Yosemite's Astroman and the Rostrum in a day, matching Peter Croft's legendary 1987 feat, and suddenly Honnold was pretty well-known.

He opened his first D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu strip club in the [[Lake City, Seattle|Lake City]] neighborhood of [[Seattle]] in 1985.  Many of the original clubs were converted adult theaters.  Mohney had a humble beginning as a projectionist at a drive-in movie theater in Durand, Michigan, later converted the failing enterprise into the infamous \"Durand Dirties,\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Beast Article|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-big-daddy-of-drive-in-porn-theaters}}</ref> and eventually grew the chain to about 300 adult theaters nationally.  An elusive man often referred to as the \"[[Howard Hughes]] of Porn,\" Mohney was the largest distributor of [[pornography]] from the late '60s to the mid '90s,<ref>{{cite web|title=10 News Article|url=http://www.10news.com/news/10news-exposes-san-diego-s-king-of-strip-clubs-}}</ref> grossing nearly $1 billion in the distribution business between 1970 and 1998.  That business largely concluded with Mohney serving three years in federal prison for tax-related crimes.<ref>{{cite web|title=MLive Article|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2011/06/mohneys_ties.html}}</ref>  While he was indicted dozens of times on federal charges, this was the only charge that ever resulted in a conviction.\n\nThe strip clubs are called \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Showgirls,\" \"Little Darlings,\" \"Dream Girls,\" or (by agreement with Mohney's long-time friend [[Larry Flynt]], who is not involved in the management of the clubs) \"Larry Flynt's Hustler Club\" and \"Hustler Barely Legal\". D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu also owns all of the adult theaters and clubs in [[San Francisco]], most being on Broadway; these, however, carry different names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2013/08/lusty_lady_deja_vu.php|work=SF Weekly|title=Lusty Lady Closure Creates S.F.

Further, it also operates many clubs that do not carry its typical brand names, as well as the Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe clubs typically aim for a clean and upscale atmosphere and offer fully nude or topless stage dancing as well as [[lap dance]]s. Many do not serve alcohol, to avoid stringent liquor license requirements. Several clubs have associated \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Love Boutique\" stores selling sex toys, lingerie, adult DVDs, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu merchandise, cigars, etc. There are also several stand-lone boutique locations, many of which are the largest stores in the country. The chain organizes nationwide club competitions such as \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Showgirl of the Year\", \"Showgirl Spectacular\", and \"Pole Princess.\"\n[[File:Ldlv.jpg|thumb|Little Darlings in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]]]]\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu published the adult magazine ''Showgirls'' from 1990 to 2002. Issue #1 was published in October 1990 and the magazine ran monthly until November 2002. In 2002 the magazine published four quarterly editions until it ceased publication in the fall of that year. ''Showgirls'' magazine featured nude layouts of dancers from D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Showgirls clubs, as well as adult film stars; strip club reviews; coverage of events ranging from new club openings to adult film conventions, to special events like Mardi Gras, Daytona Beach and Myrtle Beach Bike weeks and more; erotic stories; adult video reviews and adult industry legal news. Many of adult film's top performers have appeared on its pages and covers, including [[Jenna Jameson]], [[Tera Patrick]], and [[Serenity (actress)|Serenity]], who also served as the magazine's \"guest publisher\" from November 1997 to the fall of 2002.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu has sponsored many sporting events such as charity golf outings, unlimited hydroplane (speedboat) racing, off-road truck racer Gene Woods and female funny car driver Leah Pruett Leduc.  Its publicity stunts at various clubs often garner international media attention.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/las-vegas-strip-club-recruits-high-school-graduates-article-1.2250427]</ref>\n\nDancers in the clubs have the legal status of [[independent

He opened his first D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu strip club in the [[Lake City, Seattle|Lake City]] neighborhood of [[Seattle]] in 1985.  Many of the original clubs were converted adult theaters.  Mohney had a humble beginning as a projectionist at a drive-in movie theater in Durand, Michigan, later converted the failing enterprise into the infamous \"Durand Dirties,\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Beast Article|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-big-daddy-of-drive-in-porn-theaters}}</ref> and eventually grew the chain to about 300 adult theaters nationally.  An elusive man often referred to as the \"[[Howard Hughes]] of Porn,\" Mohney was the largest distributor of [[pornography]] from the late '60s to the mid '90s,<ref>{{cite web|title=10 News Article|url=http://www.10news.com/news/10news-exposes-san-diego-s-king-of-strip-clubs-}}</ref> grossing nearly $1 billion in the distribution business between 1970 and 1998.  That business largely concluded with Mohney serving three years in federal prison for tax-related crimes.<ref>{{cite web|title=MLive Article|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2011/06/mohneys_ties.html}}</ref>  While he was indicted dozens of times on federal charges, this was the only charge that ever resulted in a conviction.\n\nThe strip clubs are called \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Showgirls,\" \"Little Darlings,\" \"Dream Girls,\" or (by agreement with Mohney's long-time friend [[Larry Flynt]], who is not involved in the management of the clubs) \"Larry Flynt's Hustler Club\" and \"Hustler Barely Legal\". D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu also owns all of the adult theaters and clubs in [[San Francisco]], most being on Broadway; these, however, carry different names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2013/08/lusty_lady_deja_vu.php|work=SF Weekly|title=Lusty Lady Closure Creates S.F.

Further, it also operates many clubs that do not carry its typical brand names, as well as the Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe clubs typically aim for a clean and upscale atmosphere and offer fully nude or topless stage dancing as well as [[lap dance]]s. Many do not serve alcohol, to avoid stringent liquor license requirements. Several clubs have associated \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Love Boutique\" stores selling sex toys, lingerie, adult DVDs, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu merchandise, cigars, etc. There are also several stand-lone boutique locations, many of which are the largest stores in the country. The chain organizes nationwide club competitions such as \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Showgirl of the Year\", \"Showgirl Spectacular\", and \"Pole Princess.\"\n[[File:Ldlv.jpg|thumb|Little Darlings in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]]]]\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu published the adult magazine ''Showgirls'' from 1990 to 2002. Issue #1 was published in October 1990 and the magazine ran monthly until November 2002. In 2002 the magazine published four quarterly editions until it ceased publication in the fall of that year. ''Showgirls'' magazine featured nude layouts of dancers from D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Showgirls clubs, as well as adult film stars; strip club reviews; coverage of events ranging from new club openings to adult film conventions, to special events like Mardi Gras, Daytona Beach and Myrtle Beach Bike weeks and more; erotic stories; adult video reviews and adult industry legal news. Many of adult film's top performers have appeared on its pages and covers, including [[Jenna Jameson]], [[Tera Patrick]], and [[Serenity (actress)|Serenity]], who also served as the magazine's \"guest publisher\" from November 1997 to the fall of 2002.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu has sponsored many sporting events such as charity golf outings, unlimited hydroplane (speedboat) racing, off-road truck racer Gene Woods and female funny car driver Leah Pruett Leduc.  Its publicity stunts at various clubs often garner international media

In early 1943, they began to intern Allied civilians, and Ballard was sent to the [[Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center]] with his parents and younger sister. He spent over two years, the remainder of World War II, in the internment camp. His family lived in a small area in G block, a two-storey residence for 40 families. He attended school in the camp, the teachers being camp inmates from a number of professions. As he explained later in his autobiography ''[[Miracles of Life]]'', these experiences formed the basis of ''Empire of the Sun'', although Ballard exercised considerable artistic licence in writing the book, such as the removal of his parents from the bulk of the story.<ref name=\"lookback\">Ballard, J.G.

The characters (the protagonist, called Ballard, included) become increasingly obsessed with the violent psychosexuality of car crashes in general, and celebrity car crashes in particular. Ballard's disturbing novel was turned into a controversial\u2014and likewise disturbing\u2014cerebral [[Crash (1996 film)|film]] by [[David Cronenberg]].\n\nParticularly revered among Ballard's admirers is his short story collection ''[[Vermilion Sands]]'' (1971), set in an eponymous desert resort town inhabited by forgotten starlets, insane heirs, very eccentric artists, and the merchants and bizarre servants who provide for them. Each story features peculiarly exotic technology such as cloud-carving sculptors performing for a party of eccentric onlookers, poetry-composing computers, orchids with operatic voices and egos to match, [[phototropic]] self-painting canvases, etc. In keeping with Ballard's central themes, most notably technologically-mediated masochism, these tawdry and weird technologies service the dark and hidden desires and schemes of the human castaways who occupy Vermilion Sands, typically with psychologically grotesque and physically fatal results. In his introduction to ''Vermilion Sands'', Ballard cites this as his favourite collection.\n\nIn a similar vein, his collection ''[[Memories of the Space Age]]'' explores many varieties of individual and collective psychological fallout from\u2014and initial deep archetypal motivations for\u2014the American space exploration boom of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nCommentators such as [[Will Self]] have described much of his fiction as being concerned with 'idealised gated communities; the affluent, and the ennui of affluence [where] the virtualised world is concretised in the shape of these gated developments.' He added in these fictional settings 'there is no real pleasure to be gained; sex is commodified and devoid of feeling and there is no relationship with the natural world. These communities then implode into some form of violence.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watershed.co.uk/audio-video/john-gray-and-will-self-jg-ballard|title=John Gray and Will Self \u2013 JG Ballard|website=Watershed|accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref> Budrys, however, mocked his fiction as \"call[ing] for people who don't think ... to be the protagonist of a J.

Many of his earliest published works in the 1950s and 1960s were short stories, including influential works like ''[[Chronopolis (short_story)|Chronopolis]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fictionphile.com/20-most-influential-science-fiction-short-stories-of-the-20th-century/|title=20 Most Influential Science Fiction Short Stories of the 20th Century|website=FictionPhile.com|author=Boyd, Jason|access-date=9 February 2019|date=7 February 2019}}</ref> In an essay on Ballard, Will Wiles notes how his short stories 'have a lingering fascination with the domestic interior, with furnishing and appliances,' adding, 'it's a landscape that he distorts until it shrieks with anxiety'. He concludes that 'what Ballard saw, and what he expressed in his novels, was nothing less than the effect that the technological world, including our built environment, was having upon our minds and bodies.'<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://placesjournal.org/article/the-corner-of-lovecraft-and-ballard/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_4S3pvrY1QIVw7ftCh0sBQ_kEAAYASAAEgJj2_D_BwE|title=The Corner of Lovecraft and Ballard|first=Will|last=Wiles|date=20 June 2017|journal=Places Journal|issue=2017|accessdate=21 May 2018|doi=10.22269/170620}}</ref>\n\nBallard coined the term inverted Crusoeism. Whereas the original [[Robinson Crusoe]] became a castaway against his own will, Ballard's protagonists often choose to maroon themselves; hence inverted Crusoeism (e.g., [[Concrete Island]]). The concept provides a reason as to why people would deliberately maroon themselves on a remote island; in Ballard\u2019s work, becoming a castaway is as much a healing and empowering process as an entrapping one, enabling people to discover a more meaningful and vital existence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bicudo de Castro|first=Vicente|last2=Muskat|first2=Matthias|date=2020-04-04|title=Inverted Crusoeism: Deliberately marooning yourself on an island|url=https://doi.org/10.21463/shima.14.1.16|journal=Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.21463/shima.14.1.16|issn=1834-6057}}</ref>\n\n==Television==\nOn 13 December 1965, BBC Two screened an adaptation of the short story \"Thirteen to Centaurus\" directed by Peter Potter. The one-hour drama formed part of the first season of ''[[Out of the Unknown#Series one|Out of the Unknown]]'' and starred [[Donald Houston]] as Dr. Francis and James Hunter as Abel Granger.<ref>https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0279463/</ref> In 2003, Ballard's short story \"The Enormous Space\" (first published in the science fiction magazine ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' in 1989, subsequently printed in the collection of Ballard's short stories ''[[War Fever]]'') was adapted into an hour-long television film for the BBC entitled ''[[Home (2003 film)|Home]]'' by [[Richard Curson Smith]], who also directed it. The plot follows a middle-class man who chooses to abandon the outside world and restrict himself to his house, becoming a [[hermit]].\n\n==Influence==\nBallard is cited as an important forebear of the [[cyberpunk]] movement by [[Bruce Sterling]] in his introduction to the seminal ''[[Mirrorshades]]'' anthology. Ballard's parody of American politics, the pamphlet \"[[Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan]]\", which was subsequently included as a chapter in his experimental novel ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition]]'', was photocopied and distributed by pranksters at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]]. In the early 1970s, Bill Butler, a [[bookseller]] in [[Brighton]], was prosecuted under [[UK obscenity laws]] for selling the pamphlet.\n\nIn his 2002 book [[Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals|''Straw Dogs'']], the philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] acknowledges Ballard as a major influence on his ideas. Ballard described the book as a \"clear-eyed assessment of human nature and our almost unlimited gift for self-delusion.\"\n\nAccording to literary theorist [[Brian McHale]], ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition]]'' is a \"[[postmodern]]ist text based on science fiction [[literary topos|topoi]].\"<ref>Brian McHale, ''Postmodernist Fiction'' {{ISBN|978-0-415-04513-1}}</ref><ref>Luckhurst, Roger.

[[Terry Dowling]]'s milieu of ''Twilight Beach'' is also influenced by the stories of ''Vermilion Sands'' and other Ballard works.\n\nIn ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'', [[Jean Baudrillard]] hailed ''[[Crash (1973 novel)|Crash]]'' as the \"first great novel of the universe of simulation.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=Simulacra and Simulation | author=Baudrillard, Jean | year=1981 | page=[https://archive.org/details/simulacrasimula000baud/page/119 119] | isbn=978-0-472-06521-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/simulacrasimula000baud | url-access=registration | publisher=Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press }}</ref>\n\nBallard also had an interest in the relationship between various media.

In the late 1960s, he produced a variety of [[experimental literature|experimental]] short stories (or \"condensed novels\"), such as those collected in the controversial  ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition]]'' (1970). In the mid 1970s, Ballard published several novels, among them the highly controversial ''[[Crash (1973 novel)|Crash]]'' (1973), a story about [[symphorophilia]] and car crash [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], and ''[[High-Rise (novel)|High-Rise]]'' (1975), a depiction of a luxury [[high-rise apartment|apartment building]]'s descent into violent chaos.\n\nWhile much of Ballard's fiction would prove thematically and stylistically provocative,<ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|last1=Wilkins|first1=Alasdair|title=Remembering J.G.

In early 1943, they began to intern Allied civilians, and Ballard was sent to the [[Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center]] with his parents and younger sister. He spent over two years, the remainder of World War II, in the internment camp. His family lived in a small area in G block, a two-storey residence for 40 families. He attended school in the camp, the teachers being camp inmates from a number of professions. As he explained later in his autobiography ''[[Miracles of Life]]'', these experiences formed the basis of ''Empire of the Sun'', although Ballard exercised considerable artistic licence in writing the book, such as the removal of his parents from the bulk of the story.<ref name=\"lookback\">Ballard, J.G.

The editor of ''New Worlds'', [[John Carnell|Edward J.

Ballard's [[avant-garde]] inclinations did not sit comfortably in the science fiction mainstream of that time, which held attitudes he considered [[philistinism|philistine]]. Briefly attending the 1957 [[Science Fiction Convention]] in London, Ballard left disillusioned and demoralised<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jgballard.ca/media/1969_feb_speculation_magazine.html|title=JG Ballard Interviewed by Jannick Storm|website=Jgballard.ca}}</ref> and did not write another story for a year.

He wrote his first novel, ''[[The Wind from Nowhere]]'', over a two-week holiday simply to gain a foothold as a professional writer, not intending it as a \"serious novel\"; in books published later, it is omitted from the list of his works. When it was successfully published in January 1962, he resigned from his job at ''Chemistry and Industry'', and from then on supported himself and his family as a writer.\n\nLater that year his second novel, ''[[The Drowned World]]'', was published, establishing Ballard as a notable figure in the fledgling [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]] movement of science fiction. Collections of his stories started getting published, and he began a period of great literary productivity, while pushing to expand the scope of acceptable material for science fiction with such stories as \"[[The Terminal Beach]]\".\n\nIn 1964 Ballard's wife Mary died suddenly of pneumonia, leaving him to raise their three children\u2014James, Fay and [[Bea Ballard]]\u2014by himself.<ref>The autobiographical novel ''[[The Kindness of Women]]'' gives a different, fictionalised account of her death.</ref> Ballard never remarried; however, a few years later his friend and fellow author [[Michael Moorcock]] introduced him to Claire Walsh, who became his partner for the rest of his life (he died at her London residence),<ref>\"Author J.

The characters (the protagonist, called Ballard, included) become increasingly obsessed with the violent psychosexuality of car crashes in general, and celebrity car crashes in particular. Ballard's disturbing novel was turned into a controversial\u2014and likewise disturbing\u2014cerebral [[Crash (1996 film)|film]] by [[David Cronenberg]].\n\nParticularly revered among Ballard's admirers is his short story collection ''[[Vermilion Sands]]'' (1971), set in an eponymous desert resort town inhabited by forgotten starlets, insane heirs, very eccentric artists, and the merchants and bizarre servants who provide for them. Each story features peculiarly exotic technology such as cloud-carving sculptors performing for a party of eccentric onlookers, poetry-composing computers, orchids with operatic voices and egos to match, [[phototropic]] self-painting canvases, etc. In keeping with Ballard's central themes, most notably technologically-mediated masochism, these tawdry and weird technologies service the dark and hidden desires and schemes of the human castaways who occupy Vermilion Sands, typically with psychologically grotesque and physically fatal results. In his introduction to ''Vermilion Sands'', Ballard cites this as his favourite collection.\n\nIn a similar vein, his collection ''[[Memories of the Space Age]]'' explores many varieties of individual and collective psychological fallout from\u2014and initial deep archetypal motivations for\u2014the American space exploration boom of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nCommentators such as [[Will Self]] have described much of his fiction as being concerned with 'idealised gated communities; the affluent, and the ennui of affluence [where] the virtualised world is concretised in the shape of these gated developments.' He added in these fictional settings 'there is no real pleasure to be gained; sex is commodified and devoid of feeling and there is no relationship with the natural world. These communities then implode into some form of violence.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watershed.co.uk/audio-video/john-gray-and-will-self-jg-ballard|title=John Gray and Will Self \u2013 JG Ballard|website=Watershed|accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref> Budrys, however, mocked his fiction as \"call[ing] for people who don't think ... to be the protagonist of a J.

Many of his earliest published works in the 1950s and 1960s were short stories, including influential works like ''[[Chronopolis (short_story)|Chronopolis]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fictionphile.com/20-most-influential-science-fiction-short-stories-of-the-20th-century/|title=20 Most Influential Science Fiction Short Stories of the 20th Century|website=FictionPhile.com|author=Boyd, Jason|access-date=9 February 2019|date=7 February 2019}}</ref> In an essay on Ballard, Will Wiles notes how his short stories 'have a lingering fascination with the domestic interior, with furnishing and appliances,' adding, 'it's a landscape that he distorts until it shrieks with anxiety'. He concludes that 'what Ballard saw, and what he expressed in his novels, was nothing less than the effect that the technological world, including our built environment, was having upon our minds and bodies.'<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://placesjournal.org/article/the-corner-of-lovecraft-and-ballard/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_4S3pvrY1QIVw7ftCh0sBQ_kEAAYASAAEgJj2_D_BwE|title=The Corner of Lovecraft and Ballard|first=Will|last=Wiles|date=20 June 2017|journal=Places Journal|issue=2017|accessdate=21 May 2018|doi=10.22269/170620}}</ref>\n\n==Television==\nOn 13 December 1965, BBC Two screened an adaptation of the short story \"Thirteen to Centaurus\" directed by Peter Potter. The one-hour drama formed part of the first season of ''[[Out of the Unknown#Series one|Out of the Unknown]]'' and starred [[Donald Houston]] as Dr. Francis and James Hunter as Abel Granger.<ref>https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0279463/</ref> In 2003, Ballard's short story \"The Enormous Space\" (first published in the science fiction magazine ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' in 1989, subsequently printed in the collection of Ballard's short stories ''[[War Fever]]'') was adapted into an hour-long television film for the BBC entitled ''[[Home (2003 film)|Home]]'' by [[Richard Curson Smith]], who also directed it. The plot follows a middle-class man who chooses to abandon the outside world and restrict himself to his house, becoming a [[hermit]].\n\n==Influence==\nBallard is cited as an important forebear of the [[cyberpunk]] movement by [[Bruce Sterling]] in his introduction to the seminal ''[[Mirrorshades]]'' anthology. Ballard's parody of American politics, the pamphlet \"[[Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan]]\", which was subsequently included as a chapter in his experimental novel ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition]]'', was photocopied and distributed by pranksters at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]]. In the early 1970s, Bill Butler, a [[bookseller]] in [[Brighton]], was prosecuted under [[UK obscenity laws]] for selling the pamphlet.\n\nIn his 2002 book [[Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals|''Straw Dogs'']], the philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] acknowledges Ballard as a major influence on his ideas. Ballard described the book as a \"clear-eyed assessment of human nature and our almost unlimited gift for self-delusion.\"\n\nAccording to literary theorist [[Brian McHale]], ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition]]'' is a \"[[postmodern]]ist text based on science fiction [[literary topos|topoi]].\"<ref>Brian McHale, ''Postmodernist Fiction'' {{ISBN|978-0-415-04513-1}}</ref><ref>Luckhurst, Roger.

[[Terry Dowling]]'s milieu of ''Twilight Beach'' is also influenced by the stories of ''Vermilion Sands'' and other Ballard works.\n\nIn ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'', [[Jean Baudrillard]] hailed ''[[Crash (1973 novel)|Crash]]'' as the \"first great novel of the universe of simulation.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=Simulacra and Simulation | author=Baudrillard, Jean | year=1981 | page=[https://archive.org/details/simulacrasimula000baud/page/119 119] | isbn=978-0-472-06521-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/simulacrasimula000baud | url-access=registration | publisher=Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press }}</ref>\n\nBallard also had an interest in the relationship between various media.
