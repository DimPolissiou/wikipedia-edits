Pe\u00f1a is known for his warm voice, songwriting craftsmanship and his audiovisual conceptual shows for which he writes the music and directs and edits the visuals himself.\nAfter graduating from [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College of Music in Boston]], Pe\u00f1a rose to fame in the Latin market with the release of his debut album \"El Mundo al Rev\u00e9s\" in 2000 and the subsequent tour which saw him perform festivals in Argentina, Venezuela, Panama and the United States.\nPe\u00f1a's albums have garnered critical acclaim and are considered by many to be some of the best rock music to come out in Spanish.<ref>http://www.chron.com/entertainment/music/article/All-you-need-is-love-just-ask-rocker-Ignacio-1965240.php</ref>\nIn 2010 Pe\u00f1a debuted his most ambitious project to date. An educational multimedia concert designed for schools entitled \"The Great Planet Earth Debate\". Pe\u00f1a has been invited to speak at educational conferences and universities in the United States and his native Puerto Rico and was awarded an honorary degree from the Sistema Universitario Ana G. M\u00e9ndez in Puerto Rico for his contribution to education.<ref>http://www.miprv.com/ip-se-presenta-en-el-8vo-congreso-educativo-del-sistema-universitario-ana-g-mendez/</ref> From 2015 through 2017 he has been nominated for five NATAS [[Suncoast Chapter]] Emmy Awards, winning two for the [[WIPR-TV]] Short Subject documentaries \"Por Qu\u00e9 Conmemoramos\" (Why We Commemorate) and \"Soy De Una Raza Pura\" (I Am From A Pure Race) respectively.\n\n== Early life ==\nIgnacio Pe\u00f1a was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico to parents Ignacio Pe\u00f1a Feliciano and Miriam Vidal Otani. His father was a salesman and his mother a secretary. His mother is of Japanese descent. His grandfather was a soldier in the US Army during the Second World War stationed in Okinawa. There he met Eiko Otani whom he would marry and bring stateside to begin a family. \nIgnacio and his two younger sisters grew up in different parts of San Juan, PR.\nHe attended and graduated from Wesleyan Academy in Guaynabo, PR.\nAfter his parents' divorce at the age of 14 Pe\u00f1a got his first guitar and spent the rest of his youth between school and weekends with his bandmates, writing songs and rehearsing where he began to hone his craft as a songwriter. \nAfter completing his bachelor's degree in music production and engineering at Boston's Berklee College of Music, he began writing, singing and producing jingles until the opportunity to make his first record arrived. During this time, he kept writing and recording new songs while pitching them to labels and other music business outlets. After many attempts to land a recording deal, Ignacio met his would-be manager in Criteria Studios in Miami Florida. Now with management, Ignacio went into the studio with producer Pablo Manavello to record a three-song demo. The demo for \"75% de Agua\" was picked up by local rock radio station Alfa Rock 105.7 FM and the song generated an unprecedented number of requests. This resulted in a recording contract with Universal Music Latino and the subsequent production of his first album.\n\n== El Mundo al Rev\u00e9s ==\n''(The World Upside Down)''\n[[File:Ignacio Pena-Oasis Caracas 2001.jpg|thumb|Ignacio Pe\u00f1a opening for Oasis, during the Caracas Pop Fest 2001 @ Estadio De La Universidad Nacional, Caracas, Venezuela.]]\nProduced by [[Pablo Manavello]], El Mundo Al Rev\u00e9s was recorded in Miami and Nashville and released by Universal Music Latino on October 10, 2000. The production was also overseen by music engineer, Iker Gastaminza ([[Ricardo Montaner]], T\u00e9mpano) and mixing engineer, Bob St. John ([[Collective Soul]], [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Duran Duran]]). \nEl Mundo al Rev\u00e9s has 11 songs with lyrics based on personal experiences and reflections. The songs are mostly related to common people getting into different habits, starting with \"En Espa\u00f1ol\", a funny story about the use of that reference to promote products oriented to the Latin market in the U.S. A romantic \"75% de Agua,\" is followed by 1960s-style ballad, \"Un Retrato de la Luna\" and \"Puertos,\" written by Pe\u00f1a while waiting for a departure flight from the Miami International Airport.

The video for it was directed by Ignacio himself, and was done in the \"Phono/Gr\u00e1phico\" style, in which a collage of footage from an array of news and pop culture sources and personally edited by the artist, is constantly running synchronized with the music that's being played live. Images of explosions, aliens, military marches and political figures are part of the video that also includes a scene re-enactment of the sci-fi classic film \"[[A Clockwork Orange (Film)|A Clockwork Orange]]\", directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]] who Pe\u00f1a claims as a musical influence.\nProduced by Ignacio Pe\u00f1a, Iker Gastaminza and guitarist Tony Rijos, \"Anormal\" also includes a guest appearance by [[Gustavo Laureano]], lead singer of [[La Secta AllStar]], in \"Velocidad de escape\" and it's English version, \"Any year, any room, any highway\". \nAnormal was recorded in Puerto Rico and mixed in Miami. The recording process began in an empty office the band rented in Santurce where the band set up a makeshift studio and began recording. The basic tracks were recorded at Digitech Studios in San Juan and the album was then mixed by Iker Gastaminza in Miami.\n\nLike his debut album, Anormal also garnered rave reviews from the critics:\n\n''\"El cantautor boricua Ignacio Pe\u00f1a nos presenta su segundo material discogr\u00e1fico titulado Anormal, y verdaderamente es fuera de lo normal, es decir, es de las pocas cosas hechas en espa\u00f1ol que podemos llamarle sin temor a equivocarnos, como aut\u00e9ntico rock. Actualizado a nuestro cron\u00f3metro real. Algo distinto dentro del infestado mercado del pop y el rock insustancial.\"''\nEl Sol de Texas\n\n''\"Muchas veces escapistas y otras veces contestatario, \"Anormal nos muestra a un artista en medio de un interesante proceso evolutivo.

Lleva el tipo de energia adictiva que siempre hemos apreciado como el pulso que define el rock y del que muchas bandas de rock en espa\u00f1ol han carecido lamentablemente. \"\nBuena Vida\n\n== Bletzung ==\nIn 2005 Pe\u00f1a's song \"Only End Up Lonely\" won the iTunes Jukebox Jury contest at the South By Southwest Music Conference in Austin Texas. Pe\u00f1a relocated to Austin and created the band Bletzung.<ref>http://rumbacaracas.com/noticias/2005/10/06/ignacio-pena-llega-con-bletzung/</ref> The band's self-titled debut album was released independently (Hearsay Ltd.) in late 2006. The album was a version of Pe\u00f1a's second album \"Anormal\" completely in English. The band released a video for the first single called \"Only End Up Lonely\". Under the auspice of Bletzung, Pe\u00f1a toured the southern states while beginning to work on material for their second album. Bletzung disbanded in 2008.\n\n== Songs For The Fall Of An Empire ==\nIn May 2009, Pe\u00f1a became the first Latin artist to release an application for the iPhone,<ref>http://www.pulsorock.com/noticias/ignacio-pena-primer-artista-latino-en-lanzar-aplicacion-para-el-iphone/</ref> and in August 7, 2009 released a video and Digital 45 with demos of two new songs, Defeat and Something Was Bound To Happen, which he announced would be part of his next conceptual piece entitled \"Songs for the Fall of an Empire\". The video included footage from the Iraq war and the subsequent economic crash of 2008.\nThe project was put on indefinite hiatus and Pe\u00f1a decided to concentrate on the educational concert experience \"El Gran Debate del Planeta Tierra\".\n\n[[File:El Gran Debate Corpus Christi 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Ignacio Pe\u00f1a performing The Great Planet Earth Debate: Energy during the 2012 Science Teachers Association Convention, in Corpus Christi, TX.]]\n\n== El Gran Debate Del Planeta Tierra ==\n''(The Great Planet Earth Debate)''\n \nIn 2006, Pe\u00f1a was invited to perform at Owen Goodnight Middle School in San Marcos, Texas to close a lecture on climate change. It was there that he was inspired to use his audiovisual conceptual abilities to create an educational concert that would entice and interest students in history, science, math and technology. 4 years later, in 2010, Pe\u00f1a unveiled \"El Gran Debate del Planeta Tierra: Energ\u00eda\" (The Great Planet Earth Debate: Energy), a multimedia educational concert which uses a music video aesthetic and speed to help students make emotional connections with the subject matters they are taught in school. \nThe album that accompanied the show included 5 new recordings. 2 new songs: \"Memoria Phonogr\u00e1fica\" and \"Remind Me when we Get There\". A new version of \"Mientras Espero el fin del Mundo\" which originally appeared on his debut album and a new version of \"Falta 1 Persona\" from his second album. The record also included Pe\u00f1a's first ever instrumental \"Solar\".\nSubsequently, Pe\u00f1a has been invited as a speaker and performer to various universities, foundations and educational conferences, to speak about the use of multimedia in education.<ref>http://www.primerahora.com/ignaciopenalanzadebaterockeroporelplaneta-391916.html</ref>  Also, to talk about the principles of storytelling, as to how they apply to music and art conceptualization in general.\n\n== Por Qu\u00e9 Conmemoramos ==\n''(Why We Commemorate)''\nright|<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ignacio Pena-2015 Emmy.jpg|thumb|right|Pe\u00f1a wins 2015 NATAS Suncoast Chapter Emmy Award for Best Informational/Instructional Short.]] -->\n\nIn 2014 Pe\u00f1a was commissioned by the Puerto Rico Corporation for Public Broadcasting (WIPR-TV, Channel 6) to create a series of nine documentary shorts called \"Por Qu\u00e9 Conmemoramos\".

His father was a salesman and his mother a secretary. His mother is of Japanese descent. His grandfather was a soldier in the US Army during the Second World War stationed in Okinawa. There he met Eiko Otani whom he would marry and bring stateside to begin a family. \nIgnacio and his two younger sisters grew up in different parts of San Juan, PR.\nHe attended and graduated from Wesleyan Academy in Guaynabo, PR.\nAfter his parents' divorce at the age of 14 Pe\u00f1a got his first guitar and spent the rest of his youth between school and weekends with his bandmates, writing songs and rehearsing where he began to hone his craft as a songwriter. \nAfter completing his bachelor's degree in music production and engineering at Boston's Berklee College of Music, he began writing, singing and producing jingles until the opportunity to make his first record arrived. During this time, he kept writing and recording new songs while pitching them to labels and other music business outlets. After many attempts to land a recording deal, Ignacio met his would-be manager in Criteria Studios in Miami Florida. Now with management, Ignacio went into the studio with producer Pablo Manavello to record a three-song demo. The demo for \"75% de Agua\" was picked up by local rock radio station Alfa Rock 105.7 FM and the song generated an unprecedented number of requests. This resulted in a recording contract with Universal Music Latino and the subsequent production of his first album.\n\n== El Mundo al Rev\u00e9s ==\n''(The World Upside Down)''\n[[File:Ignacio Pena-Oasis Caracas 2001.jpg|thumb|Ignacio Pe\u00f1a opening for Oasis, during the Caracas Pop Fest 2001 @ Estadio De La Universidad Nacional, Caracas, Venezuela.]]\nProduced by [[Pablo Manavello]], El Mundo Al Rev\u00e9s was recorded in Miami and Nashville and released by Universal Music Latino on October 10, 2000. The production was also overseen by music engineer, Iker Gastaminza ([[Ricardo Montaner]], T\u00e9mpano) and mixing engineer, Bob St. John ([[Collective Soul]], [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Duran Duran]]). \nEl Mundo al Rev\u00e9s has 11 songs with lyrics based on personal experiences and reflections. The songs are mostly related to common people getting into different habits, starting with \"En Espa\u00f1ol\", a funny story about the use of that reference to promote products oriented to the Latin market in the U.S. A romantic \"75% de Agua,\" is followed by 1960s-style ballad, \"Un Retrato de la Luna\" and \"Puertos,\" written by Pe\u00f1a while waiting for a departure flight from the Miami International Airport. Inspired by fortune tellers promoting their \"gift\" on TV, \"El Fongo Estelar\" anticipates \"El Mundo Al Rev\u00e9s\" main title track. After love related \"Melissa\" and \"Por Si Acaso\", the album comes to an end with the intimate and relaxed \"Du\u00e9rmete\".\n\nThe album received favorable reviews.\n\n''\"Singer/songwriter Ignacio Pe\u00f1a's first outing, on Universal, is a lovely collection of pop tracks that evoke everything from Eric Clapton to Oasis.

For Phono/Gr\u00e1phico, Pe\u00f1a compiled and edited all the visuals which came together to offer viewers a glimpse of a post 9/11 world through the eyes and ears of the artist.\nPhono/Gr\u00e1phico was mainly created using Mac's iMovie program.\n\n== Anormal ==\n''(Abnormal)'' \n[[File:Ignacio Pe\u00f1a Justas, Ponce, PR 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Ignacio Pe\u00f1a performs during Las Justas in Ponce, PR in 2004.]]\nFour years after the release of his debut album, Pe\u00f1a released his sophomore album \"Anormal\" (Hearsay Ltd.)<ref>http://www.pulsorock.com/articulos/anormal-nueva-propuesta-musical-de-ignacio-pena/</ref> This second album, which was released in Puerto Rico on March 31, 2004, marked a drastic change in Ignacio's rock performance style, after the launch of 2000's \"El Mundo Al Rev\u00e9s\", a singer/songwriter effort, which was more pop oriented and completely in Spanish. \nThe record demonstrated Ignacio's evolution as an artist and songwriter plus the musical cohesiveness between his fellow band members that only comes from touring and playing together.\nConceived during the aftermath of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, \"Anormal\" (Abnormal) is a conceptual proposal that entwines 12 songs that narrate a process of existential conflicts. \"Hey t\u00fa (imb\u00e9cil)\" (Hey you (imbecile)), was the album's first single. The video for it was directed by Ignacio himself, and was done in the \"Phono/Gr\u00e1phico\" style, in which a collage of footage from an array of news and pop culture sources and personally edited by the artist, is constantly running synchronized with the music that's being played live. Images of explosions, aliens, military marches and political figures are part of the video that also includes a scene re-enactment of the sci-fi classic film \"[[A Clockwork Orange (Film)|A Clockwork Orange]]\", directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]] who Pe\u00f1a claims as a musical influence.\nProduced by Ignacio Pe\u00f1a, Iker Gastaminza and guitarist Tony Rijos, \"Anormal\" also includes a guest appearance by [[Gustavo Laureano]], lead singer of [[La Secta AllStar]], in \"Velocidad de escape\" and it's English version, \"Any year, any room, any highway\". \nAnormal was recorded in Puerto Rico and mixed in Miami. The recording process began in an empty office the band rented in Santurce where the band set up a makeshift studio and began recording. The basic tracks were recorded at Digitech Studios in San Juan and the album was then mixed by Iker Gastaminza in Miami.\n\nLike his debut album, Anormal also garnered rave reviews from the critics:\n\n''\"El cantautor boricua Ignacio Pe\u00f1a nos presenta su segundo material discogr\u00e1fico titulado Anormal, y verdaderamente es fuera de lo normal, es decir, es de las pocas cosas hechas en espa\u00f1ol que podemos llamarle sin temor a equivocarnos, como aut\u00e9ntico rock. Actualizado a nuestro cron\u00f3metro real. Algo distinto dentro del infestado mercado del pop y el rock insustancial.\"''\nEl Sol de Texas\n\n''\"Muchas veces escapistas y otras veces contestatario, \"Anormal nos muestra a un artista en medio de un interesante proceso evolutivo. Una de las mejores piezas emanadas del nuevo rock latino alternativo.''\"<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/album/el-mundo-al-rev\u00e9s-mw0000100917</ref>\nDrago Bonacich, Allmusic.com\n\n\"Anormal es un disco que no suelta ni vacila. Lleva el tipo de energia adictiva que siempre hemos apreciado como el pulso que define el rock y del que muchas bandas de rock en espa\u00f1ol han carecido lamentablemente. \"\nBuena Vida\n\n== Bletzung ==\nIn 2005 Pe\u00f1a's song \"Only End Up Lonely\" won the iTunes Jukebox Jury contest at the South By Southwest Music Conference in Austin Texas. Pe\u00f1a relocated to Austin and created the band Bletzung.<ref>http://rumbacaracas.com/noticias/2005/10/06/ignacio-pena-llega-con-bletzung/</ref> The band's self-titled debut album was released independently (Hearsay Ltd.) in late 2006. The album was a version of Pe\u00f1a's second album \"Anormal\" completely in English. The band released a video for the first single called \"Only End Up Lonely\". Under the auspice of Bletzung, Pe\u00f1a toured the southern states while beginning to work on material for their second album. Bletzung disbanded in 2008.\n\n== Songs For The Fall Of An Empire ==\nIn May 2009, Pe\u00f1a became the first Latin artist to release an application for the iPhone,<ref>http://www.pulsorock.com/noticias/ignacio-pena-primer-artista-latino-en-lanzar-aplicacion-para-el-iphone/</ref> and in August 7, 2009 released a video and Digital 45 with demos of two new songs, Defeat and Something Was Bound To Happen, which he announced would be part of his next conceptual piece entitled \"Songs for the Fall of an Empire\". The video included footage from the Iraq war and the subsequent economic crash of 2008.\nThe project was put on indefinite hiatus and Pe\u00f1a decided to concentrate on the educational concert experience \"El Gran Debate del Planeta Tierra\".\n\n[[File:El Gran Debate Corpus Christi 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Ignacio Pe\u00f1a performing The Great Planet Earth Debate: Energy during the 2012 Science Teachers Association Convention, in Corpus Christi, TX.]]\n\n== El Gran Debate Del Planeta Tierra ==\n''(The Great Planet Earth Debate)''\n \nIn 2006, Pe\u00f1a was invited to perform at Owen Goodnight Middle School in San Marcos, Texas to close a lecture on climate change. It was there that he was inspired to use his audiovisual conceptual abilities to create an educational concert that would entice and interest students in history, science, math and technology. 4 years later, in 2010, Pe\u00f1a unveiled \"El Gran Debate del Planeta Tierra: Energ\u00eda\" (The Great Planet Earth Debate: Energy), a multimedia educational concert which uses a music video aesthetic and speed to help students make emotional connections with the subject matters they are taught in school. \nThe album that accompanied the show included 5 new recordings. 2 new songs: \"Memoria Phonogr\u00e1fica\" and \"Remind Me when we Get There\". A new version of \"Mientras Espero el fin del Mundo\" which originally appeared on his debut album and a new version of \"Falta 1 Persona\" from his second album. The record also included Pe\u00f1a's first ever instrumental \"Solar\".\nSubsequently, Pe\u00f1a has been invited as a speaker and performer to various universities, foundations and educational conferences, to speak about the use of multimedia in education.<ref>http://www.primerahora.com/ignaciopenalanzadebaterockeroporelplaneta-391916.html</ref>  Also, to talk about the principles of storytelling, as to how they apply to music and art conceptualization in general.\n\n== Por Qu\u00e9 Conmemoramos ==\n''(Why We Commemorate)''\nright|<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ignacio Pena-2015 Emmy.jpg|thumb|right|Pe\u00f1a wins 2015 NATAS Suncoast Chapter Emmy Award for Best Informational/Instructional Short.]] -->\n\nIn 2014 Pe\u00f1a was commissioned by the Puerto Rico Corporation for Public Broadcasting (WIPR-TV, Channel 6) to create a series of nine documentary shorts called \"Por Qu\u00e9 Conmemoramos\". These three minute videos tell the stories behind Puerto Rican holidays. All nine shorts were created in Spanish,<ref>https://vimeo.com/album/3185816</ref> and four of them were translated into English.<ref>https://vimeo.com/album/3543854</ref>  The introduction and closing for these features the song \"T\u00edrale\" (Take a shot) from Puerto Rican metal band \"[[Puya (band)|Puya]]\" and Pe\u00f1a's own \"Remind Me When We Get There\" was used as incidental music. For this series, Pe\u00f1a was nominated for two 2015 NATAS Suncoast Chapter Emmy awards, Best Editor and Best Informational/Instructional Short for which he won.\n\nFeatured Holidays were:\n\n* D\u00eda De La Constituci\u00f3n De Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico's Constitution Day)\n* D\u00eda De La Abolici\u00f3n De La Esclavitud (Slave Emancipation Day)\n* D\u00eda Del Trabajo (Labor Day)\n* D\u00eda De La Bandera (Flag Day)\n* D\u00eda De La Recordaci\u00f3n (Memorial Day)\n* D\u00eda De Los Presidentes Y Pr\u00f3ceres Puertorique\u00f1os (Presidents and National Heroes Day)\n* D\u00eda De El Grito De Lares (Lares' Uprising Day)\n* D\u00eda De La Independencia de Estados Unidos (USA Independence Day)\n* D\u00eda De San Juan (San Juan Day)\n\nIn 2016 he was nominated for a third Emmy as editor for the \"D\u00eda De El Grito De Lares\" episode in this series.\n\n== Soy De Una Raza Pura ==\n''(I Am From A Pure Race)''\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ignacio Pe\u00f1a 2017 Emmy.jpg|thumb|right|Pe\u00f1a wins second NATAS Suncoast Chapter Emmy Award for Best Informational/Instructional Short in 2017.]] -->\n\nAfter the success of the \"Por Qu\u00e9 Conmemoramos\" series, WIPR-TV commissioned Pe\u00f1a to create a new series of shorts, that aimed to tell the stories of important, and some lesser known, black figures in Puerto Rican history, debuting on March 2016.  \"Soy De Una Raza Pura\",<ref>https://vimeo.com/album/3784675</ref> takes its name from a popular song by [[Lucecita Ben\u00edtez]], written by [[Tony Croatto]] and David Ort\u00edz Angler\u00f3, and it's featured both on the introduction and ending of these episodes.  \"T\u00edrale\" by Puerto Rican rock band \"[https://www.buscabulla.com/ Buscabulla]\" is featured as incidental music.
