As a Supervisor in San Francisco, she authored and passed Ordinance Number 060107 to \"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article\u2026if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.\"  This was the first ordinance of its time. The goal of the ordinance was to place pressure on the California State Legislature and national government to follow suit.  As a California State Legislator, she continued her work, passing A.B. 1108, which also banned toxic chemicals from children's toys.  Her language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Hepatitis B awareness and prevention===\nAt the age of 22, Fiona Ma learned that she had Hepatitis B (HBV), a virus that causes 80 percent of all liver cancer if left untreated and often shows no symptoms until it is almost too late.  Almost 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half are Asian Pacific Islander Americans.  An estimated one in ten are chronically infected with the virus.  As a result of its high Asian population, San Francisco has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men in California.\n  \nFiona Ma assumed a leading role in the fight against Hepatitis B, serving as a spokesperson for San Francisco Hep B Free - the largest and most intensive healthcare campaign for APIs in the United States.  It is widely considered a model for the nation in eliminating HBV in a regional area.\n\nIn 2008, Fiona Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158, which would have required the Department of Health Care Services to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic Hepatitis B.  She also introduced a resolution declaring May 2009 as Hepatitis B Awareness Month in California.\n\n===High-speed rail===\nAssemblymember Ma is a longtime advocate of transportation solutions, the Joint author of Proposition 1-A and the convener of the High Speed Rail Caucus. Ma was one of the leading advocates of high-speed trains in California and one of its main campaigners traveling statewide promoting its environmental benefits and job creating effects . The proposition ultimately was approved by the voters in November 2008 maintaining critical funding after the Governor Schwarzenegger had proposed a major defunding of high-speed rail.\n\n===Incarcerated survivors of domestic violence===\nAs the chair of the Domestic Violence Select Committee, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma has worked diligently to shed light on the challenges that incarcerated victims of domestic violence experience while in the judicial system.  A California prison study found that 93% of the women who had killed their significant others had been battered; 67% of these women attempted to protect themselves or their children. She has attended parole hearings to ensure survivors who have spent decades behind bars receive suitability; and also spearheaded the first legislation of its kind in the entire country, when Governor Brown signed [http://legislation.sinbysilence.com/ \"The Sin by Silence Bills\"], inspired by the documentary [[Sin by Silence]], into law on September 30, 2012 that ensures the path to freedom for over 7,000 domestic violence survivors currently serving time in California prisons. AB 593 allows victims of domestic violence whose expert testimony was limited at their trial court proceedings to re-file for a writ of habeas corpus to allow this expert testimony to weigh in on their defense and it will also give victims more time to receive legal representation by deleting the sunset date currently in statute.  AB 1593 gives victims who have suffered Intimate Partner Battering (IPB) a chance to present their evidence in an effective way during the parole process by giving great weight to any information or evidence that proves the prisoner experienced IPB and its effects at the time the crime was committed. This bill will also require that the information delivered to the Legislature relating to IPB, will be in specific and detailed reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Non-profit and community involvement===\nMa serves on the Board of Directors, and was a past Treasurer, for Curry Without Worry, a non-profit based in San Francisco. Since 2006, this organization has fed over 45,000 people.[8] She is also currently on the Board of Directors of CA Women Lead and Asian Inc.  She is the Honorary Chair and spokesperson of the San Francisco Hep B Free Campaign; Honorary California Chair of the New Leaders Council, Board Advisory Committee for the James L. Brady Riding Program for Children with Disabilities, Board Advisory Committee for Family Connections, President of Board of Asian American Donor Program, and Board Advisory Committee of the SF Ethnic Dance Festival.\n\n===State and national outreach===\nAssemblymember Ma has been active in promoting trade and fostering relationships between California and the Nation.  As an Executive Board Member of the National Conference of State Legislators, she worked to keep California competitive with other states.  She also served as the Western Region Director of Women in Government, the State Legislative Leaders Council, and was an Executive Board Member of the California Democratic Party.\n\n===International outreach===\nSince 1998, Ma has been on the forefront in promoting trade and commerce between California and Asia, leading legislative delegations to China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. She has been a frequent speaker in the region promoting US interests in high-speed rail, agriculture, entertainment and education.  She has also taken the lead to welcome foreign dignitaries visiting California in her elected capacities.\n \nShe has participated in various California trade delegations and has met with legislative leaders and decision-makers in India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, France, Israel, Ireland and Iceland.\n\n==Legislative Session 2011\u201312==\nIn the 2011-2012 legislative session, Assemblywoman Ma had 25 bills chaptered into law, 4 Assembly Concurrent Resolutions and 1 Assembly Joint Resolution signed by Governor Brown.\n\nA few of the Assemblywoman's bills are as follows:\n\n'''AB 74 Public event action plans and cooperative management'''<br> \nIn response to substance abuse-related deaths, injuries and arrests involving electronic-music shows at San Francisco's Cow Palace and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Assembly voted 75-0 to support AB 74. The bill establishes safety guidelines for electronic-music concerts when they are held on publicly owned properties such as the Cow Palace, which is located in Ma's 12th Assembly District. \"California needs to better monitor and control events occurring on state properties,\" Ma said in a news release. \"AB 74 is intended to prevent the loss of life and make safety a top priority at events on state property.\" The law requires the state agency intending to host any rave expected to draw 10,000 people or more to assess potential problems, the need for law enforcement and medical personnel, and other related issues. If the agency concludes there's a strong possibility for loss of life or harm to participants, the show's promoter would be required to prepare a plan to provide an adequate law-enforcement presence, control drug use and potentially prohibit minors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county/ci_18151243?nclick_check=1 |title=Ma's bill targeting raves passes Assembly - San Jose Mercury News |publisher=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>\n\n'''AB 183 (2011) Alcoholic beverage licenses: self-service checkout'''<br/>\nThis bill prohibits off-sale licensees from selling alcoholic beverages using a customer-operated checkout stand located on the licensee's physical premises.

Approximately 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half of them are Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Americans.  It is estimated that 1 in 10 APIs are chronically infected with HBV.  Like most APIs, Ma contracted HBV from her mother at birth via perinatal exposure. San Francisco has the highest rate of liver cancer in the nation because of its high API population, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men living in California. Ma works to remove the stigma of the disease in the Asian community by actively speaking out about the importance of testing and vaccination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |title=Fighting to eliminate hepatitis |author=Mike Aldax |date=May 13, 2010 |work=The San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=2010-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524153519/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |archivedate=2010-05-24 }}</ref> In 2008, Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158 which requires the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic hepatitis B.

As a Supervisor in San Francisco, she authored and passed Ordinance Number 060107 to \"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article\u2026if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.\"  This was the first ordinance of its time. The goal of the ordinance was to place pressure on the California State Legislature and national government to follow suit.  As a California State Legislator, she continued her work, passing A.B. 1108, which also banned toxic chemicals from children's toys.  Her language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Hepatitis B awareness and prevention===\nAt the age of 22, Fiona Ma learned that she had Hepatitis B (HBV), a virus that causes 80 percent of all liver cancer if left untreated and often shows no symptoms until it is almost too late.  Almost 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half are Asian Pacific Islander Americans.  An estimated one in ten are chronically infected with the virus.  As a result of its high Asian population, San Francisco has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men in California.\n  \nFiona Ma assumed a leading role in the fight against Hepatitis B, serving as a spokesperson for San Francisco Hep B Free - the largest and most intensive healthcare campaign for APIs in the United States.  It is widely considered a model for the nation in eliminating HBV in a regional area.\n\nIn 2008, Fiona Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158, which would have required the Department of Health Care Services to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic Hepatitis B.  She also introduced a resolution declaring May 2009 as Hepatitis B Awareness Month in California.\n\n===High-speed rail===\nAssemblymember Ma is a longtime advocate of transportation solutions, the Joint author of Proposition 1-A and the convener of the High Speed Rail Caucus. Ma was one of the leading advocates of high-speed trains in California and one of its main campaigners traveling statewide promoting its environmental benefits and job creating effects . The proposition ultimately was approved by the voters in November 2008 maintaining critical funding after the Governor Schwarzenegger had proposed a major defunding of high-speed rail.\n\n===Incarcerated survivors of domestic violence===\nAs the chair of the Domestic Violence Select Committee, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma has worked diligently to shed light on the challenges that incarcerated victims of domestic violence experience while in the judicial system.  A California prison study found that 93% of the women who had killed their significant others had been battered; 67% of these women attempted to protect themselves or their children. She has attended parole hearings to ensure survivors who have spent decades behind bars receive suitability; and also spearheaded the first legislation of its kind in the entire country, when Governor Brown signed [http://legislation.sinbysilence.com/ \"The Sin by Silence Bills\"], inspired by the documentary [[Sin by Silence]], into law on September 30, 2012 that ensures the path to freedom for over 7,000 domestic violence survivors currently serving time in California prisons. AB 593 allows victims of domestic violence whose expert testimony was limited at their trial court proceedings to re-file for a writ of habeas corpus to allow this expert testimony to weigh in on their defense and it will also give victims more time to receive legal representation by deleting the sunset date currently in statute.  AB 1593 gives victims who have suffered Intimate Partner Battering (IPB) a chance to present their evidence in an effective way during the parole process by giving great weight to any information or evidence that proves the prisoner experienced IPB and its effects at the time the crime was committed. This bill will also require that the information delivered to the Legislature relating to IPB, will be in specific and detailed reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Non-profit and community involvement===\nMa serves on the Board of Directors, and was a past Treasurer, for Curry Without Worry, a non-profit based in San Francisco. Since 2006, this organization has fed over 45,000 people.[8] She is also currently on the Board of Directors of CA Women Lead and Asian Inc.  She is the Honorary Chair and spokesperson of the San Francisco Hep B Free Campaign; Honorary California Chair of the New Leaders Council, Board Advisory Committee for the James L. Brady Riding Program for Children with Disabilities, Board Advisory Committee for Family Connections, President of Board of Asian American Donor Program, and Board Advisory Committee of the SF Ethnic Dance Festival.\n\n===State and national outreach===\nAssemblymember Ma has been active in promoting trade and fostering relationships between California and the Nation.  As an Executive Board Member of the National Conference of State Legislators, she worked to keep California competitive with other states.  She also served as the Western Region Director of Women in Government, the State Legislative Leaders Council, and was an Executive Board Member of the California Democratic Party.\n\n===International outreach===\nSince 1998, Ma has been on the forefront in promoting trade and commerce between California and Asia, leading legislative delegations to China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. She has been a frequent speaker in the region promoting US interests in high-speed rail, agriculture, entertainment and education.  She has also taken the lead to welcome foreign dignitaries visiting California in her elected capacities.\n \nShe has participated in various California trade delegations and has met with legislative leaders and decision-makers in India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, France, Israel, Ireland and Iceland.\n\n==Legislative Session 2011\u201312==\nIn the 2011-2012 legislative session, Assemblywoman Ma had 25 bills chaptered into law, 4 Assembly Concurrent Resolutions and 1 Assembly Joint Resolution signed by Governor Brown.\n\nA few of the Assemblywoman's bills are as follows:\n\n'''AB 74 Public event action plans and cooperative management'''<br> \nIn response to substance abuse-related deaths, injuries and arrests involving electronic-music shows at San Francisco's Cow Palace and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Assembly voted 75-0 to support AB 74. The bill establishes safety guidelines for electronic-music concerts when they are held on publicly owned properties such as the Cow Palace, which is located in Ma's 12th Assembly District. \"California needs to better monitor and control events occurring on state properties,\" Ma said in a news release. \"AB 74 is intended to prevent the loss of life and make safety a top priority at events on state property.\" The law requires the state agency intending to host any rave expected to draw 10,000 people or more to assess potential problems, the need for law enforcement and medical personnel, and other related issues.

Approximately 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half of them are Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Americans.  It is estimated that 1 in 10 APIs are chronically infected with HBV.  Like most APIs, Ma contracted HBV from her mother at birth via perinatal exposure. San Francisco has the highest rate of liver cancer in the nation because of its high API population, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men living in California. Ma works to remove the stigma of the disease in the Asian community by actively speaking out about the importance of testing and vaccination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |title=Fighting to eliminate hepatitis |author=Mike Aldax |date=May 13, 2010 |work=The San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=2010-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524153519/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |archivedate=2010-05-24 }}</ref> In 2008, Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158 which requires the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic hepatitis B.

Before this, LSU utilized the quarters of the Institute for the Deaf, Mute, and Blind. Land for the present campus was purchased in 1918, construction started in 1922, and the move began in 1925; however, it was not until 1932 that the move was finally completed. The campus was originally designed for 3000 students but was cut back due to budget problems. After some years of enrollment fluctuation, student numbers began a steady increase, new programs were added, curricula and faculty expanded, and a true state university emerged.<ref name=\"lsu.edu\"/>\n\nIn 1928, LSU was a small-time country school that generated little interest or attention in the state. Labeled a \"third-rate\" institution by the Association of State Universities, the school had only 1800 students, 168 faculty members, and an annual operating budget of $800,000. In 1930, [[Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]], the [[governor of Louisiana|governor]], initiated a massive building program to expand the physical plant and add departments.\n\nBy 1936, LSU had the finest facilities in the South, a top-notch faculty of 394 professors, a new medical school, more than 6,000 students, and a winning football team. In only eight years, it had risen in size from 88th in the nation to 20th, and it was the 11th largest state university in the nation. Long financed these improvements by arranging for the state to purchase acreage from the old LSU campus, which adjoined the grounds of the new State Capitol building in downtown Baton Rouge. To the consternation of his critics, Long essentially diverted $9 million for LSU's expansion and increased the annual operating budget to $2.8 million.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hueylong.com/programs/louisiana-state-university.php | title=Louisiana State University | publisher = Huey Long Legacy Project | year= 2009 | accessdate = August 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nLSU was hit by scandal in 1939 when [[James Monroe Smith]], appointed by Huey Long as president of LSU, was charged with embezzling a half-million dollars.

The Olmsted firm originally designed the campus for up to 3,000 students, but state officials asked the firm to scale the plan back due to budgetary constraints; subsequently, the new plan presented to the state by the Olmsted Brothers centered the campus around a cruciform [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] similar to the one that exists on campus today.\n\nFor unknown reasons, the Olmsted Brothers firm was dropped from the project, and an architect named [[Theodore Link]], who was well known for designing [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], took over the campus master plan. Link collaborated with Wilbur Tyson Trueblood on the project but remained faithful to the campus that the Olmsted firm had designed. Unfortunately, Link died in 1923 before the plan was completed.

The design of Hill Memorial Library was loosely based on that of the Boston Public Library, which was the first public library in the U.S. The flanking academic buildings that formed the rest of the Quad represented the major disciplines at the university, and their placement was modeled after that of buildings on the University of Virginia's campus, which was designed by Thomas Jefferson.<ref name=\"The LSU Campus\"/>\n\nNine LSU buildings, including the library and the academic buildings for dairying and physics, were constructed by [[George Caldwell (Louisiana)|George A.

The LSU-Ole Miss game, known as the [[Magnolia Bowl]] (a name selected by the student bodies of both schools) has become more formalized over the years, with a large trophy and a large traveling fanbase for both teams present each year. The LSU-Florida rivalry also has major importance as the two schools won three football national championships between 2006-2008 (Florida in 2006 and 2008; LSU in 2007). The LSU-Alabama rivalry has become very important in recent years due to the [[Nick Saban]] becoming the Coach of Alabama and the two teams' dominance of the SEC's West Division and their matchup in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game (the only time the standalone game featured two teams from the same conference).\n\n==Traditions==\n{{main|Louisiana State University traditions}}\n\n===Mascot===\n{{main|Mike the Tiger}}\n[[File:Lsumike.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Mike the Tiger]] \u2013 LSU's official mascot]]\n\nLSU Athletics is represented by its mascot, a live Bengal tiger named '''Mike the Tiger'''.

Before this, LSU utilized the quarters of the Institute for the Deaf, Mute, and Blind. Land for the present campus was purchased in 1918, construction started in 1922, and the move began in 1925; however, it was not until 1932 that the move was finally completed. The campus was originally designed for 3000 students but was cut back due to budget problems. After some years of enrollment fluctuation, student numbers began a steady increase, new programs were added, curricula and faculty expanded, and a true state university emerged.<ref name=\"lsu.edu\"/>\n\nIn 1928, LSU was a small-time country school that generated little interest or attention in the state. Labeled a \"third-rate\" institution by the Association of State Universities, the school had only 1800 students, 168 faculty members, and an annual operating budget of $800,000. In 1930, [[Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]], the [[governor of Louisiana|governor]], initiated a massive building program to expand the physical plant and add departments.\n\nBy 1936, LSU had the finest facilities in the South, a top-notch faculty of 394 professors, a new medical school, more than 6,000 students, and a winning football team. In only eight years, it had risen in size from 88th in the nation to 20th, and it was the 11th largest state university in the nation. Long financed these improvements by arranging for the state to purchase acreage from the old LSU campus, which adjoined the grounds of the new State Capitol building in downtown Baton Rouge. To the consternation of his critics, Long essentially diverted $9 million for LSU's expansion and increased the annual operating budget to $2.8 million.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hueylong.com/programs/louisiana-state-university.php | title=Louisiana State University | publisher = Huey Long Legacy Project | year= 2009 | accessdate = August 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nLSU was hit by scandal in 1939 when [[James Monroe Smith]], appointed by Huey Long as president of LSU, was charged with embezzling a half-million dollars.

The Olmsted firm originally designed the campus for up to 3,000 students, but state officials asked the firm to scale the plan back due to budgetary constraints; subsequently, the new plan presented to the state by the Olmsted Brothers centered the campus around a cruciform [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] similar to the one that exists on campus today.\n\nFor unknown reasons, the Olmsted Brothers firm was dropped from the project, and an architect named [[Theodore Link]], who was well known for designing [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], took over the campus master plan. Link collaborated with Wilbur Tyson Trueblood on the project but remained faithful to the campus that the Olmsted firm had designed. Unfortunately, Link died in 1923 before the plan was completed.

The LSU-Florida rivalry also has major importance as the two schools won three football national championships between 2006-2008 (Florida in 2006 and 2008; LSU in 2007). The LSU-Alabama rivalry has become very important in recent years due to the [[Nick Saban]] becoming the Coach of Alabama and the two teams' dominance of the SEC's West Division and their matchup in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game (the only time the standalone game featured two teams from the same conference).\n\n==Traditions==\n{{main|Louisiana State University traditions}}\n\n===Mascot===\n{{main|Mike the Tiger}}\n[[File:Lsumike.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Mike the Tiger]] \u2013 LSU's official mascot]]\n\nLSU Athletics is represented by its mascot, a live Bengal tiger named '''Mike the Tiger'''.

Significant reductions in passenger numbers has resulted in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights.\n\n== Flight cancellations ==\nGovernment regulations in Europe and the United States mandate airlines to refund fares when flights are cancelled, but in many cases airlines have instead offered vouchers or travel credits that must be used by the end of the year.

Despite pleas from industry lobbyists to expand the regulations to allow travel credits, the US [[Department of Transportation]] has reiterated that airlines are obligated to provide refunds for cancelled flights. Travel vouchers are currently allowed when passengers cancel travel plans due to travel warnings, stay at home orders and other restrictions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/07/829091394/airlines-want-to-cancel-rule-requiring-them-to-refund-fares-for-canceled-flights |title=Airlines Want To Cancel Rule Requiring Them To Refund Fares For Canceled Flights |date=April 7, 2020 |publisher=NPR}}</ref>\n\n== Air cargo ==\nAs passenger flights were canceled, the cost of sending cargo by air changed rapidly.

However, fate caused Geralt and Ciri to cross their paths thrice, with him claiming her for a second time when he invokes the Law of Surprise on a traveling merchant he saves from monsters during a random encounter; and after the death of her grandmother, Queen Calanthe of Cintra, Geralt ends up taking the girl into his care, training and loving her as his own daughter. \n\nFollowing the short stories, the novels unfold as Geralt is pulled into a whirlwind of events in his attempts to protect Ciri from those who would do her harm, becoming reluctantly embroiled in the political contentions of monarchs and emperors.\n\n==Literary analysis and reception ==\nGeralt is described as being emblematic of Polish popular culture's spirit of \"[[neo-liberal]] anti-politics\" in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Apor2008\">{{cite book|last=Apor|first=P\u00e9ter|title=Past for the eyes: East European representations of communism in cinema and museums after 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO8LAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9789639776050|page=198}}</ref> He is a professional, carrying out his duties and unwilling to become involved in the \"petty quarrels\" of the contemporary politics.<ref name=\"Apor2008\"/> [[Marek Oramus]] compared Geralt to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Oramus |first=Marek |author-link=Marek Oramus |date=2 September 2000 |title=Only the right image of a witcher |trans-title=Jedynie s\u0142uszny wizerunek wied\u017amina |url=https://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/jedynie-sluszny-wizerunek-wiedzmina,365834.html |language=Polish |work=[[Polityka]] |location=[[Poland]] |access-date=30 May 2011 |pages=52\u201354}}</ref> In 2018, [[GamesRadar]] ranked him as the 6th best hero in video game history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/heroes-in-video-games/3/ |title=The best heroes in video games |last= |first= |date=28 February 2018 |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |access-date=31 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref> In 2018, Geralt was included in [[Tom's Guide]] Top 25 Best Video Game Characters of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1544-best-video-game-characters-of-all-time.html|title=The 25 Best Video Game Characters of All Time|last=July 2018|first=Tom's Guide Staff 07|website=Tom's Guide|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n=== Film ===\n[[Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski]] portrays Geralt in the Polish-language adaptation movie ''[[The Hexer (film)|The Hexer]]''.\n\n===Television===\n* [[Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski]] portrays Geralt in the polish adaptation series ''[[The Hexer (TV series)|The Hexer]]''.\n* [[Henry Cavill]] portrays Geralt in the [[Netflix]] [[The Witcher (TV series)|adaptation of the books]], the first season of which was released in 2019.<ref name=\"directors\">{{cite web | url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflixs-the-witcher-casts-pivotal-roles-of-ciri-yennefer | title=Netflix\u2019S The Witcher casts pivotal roles of Ciri & Yennefer | date=10 October 2018 | publisher=Netflix | accessdate=16 January 2019 }}</ref> Sapkowski served as a creative consultant on the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/witcher-saga-tv-series-adaptation-ordered-at-netflix-1004558|title='The Witcher' Saga TV Series Adaptation Ordered at Netflix|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Geralt of Rivia.png|thumb|Geralt as he appears in ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'' (2015)]] -->[[File:W3 SS Geralt.png|thumb|208x208px|Geralt in ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'']]\nGeralt's adventures continues in a non-canonical version by CD Projekt Red's video game trilogy (''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]'', ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]]'' and ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]''), where he is still alive after being killed by a mob during an anti non-human riot at the end of the Witcher novel saga and his body was taken in a boat by his daughter Ciri to [[Avalon]].\n\nSapkowski stated that the games are a work of art of their own and that they cannot be considered either an \"alternative version\", or a sequel, \"because this can only be told by Geralt's creator.
