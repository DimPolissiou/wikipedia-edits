{"title_page": "List of British fencible regiments", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2017}}\nThis is a '''list of British fencible regiments'''. The ''[[fencibles]]'' (from the word ''{{not a typo|defencible}}'') were [[British Army]] [[regiment]]s raised in the [[United Kingdom]] and in the colonies for defence against the threat of invasion during the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[American War of Independence]] and [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in the late 18th century. Usually temporary units, composed of local volunteers, commanded by Regular Army officers, their role was, as their name suggests, usually confined to [[garrison]] and patrol duties, freeing the regular Army units to perform offensive operations.\n\nThe article is broken into two periods the first list is for the [[fencible]] regiments raised during the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American War of Independence]] the first was raised in 1759 two years after the start of the Seven Years' War and the last was disbanded in 1783 when active hostilities with the America colonies ended and the British recognised the de facto existence of the United States of America to be formalised by the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]].\n\nThere is a far larger list for the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. The regiments were raised during a time of great turbulence in Europe when there was a real fear that the French would either invade Great Britain or Ireland, or that radicals within Britain and Ireland would rebel against the established order. There was little to do in Britain other than garrison duties and some police actions, but in Ireland there was a French supported insurrection in 1798 and British fencible regiments were engaged in some minor pitched battles. Some regiments served outside Great Britain and Ireland. Several regiments performed garrison duties on the Channel Islands and Gibraltar. A detachment of the [[Dumbarton Fencible Regiment]] escorted prisoners to Prussia, and the [[#Ancient Irish|Ancient Irish Fencibles]] were sent to Egypt where they took part in the operations against the French in 1801.\n\nWhen it became clear that the rebellion in Ireland had been defeated and that there would be peace between France and Britain in 1802 (The preliminaries of peace were signed in London on 1 October 1801) the Fencible regiments were disbanded. The final ratification of the [[Peace of Amiens]] was concluded in March 1802. When the [[Napoleonic Wars]] resumed the British used alternative methods to defend the [[Home Nations]] (see for example the [[Additional Forces Act]], July 1803) and with the exception of the [[#Manx fencibles|Royal Manx Fencibles]] (third corps, 1803\u20131811) no more fencible regiments were raised for home defence.\n\nSeveral fencible regiments were raised in the early 1800s in Britain for the defence of Canada, some of these saw active service during the [[Anglo-American War of 1812]] (see the section ([[#Further information|Further information]]).\n\n==List of fencible infantry regiments raised prior to 1793==\n\nThe total number of British fencible infantry regiments raised during the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American War of Independence]] was nine, of which six were Scottish, two were English and one was [[Isle of Man|Manx]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!lo-<br/>cal||Name||Uniform||Commander||Raised||Disbanded||Notes\n|-\n|SH<ref name=Key group=lower-alpha>Key: SH, Scottish Highlands; SL, Scottish Lowlands; En, England, Mx Isle of Man.</ref>\n|[[Argyle Fencibles (1759)|Argyll Regiment]] \n|Highland dress.

The ''[[fencibles]]'' (from the word ''{{not a typo|defencible}}'') were [[British Army]] [[regiment]]s raised in the [[United Kingdom]] and in the colonies for defence against the threat of invasion during the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[American War of Independence]] and [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in the late 18th century. Usually temporary units, composed of local volunteers, commanded by Regular Army officers, their role was, as their name suggests, usually confined to [[garrison]] and patrol duties, freeing the regular Army units to perform offensive operations.\n\nThe article is broken into two periods the first list is for the [[fencible]] regiments raised during the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American War of Independence]] the first was raised in 1759 two years after the start of the Seven Years' War and the last was disbanded in 1783 when active hostilities with the America colonies ended and the British recognised the de facto existence of the United States of America to be formalised by the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]].\n\nThere is a far larger list for the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. The regiments were raised during a time of great turbulence in Europe when there was a real fear that the French would either invade Great Britain or Ireland, or that radicals within Britain and Ireland would rebel against the established order. There was little to do in Britain other than garrison duties and some police actions, but in Ireland there was a French supported insurrection in 1798 and British fencible regiments were engaged in some minor pitched battles. Some regiments served outside Great Britain and Ireland. Several regiments performed garrison duties on the Channel Islands and Gibraltar. A detachment of the [[Dumbarton Fencible Regiment]] escorted prisoners to Prussia, and the [[#Ancient Irish|Ancient Irish Fencibles]] were sent to Egypt where they took part in the operations against the French in 1801.\n\nWhen it became clear that the rebellion in Ireland had been defeated and that there would be peace between France and Britain in 1802 (The preliminaries of peace were signed in London on 1 October 1801) the Fencible regiments were disbanded. The final ratification of the [[Peace of Amiens]] was concluded in March 1802. When the [[Napoleonic Wars]] resumed the British used alternative methods to defend the [[Home Nations]] (see for example the [[Additional Forces Act]], July 1803) and with the exception of the [[#Manx fencibles|Royal Manx Fencibles]] (third corps, 1803\u20131811) no more fencible regiments were raised for home defence.\n\nSeveral fencible regiments were raised in the early 1800s in Britain for the defence of Canada, some of these saw active service during the [[Anglo-American War of 1812]] (see the section ([[#Further information|Further information]]).\n\n==List of fencible infantry regiments raised prior to 1793==\n\nThe total number of British fencible infantry regiments raised during the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American War of Independence]] was nine, of which six were Scottish, two were English and one was [[Isle of Man|Manx]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!lo-<br/>cal||Name||Uniform||Commander||Raised||Disbanded||Notes\n|-\n|SH<ref name=Key group=lower-alpha>Key: SH, Scottish Highlands; SL, Scottish Lowlands; En, England, Mx Isle of Man.</ref>\n|[[Argyle Fencibles (1759)|Argyll Regiment]] \n|Highland dress.

The festival of [[Hanukkah]] commemorates the uprising of the [[Maccabees]] against this attempt.\n\n;139 BCE:[[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Hispanus]] expels all Jews from the city of [[Rome]].\n\n;124&nbsp;BCE: The [[woman with seven sons]] was a Jewish [[martyr]], described in [[2 Maccabees]] 7 (2 Maccabees was written c. 124 BCE) and other sources.

When they refused, he tortured and killed the sons one by one. The narrator mentions that the mother \"was the most remarkable of all, and deserves to be remembered with special honour. She watched her seven sons die in the space of a single day, yet she bore it bravely because she put her trust in the Lord.\"<ref>2 Maccabees 7:20, [[New English Bible]].</ref> Each of the sons makes a speech as he dies, and the last one says that his brothers are \"dead under God's covenant of everlasting life\".<ref>2 Maccabees 7:36, [[Authorised Version]].

The Apocryphal Books: Esdras to Maccabees'' ([[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], 1902).</ref> The narrator ends by saying that the mother died, without saying whether she was executed, or died in some other way.\n\nThe [[Talmud]] tells a similar story, but with the refusal to worship an idol replacing the refusal to eat pork. [[Nashim|Tractate Gittin]] 57b cites Rabbi Judah saying that \"this refers to the woman and her seven sons\" and the unnamed king is referred to as the \"Emperor\" and \"Caesar\". The woman commits [[suicide]] in this rendition of the story: she \"also went up on to a roof and threw herself down and was killed\".<ref>''Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Gittin [http://www.halakhah.com/gittin/gittin_57.html Folio 57]''.</ref>\n\nOther versions of the story are found in [[4 Maccabees]] (which suggests that the woman might have thrown herself into the flames, 17:1) and [[Josippon]] (which says she fell dead on her sons' corpses<ref name=\"JVL\"/>).\n\n;63 BCE: 12,000 Jews die and many more are sent into [[Jewish diaspora|the diaspora]] as a result of [[Pompey#Pompey in the East|Pompey's conquest of the East]].\n\n;59 BCE: [[Cicero]] criticizes Jews for being too influential in public assemblies.

The Nazi Holocaust is history\u2019s most extreme example of anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism did not begin with Adolf Hitler: Anti-Semitic attitudes date back to ancient times. In much of Europe throughout the Middle Ages, Jewish people were denied citizenship and forced to live in ghettos. Anti-Jewish riots called pogroms swept the Russian Empire during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and anti-Semitic incidents have increased in parts of Europe, the Middle East and North America in the last several years.\n\nThe term anti-Semitism was first popularized by German journalist Wilhelm Marr in 1879 to describe hatred or hostility toward Jews. The history of anti-Semitism, however, goes back much further.\n\nHostility against Jews may date back nearly as far as Jewish history. In the ancient empires of Babylonia, Greece, and Rome, Jews\u2014who originated in the ancient kingdom of Judea\u2014were often criticized and persecuted for their efforts to remain a separate cultural group rather than taking on the religious and social customs of their conquerors.\n\nWith the rise of Christianity, anti-Semitism spread throughout much of Europe. Early Christians vilified Judaism in a bid to gain more converts. They accused Jews of outlandish acts such as \u201cblood libel\u201d\u2014the kidnapping and murder of Christian children to use their blood to make Passover bread.\n\n\nThese religious attitudes were reflected in anti-Jewish economic, social and political policies that pervaded into the European Middle Ages.\n\nAnti-Semitism in Medieval Europe\nMany of the anti-Semitic practices seen in Nazi Germany actually have their roots in medieval Europe. In many European cities, Jews were confined to certain neighborhoods called ghettos.\n\nSome countries also required Jews to distinguish themselves from Christians with a yellow badge worn on their garment, or a special hat called a Judenhut.\n\nSome Jews became prominent in banking and moneylending, because early Christianity didn\u2019t permit moneylending for interest. This resulted in economic resentment which forced the expulsion of Jews from several European countries including France, Germany, Portugal and Spain during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\n\nJews were denied citizenship and civil liberties, including religious freedom throughout much of medieval Europe.\n\nPoland was one notable exception. In 1264, Polish prince Boles\u0142aw the Pious issued a decree allowing Jews personal, political and religious freedoms. Jews did not receive citizenship and gain rights throughout much of western Europe, however, until the late 1700s and 1800s.\n\nRussian Pogroms\nThroughout the 1800s and early 1900s, Jews throughout the Russian Empire and other European countries faced violent, anti-Jewish riots called pogroms.\n\nPogroms were typically perpetrated by a local non-Jewish population against their Jewish neighbors, though pogroms were often encouraged and aided by the government and police forces.\n\nIn the wake of the Russian Revolution, an estimated 1,326 pogroms are thought to have taken place across Ukraine alone, leaving nearly half a million Ukrainian Jews homeless and killing an estimated 30,000 to 70,000 people between 1918 and 1921. Pogroms in Belarus and Poland also killed tens of thousands of people.\n\nNazi Anti-Semitism\nAdolf Hitler and the Nazis rose to power in Germany in the 1930s on a platform of German nationalism, racial purity and global expansion.\n\nHitler, like many anti-Semites in Germany, blamed the Jews for the country\u2019s defeat in World War I, and for the social and economic upheaval that followed.\n\nEarly on, the Nazis undertook an \u201cAryanization\u201d of Germany, in which Jews were dismissed from civil service, Jewish-owned businesses were liquidated and Jewish professionals, including doctors and lawyers, were stripped of their clients.\n\nThe Nuremberg Laws of 1935 introduced many anti-Semitic policies and outlined the definition of who was Jewish based on ancestry. Nazi propagandists had swayed the German public into believing that Jews were a separate race. According to the Nuremberg Laws, Jews were no longer German citizens and had no right to vote.\n\nKristallnacht\nJews became routine targets of stigmatization and persecution as a result. This culminated in a state-sponsored campaign of street violence known as Kristallnacht (the \u201cnight of broken glass\u201d), which took place between November 9-10, 1938. In two days, more than 250 synagogues across the Reich were burned and 7,000 Jewish businesses looted.\n\nThe morning after Kristallnacht, 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps.\n\n13\nGALLERY\n13 IMAGES\nHolocaust\nPrior to Kristallnacht, Nazi policies toward Jews had been antagonistic but primarily non-violent. After the incident, conditions for Jews in Nazi Germany became progressively worse as Hitler and the Nazis began to implement their plan to exterminate the Jewish people, which they referred to as the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the \u201cJewish problem.\u201d\n\nBetween 1939 and 1945, the Nazis would use mass killing centers called concentration camps to carry out the systematic murder of roughly 6 million European Jews in what would become known as the Holocaust.\n\nAnti-Semitism in the Middle East\nAnti-Semitism in the Middle East has existed for millennia, but increased greatly since World War II. Following the establishment of a Jewish State in Israel in 1948, the Israelis fought for control of Palestine against a coalition of Arab states.\n\nAt the end of the War, Israel kept much of Palestine, resulting in the forced exodus of roughly 700,000 Muslim Palestinians from their homes. The conflict created resentment over Jewish nationalism in Muslim-majority nations.\n\nAs a result, anti-Semitic activities grew in many Arab nations, causing most Jews to leave over the next few decades. Today, many North African and Middle Eastern nations have little Jewish population remaining.\n\nAnti-Semitism in Europe and the United States\nAnti-Semitic hate crimes have spiked in Europe in recent years, especially in France, which has the world\u2019s third largest Jewish population. In 2012, three children and a teacher were shot by a radical Islamist gunman in Toulouse, France.\n\nIn the wake of the mass shooting at the satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris in 2015, four Jewish hostages were murdered at a Kosher supermarket by an Islamic terrorist.\n\nThe U.K. logged a record 1,382 hate crimes against Jews in 2017, an increase of 34 percent from previous years. In the United States, anti-Semitic incidents rose 57 percent in 2017\u2014the largest single-year increase ever recorded by the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights advocacy organization. 2018 saw a doubling of anti-Semitic assaults, according the ADL, and the single deadliest attack against the Jewish community in American history\u2014the October 27, 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.\n\n== Twentieth century ==\n[[File:Yad Vashem Hall of Names by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[Hall of Names]] in [[Yad Vashem]] containing Pages of Testimony commemorating the millions of Jews who were murdered during [[the Holocaust]]]]\n{{Main|Timeline of antisemitism in the 20th century}}\n\n== Twenty-first century ==\n\n{{Main|Timeline of antisemitism in the 21st century}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Martyrdom in Judaism]]\n* [[Timeline of anti-Zionism]]\n* [[Vichy Holocaust collaboration timeline]]\n* [[Expulsions and exoduses of Jews]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper International Religious Freedom Report for 2012\u2014A Continued Rise in Anti-Semitism], a report by the U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labo\n\n{{Antisemitism topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{Timeline of religion}}\n\n[[Category:Antisemitic attacks and incidents|*]]\n[[Category:History of antisemitism]]\n[[Category:Jewish history timelines|Antisemitism]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Dynamic list}}\nThis '''timeline of antisemitism''' chronicles the facts of [[antisemitism]], hostile actions or discrimination against [[Jews]] as a religious or ethnic group.

When they refused, he tortured and killed the sons one by one. The narrator mentions that the mother \"was the most remarkable of all, and deserves to be remembered with special honour. She watched her seven sons die in the space of a single day, yet she bore it bravely because she put her trust in the Lord.\"<ref>2 Maccabees 7:20, [[New English Bible]].</ref> Each of the sons makes a speech as he dies, and the last one says that his brothers are \"dead under God's covenant of everlasting life\".<ref>2 Maccabees 7:36, [[Authorised Version]].

The Apocryphal Books: Esdras to Maccabees'' ([[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], 1902).</ref> The narrator ends by saying that the mother died, without saying whether she was executed, or died in some other way.\n\nThe [[Talmud]] tells a similar story, but with the refusal to worship an idol replacing the refusal to eat pork.

At that time the stone was in the same broken state in which it now appears and was situated some 10m SE of a stone circle (CV013-026002-). Macalister recorded local traditions which alleged that the damage to the stone had been carried out in living memory by local farmers in order to remove an obstruction to agricultural activities. Macalister also stated that people of the vicinity had dug around the stone in a vain search for buried treasure and in so doing had apparently destroyed a 'cist burial'. He did not, however, actually see this 'cist burial'. Some thirty years later a second decorated stone fragment, probably a portion of the same monolith, was discovered a short distance down-slope from the main piece. In the early summer of 1974 it was decided to remove the weathered and overgrown fragments to the National Museum of Ireland. A limited excavation was undertaken in its immediate vicinity which revealed that 'the stone stood in a flat-bottomed pit which had been deliberately sunk 80cm into the subsoil to receive it' (Raftery 1978, 51-2). Immediately E of the stone were two pits one of which may be identified as the remains of the cist burial identified by Macalister as it contained tiny fragments of burnt bone (CV013-026003-). The two fragments of the Killycluggin Stone are on display in the Cavan County Museum, Ballyjamesduff, while a replica stands at the cross-roads c. 250m NW of the original site. The following description of the stone is derived from Raftery (1978, 49-51). The main fragment has been worked to more-or-less cylindrical form on its surviving upper portion. That part which was intended to be below ground level is rough and irregular and projects awkwardly in one direction so that the stone as a whole is crudely L-shaped. The base of the stone slopes obliquely to its vertical axis. The entire upper surface of this stone had been smashed by deliberate and systematic hammering. This destruction continued along one side, whereby the ornament, down to the base of the stone was totally obliterated. The surviving ornament, which comprises combinations of sweeping curves and tight, hair-spring spirals \u2013 classic La T\u00e8ne motifs \u2013 is chiseled deeply and crisply into the prepared surface of the stone. The curvilinear patterns have been divided into rectangular panels by straight vertical lines and by horizontal lines at right angles to them which define the basal extremity of the ornamented area. The precise original width of only one such panel can now be ascertained (c. 0.9m wide and 0.75m high) but it may be estimated that four such panels of decoration once existed on the stone giving an original circumference of 3.6m. The smaller decorated fragment appears to represent a portion of the dome-shaped top of the original monolith and, in this regard, would have resembled that of the best known of the Irish aniconic stones, the stele from Turoe, Co. Galway (GA097-152----). The decoration on this fragment is of two types. Along one edge slight remains of curvilinear patterns, similar to those on the portion just described, survive. Sufficient remains to show that the upper limits of this decoration are defined by a straight line as is the case at the base of the stone, and traces of one of the lines which divide the ornament into vertical, rectangular panels are present here too. The convex upper surface of this fragment is decorated by a series of deeply chiseled, parallel lines which extend across the surface of the stone. The surviving edges of this panel of ornament are defined by a straight line which is incised at an oblique angle to the line which forms the boundary to the zones of curvilinear ornament. Thus there occurs what is now a triangular area, devoid of ornament between the ornament on the apex of the stone and the ornament on the surviving cylindrical part. The two decorated fragments do not join so that neither the original height of the stone nor the precise overall disposition of its ornamentation can now be ascertained.

At that time the stone was in the same broken state in which it now appears and was situated some 10m SE of a stone circle (CV013-026002-). Macalister recorded local traditions which alleged that the damage to the stone had been carried out in living memory by local farmers in order to remove an obstruction to agricultural activities. Macalister also stated that people of the vicinity had dug around the stone in a vain search for buried treasure and in so doing had apparently destroyed a 'cist burial'. He did not, however, actually see this 'cist burial'. Some thirty years later a second decorated stone fragment, probably a portion of the same monolith, was discovered a short distance down-slope from the main piece. In the early summer of 1974 it was decided to remove the weathered and overgrown fragments to the National Museum of Ireland. A limited excavation was undertaken in its immediate vicinity which revealed that 'the stone stood in a flat-bottomed pit which had been deliberately sunk 80cm into the subsoil to receive it' (Raftery 1978, 51-2). Immediately E of the stone were two pits one of which may be identified as the remains of the cist burial identified by Macalister as it contained tiny fragments of burnt bone (CV013-026003-). The two fragments of the Killycluggin Stone are on display in the Cavan County Museum, Ballyjamesduff, while a replica stands at the cross-roads c. 250m NW of the original site. The following description of the stone is derived from Raftery (1978, 49-51). The main fragment has been worked to more-or-less cylindrical form on its surviving upper portion. That part which was intended to be below ground level is rough and irregular and projects awkwardly in one direction so that the stone as a whole is crudely L-shaped. The base of the stone slopes obliquely to its vertical axis. The entire upper surface of this stone had been smashed by deliberate and systematic hammering. This destruction continued along one side, whereby the ornament, down to the base of the stone was totally obliterated. The surviving ornament, which comprises combinations of sweeping curves and tight, hair-spring spirals \u2013 classic La T\u00e8ne motifs \u2013 is chiseled deeply and crisply into the prepared surface of the stone. The curvilinear patterns have been divided into rectangular panels by straight vertical lines and by horizontal lines at right angles to them which define the basal extremity of the ornamented area. The precise original width of only one such panel can now be ascertained (c. 0.9m wide and 0.75m high) but it may be estimated that four such panels of decoration once existed on the stone giving an original circumference of 3.6m. The smaller decorated fragment appears to represent a portion of the dome-shaped top of the original monolith and, in this regard, would have resembled that of the best known of the Irish aniconic stones, the stele from Turoe, Co. Galway (GA097-152----). The decoration on this fragment is of two types. Along one edge slight remains of curvilinear patterns, similar to those on the portion just described, survive. Sufficient remains to show that the upper limits of this decoration are defined by a straight line as is the case at the base of the stone, and traces of one of the lines which divide the ornament into vertical, rectangular panels are present here too. The convex upper surface of this fragment is decorated by a series of deeply chiseled, parallel lines which extend across the surface of the stone. The surviving edges of this panel of ornament are defined by a straight line which is incised at an oblique angle to the line which forms the boundary to the zones of curvilinear ornament. Thus there occurs what is now a triangular area, devoid of ornament between the ornament on the apex of the stone and the ornament on the surviving cylindrical part. The two decorated fragments do not join so that neither the original height of the stone nor the precise overall disposition of its ornamentation can now be ascertained.

Baca''''', No. 19-518, is a pending case in the 2019-2020 term of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on the issue of [[faithless elector]]s in the [[United States Electoral College]] stemming from the [[2016 United States Presidential Election]]. The case is based on a challenge to a [[Colorado]] law compelling an elector to vote for the presidential candidate who received the most votes in the state, claiming that electors have discretion to vote as they choose under the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"Docket 01\" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hutchins|first1=Corey|title=Electoral College members file voter 'intimidation' lawsuit against Colorado's secretary of state|url=http://www.coloradoindependent.com/166682/electoral-college-members-file-voter-intimidation-lawsuit-against-colorados-secretary-of-state|publisher=Colorado Independent|date=August 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe case had previously been consolidated with ''[[Chiafalo v. Washington]]'', a similar case concerning faithless electors out of [[Washington (state)|Washington state]]. However, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] announced her recusal from the Colorado case due to a prior relationship with one of the respondents, and subsequently the Court separated the cases. Oral arguments had been scheduled for April, but were subsequently postponed due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Background==\n===Faithless electors===\n{{main|Faithless elector}}\nIn the [[United States Electoral College]], faithless electors are those who either cast electoral votes for someone other than the candidate of the party that they pledged to vote for or who [[Abstention|abstain]].

In 1952, the constitutionality of state pledge laws was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ray v. Blair]]'', {{ussc|343|214|1952}}. The Court ruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning candidate in order to be certified as electors, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge. The court did not rule whether pledges were enforceable. Nevertheless, the court also wrote:\n\n{{quote|However, even if such promises of candidates for the electoral college are legally unenforceable because violative of an ''assumed constitutional freedom of the elector under the Constitution, Art. II, \u00a7 1, to vote as he may choose'' [emphasis added] in the electoral college, it would not follow that the requirement of a pledge in the primary is unconstitutional.}}\n\nIn his dissent, Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], joined by Justice [[William O.

The case is based on a challenge to a [[Colorado]] law compelling an elector to vote for the presidential candidate who received the most votes in the state, claiming that electors have discretion to vote as they choose under the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"Docket 01\" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hutchins|first1=Corey|title=Electoral College members file voter 'intimidation' lawsuit against Colorado's secretary of state|url=http://www.coloradoindependent.com/166682/electoral-college-members-file-voter-intimidation-lawsuit-against-colorados-secretary-of-state|publisher=Colorado Independent|date=August 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe case had previously been consolidated with ''[[Chiafalo v. Washington]]'', a similar case concerning faithless electors out of [[Washington (state)|Washington state]]. However, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] announced her recusal from the Colorado case due to a prior relationship with one of the respondents, and subsequently the Court separated the cases. Oral arguments had been scheduled for April, but were subsequently postponed due to the [[2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Background==\n===Faithless electors===\n{{main|Faithless elector}}\nIn the [[United States Electoral College]], faithless electors are those who either cast electoral votes for someone other than the candidate of the party that they pledged to vote for or who [[Abstention|abstain]]. Thirty-two [[U.S. state|state]]s plus the [[District of Columbia]] have passed laws to prevent faithless electors,<ref>{{cite web |title=Faithless Elector State Laws |url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_elector_state_laws |website=Fair Vote |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Laws Binding Electors |url=http://presidentialelectorlaws.us |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref> but none had been enforced prior to 2016. In 1952, the constitutionality of state pledge laws was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ray v. Blair]]'', {{ussc|343|214|1952}}. The Court ruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning candidate in order to be certified as electors, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge. The court did not rule whether pledges were enforceable. Nevertheless, the court also wrote:\n\n{{quote|However, even if such promises of candidates for the electoral college are legally unenforceable because violative of an ''assumed constitutional freedom of the elector under the Constitution, Art. II, \u00a7 1, to vote as he may choose'' [emphasis added] in the electoral college, it would not follow that the requirement of a pledge in the primary is unconstitutional.}}\n\nIn his dissent, Justice [[Robert H.

Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a [[Collective leadership in the Soviet Union|collective leadership]], he eventually consolidated power to become the country's ''de facto'' [[dictator]] by the 1930s. A [[communist]] ideologically committed to the [[Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin formalised these ideas as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], while his own policies are known as [[Stalinism]].\n\n<!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power-->\nBorn to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin joined the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings, and [[protection rackets]]. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] and created a [[one-party state]] under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Serving in the [[Russian Civil War]] before overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]] following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's 1924 death]]. Under Stalin, \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" became a central tenet of the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party's dogma]]. Through the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivisation]] and [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialisation]], creating a centralised [[command economy]]. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]]. To eradicate accused \"[[enemies of the working class]]\", Stalin instituted the \"[[Great Purge]]\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\n\n<!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death-->\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported European [[anti-fascist]] movements during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Soviet sphere of influence|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], and [[Soviet Civil Administration|North Korea]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[doctors' plot]]. After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced him]] and initiated the [[de-Stalinisation]] of [[Soviet society]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and [[socialism]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|mass repressions]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|that killed millions]].\n<!--please do not remove, for ToC spacing-->\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}\n\n===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899===\nStalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} then part of the [[Tiflis Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=15}} He was born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 Dec}},{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's exact date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878. This birth date is maintained in his School Leaving Certificate, his extensive tsarist Russia police file, a police arrest record from 18 April 1902 which gave his age as 23 years, and all other surviving pre-Revolution documents.

Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a [[Collective leadership in the Soviet Union|collective leadership]], he eventually consolidated power to become the country's ''de facto'' [[dictator]] by the 1930s. A [[communist]] ideologically committed to the [[Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin formalised these ideas as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], while his own policies are known as [[Stalinism]].\n\n<!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power-->\nBorn to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin joined the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings, and [[protection rackets]]. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] and created a [[one-party state]] under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Serving in the [[Russian Civil War]] before overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]] following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's 1924 death]]. Under Stalin, \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" became a central tenet of the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party's dogma]]. Through the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivisation]] and [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialisation]], creating a centralised [[command economy]]. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]]. To eradicate accused \"[[enemies of the working class]]\", Stalin instituted the \"[[Great Purge]]\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\n\n<!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death-->\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported European [[anti-fascist]] movements during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Soviet sphere of influence|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], and [[Soviet Civil Administration|North Korea]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[doctors' plot]]. After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced him]] and initiated the [[de-Stalinisation]] of [[Soviet society]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and [[socialism]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|mass repressions]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|that killed millions]].\n<!--please do not remove, for ToC spacing-->\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}\n\n===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899===\nStalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} then part of the [[Tiflis Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=15}} He was born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 Dec}},{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's exact date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878.
