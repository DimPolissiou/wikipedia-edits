He currently lives in [[New Orleans]] and is Professor Emeritus, retiring with a dual appointment as Professor of English and Professor of Religious Studies at [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] where he was also an LSU Distinguished Professor and  Erich and Lea Sternberg Honors Professor. He currently works privately with clients, using dreams in a process of spiritual direction. Kamenetz is married to [[Moira Crone]], a novelist and short story writer. He is the father of [[Anya Kamenetz]], also an author, and Kezia Kamenetz.\n\n===Poetry===\nAt the age of 16, Kamenetz entered [[Yale University]], where he gave readings and published with poets [[Alan Bernheimer]] and [[Kit Robinson]] (later associated with the [[Language poets]]), and studied with [[Ted Berrigan]]. His first book, ''The Missing Jew'' (Dryad, 1979, was influenced by the [[Objectivist poets]], especially [[Charles Reznikoff]], whom he met at Stanford in 1973. Both poets relied on plain diction and paid attention to American Jewish identity and culture. Another enduring influence was [[Robert Duncan (poet)]], whom Kamenetz also met at that time, and later interviewed extensively about Duncan's interest in the [[Zohar]] and Jewish mysticism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kamenetz|first=Rodger|title=Realms of Being: An interview with Robert Duncan|journal=The Southern Review|year=1985|volume=21|issue=1|pages=5\u201325}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wagstaff|first=Christopher|title=A Poet's Mind: Collected Interviews with Robert Duncan, 1960-1985|year=2012|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781583944547|pages=387\u2013410}}</ref> \nKamenetz typed ''The Missing Jew'' on a single continuous scroll, and the poems developed as commentaries on previous poems, as in the Jewish literary tradition of [[midrash]]. Joel Lewis, writing in the '''Forward''', said, \"Mr. Kamenetz recovers Jewishness as a field for discourse, not sentimentalized imagery. In direct and imaginative address, he puts the question of Jewishness under discussion with large parts of honesty and humor.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Joel|title=A modern day Rashi|newspaper=The Forward|date=December 11, 1992}}</ref> \nKamenetz continued to add to the book, and a new edition, nearly double in size, appeared in 1991 as ''The Missing Jew: New and Selected Poems'' (Time Being, 1991). His poems were anthologized in ''Voices Within the Ark'' (Avon, 1979), ''Jewish American Poetry'' (Brandeis, 2000), ''Jewish in America'' (U. of Michigan Press), ''Bearing the Mystery'' (Eerdmans), ''Best Jewish Writing 2003'' (Jossey Bass), ''Blood to Remember: American Poets on the Holocaust'' (Time Being), ''Telling and Remembering: a Century of American Jewish Poetry'' (Beacon, 1997), and ''The Prairie Schooner Anthology of Contemporary Jewish American Writing'' (Nebraska, 1998). In ''The Lowercase Jew'' (Northwestern, 2003), Kamenetz adopted a form of verse essay to address issues of literary anti-Semitism. The title poem speaks to [[T.S. Eliot]]'s use of a lower case spelling of \"jew\" in his poetry; another retells an incident in which \"Allen Ginsberg Forgives Ezra Pound on Behalf of the Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kamenetz|first=Rodger|title=Allen Ginsberg Forgives Ezra Pound on Behalf of the Jews|url=http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/133838/allen-ginsberg-forgives-ezra-pound-on-behalf-of-th/|publisher=The Forward|accessdate=December 9, 2010}}</ref> Kamenetz's sixth  book of poetry, \"[https://www.amazon.com/Die-Next-You-Rodger-Kamenetz/dp/1926616502 To Die Next To You]\" (Six Gallery Press, 2013) derives primarily from his experience with dreamwork.<ref>{{cite web|last=Liebovitz|first=Liel|title=Rodger Kamenetz Will Explain Your Dreams|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/149978/rodger-kamenetz-will-explain-your-dreams|publisher=Tablet|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}</ref> His seventh book of poetry, \"[https://www.amazon.com/Yonder-Rodger-Kamenetz/dp/1944884580 Yonder]\" (Lavender Ink, 2019) \"brims with respect for the prose poetry genre, with homages to forebears from Baudelaire to Max Jacob, Russel Edson to Kafka.\"\n\n===Prose===\nAfter the death of his mother in 1980, Kamenetz turned from poetry to the autobiographical essay in ''Terra Infirma''  (University of Arkansas, 1985) and reprinted by Schocken Books in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Richard|title=Terra Infirma:Penetrating the Mystery of a Mother's Silence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/21/daily/032699terra-book-review.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 26, 1999}}</ref>  The book is structured as the interpretation of a single dream of his late mother, which Kamenetz modeled on [[Michel Butor]]'s ''Histoire extraordinaire: essai sur un r\u00eave de Baudelaire'' (1961). \nIn October 1990, Kamenetz was invited to observe an historic dialogue between rabbis and the [[XIV Dalai Lama]] in Dharamsala, India. The [[Dalai Lama]] had asked the Jewish delegates to share with him \"the secret of Jewish spiritual survival in exile.\"  His account of this exchange, [[The Jew in the Lotus]] (1994), was a popular success and became an international best-seller. Writing in the [[New York Times]], [[Verlyn Klinkenborg]] cited its broader relevance as a book \"about the survival of esoteric traditions in a world bent on destroying them.\" <ref>{{cite news|last=Klinkenborg|first=Verlyn|title=Going to See the Lama|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/books/going-to-see-the-lama.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 24, 1994}}</ref> The book was primarily potent in capturing an ongoing engagement in the US between Jews, often highly secularized, and Buddhist teachings. Kamenetz popularized the term [[Jewish Buddhist|JUBU]] or [[Jewish Buddhist]], interviewing poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[vipassana]] teacher [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], [[Ram Dass]] and other American Jews involved with bringing Eastern traditions to the West.  \nThe book also made prominent a Jewish mystical response to Eastern spirituality in the [[Jewish renewal]] movement, led by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], and [[Jewish meditation]] as taught by Rabbi Jonathan Omer-Man. \n''The Jew in the Lotus'' inspired a PBS documentary of the same name produced and directed by Laurel Chiten, released theatrically in New York, Los Angeles and Boston, and subsequently on Independent Lens on   September 1, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|last=ITVS|title=The Jew in the Lotus|url=http://www.itvs.org/films/jew-in-the-lotus}}</ref> \nKamenetz followed ''The Jew in the Lotus'' with ''Stalking Elijah: Adventures with Today's Jewish Mystical Masters'' (Harper, 1997), which received the [[National Jewish Book Award]] for Jewish Thought in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/awards/national-jewish-book-awards/past-winners?category=30766|title=Past Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Book Council|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Kamenetz interviews a number of Jewish leaders who attempt to blend together Jewish mysticism, feminism and innovations in prayer and meditation practice. Among them were Rabbis [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], Jonathan Omer-Man, [[Arthur Green]] and [[Shefa Gold]]. The book ends with the account of a seder held in Dharamsala India, which included as guests the Tibetan teacher Geshe [[Sonam Rinchen (buddhist geshe)|Sonam Rinchen]]. During that same visit, Kamenetz met with the [[Dalai Lama]], which inspired him to work with the Interfaith Action Network of the International Campaign to free the young Panchen Lama [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] from Chinese government detainment. The world's youngest prisoner of conscience, the Panchen Lama's eighth birthday fell during the first week of Passover. Struck by this coincidence, Kamenetz created a nationwide campaign of [[Passover Seder]]s for Tibet,<ref>{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Jan|title=Make Your Own Tradition: Redefining Seders for Today|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/10/nyregion/make-your-own-tradition-redefining-seders-for-today.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> uniting the Jewish memory of slavery and oppression in Egypt long ago with the lack of religious freedom in today's Tibet under Chinese rule.

He currently lives in [[New Orleans]] and is Professor Emeritus, retiring with a dual appointment as Professor of English and Professor of Religious Studies at [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] where he was also an LSU Distinguished Professor and  Erich and Lea Sternberg Honors Professor. He currently works privately with clients, using dreams in a process of spiritual direction. Kamenetz is married to [[Moira Crone]], a novelist and short story writer. He is the father of [[Anya Kamenetz]], also an author, and Kezia Kamenetz.\n\n===Poetry===\nAt the age of 16, Kamenetz entered [[Yale University]], where he gave readings and published with poets [[Alan Bernheimer]] and [[Kit Robinson]] (later associated with the [[Language poets]]), and studied with [[Ted Berrigan]]. His first book, ''The Missing Jew'' (Dryad, 1979, was influenced by the [[Objectivist poets]], especially [[Charles Reznikoff]], whom he met at Stanford in 1973. Both poets relied on plain diction and paid attention to American Jewish identity and culture. Another enduring influence was [[Robert Duncan (poet)]], whom Kamenetz also met at that time, and later interviewed extensively about Duncan's interest in the [[Zohar]] and Jewish mysticism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kamenetz|first=Rodger|title=Realms of Being: An interview with Robert Duncan|journal=The Southern Review|year=1985|volume=21|issue=1|pages=5\u201325}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wagstaff|first=Christopher|title=A Poet's Mind: Collected Interviews with Robert Duncan, 1960-1985|year=2012|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781583944547|pages=387\u2013410}}</ref> \nKamenetz typed ''The Missing Jew'' on a single continuous scroll, and the poems developed as commentaries on previous poems, as in the Jewish literary tradition of [[midrash]]. Joel Lewis, writing in the '''Forward''', said, \"Mr. Kamenetz recovers Jewishness as a field for discourse, not sentimentalized imagery. In direct and imaginative address, he puts the question of Jewishness under discussion with large parts of honesty and humor.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Joel|title=A modern day Rashi|newspaper=The Forward|date=December 11, 1992}}</ref> \nKamenetz continued to add to the book, and a new edition, nearly double in size, appeared in 1991 as ''The Missing Jew: New and Selected Poems'' (Time Being, 1991). His poems were anthologized in ''Voices Within the Ark'' (Avon, 1979), ''Jewish American Poetry'' (Brandeis, 2000), ''Jewish in America'' (U. of Michigan Press), ''Bearing the Mystery'' (Eerdmans), ''Best Jewish Writing 2003'' (Jossey Bass), ''Blood to Remember: American Poets on the Holocaust'' (Time Being), ''Telling and Remembering: a Century of American Jewish Poetry'' (Beacon, 1997), and ''The Prairie Schooner Anthology of Contemporary Jewish American Writing'' (Nebraska, 1998). In ''The Lowercase Jew'' (Northwestern, 2003), Kamenetz adopted a form of verse essay to address issues of literary anti-Semitism. The title poem speaks to [[T.S. Eliot]]'s use of a lower case spelling of \"jew\" in his poetry; another retells an incident in which \"Allen Ginsberg Forgives Ezra Pound on Behalf of the Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kamenetz|first=Rodger|title=Allen Ginsberg Forgives Ezra Pound on Behalf of the Jews|url=http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/133838/allen-ginsberg-forgives-ezra-pound-on-behalf-of-th/|publisher=The Forward|accessdate=December 9, 2010}}</ref> Kamenetz's sixth  book of poetry, \"[https://www.amazon.com/Die-Next-You-Rodger-Kamenetz/dp/1926616502 To Die Next To You]\" (Six Gallery Press, 2013) derives primarily from his experience with dreamwork<ref>{{cite web|last=Liebovitz|first=Liel|title=Rodger Kamenetz Will Explain Your Dreams|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/149978/rodger-kamenetz-will-explain-your-dreams|publisher=Tablet|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}</ref>. His seventh book of poetry, \"[https://www.amazon.com/Yonder-Rodger-Kamenetz/dp/1944884580 Yonder]\" (Lavender Ink, 2019) \"brims with respect for the prose poetry genre, with homages to forebears from Baudelaire to Max Jacob, Russel Edson to Kafka.\"\n\n===Prose===\nAfter the death of his mother in 1980, Kamenetz turned from poetry to the autobiographical essay in ''Terra Infirma''  (University of Arkansas, 1985) and reprinted by Schocken Books in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Richard|title=Terra Infirma:Penetrating the Mystery of a Mother's Silence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/21/daily/032699terra-book-review.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 26, 1999}}</ref>  The book is structured as the interpretation of a single dream of his late mother, which Kamenetz modeled on [[Michel Butor]]'s ''Histoire extraordinaire: essai sur un r\u00eave de Baudelaire'' (1961). \nIn October 1990, Kamenetz was invited to observe an historic dialogue between rabbis and the [[XIV Dalai Lama]] in Dharamsala, India. The [[Dalai Lama]] had asked the Jewish delegates to share with him \"the secret of Jewish spiritual survival in exile.\"  His account of this exchange, [[The Jew in the Lotus]] (1994), was a popular success and became an international best-seller. Writing in the [[New York Times]], [[Verlyn Klinkenborg]] cited its broader relevance as a book \"about the survival of esoteric traditions in a world bent on destroying them.\" <ref>{{cite news|last=Klinkenborg|first=Verlyn|title=Going to See the Lama|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/books/going-to-see-the-lama.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 24, 1994}}</ref> The book was primarily potent in capturing an ongoing engagement in the US between Jews, often highly secularized, and Buddhist teachings. Kamenetz popularized the term [[Jewish Buddhist|JUBU]] or [[Jewish Buddhist]], interviewing poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[vipassana]] teacher [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], [[Ram Dass]] and other American Jews involved with bringing Eastern traditions to the West.  \nThe book also made prominent a Jewish mystical response to Eastern spirituality in the [[Jewish renewal]] movement, led by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], and [[Jewish meditation]] as taught by Rabbi Jonathan Omer-Man. \n''The Jew in the Lotus'' inspired a PBS documentary of the same name produced and directed by Laurel Chiten, released theatrically in New York, Los Angeles and Boston, and subsequently on Independent Lens on   September 1, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|last=ITVS|title=The Jew in the Lotus|url=http://www.itvs.org/films/jew-in-the-lotus}}</ref> \nKamenetz followed ''The Jew in the Lotus'' with ''Stalking Elijah: Adventures with Today's Jewish Mystical Masters'' (Harper, 1997), which received the [[National Jewish Book Award]] for Jewish Thought in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/awards/national-jewish-book-awards/past-winners?category=30766|title=Past Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Book Council|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Kamenetz interviews a number of Jewish leaders who attempt to blend together Jewish mysticism, feminism and innovations in prayer and meditation practice. Among them were Rabbis [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], Jonathan Omer-Man, [[Arthur Green]] and [[Shefa Gold]]. The book ends with the account of a seder held in Dharamsala India, which included as guests the Tibetan teacher Geshe [[Sonam Rinchen (buddhist geshe)|Sonam Rinchen]]. During that same visit, Kamenetz met with the [[Dalai Lama]], which inspired him to work with the Interfaith Action Network of the International Campaign to free the young Panchen Lama [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] from Chinese government detainment. The world's youngest prisoner of conscience, the Panchen Lama's eighth birthday fell during the first week of Passover. Struck by this coincidence, Kamenetz created a nationwide campaign of [[Passover Seder]]s for Tibet,<ref>{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Jan|title=Make Your Own Tradition: Redefining Seders for Today|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/10/nyregion/make-your-own-tradition-redefining-seders-for-today.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> uniting the Jewish memory of slavery and oppression in Egypt long ago with the lack of religious freedom in today's Tibet under Chinese rule. A special seder was held in Washington D.C. on April 24, 1997 and attended by the Dalai Lama, as well as by numerous U.S. dignitaries and celebrities, including Supreme Court Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] and [[Adam Yauch]] of the Beastie Boys.<ref>{{cite news|last=Niebuhr|first=Gustav|title=Adding a Contemporary Ring to an Ancient Story|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/26/us/adding-a-contemporary-ring-to-an-ancient-story.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 26, 1997}}</ref> The seder, as well as Kamenetz's visit with the Dalai Lama in 1997 was featured in the 1999 documentary, ''The Jew in the Lotus'' and is recounted in ''Stalking Elijah'' <ref>{{cite book|last=Kamenetz|first=Rodger|title=Stalking Elijah|year=1997|publisher=Harper San Francisco|isbn=0060642319|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stalkingelijahad00kame/page/327 327\u2013329]|url=https://archive.org/details/stalkingelijahad00kame/page/327}}</ref> \nIn fall 2007, Harper One published ''The History of Last Night's Dream'' which explores the spiritual possibilities of dreaming from Genesis to now.

{"title_page": "Partial-order planning", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=June 2013}}\n{{essay-like|date=April 2014}}\n}}\n\n'''Partial-order planning''' is an approach to [[automated planning]] that maintains a partial ordering between actions and only commits ordering between actions when forced to i.e., ordering of actions is partial. Also this planning doesn't specify which action will come out first when two actions are processed. By contrast, '''total-order planning''' maintains a total ordering between all actions at every stage of planning. Given a problem in which some sequence of actions is required in order to achieve a goal, a '''partial-order plan''' specifies all actions that need to be taken, but specifies an ordering between actions only where necessary.\n\t\nConsider the following situation: a person must travel from the start to the end of an obstacle course. This obstacle course is composed of a bridge, a see-saw and a swing-set. The bridge must be traversed before the see-saw and swing-set are reachable. Once reachable, the see-saw and swing-set can be traversed in any order, after which the end is reachable. In a partial-order plan, ordering between these obstacles is specified only when necessary. The bridge must be traversed first. Second, either the see-saw or swing-set can be traversed. Third, the remaining obstacle can be traversed. Then the end can be traversed. Partial-order planning relies upon the [[Principle of Least Commitment]] for its efficiency. \n\n==Partial-order plan==\nA '''partial-order plan''' or '''partial plan''' is a plan which specifies all actions that need to be taken, but only specifies the order between actions when necessary. It is the result of a partial-order planner. A partial-order plan consists of four components:\n\n* A set of '''actions''' (also known as '''operators''').\n* A '''[[partial order]]''' for the actions. It specifies the conditions about the order of some actions.\n* A set of '''causal links'''. It specifies which actions meet which preconditions of other actions. Alternatively, a set of '''bindings''' between the variables in actions.\n* A set of '''open preconditions'''. It specifies which preconditions are not fulfilled by any action in the partial-order plan.\n\nIn order to keep the possible orders of the actions as open as possible, the set of order conditions and causal links must be as small as possible.\n\nA plan is a solution if the set of open preconditions is empty.\n\nA '''linearization''' of a partial order plan is a total order plan derived from the particular partial order plan; in other words, both order plans consist of the same actions, with the order in the linearization being a [[linear extension]] of the partial order in the original partial order plan.\n\n===Example===\n\nFor example, a plan for baking a cake might start:\n\n* go to the store\n* get eggs; get flour; get milk\n* pay for all goods\n* go to the kitchen\n\nThis is a partial plan because the order for finding eggs, flour and milk is not specified, the agent can wander around the store [[reactive planning|reactively]] accumulating all the items on its shopping list until the list is complete.\n\n==Partial-order planner==\n\nA '''partial-order planner''' is an [[algorithm]] or [[Computer program|program]] which will construct a partial-order plan and search for a solution. The input is the problem description, consisting of descriptions of the '''initial state''', the '''goal''' and possible '''actions'''.\n\nThe problem can be interpreted as a [[Search algorithm|search problem]] where the set of possible partial-order plans is the search space. The initial state would be the plan with the open preconditions equal to the goal conditions. The final state would be any plan with no open preconditions, i.e. a solution.\n\nThe initial state is the starting conditions, and can be thought of as the preconditions to the task at hand. For a task of setting the table, the initial state could be a clear table. The goal is simply the final action that needs to be accomplished, for example setting the table. The operators of the algorithm are the actions by which the task is accomplished. For this example there may be two operators: lay (tablecloth), and place (glasses, plates, and silverware).\n\n===Plan space===\nThe [[plan space]] of the algorithm is constrained between its start and finish. The algorithm starts, producing the initial state and finishes when all parts of the goal have been achieved. In the setting a table example, there are two types of actions that need to be addressed\u2014the put-out and lay operators. There are also four unsolved operators: Action 1, lay-tablecloth, Action 2, Put-out (plates), Action 3, Put-out (silverware), and Action 4, Put-out (glasses). However, there is a threat that arises if Action 2, 3, or 4 comes before Action 1. This threat is that the precondition to the start of the algorithm will be unsatisfied as the table will no longer be clear. Thus, there are constraints that need to be added to the algorithm that force Actions 2, 3, and 4 to come after Action 1. Once these steps are completed, the algorithm will finish and the goal will have been completed.\n\n===Threats===\nAs seen in the algorithm presented above, partial-order planning can encounter certain [[threats]], meaning [[orderings]] that threaten to break connected actions, thus potentially destroying the entire plan. There are two ways to resolve threats: \n* [[Promotion (rank)|Promotion]]\n* [[Demotion]]\n\n[[Promotion (rank)|Promotion]] orders the possible threat after the connection it threatens. [[Demotion]] orders the possible threat before the connection it threatens.\n\nPartial-order planning algorithms are known for being both sound and complete, with sound being defined as the total ordering of the algorithm, and complete being defined as the capability to find a solution, given that a solution does in fact exist.\n\n==Partial-order vs. total-order planning==\nPartial-order planning is the opposite of [[total-order planning]], in which actions are sequenced all at once and for the entirety of the task at hand. The question arises when one has two competing processes, which one is better? Anthony Barret and Daniel Weld have argued in their 1993 book, that partial-order planning is superior to [[total-order planning]], as it is faster and thus more efficient. They tested this theory using [[Korf\u2019s taxonomy of subgoal collections]], in which they found that partial-order planning performs better because it produces more [[trivial serializability]] than [[total-order planning]]. [[Trivial serializability facilitates]] a planner\u2019s ability to perform quickly when dealing with goals that contain subgoals. Planners perform more slowly when dealing with [[laboriously serializable]] or [[nonserializable subgoals]]. The determining factor that makes a subgoal trivially or laboriously serializable is the search space of different plans. They found that partial-order planning is more adept at finding the quickest path, and is therefore the more efficient of these two main types of planning.\n\n==The Sussman anomaly==\nPartial-order plans are known to easily and optimally solve the [[Sussman anomaly]]. Using this type of incremental planning system solves this problem quickly and efficiently. This was a result of partial-order planning that solidified its place as an efficient planning system.\n\n==Disadvantages to partial-order planning==\nOne drawback of this type of planning system is that it requires a lot more computational power for each node. This higher per-node cost occurs because the algorithm for partial-order planning is more complex than others. This has important [[artificial intelligence]] implications. When coding a robot to do a certain task, the creator needs to take into account how much energy is needed. Though a partial-order plan may be quicker it may not be worth the energy cost for the robot. The creator must be aware of and weigh these two options to build an efficient robot.\n\n== References ==\n*''Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach'' by Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig\n*[http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~weld/papers/pi.pdf An Introduction To Least Commitment Planning] by Daniel Weld\n*[http://www.isi.edu/info-agents/papers/kambhampati95-joint-aij.ps Kambhampati, S., Knoblock, C.A., Yang, Q.

DeMille]]'s film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' in 1956. Five years later, she made her Broadway debut in ''[[Becket]]''<ref name=\"bio\" /> before playing Tzeitel in [[Harold Prince]]'s production of ''Fiddler on the Roof''. She left the cast of ''Fiddler on the Roof'' before the end of its tour to take care of her two small children<ref name=\"interview\" /> but Harold Prince gave her the opportunity to become involved in casting with a more flexible schedule. ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' was the first musical for which Merlin served as the casting director. She was also in charge of casting for such plays as ''[[Follies]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]''. \n\nIn 1986, she served as casting director for the [[John Carpenter]] film, ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]].''\n\nAfter making appearances in several feature films, including the movie ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'', in which she played Miss Olivia Berg, a classical dance teacher; Merlin appeared in the [[NBC]] crime drama ''[[Law & Order]]'' in 1992 as a defense attorney.  Like many actors from that show, she went on to play other characters in the ''Law & Order'' franchise - another defense attorney in the original show and a more recurring role as Judge Lena Petrovsky, a judge who was very stern, by-the-book, and has scolded or sanctioned, at various times, ADAs [[Casey Novak]] ([[Diane Neal]]) and [[Alexandra Cabot]] ([[Stephanie March]]) and Detective (now Lieutenant) [[Olivia Benson]] ([[Mariska Hargitay]]), in its first spin-off ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]''.

The [[Dust Bowl]] (which gives the nickname the Dirty Thirties) in the United States further emphasised the scarcity of wealth. [[Herbert Hoover]] worsened the situation with his failed attempt to balance the budget by taxes. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was elected, as a response, in 1933, and introduced the [[New Deal]]. The founding of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) and the funding of numerous projects (e.g. the [[Hoover Dam]]) helped restore prosperity in the US.\n\nThe decade also saw the rapid retreat of [[Liberal democracy]], as [[authoritarian]] regimes emerged in  countries across Europe and South America, in particular the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] in [[German Reich|Germany]]. Germany elected [[Adolf Hitler]], who imposed the [[Nuremberg Laws]], a series of laws which discriminated against [[Jews]] and other ethnic minorities. Weaker states such as [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]], and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] were invaded by expansionist world powers, the last of these attacks leading to the outbreak of the [[World War II]] on September 1, 1939, despite calls from the [[League of Nations]] for worldwide peace. World War II helped end the Great Depression when governments spent money for the war effort. The 1930s also saw a proliferation of new technologies, especially in the fields of intercontinental [[aviation]], [[radio]], and [[film]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Politics and wars==\n===Wars===\n[[File:Kamp-wrzes22-anim.gif|upright|thumb|The outbreak of '''[[World War II]]''': Until the beginning of October 1939 both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union conquer [[Poland]] entirely in accordance with the secret part of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]]] \n* [[Colombia\u2013Peru War]] (September 1, 1932 \u2013 May 24, 1933) \u2013 fought between the [[Republic of Colombia]] and the [[Republic of Peru]].\n* [[Chaco War]] (June 15, 1932 \u2013 June 10, 1935) \u2013 the war was fought between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the disputed territory of [[Gran Chaco]] resulting in an overall Paraguayan victory in 1935.

The [[zipper]] became widely used. These essentially U.S. developments were echoed, in varying degrees, in Britain and Europe. Suntans (called at the time \"sunburns\") became fashionable in the early 1930s, along with travel to the resorts along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], in the [[Bahamas]], and on the east coast of [[Florida]] where one can acquire a tan, leading to new categories of clothes: white dinner jackets for men and beach pajamas, halter tops, and bare midriffs for women.<ref name=\"Mode\">Wilcox, R.

The [[Dust Bowl]] (which gives the nickname the Dirty Thirties) in the United States further emphasised the scarcity of wealth. [[Herbert Hoover]] worsened the situation with his failed attempt to balance the budget by taxes. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was elected, as a response, in 1933, and introduced the [[New Deal]]. The founding of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) and the funding of numerous projects (e.g. the [[Hoover Dam]]) helped restore prosperity in the US.\n\nThe decade also saw the rapid retreat of [[Liberal democracy]], as [[authoritarian]] regimes emerged in  countries across Europe and South America, in particular the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] in [[German Reich|Germany]]. Germany elected [[Adolf Hitler]], who imposed the [[Nuremberg Laws]], a series of laws which discriminated against [[Jews]] and other ethnic minorities. Weaker states such as [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]], and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] were invaded by expansionist world powers, the last of these attacks leading to the outbreak of the [[World War II]] on September 1, 1939, despite calls from the [[League of Nations]] for worldwide peace. World War II helped end the Great Depression when governments spent money for the war effort. The 1930s also saw a proliferation of new technologies, especially in the fields of intercontinental [[aviation]], [[radio]], and [[film]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Politics and wars==\n===Wars===\n[[File:Kamp-wrzes22-anim.gif|upright|thumb|The outbreak of '''[[World War II]]''': Until the beginning of October 1939 both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union conquer [[Poland]] entirely in accordance with the secret part of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]]] \n* [[Colombia\u2013Peru War]] (September 1, 1932 \u2013 May 24, 1933) \u2013 fought between the [[Republic of Colombia]] and the [[Republic of Peru]].\n* [[Chaco War]] (June 15, 1932 \u2013 June 10, 1935) \u2013 the war was fought between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the disputed territory of [[Gran Chaco]] resulting in an overall Paraguayan victory in 1935.

The Kuomintang and Communists attempted to put away their differences after 1937 to fight the Japanese occupation of China, but intermittent clashes continued through the remainder of the 1930s. Even with some clashes they all fought the Japanese \n* [[Spanish Civil War]] (July 17, 1936 \u2013 April 1, 1939) \u2013 Germany and Italy back anti-communist [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola y de las JONS|Falange]] forces of [[Francisco Franco]]. The [[Soviet Union]] and international communist parties (see [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]]) back the left-wing republican faction in the war. The war ends in April 1939 with Franco's nationalist forces defeating the republican forces. Franco becomes [[List of heads of state of Spain|Head of State of Spain]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Spain|President of Government]] and de facto dictator.

He was ousted in favor of [[Winston Churchill]] in May 1940, after the [[Invasion of Norway]].<ref>Hunt, Lynn. \"The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures\" Vol. C since 1740.Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009.</ref>\n* The assassination of the German diplomat [[Ernst vom Rath]] by a German-born Polish Jew triggers the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass) which occurred between 9 and 10 November 1938, carried out by the [[Hitler Youth]], the [[Gestapo]], and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], during which much of the Jewish population living in Nazi Germany and Austria was attacked \u2013 91 Jews were murdered, and between 25,000 and 30,000 more were arrested and sent to [[Nazi concentration camp]]s. Some 267 synagogues were destroyed, and thousands of homes and businesses were ransacked. ''Kristallnacht'' also served as the pretext for the wholesale confiscation of firearms from German Jews.\n* Germany and Italy pursue territorial expansionist agendas. Germany demands the annexation of the [[Federal State of Austria]] and of other German-speaking territories in Europe. Between 1935 and 1936, Germany recovers the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] and re-militarizes the [[Rhineland]]. Italy initially opposes Germany's aims for Austria, but in 1936 the two countries resolve their differences in the aftermath of Italy's diplomatic isolation following the start of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], Germany becoming Italy's only remaining ally. Germany and Italy improve relations by forming an alliance against communism in 1936 with the signing of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]]. Germany annexes Austria in the event known as the [[Anschluss]].

The period also saw the first widespread use of man-made fibers, especially [[rayon]] for dresses and [[viscose]] for [[lining (sewing)|linings]] and [[lingerie]], and synthetic [[nylon]] [[stocking]]s. The [[zipper]] became widely used. These essentially U.S. developments were echoed, in varying degrees, in Britain and Europe. Suntans (called at the time \"sunburns\") became fashionable in the early 1930s, along with travel to the resorts along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], in the [[Bahamas]], and on the east coast of [[Florida]] where one can acquire a tan, leading to new categories of clothes: white dinner jackets for men and beach pajamas, halter tops, and bare midriffs for women.<ref name=\"Mode\">Wilcox, R.

[[Precisionism]] with its depictions of industrial America was also a popular art movement during the 1930s in the USA. During the Great Depression the art of [[photography]] played an important role in the Social Realist movement.

The movement stands out historically because of its political undertones, the majority of which of a [[Marxist]] nature, or related to a social and political situation of post-revolutionary Mexico. Also in Latin America [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Magic Realism]] were important movements.\n\nIn Europe during the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], [[Surrealism]], late [[Cubism]], the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], [[Dada]], [[German Expressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[modernist]] painting in various guises characterized the art scene in Paris and elsewhere.\n\n.\n*[[1934 FIFA World Cup]] was hosted and won by Italy.\n*[[1936 Summer Olympics]] was hosted by Berlin.\n*[[1938 FIFA World Cup]] was hosted by France and won by Italy.\n*[[1932 Winter Olympics]] was hosted by the village of Lake Placid, NY.\n\n== People ==\n\n===World leaders===\n{|\n| valign = top style=\"width: 500px\" |\n* Monarch [[Mohammad Nadir Shah]] (Afghanistan)\n* Prime Minister [[James Scullin]] (Australia)\n* Prime Minister [[Joseph Lyons]] (Australia)\n* Prime Minister [[Sir Earle Page]] (Australia)\n* Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] (Australia)\n* President [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] ([[Brazil]])\n* Prime Minister [[Richard Bedford Bennett, 1st Viscount Bennett]] (Canada)\n* Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (Canada)\n* Chairman [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ([[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]])\n* Chairman [[Lin Sen]] ([[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]])\n* President [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] ([[Czechoslovakia]])\n* President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]]  ([[Czechoslovakia]])\n* President [[Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo]] ([[Dominican Republic]])\n* King [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] ([[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Nubia]], [[Kordofan]] & [[Darfur]])\n* King [[Ibn Saud]] ([[Saudi Arabia]])\n* Taoiseach [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] ([[\u00c9ire]])\n* Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]] ([[Ethiopia]])\n* President [[Gaston Doumergue]] (France)\n* President [[Paul Doumer]] (France)\n* President [[Albert Lebrun]] (France)\n* Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] (France)\n* Prime Minister [[L\u00e9on Blum]] (France)\n* President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] (Germany)\n* Chancellor and later F\u00fchrer [[Adolf Hitler]] (Germany) - won a popular election and then established a [[Nazi Germany|dictatorship in Germany]] whose expansionist ambitions lead to the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe.\n* Governor-General [[E.
