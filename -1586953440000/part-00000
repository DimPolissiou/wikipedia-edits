His real name is Trevion R. Ward but most of you may know him as Tre, or Moneybaby . Tre Moneybaby is 16 years old, born November 29th 2003. He started rapping when he was just 3 years old but started taking it serious when he was 13 when he was under Detroit native Kelo Yay\u2019s wing and \u201cSafebin Ballaz ent.\u201d When the released songs featuring Tre Moneybaby such as , \u201cLookin like money\u201d \u201cWhat it cost\u201d \u201cWe can do it\u201d \u201cMillionaire Mindset\u201d and \u201cFatcs\u201d. After a year and a half they stopped working and all went their separate ways. Tre Moneybaby started releasing music on his own with another local rapper known as Paidd Kj under Blockbrothas ent. 2019 Tre Moneybaby had gotten plenty of exposure when he recorded a song called \u201cNever\u201d with Veeze and Detroit native Babyface Ray, even before that he had songs with artist such as, lil beno, baby drego, rocky badd and etc that\u2019s unreleased.

February of 2020 he released a E.P called \u201cWritten Dreams\u201d  and music video \u201cHorse Power\u201d that\u2019s really a Detroit hellcat and scatpack type of turn up song.

Built approximately {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|}} due east of the [[Isle of Dogs]], its northern bank is in [[Silvertown]] in the [[London Borough of Newham]] and its southern bank is in the [[New Charlton]] area of the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nFlooding in London has been a problem since the city was first established in Roman times.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kendrick|first=Mary|date=1988|title=The Thames Barrier|url=|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=16|pages=57-68|via=ScienceDirect}}</ref>\u00a0In 1954 the Waverley Committee, established to investigate the serious [[North Sea flood of 1953]] which affected parts of the Thames Estuary and parts of London, recommended that \"''as an alternative to raising the banks, the possibility and cost of erecting a structure across the Thames which could be closed in a surge should be urgently investigated''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1954/jun/03/coastal-flooding-committees-report|title=Coastal Flooding (Committee's Report) (Hansard, 3 June 1954)|website=api.parliament.uk|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> A large number of designs were put forward, ranging from a huge road viaduct with two 500 foot (150 m) sluice gates crossing the Thames at Crayfordness to flap gates lying on the river bed and floated up by compressed air.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Gilbert, Stuart (Stuart K.)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11594001|title=The Thames barrier|date=1984|publisher=T.

He considered the estimated construction costs and the probability of a flood and of damage if the barrier was not built.\u00a0He strongly recommended that a barrier should be built in order to avoid the catastrophe of flooding central London, and a site was agreed at Woolwich.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe barrier protects central London against a storm surge, caused when a deep depression forms to the north of Scotland and progresses across the North Sea and south-easterly towards southern Scandinavia. When such a surge coincides with a high [[spring tide]], the high winds associated with the depression can funnel the water up the Thames Estuary and cause surges of up to 3.5 metres. The planners assessed that in the absence of a barrier, such a surge could inundate 45 square miles (117 km<sup>2</sup>) of land, put hospitals, powers stations and the London Underground out of action and cause damage estimated in 1966 at \u00a32.0 billion<ref>The Thames Barrier:  The Background and Basic Engineering Requirements.  D Ayres Director of Public Health Engineering, GLC.  1983. Paper presented to a meeting of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 8th June 1983</ref> (about \u00a350 billion at 2020 prices). The barrier was designed to provide a flood defence capable of resisting a once in 1000 year surge tide at a base date of 2030.\n\n=== Design and construction ===\n[[File:Thames Barrier - simple operation diagram.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Diagram showing how the gates work, though the barrier actually rises further than this to allow water to \"underspill\" under the barrier in a controlled fashion]]\n\nThe concept of the rising sector gates was devised by (Reginald) Charles Draper. In 1969, from his parents' house in Pellatt Grove, [[Wood Green]], London, he constructed a working model. The novel rotating cylinders were based on the design of the taps on his gas cooker. The barrier was designed by Rendel, Palmer and Tritton for the [[Greater London Council]] and the concept tested at the [[Hydraulics Research Station]], Wallingford<ref name=\":1\" />. The site at New Charlton was chosen because of the relative straightness of the banks, and because the underlying river chalk was strong enough to support the barrier. \n\nThe Thames Barrier and Flood Prevention Act, authorising construction, was passed in 1972.  In 1974 the GLC placed the two major construction contracts. Civil construction was undertaken by a [[Costain Group|Costain]]/[[Royal BAM Group|Hollandsche Beton Maatschappij]]/[[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]] consortium.   Work began at the barrier site in 1974 and progressed in two phases. The southern piers (9 to 6) were built first, with river traffic diverted to the north side, then traffic routed through the completed southern spans whilst the north side piers (1 to 5) were built. During construction of the piers, precast concrete sills were built in a [[cofferdam]] on the north side of the river and floated out and sunk between the piers to form the gate recesses, with access tunnels at the upstream and downstream ends.<ref>[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/regions/thames/323150/335688/341764/341785/?version=1&lang=_e Environment Agency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917221210/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/regions/thames/323150/335688/341764/341785/?version=1&lang=_e |date=17 September 2008 }}</ref> The second major contract, for the gates and operating machinery, was placed with the Davy Cleveland Barrier Consortium, formed by Davy McKee Ltd<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Davy_McKee_(Sheffield)|title=Davy McKee (Sheffield) - Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> of Sheffield and [[Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company|Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd]].<ref>[http://www.al-rushaid.com/engineering06.htm Cleveland Bridge UK projects: Thames Barrier] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619202806/http://www.al-rushaid.com/engineering06.htm |date=19 June 2012 }}</ref> The gates of the barrier were fabricated in sections at Cleveland Bridge's Darlington works and assembled at Port Clarence on the [[River Tees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benring.co.uk/ |title=Benring limited: Thames Barrier \u2013 subcontracted to Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd |publisher=Benring.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref> The gates, gate arms and rocking beams were transported from the Tees to the Thames by barge and lifted into position by two very large floating cranes operated by Neptun of Hamburg (now part of SMIT).<ref>Manufacture and Installation of the Barrier Gates and Operating Machinery - P F Harvey, Davy Cleveland Barrier Consortium - Institution of Mechanical Engineers - Paper presented at a meeting on 8th June 1983.</ref>\u00a0The mechanical and hydraulic machinery was built by Davy Loewy, Henry Berry and Vickers and trial assembled in Davy's Darnall works.\u00a0Delays to the civil works required changes to the construction and installation sequence, but commissioning was relatively uneventful and the first trial operation of all the gates together was carried out on 31 October 1982.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/frame/article/1982-11-04/3/1.html|title=Archive Page Viewer {{!}} November 4, 1982 {{!}} The Times|access-date=2020-04-14|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the barrier, the flood defences {{convert| 11|mi|order=flip}} down river were raised and strengthened.

He considered the estimated construction costs and the probability of a flood and of damage if the barrier was not built.\u00a0He strongly recommended that a barrier should be built in order to avoid the catastrophe of flooding central London, and a site was agreed at Woolwich.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe barrier protects central London against a storm surge, caused when a deep depression forms to the north of Scotland and progresses across the North Sea and south-easterly towards southern Scandinavia. When such a surge coincides with a high [[spring tide]], the high winds associated with the depression can funnel the water up the Thames Estuary and cause surges of up to 3.5 metres. The planners assessed that in the absence of a barrier, such a surge could inundate 45 square miles (117 km<sup>2</sup>) of land, put hospitals, powers stations and the London Underground out of action and cause damage estimated in 1966 at \u00a32.0 billion<ref>The Thames Barrier:  The Background and Basic Engineering Requirements.  D Ayres Director of Public Health Engineering, GLC.  1983. Paper presented to a meeting of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 8th June 1983</ref> (about \u00a350 billion at 2020 prices). The barrier was designed to provide a flood defence capable of resisting a once in 1000 year surge tide at a base date of 2030.\n\n=== Design and construction ===\n[[File:Thames Barrier - simple operation diagram.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Diagram showing how the gates work, though the barrier actually rises further than this to allow water to \"underspill\" under the barrier in a controlled fashion]]\n\nThe concept of the rising sector gates was devised by (Reginald) Charles Draper. In 1969, from his parents' house in Pellatt Grove, [[Wood Green]], London, he constructed a working model. The novel rotating cylinders were based on the design of the taps on his gas cooker. The barrier was designed by Rendel, Palmer and Tritton for the [[Greater London Council]] and the concept tested at the [[Hydraulics Research Station]], Wallingford<ref name=\":1\" />. The site at New Charlton was chosen because of the relative straightness of the banks, and because the underlying river chalk was strong enough to support the barrier. \n\nThe Thames Barrier and Flood Prevention Act, authorising construction, was passed in 1972.  In 1974 the GLC placed the two major construction contracts. Civil construction was undertaken by a [[Costain Group|Costain]]/[[Royal BAM Group|Hollandsche Beton Maatschappij]]/[[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]] consortium.   Work began at the barrier site in 1974 and progressed in two phases. The southern piers (9 to 6) were built first, with river traffic diverted to the north side, then traffic routed through the completed southern spans whilst the north side piers (1 to 5) were built. During construction of the piers, precast concrete sills were built in a [[cofferdam]] on the north side of the river and floated out and sunk between the piers to form the gate recesses, with access tunnels at the upstream and downstream ends.<ref>[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/regions/thames/323150/335688/341764/341785/?version=1&lang=_e Environment Agency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917221210/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/regions/thames/323150/335688/341764/341785/?version=1&lang=_e |date=17 September 2008 }}</ref> The second major contract, for the gates and operating machinery, was placed with the Davy Cleveland Barrier Consortium, formed by Davy McKee Ltd<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Davy_McKee_(Sheffield)|title=Davy McKee (Sheffield) - Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> of Sheffield and [[Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company|Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd]].<ref>[http://www.al-rushaid.com/engineering06.htm Cleveland Bridge UK projects: Thames Barrier] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619202806/http://www.al-rushaid.com/engineering06.htm |date=19 June 2012 }}</ref> The gates of the barrier were fabricated in sections at Cleveland Bridge's Darlington works and assembled at Port Clarence on the [[River Tees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benring.co.uk/ |title=Benring limited: Thames Barrier \u2013 subcontracted to Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd |publisher=Benring.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref> The gates, gate arms and rocking beams were transported from the Tees to the Thames by barge and lifted into position by two very large floating cranes operated by Neptun of Hamburg (now part of SMIT).<ref>Manufacture and Installation of the Barrier Gates and Operating Machinery - P F Harvey, Davy Cleveland Barrier Consortium - Institution of Mechanical Engineers - Paper presented at a meeting on 8th June 1983.</ref>\u00a0The mechanical and hydraulic machinery was built by Davy Loewy, Henry Berry and Vickers and trial assembled in Davy's Darnall works.\u00a0Delays to the civil works required changes to the construction and installation sequence, but commissioning was relatively uneventful and the first trial operation of all the gates together was carried out on 31 October 1982.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/frame/article/1982-11-04/3/1.html|title=Archive Page Viewer {{!}} November 4, 1982 {{!}} The Times|access-date=2020-04-14|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the barrier, the flood defences {{convert| 11|mi|order=flip}} down river were raised and strengthened.

In November of the same year, their son Krzysztof was born. Despite an unhappy partnership, the couple went on to have a second child, Zofia. Their poor financial situation led to Rafa\u0142's artist father helping them out. In 1923 he bought for them a chalet called \"Marysin\".\n\nRafa\u0142 Malczewski was an associate and friend of a group of artists, musicians and intellectuals who would congregate in the [[Mountain resort]] of Zakopane in the early part of the 20th century. They included [[Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], [[Karol Szymanowski]], [[Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski]], [[Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz]]. In 1932 he joined the \"Rhythm Association of artists (Stowarzyszenie Artyst\u00f3w Polskich \u201eRytm\u201d) and was a set designer for productions of [[Strindberg]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Witkiewicz]] at the ''Formistyczny Theatre'' in Zakopane. In 1937 he was awarded the \"Wawrzyn Akademicki\" award from the [[Polska Akademia Literatury]] \"for services to Polish art\".<ref>Rocznik Polskiej Akademii Literatury 1937\u20131938, Warsaw 1939, p. 175.</ref> 1938 he donated part of his artistic output to the newly re-opened [[National Museum of Warsaw]] to which, several years earlier on account of his material difficulties, he had sold the entirety of his father's work left to him by Malczewski Sr.\n\n== Travels ==\n[[File:Rafal Malczewski Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Rafa\u0142 Malczewski in [[Ottawa]]. He settled in [[Canada]] in 1942]]\nIn 1939 after the [[outbreak of World War II]], having already abandoned his wife and children, he escaped over the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] border, with his partner Zofia Mikucka, and via [[Budapest]] and [[Venice]] made his way to [[Paris]]. There he fell on the generosity of the Polish embassy to help him out of another financial difficulty. In 1940 they travelled on to [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], where they stayed for four months. At the beginning of 1941 they moved to [[Brazil]]. At first they stayed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where he was able to sell some of his paintings which consisted of water colour landscapes of Rio, [[Curitiba]] and of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Parana]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=CANADIAN ART CRITICS ON RAFA\u0141 MALCZEWSKI|author= Krzy\u017canowski, Jerzy R.|journal=The Polish Review|volume= 38, No. 2 |date=1993|pages=191-201}}</ref><ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\nIn 1942 they moved to Curitiba to stay with his cousin, Maria Bochdan-Niedenthal. Shortly after, he succeeded in obtaining Canadian visas for himself and his girlfriend, Zofia, to travel to [[Ottawa]]. By December 1942 he held his first Canadian exhibition in the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]. He managed to persuade the [[Canadian railways]] to sponsor him and Zofia to travel across [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] in search of artistic subjects in exchange for publicity scenery. He spent the winter of 1943 in the [[Rocky Mountains]], which led to a series of canvases that kept him supplied for many exhibitions until 1949. A stay in [[New York City|New York]] in 1950 was fruitful enough for further sales of his work. \n\nDespite developing problems with his sight, like his father before him, the ensuing years saw a great flowering of his painting and writing. After his wife, Bronislawa died in Warsaw in 1953, he finally married Zofia Mikucka.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coraz trudniej \u017cy\u0107, a umrze\u0107 strach, Listy 1952\u20131955|trans-title=It gets more difficult to live, but perish the thought of dying.

He managed to obtain sponsorship from the CIA-controlled [[Radio Free Europe]] and from [[Quebec City]]. In 1959 the daughter of Zofia Malczewska-Kondracka invited him to visit Poland. Despite great nostalgia for the south of the country, he  resolved to remain in Canada, but his journey was described in his memoir, ''Wspomnieniach z Polski'' and serialised in the [[London]] \u00e9migr\u00e9 paper, [[Wiadomo\u015bci (London magazine)|Wiadomo\u015bci]]. From 1961 he was kept by his daughter, Zofia, and three years later, in 1964 his last exhibition took place in [[Montreal]]. He died and was buried there in 1965.<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\n== Characteristics of his art ==\nMagdalena Ma\u0142etko has emphasised several pointers to understand Malczewski's art. His successful artist father wished him to have a more reliable career than his own. While at the University of Vienna Malczewski studied [[Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]] as part of the philosophy course, but he failed to complete his degree. He never got over the death of his close friend and climbing partner Bronikowski, who died on a climb they did together in 1917. His first marriage was an attempt to get over his grief and was loveless, and more of a duty due to Bronis\u0142awa's pregnancy. Painting came to him instinctually as he watched his prolific father working in his studio. Malczewski was an artist difficult to categorise, although he developed his own distinctive style. This has been called \"hyper realism\" (Witkacy) and \"naive\". His themes were predominantly empty vistas, mountain scenery, snowscapes and glassy lakes. He also did portraits, cartoons and a series of rally cars and industrial scenery in [[Silesia]]. The great hiatus of his life was leaving his family and his beloved Zakopane in 1939. Three years later he had settled in Canada having travelled through Southern Europe and Brazil, where his palette responded to the colour and light. His later life was a struggle with increasing blindness and paralysis which allowed him only to use water colour, alongside his writing, which he managed to do until his death.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ma\u0142etko, Magdalena|title= Rafa\u0142 Malczewski i jego widzenie nowoczesno\u015bci|date=2009   |url=https://www.kul.pl/files/564/public/ARTykuly/ARTykuly002/ARTykuly_nr002_2009_MM_s22.pdf|lang=pl|publisher=www.kul.pl|access-date=2020-04-14|trans-title=Rafa\u0142 Malczewski and his vision of modernity}}</ref>\n\n== Selected exhibitions and awards==\nMalczewski's first public show was with [[Witkacy]] at Garlinski's Salon in Warsaw in 1924.<ref name = \"IK\"/> Solo shows followed in:\n* Zakopane (1926)\n* Warsaw (1928, 1929, 1935, 1938)\n* Krak\u00f3w (1930, 1932) \n* [[Lodz|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (1935)\n* [[Katowice]] (1938) \n* Montreal Museum of Arts ( 1942)\n* Dominion Gallery (1949)  \n* Corcoran Gallery, [[Washington, D.C.]] (1944).<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\nAs a member of the Society for the Propagation of Polish Art Abroad, he participated in the following group exhibitions:\n* [[Prague]] and [[Helsinki]] (1929)\n* Vienna and Paris (1928) \n* [[Brussels]] and [[The Hague]] (1929)\n* Budapest and [[Copenhagen]] (1930)\n* Venice (13th Biennale) and [[Los Angeles]] (1932)\n* [[Moscow]], [[Edinburgh]], and [[San Francisco]] (1933)\n* New York (1933)\n* [[Berlin]] (1936)\n* [[Pittsburgh]] (1938)\n* [[Ottawa]] (1942)\n* [[Detroit]] (1945) \n* [[Montreal]] (1954). \nAmong the many awards he received were:\n* President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] prize 1930\n* Golden laurel of ''Polska Akademia Literatury'' 1937\n* Gold Medal for his ''Wiosna w g\u00f3rach'' [\"Spring in the mountains\"] at the Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] 1937\n* ''The Visual Arts Prize'' of Paris-based Polish-language monthly, ''[[Kultura]]'' 1962.<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\n== Selected written work ==\nIn his writing Rafa\u0142 Malczewski evoked the atmosphere of [[Interbellum Poland|interbellum]] Zakopane:\n* ''Od cepra do wariata'', [From Lowland Dweller to Madman]\n* ''Narkotyk g\u00f3r.

He went on to study film at [[The University of Southern California]] alongside other notable directors [[George Lucas]], [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[John Carpenter]]. Franklin was a devotee of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] (ever since he saw ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' at the age of 12), and his attempt to arrange for a screening of Hitchcock's ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) at USC resulted in a phone-call from Hitchcock himself.

He directed four episodes of the Australian police drama ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'' before directing the bawdy 1975 sex comedy feature ''[[The True Story of Eskimo Nell]]'' and the 1976 soft-core pornography feature ''[[Fantasm]]''. Franklin's next film was the cult horror movie ''[[Patrick (1978 film)|Patrick]]'' (1978), written by [[Everett De Roche]], about a man in a coma who uses telekinesis to create murder and mayhem in a hospital. Franklin gave De Roche a copy of the screenplay of Alfred Hitchcock's ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), and De Roche suggested a movie with the plot of ''Rear Window'' taking place in a moving vehicle. The result was ''[[Roadgames]]'' (1981), directed by Franklin from a screenplay by De Roche. Filmed and set in Australia, and starring American actors [[Stacy Keach]] and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (the latter of whom Franklin met whilst visiting his one-time USC classmate John Carpenter on the set of ''[[The Fog]]''), ''Roadgames'' was the most expensive Australian movie ever made at the time of its release in 1981.<ref name=\"atdd\" />\n\n===US films===\nAfter moving to Hollywood, Richard Franklin directed ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' (1983), the first sequel to Hitchcock's 1960 classic ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', with [[Anthony Perkins]] reprising the role of [[Norman Bates]]. The film was a financial success and received generally good reviews (it also led to a further two sequels, neither of which Franklin was involved with). Franklin then directed the 1984 spy/adventure movie ''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'', starring [[Henry Thomas]] and [[Dabney Coleman]]. The film was a remake of ''[[The Window (1949 film)|The Window]]'' (1949), which was in turn based on the short story \"The Boy Who Cried Murder\" by [[Cornell Woolrich]] (Woolrich's short story \"It Had to Be Murder\" was adapted into Hitchcock's ''Rear Window'', which was the inspiration for Franklin's ''Road Games''). \n\nFranklin was going to make ''The Lost Boys'' at one stage<ref>http://www.avclub.com/article/tom-holland-his-seminal-vampire-flick-fright-night-223200</ref> but his next film was ''[[Link (film)|Link]]'' (1986) a British horror movie (starring [[Elisabeth Shue]] and [[Terence Stamp]]) about a super-intelligent, murderous [[orangutan]]. The film reunited Franklin with screenwriter Everett De Roche. \n\nFranklin was disillusioned with Hollywood after the experience of directing the 1991 action/thriller ''[[F/X2|FX2: The Deadly Art Of Illusion]]'' (starring [[Bryan Brown]] and [[Brian Dennehy]]).\n\n===Return to Australia===\nHe returned to Australia where he filmed ''[[Hotel Sorrento]]'' (1995) and ''[[Brilliant Lies]]'' (1996).
