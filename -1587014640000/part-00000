After the fall of Kush, the [[Nubians]] formed the three Christian kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], with the latter two lasting until around 1500. Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by [[Bedouin|Arab nomads]]. From the 16th\u201319th centuries, central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the [[Sultanate of Sennar|Funj sultanate]], while [[Sultanate of Darfur|Darfur]] ruled the west and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] the far north. This period saw extensive [[Islamisation]] and [[Arabisation]].\n\nFrom 1820 to 1874 the entirety of Sudan was conquered by the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]. Between 1881 and 1885, the harsh Egyptian reign was eventually met with a successful [[Mahdist War|revolt]] led by the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]] [[Muhammad Ahmad]], resulting in the establishment of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Caliphate of Omdurman]]. This state was eventually destroyed in 1898 by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], who would then [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|govern Sudan together with Egypt]].\n\nThe 20th century saw the growth of Sudanese nationalism and in 1953 Britain granted Sudan self-government. Independence was proclaimed on 1 January 1956. Since independence, Sudan has been ruled by a series of unstable parliamentary governments and military regimes. Under [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], Sudan instituted [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in 1983.<ref name=\"sudan.gov.sd\">{{cite web |url=http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902160838/http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |archive-date=2 September 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This exacerbated the rift between the Islamic north, the seat of the government and the Animists and Christians in the [[South Sudan|south]].

It was established after the [[Bronze Age]] collapse and the disintegration of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], centered at Napata in its early phase.\n\nAfter King [[Kashta]] (\"the Kushite\") invaded Egypt in the eighth century BC, the Kushite kings ruled as pharaohs of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]] for a century before being defeated and driven out by the [[Assyria]]ns. At the height of their glory, the Kushites conquered an empire that stretched from what is now known as [[South Kordofan]] to the Sinai. Pharaoh [[Piye]] attempted to expand the empire into the Near East but was thwarted by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush is mentioned in the Bible as having saved the Israelites from the wrath of the Assyrians, although disease among the besiegers was the main reason for the failure to take the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roux, Georges |title=Ancient Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC|date= 1992|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193825-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2013}}\nThe war that took place between Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] and the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] was a decisive event in western history, with the Nubians being defeated in their attempts to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]] by Assyria. Sennacherib's successor [[Esarhaddon]] went further and invaded Egypt itself to secure his control of the Levant. This succeeded, as he managed to expel Taharqa from Lower Egypt. Taharqa fled back to Upper Egypt and Nubia, where he died two years later. Lower Egypt came under Assyrian vassalage but proved unruly, unsuccessfully rebelling against the Assyrians. Then, the king [[Tantamani]], a successor of Taharqa, made a final determined attempt to regain Lower Egypt from the newly re-instated Assyrian vassal [[Necho I]]. He managed to retake [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] killing Necho in the process and besieged cities in the Nile Delta. [[Ashurbanipal]], who had succeeded Esarhaddon,  sent a large army in Egypt to regain control. He routed Tantamani near Memphis and, pursuing him, [[Sack of Thebes|sacked Thebes]]. Although the Assyrians immediately departed Upper Egypt after these events, weakened, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Necho's son [[Psamtik I]] less than a decade later. This ended all hopes of a revival of the Nubian Empire, which rather continued in the form of a smaller kingdom centered on [[Napata]]. The city was raided by the Egyptian c. 590 BC and the Kushite resettled in [[Mero\u00eb]].\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the Nubian capital was still at Mero\u00eb. In [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Ethiopia]] (a term also used earlier by the Assyrians when encountering the Nubians). The civilization of Kush was among the first in the world to use iron smelting technology. The Nubian kingdom at Mero\u00eb persisted until the mid-fourth century AD.\n\n===Medieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350\u20131500)===\n{{main|Nobatia|Makuria|Alodia|Daju kingdom}} \n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The three Christian Nubian kingdoms.

Although technically the [[Vali (governor)|Vali]] of Egypt under the [[Ottoman Empire]], Muhammad Ali styled himself as [[Khedive]] of a virtually independent Egypt. Seeking to add Sudan to his domains, he sent his third son Ismail (not to be confused with [[Isma'il Pasha|Isma\u02bbil Pasha]] mentioned later) to conquer the country, and subsequently incorporate it into Egypt. With the exception of the Shaiqiya and the Darfur sultanate in Kordofan, he was met without resistance. The Egyptian policy of conquest was expanded and intensified by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s son, Isma\u02bbil, under whose reign most of the remainder of modern-day Sudan was conquered.\n\nThe Egyptian authorities made significant improvements to the Sudanese infrastructure (mainly in the north), especially with regard to irrigation and cotton production. In 1879, the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great Powers]] forced the removal of Ismail and established his son [[Tewfik Pasha]] in his place. Tewfik's corruption and mismanagement resulted in the [['Urabi revolt]], which threatened the Khedive's survival. Tewfik appealed for help to the British, who subsequently occupied Egypt in 1882. Sudan was left in the hands of the Khedivial government, and the mismanagement and corruption of its officials.<ref>{{cite book|last=Churchill|first=Winston|title=The River War|year=1902|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/riverwarhistoric00chur|chapter=The Rebellion of the Mahdi}}</ref><ref name=\"SlatinWingate1896\">{{cite book|author1=Rudolf Carl Freiherr von Slatin|author2=Sir Francis Reginald Wingate|title=Fire and Sword in the Sudan|url=https://archive.org/details/riverwarhistoric00chur|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=1896|publisher=E.

The Mahdiyah (Mahdist regime) imposed traditional Sharia [[Sharia|Islamic law]]s.\n\nFrom his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the [[Siege of Khartoum|fall of Khartoum]] in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a [[Mahdist War|successful military campaign]] against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan, known as the [[Turkiyah]]. Muhammad Ahmad died on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum. After a power struggle amongst his deputies, [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], with the help primarily of the [[Baggara]] of western Sudan, overcame the opposition of the others and emerged as unchallenged leader of the Mahdiyah. After consolidating his power, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad assumed the title of ''Khalifa'' (successor) of the Mahdi, instituted an administration, and appointed [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (who were usually [[Baggara]]) as emirs over each of the several provinces.\n\n[[File:Battle of Omdurman-1.JPG|thumb|250px|The flight of the Khalifa after his defeat at the [[Battle of Omdurman]].]]\n\nRegional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period, largely because of the Khalifa's brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country. In 1887, a 60,000-man Ansar army invaded [[Ethiopia]], penetrating as far as [[Gondar]]. In March 1889, king [[Yohannes IV]] of Ethiopia marched on [[Metemma]]; however, after Yohannes fell in battle, the Ethiopian forces withdrew. Abd ar Rahman an Nujumi, the Khalifa's general, attempted an invasion of Egypt in 1889, but British-led Egyptian troops defeated the Ansar at Tushkah. The failure of the Egyptian invasion broke the spell of the Ansar's invincibility. The [[Belgium|Belgians]] prevented the Mahdi's men from conquering [[Equatoria]], and in 1893, the Italians repelled an Ansar attack at [[Agordat]] (in [[Eritrea]]) and forced the Ansar to withdraw from Ethiopia.\n\nIn the 1890s, the British sought to re-establish their control over Sudan, once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, but in actuality treating the country as a British colony. By the early 1890s, British, French and Belgian claims had converged at the [[Nile]] headwaters. Britain feared that the other powers would take advantage of Sudan's instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt. Apart from these political considerations, Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at [[Aswan]]. [[Herbert Kitchener]] led military campaigns against the [[Mahdist Sudan]] from 1896 to 1898. Kitchener's campaigns culminated in a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Omdurman]] on 2 September 1898.\n\n===Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899\u20131956)===\n{{Main|Anglo-Egyptian Sudan}}\n[[File:The war in the Soudan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The [[Mahdist War]] was fought between a group of Muslim dervishes, called [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdists]], who had over-run much of Sudan, and the British forces.]]\n\nIn 1899, Britain and Egypt reached an agreement under which Sudan was run by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Humphries |first1=Christian |title=Oxford World Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0195218183 |page=[https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi00oxfo/page/644 644] |url=https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi00oxfo/page/644 }}</ref> In reality, Sudan was effectively administered as a [[Crown colony]].

In 1905 Local chieftain [[Sultan Yambio]] reluctant to the end gave up the struggle with British forces that had occupied the [[Kordofan]] region, finally ending the lawlessness. The continued British administration of Sudan fuelled an increasingly strident nationalist backlash, with Egyptian nationalist leaders determined to force Britain to recognise a single independent union of Egypt and Sudan. With a formal end to Ottoman rule in 1914, Sir [[Reginald Wingate]] was sent that December to occupy Sudan as the new Military Governor. [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] was declared [[Sultan of Egypt and Sudan]], as was his brother and successor, [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]]. They continued upon their insistence of a single Egyptian-Sudanese state even when the [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was retitled as the [[Kingdom of Egypt|Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan]], but it was [[Saad Zaghloul]] who continued to be frustrated in the ambitions until his death in 1927.<ref>M.

The [[Lee Stack|assassination of a Governor-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in Cairo]] was the causative factor; it brought demands of the newly elected [[Wafd Party|Wafd]] government from colonial forces. A permanent establishment of two battalions in Khartoum was renamed the [[Sudan Defence Force]] acting as under the government, replacing the former garrison of Egyptian army soldiers, saw action afterwards during the [[Abyssinia Crisis|Walwal Incident]].<ref>Morewood, ''The British of Egypt'', (Suffolk 2005), p.4</ref> The [[Wafdist]] parliamentary majority had rejected [[Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha|Sarwat Pasha]]'s accommodation plan with [[Austen Chamberlain]] in London; yet Cairo still needed the money. The Sudanese Government's revenue had reached a peak in 1928 at \u00a36.6 million, thereafter the Wafdist disruptions, and Italian borders incursions from Somaliland, London decided to reduce expenditure during the Great Depression. Cotton and gum exports were dwarfed by the necessity to import almost everything from Britain leading to a balance of payments deficit at Khartoum.<ref>Daly, pp.457\u201359</ref>\n\nIn July 1936 the Liberal Constitutional leader, Muhammed Mahmoud was persuaded to bring Wafd delegates to London to sign the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, \"the beginning of a new stage in Anglo-Egyptian relations\", wrote [[Anthony Eden]].<ref>Morewood, \n''The British Defence of Egypt 1935\u201340'', (Suffolk, 1940), p.94-5</ref> The British Army was allowed to return to Sudan to protect the Canal Zone.

But Mahmoud was a supporter of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]; the region was caught between the Empire's efforts to save the Jews, and moderate Arab calls to halt migration.<ref>Morewood, p.164-5</ref>\n\nThe Sudanese Government was directly involved militarily in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Formed in 1925, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] played an active part in responding to incursions early in World War Two.  Italian troops occupied [[Kassala]] and other border areas from [[Italian East Africa|Italian Somaliland]] during 1940.  In 1942, the SDF also played a part in the invasion of the Italian colony by British and Commonwealth forces.  The last British [[governor-general]] was [[Robert George Howe]].\n\nThe [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]] finally heralded the beginning of the march towards Sudanese independence. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt's new leaders, [[Mohammed Naguib]], whose mother was Sudanese, and later [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], believed the only way to end British domination in Sudan was for Egypt to officially abandon its claims of sovereignty. In addition Nasser knew it would be difficult for Egypt to govern an impoverished Sudan after its independence. The British on the other hand continued their political and financial support for the Mahdist successor, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi]], whom it was believed would resist Egyptian pressure for Sudanese independence.  Rahman was capable of this, but his regime was plagued by political ineptitude, which garnered a colossal loss of support in northern and central Sudan. Both Egypt and Britain sensed a great instability fomenting, and thus opted to allow both Sudanese regions, north and south to have a free vote on whether they wished independence or a British withdrawal.\n\n===Independence (1956\u2013present)===\n{{Main|History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|History of Sudan (1969\u201385)|History of Sudan (1986\u2013present)}}\n{{Missing information|section|the history of Sudan between 1956 and 1969 and between 1977 and 1989|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Sudan independence 2.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Sudan's flag raised at independence ceremony on 1 January 1956 by the Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari and in presence of opposition leader Mohamed Ahmed Almahjoub]] \nA polling process was carried out resulting in composition of a democratic parliament and [[Ismail al-Azhari]] was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035130/http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archivedate=20 November 2008 |title=Brief History of the Sudan |publisher=Sudan Embassy in London |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister [[Ismail al-Azhari]].\n\nDissatisfaction culminated in a second [[1969 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 25 May 1969. The coup leader, Col. [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], became prime minister, and the new regime abolished parliament and outlawed all political parties. Disputes between [[Marxist]] and non-Marxist elements within the ruling military coalition resulted in [[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|a briefly successful coup in July 1971]], led by the [[Sudanese Communist Party]]. Several days later, anti-communist military elements restored Nimeiry to power.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] led to a cessation of the north\u2013south civil war and a degree of self-rule. This led to ten years hiatus in the civil war but an end to American investment in the [[Jonglei Canal]] project.  This had been considered absolutely essential to irrigate the Upper Nile region and to prevent an environmental catastrophe and wide-scale famine among the local tribes, most especially the Dinka. In the civil war that followed their homeland was raided, looted, pillaged and burned.  Many of the tribe were murdered in a bloody civil war that raged for over 20 years.\n\n[[File:Hashem al Atta, 1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat.jpg|thumb|[[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat]]]]\nUntil the early 1970s, Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose. In 1978, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government. This further promoted the mechanised export agriculture sector. This caused great hardship for the pastoralists of Sudan (see [[Nuba peoples#Effect of private agriculture schemes|Nuba peoples]]).

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes both Arab and non-Arab Muslims in the north and east, especially those in the Khatmia Sufi sect.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Further|Music of Sudan|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan|List of Sudanese writers}}\nSudanese culture melds the behaviors, practices, and beliefs of about 578 ethnic groups, communicating in 145 different languages, in a region microcosmic of Africa, with geographic extremes varying from sandy desert to tropical forest. Recent evidence suggests that while most citizens of the country identify strongly with both Sudan and their religion, Arab and African supranational identities are much more polarising and contested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|title=Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J.

Beginning with the imposition of strict [[Salafi]] interpretation of ''[[sharia]]'' law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like [[Mahjoub Sharif]], were imprisoned while others, like [[Mohammed el Amin]] (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and [[Mohammed Wardi]] (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional [[Z\u0101r]] ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated {{ref_label|roughguide|1|a}}. At the same time European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish [[bagpipes]], were renowned, and set traditional music to [[march (music)|military march]] music. The march ''March Shulkawi No 1'', is an example, set to the sounds of the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]]. Northern Sudan listens to different music than the rest of Sudan. A type of music called Aldlayib uses a musical instrument called the Tambur. The Tambur has five strings and is made from wood and makes music accompanied by the voices of human applause and singing artists. This music has a perfect blend that gives the area of the Northern State a special character.\n\n=== Cinema and photography===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan}}\nThe [[cinema of Sudan]] began with [[cinematography]] by the [[History of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|British colonial presence]] in the early 20th century. After independence in 1956, a vigorous documentary film tradition was established, but financial pressures and serious constraints imposed by the [[Islamism|Islamist]] government led to the decline of filmmaking from the 1990s onwards. Since the 2010s, several initiatives have shown an encouraging revival of filmmaking and public interest in film shows and festivals, albeit limited mainly to Khartoum.\n\nThe use of [[Photography of Sudan|photography in Sudan]] goes back to the 1880s and the [[Turkish Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian rule]]. As in other countries, the growing importance of photography for [[mass media]] like newspapers, as well as for amateur photographers led to a wider photographic [[documentation]] and [[Photojournalism#Golden age|use of photographs]] in Sudan during the 20th century and beyond. In the 21st century, photography in Sudan has undergone important changes, mainly due to [[digital photography]] and distribution through [[social media]] and the [[internet]].\n\n===Sport===\nThe most popular sports in Sudan are athletics ([[track and field]]) and [[Association football|football]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Though not as successful as football, [[basketball]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[volleyball]] are also popular in Sudan. In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Sudan national basketball team|national basketball team]] finished among the continent's top teams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Nowadays, it is only a minor force.\n\nSudanese football has a long history. Sudan was one of the four African nations \u2013 the others being Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa \u2013 which formed African football. Sudan hosted the first [[African Cup of Nations]] in 1956, and has won the African Cup of Nations once, in 1970. Two years later, the Sudan's National Football Team participated in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]]. The [[Khartoum|nation's capital]] is home to the Khartoum League, which is considered to be the oldest football league in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSudanese football teams such as [[Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman)|Al-Hilal]], [[Al-Merrikh SC|Al-Merrikh]], and Abdelgadir Osman FC are among the nation's strongest teams. Other teams like Khartoum, El-Neel, [[Al-Nidal El-Nahud]] and [[Hay-Al Arab]], are also starting to grow in popularity.\n\n===Clothing===\nMost Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn by Sudanese men is the [[jalabiya|galabiya]], which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to [[Egypt]]. The galabiya is often accompanied by a large turban and a scarf, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.\n\nThe most common dress for Sudanese women is the ''thobe'' or ''[[thawb]]'', pronounced ''tobe'' in Sudanese dialect. The thobe is a white or colorful long one piece cloth that women wrap around their inner garments, usually covering their head and hair. \n\nDue to a 1991 penal code, women cannot wear trousers in public because it is interpreted as an \"obscene outfit.\" A woman was facing up to 40 lashes for wearing trousers, but after being found guilty she was fined the equivalent of 200 U.S. dollars instead.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/world/africa/08sudan.html?_r=0| work=The New York Times | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Gettleman | first2=Waleed | last2=Arafat | title=Sudan Court Fines Woman for Wearing Trousers | date=8 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Sudan}}\n[[File:Faculty of Science (University of Khartoum) 002.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Khartoum University]] established in 1902]]\nEducation in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years, although more than 40% of children are not going to schools due to the economic situation.

After the fall of Kush, the [[Nubians]] formed the three Christian kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], with the latter two lasting until around 1500. Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by [[Bedouin|Arab nomads]]. From the 16th\u201319th centuries, central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the [[Sultanate of Sennar|Funj sultanate]], while [[Sultanate of Darfur|Darfur]] ruled the west and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] the far north. This period saw extensive [[Islamisation]] and [[Arabisation]].\n\nFrom 1820 to 1874 the entirety of Sudan was conquered by the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]. Between 1881 and 1885, the harsh Egyptian reign was eventually met with a successful [[Mahdist War|revolt]] led by the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]] [[Muhammad Ahmad]], resulting in the establishment of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Caliphate of Omdurman]]. This state was eventually destroyed in 1898 by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], who would then [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|govern Sudan together with Egypt]].\n\nThe 20th century saw the growth of Sudanese nationalism and in 1953 Britain granted Sudan self-government. Independence was proclaimed on 1 January 1956. Since independence, Sudan has been ruled by a series of unstable parliamentary governments and military regimes. Under [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], Sudan instituted [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in 1983.<ref name=\"sudan.gov.sd\">{{cite web |url=http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902160838/http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |archive-date=2 September 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This exacerbated the rift between the Islamic north, the seat of the government and the Animists and Christians in the [[South Sudan|south]].

The population that resulted from this cultural and genetic mixing developed a social hierarchy over the next centuries which became the Kingdom of Kush (with the capital at Kerma) at 1700 BC. Anthropological and archaeological research indicate that during the predynastic period Nubia and Nagadan Upper Egypt were ethnically, and culturally nearly identical, and thus, simultaneously evolved systems of pharaonic kingship by 3300 BC.<ref name=\"Keita, S.O.Y. 1993 129\u201354\">{{cite journal|title = Studies and Comments on Ancient Egyptian Biological Relationships| author = Keita, S.O.Y. | year = 1993| journal=History in Africa|volume=20| issue = 7 |pages=129\u201354|jstor=317196|doi = 10.2307/3171969}}</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of Kush (c. 800 BC\u2013350 AD)===\n{{main|Kingdom of Kush|Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}\n[[File:Sudan Meroe Pyramids 2001.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Nubian pyramids]] in [[Mero\u00eb]].]]\n[[File:Xerxes detail Ethiopian.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Ku\u0161iya'' soldier of the [[Achaemenid army]], circa 480 BCE.

It was established after the [[Bronze Age]] collapse and the disintegration of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], centered at Napata in its early phase.\n\nAfter King [[Kashta]] (\"the Kushite\") invaded Egypt in the eighth century BC, the Kushite kings ruled as pharaohs of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]] for a century before being defeated and driven out by the [[Assyria]]ns. At the height of their glory, the Kushites conquered an empire that stretched from what is now known as [[South Kordofan]] to the Sinai. Pharaoh [[Piye]] attempted to expand the empire into the Near East but was thwarted by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush is mentioned in the Bible as having saved the Israelites from the wrath of the Assyrians, although disease among the besiegers was the main reason for the failure to take the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roux, Georges |title=Ancient Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC|date= 1992|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193825-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2013}}\nThe war that took place between Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] and the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] was a decisive event in western history, with the Nubians being defeated in their attempts to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]] by Assyria. Sennacherib's successor [[Esarhaddon]] went further and invaded Egypt itself to secure his control of the Levant. This succeeded, as he managed to expel Taharqa from Lower Egypt. Taharqa fled back to Upper Egypt and Nubia, where he died two years later. Lower Egypt came under Assyrian vassalage but proved unruly, unsuccessfully rebelling against the Assyrians. Then, the king [[Tantamani]], a successor of Taharqa, made a final determined attempt to regain Lower Egypt from the newly re-instated Assyrian vassal [[Necho I]]. He managed to retake [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] killing Necho in the process and besieged cities in the Nile Delta. [[Ashurbanipal]], who had succeeded Esarhaddon,  sent a large army in Egypt to regain control. He routed Tantamani near Memphis and, pursuing him, [[Sack of Thebes|sacked Thebes]]. Although the Assyrians immediately departed Upper Egypt after these events, weakened, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Necho's son [[Psamtik I]] less than a decade later. This ended all hopes of a revival of the Nubian Empire, which rather continued in the form of a smaller kingdom centered on [[Napata]]. The city was raided by the Egyptian c. 590 BC and the Kushite resettled in [[Mero\u00eb]].\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the Nubian capital was still at Mero\u00eb. In [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Ethiopia]] (a term also used earlier by the Assyrians when encountering the Nubians). The civilization of Kush was among the first in the world to use iron smelting technology. The Nubian kingdom at Mero\u00eb persisted until the mid-fourth century AD.\n\n===Medieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350\u20131500)===\n{{main|Nobatia|Makuria|Alodia|Daju kingdom}} \n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The three Christian Nubian kingdoms.

Although technically the [[Vali (governor)|Vali]] of Egypt under the [[Ottoman Empire]], Muhammad Ali styled himself as [[Khedive]] of a virtually independent Egypt. Seeking to add Sudan to his domains, he sent his third son Ismail (not to be confused with [[Isma'il Pasha|Isma\u02bbil Pasha]] mentioned later) to conquer the country, and subsequently incorporate it into Egypt. With the exception of the Shaiqiya and the Darfur sultanate in Kordofan, he was met without resistance. The Egyptian policy of conquest was expanded and intensified by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s son, Isma\u02bbil, under whose reign most of the remainder of modern-day Sudan was conquered.\n\nThe Egyptian authorities made significant improvements to the Sudanese infrastructure (mainly in the north), especially with regard to irrigation and cotton production. In 1879, the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great Powers]] forced the removal of Ismail and established his son [[Tewfik Pasha]] in his place. Tewfik's corruption and mismanagement resulted in the [['Urabi revolt]], which threatened the Khedive's survival. Tewfik appealed for help to the British, who subsequently occupied Egypt in 1882. Sudan was left in the hands of the Khedivial government, and the mismanagement and corruption of its officials.<ref>{{cite book|last=Churchill|first=Winston|title=The River War|year=1902|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/riverwarhistoric00chur|chapter=The Rebellion of the Mahdi}}</ref><ref name=\"SlatinWingate1896\">{{cite book|author1=Rudolf Carl Freiherr von Slatin|author2=Sir Francis Reginald Wingate|title=Fire and Sword in the Sudan|url=https://archive.org/details/riverwarhistoric00chur|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=1896|publisher=E.

The Mahdiyah (Mahdist regime) imposed traditional Sharia [[Sharia|Islamic law]]s.\n\nFrom his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the [[Siege of Khartoum|fall of Khartoum]] in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a [[Mahdist War|successful military campaign]] against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan, known as the [[Turkiyah]]. Muhammad Ahmad died on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum. After a power struggle amongst his deputies, [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], with the help primarily of the [[Baggara]] of western Sudan, overcame the opposition of the others and emerged as unchallenged leader of the Mahdiyah. After consolidating his power, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad assumed the title of ''Khalifa'' (successor) of the Mahdi, instituted an administration, and appointed [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (who were usually [[Baggara]]) as emirs over each of the several provinces.\n\n[[File:Battle of Omdurman-1.JPG|thumb|250px|The flight of the Khalifa after his defeat at the [[Battle of Omdurman]].]]\n\nRegional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period, largely because of the Khalifa's brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country. In 1887, a 60,000-man Ansar army invaded [[Ethiopia]], penetrating as far as [[Gondar]]. In March 1889, king [[Yohannes IV]] of Ethiopia marched on [[Metemma]]; however, after Yohannes fell in battle, the Ethiopian forces withdrew. Abd ar Rahman an Nujumi, the Khalifa's general, attempted an invasion of Egypt in 1889, but British-led Egyptian troops defeated the Ansar at Tushkah. The failure of the Egyptian invasion broke the spell of the Ansar's invincibility. The [[Belgium|Belgians]] prevented the Mahdi's men from conquering [[Equatoria]], and in 1893, the Italians repelled an Ansar attack at [[Agordat]] (in [[Eritrea]]) and forced the Ansar to withdraw from Ethiopia.\n\nIn the 1890s, the British sought to re-establish their control over Sudan, once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, but in actuality treating the country as a British colony. By the early 1890s, British, French and Belgian claims had converged at the [[Nile]] headwaters. Britain feared that the other powers would take advantage of Sudan's instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt. Apart from these political considerations, Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at [[Aswan]]. [[Herbert Kitchener]] led military campaigns against the [[Mahdist Sudan]] from 1896 to 1898. Kitchener's campaigns culminated in a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Omdurman]] on 2 September 1898.\n\n===Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899\u20131956)===\n{{Main|Anglo-Egyptian Sudan}}\n[[File:The war in the Soudan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The [[Mahdist War]] was fought between a group of Muslim dervishes, called [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdists]], who had over-run much of Sudan, and the British forces.]]\n\nIn 1899, Britain and Egypt reached an agreement under which Sudan was run by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Humphries |first1=Christian |title=Oxford World Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0195218183 |page=[https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi00oxfo/page/644 644] |url=https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi00oxfo/page/644 }}</ref> In reality, Sudan was effectively administered as a [[Crown colony]].

In 1905 Local chieftain [[Sultan Yambio]] reluctant to the end gave up the struggle with British forces that had occupied the [[Kordofan]] region, finally ending the lawlessness. The continued British administration of Sudan fuelled an increasingly strident nationalist backlash, with Egyptian nationalist leaders determined to force Britain to recognise a single independent union of Egypt and Sudan. With a formal end to Ottoman rule in 1914, Sir [[Reginald Wingate]] was sent that December to occupy Sudan as the new Military Governor. [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] was declared [[Sultan of Egypt and Sudan]], as was his brother and successor, [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]]. They continued upon their insistence of a single Egyptian-Sudanese state even when the [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was retitled as the [[Kingdom of Egypt|Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan]], but it was [[Saad Zaghloul]] who continued to be frustrated in the ambitions until his death in 1927.<ref>M.

The [[Lee Stack|assassination of a Governor-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in Cairo]] was the causative factor; it brought demands of the newly elected [[Wafd Party|Wafd]] government from colonial forces. A permanent establishment of two battalions in Khartoum was renamed the [[Sudan Defence Force]] acting as under the government, replacing the former garrison of Egyptian army soldiers, saw action afterwards during the [[Abyssinia Crisis|Walwal Incident]].<ref>Morewood, ''The British of Egypt'', (Suffolk 2005), p.4</ref> The [[Wafdist]] parliamentary majority had rejected [[Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha|Sarwat Pasha]]'s accommodation plan with [[Austen Chamberlain]] in London; yet Cairo still needed the money. The Sudanese Government's revenue had reached a peak in 1928 at \u00a36.6 million, thereafter the Wafdist disruptions, and Italian borders incursions from Somaliland, London decided to reduce expenditure during the Great Depression. Cotton and gum exports were dwarfed by the necessity to import almost everything from Britain leading to a balance of payments deficit at Khartoum.<ref>Daly, pp.457\u201359</ref>\n\nIn July 1936 the Liberal Constitutional leader, Muhammed Mahmoud was persuaded to bring Wafd delegates to London to sign the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, \"the beginning of a new stage in Anglo-Egyptian relations\", wrote [[Anthony Eden]].<ref>Morewood, \n''The British Defence of Egypt 1935\u201340'', (Suffolk, 1940), p.94-5</ref> The British Army was allowed to return to Sudan to protect the Canal Zone.

But Mahmoud was a supporter of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]; the region was caught between the Empire's efforts to save the Jews, and moderate Arab calls to halt migration.<ref>Morewood, p.164-5</ref>\n\nThe Sudanese Government was directly involved militarily in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Formed in 1925, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] played an active part in responding to incursions early in World War Two.  Italian troops occupied [[Kassala]] and other border areas from [[Italian East Africa|Italian Somaliland]] during 1940.  In 1942, the SDF also played a part in the invasion of the Italian colony by British and Commonwealth forces.  The last British [[governor-general]] was [[Robert George Howe]].\n\nThe [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]] finally heralded the beginning of the march towards Sudanese independence. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt's new leaders, [[Mohammed Naguib]], whose mother was Sudanese, and later [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], believed the only way to end British domination in Sudan was for Egypt to officially abandon its claims of sovereignty. In addition Nasser knew it would be difficult for Egypt to govern an impoverished Sudan after its independence. The British on the other hand continued their political and financial support for the Mahdist successor, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi]], whom it was believed would resist Egyptian pressure for Sudanese independence.  Rahman was capable of this, but his regime was plagued by political ineptitude, which garnered a colossal loss of support in northern and central Sudan. Both Egypt and Britain sensed a great instability fomenting, and thus opted to allow both Sudanese regions, north and south to have a free vote on whether they wished independence or a British withdrawal.\n\n===Independence (1956\u2013present)===\n{{Main|History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|History of Sudan (1969\u201385)|History of Sudan (1986\u2013present)}}\n{{Missing information|section|the history of Sudan between 1956 and 1969 and between 1977 and 1989|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Sudan independence 2.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Sudan's flag raised at independence ceremony on 1 January 1956 by the Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari and in presence of opposition leader Mohamed Ahmed Almahjoub]] \nA polling process was carried out resulting in composition of a democratic parliament and [[Ismail al-Azhari]] was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035130/http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archivedate=20 November 2008 |title=Brief History of the Sudan |publisher=Sudan Embassy in London |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister [[Ismail al-Azhari]].\n\nDissatisfaction culminated in a second [[1969 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 25 May 1969. The coup leader, Col. [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], became prime minister, and the new regime abolished parliament and outlawed all political parties. Disputes between [[Marxist]] and non-Marxist elements within the ruling military coalition resulted in [[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|a briefly successful coup in July 1971]], led by the [[Sudanese Communist Party]]. Several days later, anti-communist military elements restored Nimeiry to power.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] led to a cessation of the north\u2013south civil war and a degree of self-rule. This led to ten years hiatus in the civil war but an end to American investment in the [[Jonglei Canal]] project.  This had been considered absolutely essential to irrigate the Upper Nile region and to prevent an environmental catastrophe and wide-scale famine among the local tribes, most especially the Dinka. In the civil war that followed their homeland was raided, looted, pillaged and burned.  Many of the tribe were murdered in a bloody civil war that raged for over 20 years.\n\n[[File:Hashem al Atta, 1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat.jpg|thumb|[[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat]]]]\nUntil the early 1970s, Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose. In 1978, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government. This further promoted the mechanised export agriculture sector. This caused great hardship for the pastoralists of Sudan (see [[Nuba peoples#Effect of private agriculture schemes|Nuba peoples]]).

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes both Arab and non-Arab Muslims in the north and east, especially those in the Khatmia Sufi sect.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Further|Music of Sudan|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan|List of Sudanese writers}}\nSudanese culture melds the behaviors, practices, and beliefs of about 578 ethnic groups, communicating in 145 different languages, in a region microcosmic of Africa, with geographic extremes varying from sandy desert to tropical forest. Recent evidence suggests that while most citizens of the country identify strongly with both Sudan and their religion, Arab and African supranational identities are much more polarising and contested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|title=Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J.

Beginning with the imposition of strict [[Salafi]] interpretation of ''[[sharia]]'' law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like [[Mahjoub Sharif]], were imprisoned while others, like [[Mohammed el Amin]] (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and [[Mohammed Wardi]] (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional [[Z\u0101r]] ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated {{ref_label|roughguide|1|a}}. At the same time European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish [[bagpipes]], were renowned, and set traditional music to [[march (music)|military march]] music. The march ''March Shulkawi No 1'', is an example, set to the sounds of the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]]. Northern Sudan listens to different music than the rest of Sudan. A type of music called Aldlayib uses a musical instrument called the Tambur. The Tambur has five strings and is made from wood and makes music accompanied by the voices of human applause and singing artists. This music has a perfect blend that gives the area of the Northern State a special character.\n\n=== Cinema and photography===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan}}\nThe [[cinema of Sudan]] began with [[cinematography]] by the [[History of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|British colonial presence]] in the early 20th century. After independence in 1956, a vigorous documentary film tradition was established, but financial pressures and serious constraints imposed by the [[Islamism|Islamist]] government led to the decline of filmmaking from the 1990s onwards. Since the 2010s, several initiatives have shown an encouraging revival of filmmaking and public interest in film shows and festivals, albeit limited mainly to Khartoum.\n\nThe use of [[Photography of Sudan|photography in Sudan]] goes back to the 1880s and the [[Turkish Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian rule]]. As in other countries, the growing importance of photography for [[mass media]] like newspapers, as well as for amateur photographers led to a wider photographic [[documentation]] and [[Photojournalism#Golden age|use of photographs]] in Sudan during the 20th century and beyond. In the 21st century, photography in Sudan has undergone important changes, mainly due to [[digital photography]] and distribution through [[social media]] and the [[internet]].\n\n===Sport===\nThe most popular sports in Sudan are athletics ([[track and field]]) and [[Association football|football]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Though not as successful as football, [[basketball]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[volleyball]] are also popular in Sudan. In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Sudan national basketball team|national basketball team]] finished among the continent's top teams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Nowadays, it is only a minor force.\n\nSudanese football has a long history. Sudan was one of the four African nations \u2013 the others being Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa \u2013 which formed African football. Sudan hosted the first [[African Cup of Nations]] in 1956, and has won the African Cup of Nations once, in 1970. Two years later, the Sudan's National Football Team participated in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]]. The [[Khartoum|nation's capital]] is home to the Khartoum League, which is considered to be the oldest football league in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSudanese football teams such as [[Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman)|Al-Hilal]], [[Al-Merrikh SC|Al-Merrikh]], and Abdelgadir Osman FC are among the nation's strongest teams. Other teams like Khartoum, El-Neel, [[Al-Nidal El-Nahud]] and [[Hay-Al Arab]], are also starting to grow in popularity.\n\n===Clothing===\nMost Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn by Sudanese men is the [[jalabiya|galabiya]], which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to [[Egypt]]. The galabiya is often accompanied by a large turban and a scarf, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.\n\nThe most common dress for Sudanese women is the ''thobe'' or ''[[thawb]]'', pronounced ''tobe'' in Sudanese dialect. The thobe is a white or colorful long one piece cloth that women wrap around their inner garments, usually covering their head and hair. \n\nDue to a 1991 penal code, women cannot wear trousers in public because it is interpreted as an \"obscene outfit.\" A woman was facing up to 40 lashes for wearing trousers, but after being found guilty she was fined the equivalent of 200 U.S. dollars instead.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/world/africa/08sudan.html?_r=0| work=The New York Times | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Gettleman | first2=Waleed | last2=Arafat | title=Sudan Court Fines Woman for Wearing Trousers | date=8 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Sudan}}\n[[File:Faculty of Science (University of Khartoum) 002.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Khartoum University]] established in 1902]]\nEducation in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years, although more than 40% of children are not going to schools due to the economic situation.

In the 1850s, after decades of urban growth under [[East India Company]] and [[British Raj]], the city's population reached half a million. The urban area then covered mostly the southern extension of Mumbai peninsula, the population density was over 10 times higher than London at that time.<ref name=jn2010>Jan Nijman, A STUDY OF SPACE IN MUMBAI'S SLUMS, Tijdschrift Voor economic en social geographies, Volume 101, Issue 1, pages 4\u201317, February 2010</ref>\n\n[[File:Shanty dwellings, Railway tracks and Mosque in Dharavi Slum Mumbai India February 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Shanty dwellings next to railway tracks in Dharavi (about 2010). A mosque inside the slum is visible. The railway network provides mass transit to the slum residents.]]\nThe most polluting industries were tanneries, and the first tannery moved from peninsular Mumbai into Dharavi in 1887. People who worked with leather, typically a profession of lowest Hindu castes and of Muslim Indians, moved into Dharavi. Other early settlers included the Kumbars, a large Gujarati community of potters (another polluting industry). The colonial government granted them a 99-year land-lease in 1895. Rural migrants looking for jobs poured into Mumbai, and its population soared past 1 million. Other artisans, like the [[embroidery]] workers from [[Uttar Pradesh]], started the ready-made garments trade.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /> These industries created jobs, labor moved in, but there was no government effort to plan or invest in any infrastructure in or near Dharavi. The living quarters and small scale factories grew haphazardly, without provision for sanitation, drains, safe drinking water, roads or other basic services. But some ethnic, caste and religious communities that have settled in Dharavi at that time helped build the settlement of Dharavi, by forming organizations and political parties, building school and temples, constructing homes and factories.<ref name=\":0\" /> Dharavi's first mosque, Badi Masjid, started in 1887 and the oldest Hindu temple, Ganesh Mandir, was built in 1913.<ref name=jn2010 />\n\n===Post-independence===\nAt India's independence from colonial rule in 1947, Dharavi had grown to be the largest slum in Mumbai and all of India.

The urban area then covered mostly the southern extension of Mumbai peninsula, the population density was over 10 times higher than London at that time.<ref name=jn2010>Jan Nijman, A STUDY OF SPACE IN MUMBAI'S SLUMS, Tijdschrift Voor economic en social geographies, Volume 101, Issue 1, pages 4\u201317, February 2010</ref>\n\n[[File:Shanty dwellings, Railway tracks and Mosque in Dharavi Slum Mumbai India February 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Shanty dwellings next to railway tracks in Dharavi (about 2010).

People who worked with leather, typically a profession of lowest Hindu castes and of Muslim Indians, moved into Dharavi. Other early settlers included the Kumbars, a large Gujarati community of potters (another polluting industry). The colonial government granted them a 99-year land-lease in 1895. Rural migrants looking for jobs poured into Mumbai, and its population soared past 1 million. Other artisans, like the [[embroidery]] workers from [[Uttar Pradesh]], started the ready-made garments trade.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /> These industries created jobs, labor moved in, but there was no government effort to plan or invest in any infrastructure in or near Dharavi. The living quarters and small scale factories grew haphazardly, without provision for sanitation, drains, safe drinking water, roads or other basic services. But some ethnic, caste and religious communities that have settled in Dharavi at that time helped build the settlement of Dharavi, by forming organizations and political parties, building school and temples, constructing homes and factories.<ref name=\":0\" /> Dharavi's first mosque, Badi Masjid, started in 1887 and the oldest Hindu temple, Ganesh Mandir, was built in 1913.<ref name=jn2010 />\n\n===Post-independence===\nAt India's independence from colonial rule in 1947, Dharavi had grown to be the largest slum in Mumbai and all of India.

Concerns have also been raised by residents who fear that some of their small businesses in the \"informal\" sector may not be relocated under the redevelopment plan. Due to this opposition, a trust has been proposed called the Dharavi Community Land Trust that will be made up of community members, landowners, and neighborhood associations.\n\nIn 2008 German students Jens Kaercher and Lucas Schwind won a Next Generation prize for their innovative redevelopment strategy designed to protect the current residents from needing to relocate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lafargeholcim-foundation.org/projects/realizing-solutions-for-the-redevelopment-of-dharavi-mumbai-in|title=Realizing solutions for the redevelopment of Dharavi, Mumbai, In|last=info@lafargeholcim-foundation.org|first=LafargeHolcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction|website=LafargeHolcim Foundation website|access-date=20 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820235021/https://www.lafargeholcim-foundation.org/projects/realizing-solutions-for-the-redevelopment-of-dharavi-mumbai-in|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOther redevelopment schemes include the \"Dharavi Masterplan\" devised by British architectural and engineering firm Foster + Partners, that proposes \"double-height spaces that create an intricate vertical landscape and reflect the community's way of life\" built-in phases that the firm says would \"eliminate the need for transit camps,\" instead catalyzing the rehabilitation of Dharavi \"from within.\"\n\nA Dubai based firm, SecLink Group, has planned to redevelop the slum into a completely new area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/business/dubai-firm-to-transform-asias-biggest-slum-1.62097740|title=Dubai firm to transform Asia's biggest slum|website=gulfnews.com|language=en|access-date=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412182103/https://gulfnews.com/business/dubai-firm-to-transform-asias-biggest-slum-1.62097740|archive-date=12 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On setting up of the SPV, the private firm will have to bring in the equity of Rs 400 crore, while the state government will invest another Rs 100 crore.

Following the empowered committee\u2019s nod, the senior state officials said that an MoU will soon be executed between the state government, and the Dharavi Redevelopment Project Authority (DRPA) and the company. With an almost estimated cost of over Rs 26,000 crore, the Dharavi makeover project is the biggest brownfield redevelopment project in India. To make the redevelopment more economically viable, the state government\u2019s plan is involving transforming the region into a hub for commercial and business activity.

Dharavi is southern end of Ward H East, and other residential and commercial areas in the Ward marked in dark blue include [[Santacruz, Mumbai|Santacruz]], [[Vile Parle]] and [[Mahim]].]]\nDharavi is a large area situated between Mumbai's two main suburban railway lines, the Western and Central Railways. To the west of Dharavi are [[Mahim]] and [[Bandra]], and to the north lies the [[Mithi River]]. The Mithi River empties into the [[Arabian Sea]] through the [[Mahim Creek]]. The area of [[Antop Hill]] lies to the east while the locality called [[Matunga]] is located in the South. Due to its location and poor sewage and drainage systems, Dharavi particularly becomes vulnerable to floods during the [[wet season]].\n\nDharavi is considered one of the largest slums in the world. The low-rise building style and narrow street structure of the area make Dharavi very cramped and confined. Like most slums, it is overpopulated. Compared to Mumbai's urban [[floor space index]] (FSI) of a range from 5 to 15, in Dharavi it is about 13.3 [[citation needed]]. Government officials are considering changing the Dharavi's floor space index to 4. Despite the expensive Mumbai lifestyle, Dharavi provides a cheap alternative where rent is as low as Rs.1,000 per month.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:An embroidery unit in Dharavi, Mumbai.jpg|thumb|left|An embroidery unit in Dharavi.]]\nIn addition to the traditional [[pottery]] and textile industries in Dharavi,<ref name=\"natgeo\" /> there is an increasingly large [[recycling]] industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of [[Mumbai]].

Water access derives from public standpipes stationed throughout the slum. Additionally, with the limited lavatories they have, they are extremely filthy and broken down to the point of being unsafe. Mahim Creek is a local river that is widely used by local residents for urination and defecation causing the spread of contagious diseases.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /> The open sewers in the city drain to the creek causing a spike in water pollutants, septic conditions, and foul odors. Due to the air pollutants, diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and asthma are common among residents. There are government proposals in regards to improving Dharavi's sanitation issues. The residents have a section where they wash their clothes in water that people defecate in. This spreads the amount of disease as doctors have to deal with over 4,000 cases of typhoid a day. There is also an average of 1 toilet per 500 people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Epidemics and other disasters==\nDharavi has experienced a long history of epidemics and natural disasters, sometimes with significant loss of lives.

Inside the huts, it is, however, very clean, and some huts share some elements of beauty.

My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day. He will be working long hours, in a thankless, difficult job, for entry level money \u2013 the way it should be. There has also been talk of my daughter joining WWE as a backstage interviewer.

He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day. He will be working long hours, in a thankless, difficult job, for entry level money \u2013 the way it should be. There has also been talk of my daughter joining WWE as a backstage interviewer. I certainly hope that turns out to be the case \u2013 but as of now, as far as I know, it's just talk.|url=https://www.facebook.com/RealMickFoley/posts/1186283561401780:0|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Foley, Dewey|Dewey Foley}}\n|Creative assistant\n|-\n|{{sort|Koskey, Ed|Ed Koskey}}<ref name=\"report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/42333-report-news-and-notes-on-changes-within-wwe-creative/|title=Report: News and notes on changes within WWE creative|last=Martin | first=Adam|date=2013-06-30|accessdate=2016-10-28|publisher=WrestleView}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Koskey, Edward|Edward Koskey}}\n|Lead writer for ''[[SmackDown]]''<ref name=\"pwinsider.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=129307|title=WWE WRITING SHUFFLE &#124; PWInsider.com|website=www.pwinsider.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sort|Baeckstrom, Jonathan|Jonathan Baeckstrom}}\n|{{sort|Baeckstrom, Jonathan|Jonathan Baeckstrom}}\n|Lead writer for ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''<ref name=\"pwinsider.com\"/>\n|-\n|{{sort|Belcastro, Joseph|Joseph Belcastro}}\n|{{sort|Belcastro, Joseph|Joseph Belcastro}}\n|Lead writer for ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]''<br>Promo trainer<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.solowrestling.com/new/66136-sawyer-fulton--en-exclusiva-estoy-seguro-de-que-wwe-tenia-cero-planes-para-mi-despues-de-la-lesion|title=Sawyer Fulton, en exclusiva: 'Estoy seguro de que WWE ten\u00eda cero planes para m\u00ed despu\u00e9s de la lesi\u00f3n'|last=[[SoloWrestling]]|date=November 28, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 28, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sortname|Ranjin|Singh|dab=wrestling}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/ranjinsingh|title=Ranjin Singh|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Kapoor, David|David Kapoor}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/2009/10/06/ranjin-singh/|title=Ranjin Singh|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2016-12-23|date=October 6, 2009}}</ref>\n|Senior VP of Creative<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailysmark.com/podcast/ZAgH0W-episode-90-kaz-byke|title=Episode 90: Kaz Byke|website=The Daily Smark|accessdate=March 27, 2019}}</ref><!-- Podcast with former writer Kazeem Famuyide -->\n|-\n|{{sort|Ward, Ryan|Ryan Ward}}<ref name=\"report\"/>\n|{{sort|Ward, Ryan|Ryan Ward}}\n|Writer for ''[[SmackDown]]''<br>Inactive<ref name=\"pwinsider.com\"/>\n|}\n\n===Music department===\n{{See also|WWE Music Group}}<!--This list should be followed according to wwe.com-->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:65%;\"\n|-\n!width=15%|Name\n!width=25%|Notes\n|-\n|{{sort|Lawi, Neil|Neil Lawi}}<ref>{{cite web |title=WWE Launches The WWE Music Group, Neil Lawi Named General Manager |url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/company-news/2006/03-27-2006c |website=www.corporate.wwe.com |accessdate=10 August 2018 }}</ref>\n|Senior VP/GM of [[WWE Music Group]]\n|-\n|{{sort|Williams, Josiah|Josiah Williams}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wrestle-and-flow-josiah-williams-joins-wwe-universe|title=Wrestle and Flow's Josiah Williams joins WWE|author=WWE.com Staff|publisher=WWE.com|date=2019-04-06|accessdate=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n|On-Air Digital Talent\n|}\n\n===Producers===\n[[File:Michael PS Hayes.png|thumb|175px|[[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]]]]<!--This list should be followed according to wwe.com-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:65%;\"\n|-\n!width=19%|Ring name\n!width=19%|Real name\n!width=27%|Notes\n|-\n|{{sortname|Adam|Pearce}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/adam-pearce-road-wwe|title=How Adam Pearce became a coach at the WWE Performance Center|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Pearce, Adam|Adam Pearce}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/93838/samoa-joenxt-thoughts-another-new-wwe-signing-taz-lana-owens-vs-cena-and-much-more.html?p=1|title=SAMOA JOE-NXT THOUGHTS, ANOTHER NEW WWE SIGNING, TAZ, LANA, OWENS VS.
