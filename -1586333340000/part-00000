The gastric fundus then serves as the leading point of herniation. Although type II hernias are associated with reflux disease, their primary clinical significance lies in the potential for mechanical complications. '''(D)'''\n\n'''Type III:''' Type III hernias have elements of both types I and II hernias. With progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal ligament stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm, thereby adding a sliding element to the type II hernia.\n\n'''Type IV:''' Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal ligament, allowing other organs, such as colon, spleen, pancreas and small intestine to enter the hernia sac.\n\nThe end stage of type I and type II hernias occurs when the whole stomach migrates up into the chest by rotating 180\u00b0 around its longitudinal axis, with the cardia and pylorus as fixed points. In this situation the abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stomach.\n\n== Treatment ==\n\nGeneral advice is only for relief of the symptoms:\n\n*Raise the head of your bed about 15 cm and lie on your left side, that way the stomach contents cannot come up into your esophagus as easily.\n*If you are overweight, try to slim.\n*Avoid types of food and drink that you know cause you problems.\n*Drink water after every bite.\n*Avoid bending forwards and lifting heavy weights.\n\nMedicines (eg PPI) can provide good symptom relief. Home remedies, lifestyle adjustments and medications are symptom relief and can not treat the underlying cause of the symptoms. Hiatus hernia means the diaphragm is weakened. Scientific studies show that neuromuscular training is effective as it strengthens the internal muscles and by getting stronger internal muscles you do something about the underlying cause.\n\nIn some unusual instances, as when the hiatal hernia is unusually large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it may cause [[esophageal stricture]] or severe discomfort. About 5% of hiatal hernias are paraesophageal. If symptoms from such a hernia are severe for example if chronic acid reflux threatens to severely injure the [[esophagus]] or is causing [[Barrett's esophagus]], [[surgery]] is sometimes recommended. However surgery has its own risks including death and disability, so that even for large or paraesophageal hernias, watchful waiting may on balance be safer and cause fewer problems than surgery.<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\">{{cite journal | pmc = 1422604 | pmid=12368678 | doi=10.1097/00000658-200210000-00012 | volume=236 | issue=4 | title=Paraesophageal hernias: operation or observation? |vauthors=Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW| journal=Ann Surg | pages=492\u2013500 | year=2002 }}</ref> Complications from surgical procedures to correct a hiatal hernia may include [[gas bloat syndrome]], [[dysphagia]] (trouble swallowing), [[Gastric dumping syndrome|dumping syndrome]], excessive scarring, and rarely, [[achalasia]].<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\"/>  Surgical procedures sometimes fail over time, requiring a second surgery to make repairs.\n\nOne surgical procedure used is called [[Nissen fundoplication]]. In fundoplication, the [[gastric fundus]] (upper part) of the stomach is wrapped, or plicated, around the inferior part of the esophagus, preventing herniation of the stomach through the hiatus in the diaphragm and the reflux of [[gastric acid]]. In such an operation the stomach is sewn fast under the diaphragm, which contributes to unwanted side-effects. If, for example, a person needs to vomit after such an operation this cannot happen in a natural way, hospitalisation is required and a catheter is inserted down to the stomach to empty the contents. The procedure is now commonly performed [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopically]]. With proper patient selection, laparoscopic [[fundoplication]] recent studies have indicated relatively low complication rates, quick recovery, and relatively good long term results.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Migaczewski M, P\u0119dziwiatr M, Mat\u0142ok M, Budzy\u0144ski A |title=Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in the treatment of Barrett's esophagus \u2014 10 years of experience |journal=Wideochir Inne Tech Maloinwazyjne |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=139\u201345 |year=2013 |pmid=23837098 |pmc=3699774 |doi=10.5114/wiitm.2011.32941 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Witteman BP, Strijkers R, de Vries E, Toemen L, Conchillo JM, Hameeteman W, Dagnelie PC, Koek GH, Bouvy ND |title=Transoral incisionless fundoplication for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease in clinical practice |journal=Surg Endosc |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=3307\u201315 |year=2012 |pmid=22648098 |pmc=3472060 |doi=10.1007/s00464-012-2324-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ozmen V, Oran ES, Gorgun E, Asoglu O, Igci A, Kecer M, Dizdaroglu F |title=Histologic and clinical outcome after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus |journal=Surg Endosc |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=226\u20139 |year=2006 |pmid=16362470 |doi=10.1007/s00464-005-0434-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Abbas AE, Deschamps C, Cassivi SD, Allen MS, Nichols FC, Miller DL, Pairolero PC |title=Barrett's esophagus: the role of laparoscopic fundoplication |journal=Ann.

The gastric fundus then serves as the leading point of herniation. Although type II hernias are associated with reflux disease, their primary clinical significance lies in the potential for mechanical complications. '''(D)'''\n\n'''Type III:''' Type III hernias have elements of both types I and II hernias. With progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal ligament stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm, thereby adding a sliding element to the type II hernia.\n\n'''Type IV:''' Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal ligament, allowing other organs, such as colon, spleen, pancreas and small intestine to enter the hernia sac.\n\nThe end stage of type I and type II hernias occurs when the whole stomach migrates up into the chest by rotating 180\u00b0 around its longitudinal axis, with the cardia and pylorus as fixed points. In this situation the abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stomach.\n\n== Treatment ==\nIn the great majority of cases, sufferers experience no life-altering discomfort, and no treatment is required. If there is pain or discomfort, 3 or 4 sips of room temperature water will usually relieve the pain. Symptomatic patients should elevate the head of their beds and avoid lying down directly after meals.<ref name=BMJ2014/> If the condition has been brought on by stress, [[stress management|stress reduction techniques]] may be prescribed, or if overweight, [[weight loss]] may be indicated.  Antisecretory drugs like [[proton pump inhibitors]] and [[histamine H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub> receptor]] blockers can be used to reduce acid secretion.  Medications that reduce the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES) pressure should be avoided.\n\nHowever, in some unusual instances, as when the hiatal hernia is unusually large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it may cause [[esophageal stricture]] or severe discomfort. About 5% of hiatal hernias are paraesophageal. If symptoms from such a hernia are severe for example if chronic acid reflux threatens to severely injure the [[esophagus]] or is causing [[Barrett's esophagus]], [[surgery]] is sometimes recommended. However surgery has its own risks including death and disability, so that even for large or paraesophageal hernias, watchful waiting may on balance be safer and cause fewer problems than surgery.<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\">{{cite journal | pmc = 1422604 | pmid=12368678 | doi=10.1097/00000658-200210000-00012 | volume=236 | issue=4 | title=Paraesophageal hernias: operation or observation? |vauthors=Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW| journal=Ann Surg | pages=492\u2013500 | year=2002 }}</ref> Complications from surgical procedures to correct a hiatal hernia may include [[gas bloat syndrome]], [[dysphagia]] (trouble swallowing), [[Gastric dumping syndrome|dumping syndrome]], excessive scarring, and rarely, [[achalasia]].<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\"/>  Surgical procedures sometimes fail over time, requiring a second surgery to make repairs.\n\nOne surgical procedure used is called [[Nissen fundoplication]]. In fundoplication, the [[gastric fundus]] (upper part) of the stomach is wrapped, or plicated, around the inferior part of the esophagus, preventing herniation of the stomach through the hiatus in the diaphragm and the reflux of [[gastric acid]]. The procedure is now commonly performed [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopically]].
