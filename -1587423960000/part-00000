Following the Pilot in 1982, the series was officially launched two years later in 1984 (Series 1) and continued to Series 9 (1992); including two Christmas Special episodes in 1985 (between Series 2 and 3) and in 1991 (between Series 7 and 8).  The last series (Series 9) was followed by two retrospective episodes in 1994 (''[[The Best of 'Allo 'Allo!]]'') & 2007 (''[[The Return of 'Allo 'Allo!]]'').  In total, including the Pilot, the two Christmas Specials and the two post series retrospective episodes; there are 87 episodes. Dates shown are original air dates on [[BBC One]] (except for ''[[The Return of 'Allo 'Allo!]]'' episode which was broadcast on [[BBC Two]]).\n\n== Overview ==\n{{Series overview\n\n| color0     = #123456\n| link0      = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Pilot (1982)\n| linkT0     = Pilot\n| episodes0  = 1\n| start0     = {{Start date|1982|12|30}}\n| end0       = start\n\n| color1     = #FF5F5F\n| link1      = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Series 1 (1984)\n| episodes1  = 7\n| start1     = {{Start date|1984|09|07|df=y}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1984|10|19|df=y}}\n\n| color2     = #0000FF\n| link2      = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Series 2 (1985)\n| episodes2  = 7\n| start2     = {{Start date|1985|10|21|df=y}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1985|12|26|df=y}}\n\n| color3     = #7400E9\n| link3      = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Series 3 (1986\u201387)\n| episodes3  = 6\n| start3     = {{Start date|1986|12|05|df=y}}\n| end3       = {{End date|1987|01|09|df=y}}\n\n| color4     = #00FF00\n| link4      = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Series 4 (1987)\n| episodes4  = 6\n| start4     = {{Start date|1987|11|07|df=y}}\n| end4       = {{End date|1987|12|12|df=y}}\n\n| color5     = #FF9933\n| link5      = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Series 5 (1988\u201389)\n| episodes5  = 26\n| start5     = {{Start date|1988|09|03|df=y}}\n| end5       = {{End date|1989|02|25|df=y}}\n\n| color6     = #00AE3A\n| link6      = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Series 6 (1989)\n| episodes6  = 8\n| start6     = {{Start date|1989|09|02|df=y}}\n| end6       = {{End date|1989|10|21|df=y}}\n\n| color7     = #FF5F5F\n| link7      = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Series 7 (1991)\n| episodes7  = 10\n| start7     = {{Start date|1991|01|05|df=y}}\n| end7       = {{End date|1991|03|09|df=y}}\n\n| color8     = #FFFF00\n| link8       = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Series 8 (1991\u201392)\n| episodes8  = 8\n| start8     = {{Start date|1991|12|24|df=y}}\n| end8       = {{End date|1992|03|01|df=y}}\n\n| color9     = #FF66FF\n| link9       = <includeonly>List of 'Allo 'Allo! episodes</includeonly>#Series 9 (1992)\n| episodes9  = 6\n| start9     = {{Start date|1992|11|09|df=y}}\n| end9       = {{End date|1992|12|14|df=y}}\n\n}}\n\n== Episodes ==\n===Pilot (1982)===\n{{Episode table |background=000000 |caption=Pilot |overall=5 |series=5 |title=20 |director=16 |writer=16 |airdate=20 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 00\n| Title           = The British Are Coming\n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] & [[Jeremy Lloyd]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|12|30|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Ren\u00e9 Artois owns his own caf\u00e9 in Nouvion, northern France, during the German occupation of World War Two. His main day-to-day concerns should be ensuring that he doesn't displease the local German army personnel, and ensuring his wife does not suspect his affairs with his younger waitresses. But the local leader of the Resistance declares the caf\u00e9 is to become a safe house for the hiding of two RAF pilots, shot down and without uniforms - or a word of the French language. He is also to welcome a forger, recently busted from jail, into the caf\u00e9 - who happens to be an old flame of his bedridden mother-in-law.\n* Note: In this episode, the painting is referred to as ''The Reclining Madonna with the Big Boobies''. In all later episodes, it is called ''The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies''.\n* Note: In this episode, Michelle claims to be a member of 'Lifeline' - a reference to the same organization in ''[[Secret Army (TV series)|Secret Army]]''.\n* Note: In this episode Gruber has more medals.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n* Produced by David Croft\n\n===Series 1 (1984)===\n{{main|'Allo 'Allo!

For the purposes of clarification, titles shown here are as follows:\n* Series 1-7: These are the titles which appear on the British Region 2 DVD releases. Titles shown in brackets are where Region 1 and Region 4 DVD release titles do not correspond to those on the British Region 2 DVD release.\n* Series 8-9: These are the titles which appear on the American Region 1 DVD releases. Series 8-9 and the second Christmas Special (under the title \"Pregnancy\") have been released on DVD in Poland, however with no titles, just notes on every episode.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{British Comedy Guide|episodes|allo_allo|'Allo 'Allo!}}\n* {{IMDb episodes|0086659|'Allo 'Allo!}}\n\n{{'Allo 'Allo!}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of 'Allo 'Allo!

But the local leader of the Resistance declares the caf\u00e9 is to become a safe house for the hiding of two RAF pilots, shot down and without uniforms - or a word of the French language. He is also to welcome a forger, recently busted from jail, into the caf\u00e9 - who happens to be an old flame of his bedridden mother-in-law.\n* Note: In this episode, the painting is referred to as ''The Reclining Madonna with the Big Boobies''.

For the purposes of clarification, titles shown here are as follows:\n* Series 1-7: These are the titles which appear on the British Region 2 DVD releases. Titles shown in brackets are where Region 1 and Region 4 DVD release titles do not correspond to those on the British Region 2 DVD release.\n* Series 8-9: These are the titles which appear on the American Region 1 DVD releases. Series 8-9 and the second Christmas Special (under the title \"Pregnancy\") have been released on DVD in Poland, however with no titles, just notes on every episode.\n\n==External links==\n* {{British Comedy Guide|episodes|allo_allo|'Allo 'Allo!}}\n* {{IMDb episodes|0086659|'Allo 'Allo!}}\n\n{{'Allo 'Allo!}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of 'Allo 'Allo!

The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire by creating an independent [[Principality of Albania]] and enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of its Macedonian region to those countries, and additionally the [[Southern Dobruja]] region to Romania and Adrianople (the present-day city of [[Edirne]]) to Turkey in the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], which further destabilized the region.<ref name=Willmott22-23>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=2\u201323}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] student and member of a multi-ethnic organisation of national revolutionaries called [[Young Bosnia]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia.<ref name=Willmott26>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=26}}</ref>\nThe political objective of the assassination was the independence of the southern Austro-Hungarian provinces mainly populated by Slavs from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, though it also inadvertently triggered a chain of events that embroiled Russia and the major European powers. This began a period of diplomatic manoeuvring among Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, and Britain called the [[July Crisis]]. Austria-Hungary delivered the [[July Ultimatum of 1914|July Ultimatum]] to Serbia, a series of ten demands intentionally made unacceptable in order to provoke a war with Serbia.<ref name=Willmott27>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=27}}</ref> When Serbia agreed to only eight of the ten demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July 1914.\n\nThe dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia escalated into what is now known as World War I, and drew in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[German Empire|Germany]], France, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Within a week, Austria-Hungary had to face a war with Russia, Serbia's patron, which had the largest army in the world at the time. The result was that Serbia became a subsidiary front in the massive fight that started to unfold along Austria-Hungary's border with Russia. Serbia had an experienced army, but it was also exhausted from the conflicts of the Balkan Wars and poorly equipped, which led the Austro-Hungarians to believe that it would fall in less than a month. Serbia's strategy was to hold on as long as it could and hope the Russians could defeat the main [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], with or without the help of other allies. Serbia constantly had to worry about its hostile neighbor to the east, [[History of Independent Bulgaria#World War I|Bulgaria]], with which it had fought several wars, most recently in the Second Balkan War of 1913.\n\n== Military forces ==\n\n=== Austro-Hungarian ===\n{{also|Alfred Redl}}\nThe standing peacetime Austro-Hungarian army had some 36,000 officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s and 414,000 enlisted personnel. During the mobilization, this number was increased to a total of 3,350,000 men of all ranks. The operational army had over 1,420,000 men, and a further 600,000 were allocated to support and logistic units (train, munition and supply columns, etc.) while the rest \u2013 around 1,350,000 \u2013 were reserve troops available for replacing losses and the formation of new units.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\u00d6sterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 - 1918, vol. 1, Wienn 1930, p68</ref> This vast manpower allowed the Austro-Hungarian army to replace its losses regularly and keep units at their formation strength. According to some sources, during 1914 there were on average 150,000 men per month sent to replace the losses in the field army. During 1915 these numbers rose to 200,000 per month.<ref>http://digi.landesbibliothek.at/viewer/image/AC03568741/1/LOG_0003/\nDie Entwicklung der \u00f6st.-ung.

However, with the beginning of the Russian general mobilization, the ''Armeeoberkommando'' (AOK, Austro-Hungarian Supreme Command) decided to move the 2nd Army to [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] to counter Russian forces. Due to the congestion of railroad lines towards Galicia, the 2nd Army could only start its departure on 18 August, which allowed the AOK to assign some units of the 2nd Army to take part in operations in Serbia before that date. Eventually, the AOK allowed General [[Oskar Potiorek]] to deploy a significant part of the 2nd Army (around four divisions) in fighting against Serbia, which caused a delay of transport of these troops to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]] for more than a week. Furthermore, the Austro-Hungarian defeats suffered during the first invasion of Serbia forced the AOK to transfer two divisions from the 2nd Army permanently to Potiorek's force. By 12 August, Austria-Hungary had amassed over 500,000 soldiers on Serbian frontiers, including some 380,000 operational troops. With the departure of the major part of the 2nd Army to the Russian front, this number fell to some 285,000 of operational troops, including garrisons.<ref>http://honsi.org/literature/svejk/dokumenty/oulk/band1.html \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 - 1918, vol. 1, Wienn 1930, p68</ref> Apart from land forces, Austria-Hungary also deployed its Danube River flotilla of six monitors and six patrol boats.\n\nMany Austro-Hungarian soldiers were not of good quality.<ref name=Jordan20>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=20}}</ref> About one-quarter of them were illiterate, and most of the conscripts from the empire's subject nationalities did not speak or understand German or Hungarian.

By 30 July, the mobilization was completed and the troops began to be deployed according to the war plan. Deployments were completed by 9 August, when all of the troops had arrived at their designated strategic positions. During mobilization, Serbia raised approximately 450,000 men of three age-defined classes (or bans) called ''poziv'', which comprised all able-bodied men between 21 and 45 years of age.\n\nThe operational army consisted of 11 and 1/2 infantry (six of 1st and five of the 2nd ban) and 1 cavalry division. Aged men of the 3rd ban were organized in 15 infantry regiments with some 45\u201350,000 men designated for use in rear and line of communications duties. However, some of them were by necessity used as part of operational army as well, bringing its strength up to around 250,000 men.<ref>James Lyon, A peasant mob: The Serbian army in the eve of the Great War, JMH 61, 1997, p501</ref> Serbia was in a much more disadvantageous position when compared with Austria-Hungary with regard to human reserves and replacement troops, as its only source of replacements were new recruits reaching the age of military enlistment. Their maximum annual number was theoretically around 60,000, which was insufficient to replace the losses of more than 132,000 sustained during operations from August to December 1914. This shortage of manpower forced the Serbian army to recruit under- and over-aged men to make up for losses in the opening phase of the war.\n\nBecause of the poor financial state of the Serbian economy and losses in the recent Balkan Wars, the Serbian army lacked much of the modern weaponry and equipment necessary to engage in combat with their larger and wealthier adversaries. There were only 180,000 modern rifles available for the operational army, which meant that the Serbian Army lacked between one-quarter to one-third of the rifles necessary to fully equip even their front line units, let alone reserve forces.<ref>James Lyon, p496</ref> Although Serbia tried to remedy this deficit by ordering 120,000 rifles from Russia in 1914, the weapons did not begin to arrive until the second half of August. Only 1st ban troops had complete grey-green M1908 uniforms, while 2nd ban troops often wore the obsolete dark blue M1896 issue, with the 3rd ban having no proper uniforms at all and were reduced to wearing their civilian clothes with military greatcoats and caps.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nigel|last=Thomas|page=38|title=Armies in the Balkans 1914-18|ISBN=1-84176-194-X}}</ref> The Serbian troops did not have service issued boots at all, and the vast majority of them wore everyday footwear made of pig skin called ''[[opanak]]''.\n\nAmmunition reserves were also insufficient for sustained field operations as most of it had been used in the 1912\u201313 Balkan wars. Artillery ammunition was sparse and only amounted to several hundred shells per unit. Because Serbia lacked a significant domestic military-industrial complex, its army was completely dependent on imports of ammunition and arms from France and Russia, which themselves were chronically short of supplies. The inevitable shortages of ammunition, which later would include a complete lack of artillery ammunition, reached their peak during decisive moments of the Austro-Hungarian invasion.\n\n=== Comparative strength ===\n\nThese figures detail the number of all Austro-Hungarian troops concentrated on the southern (Serbian) theater of war at the beginning of August 1914 and the resources of the entire Serbian army (the number of troops actually available for the operations on both sides was however somewhat less):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

However, since the railroad lines leading to Galicia were busy with transport of other troops, the 2nd Army could only start its departure northward on 18 August. In order to make use of the temporary presence of the 2nd Army, AOK allowed parts of it to be used in the Serbian campaign until that date. Eventually, AOK directed significant parts of the 2nd Army (around four divisions) to assist General [[Oskar Potiorek|Potiorek]]'s main force and postponed their transportation to Russia until the last week of August. Defeats suffered in the first invasion of Serbia eventually forced AOK to transfer two divisions from 2nd Army to Potiorek's army permanently.\n\nThe V and VI Austro-Hungarian Armies had about 270,000 men who were much better equipped than the Serbs. Overall, Austro-Hungarian command was in the hands of General Potiorek. The Austro-Hungarian Empire had the third largest population in Europe in 1914, behind Russia and Germany (almost twelve times the population of the Kingdom of Serbia), giving it an enormous manpower advantage.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1915, the Serbian campaign resulted in crimes against the Muslim population, mostly Albanians. Some people were converted to Eastern Orthodox Church and ethnically cleansed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=William W. |first1=Hagen |title=The Balkans' Lethal Nationalisms.

The Second Army was due to be transported to Galicia to face the Russians at the end of August, but he made use of it until then. The Sixth was positioning itself in southern Bosnia and was not yet able to commence offensive operations. Potiorek's desire was to win a victory before Emperor Franz Joseph's birthday and to knock Serbia out as soon as possible. Thus he made two grave strategic errors by attacking with only just over half of his strength and attacking hilly western Serbia instead of the open plains of the north. This move surprised Marshal [[Radomir Putnik|Putnik]], who expected attack from the north and initially believed that it was a feint. Once it became clear that it was the main thrust, the strong Second Army under the command of General [[Stepa Stepanovi\u0107]] was sent to join the small Third Army under [[Pavle Juri\u0161i\u0107 \u0160turm]] already facing the Austro-Hungarians and expel the invaders. After a fierce four-day battle, the Austro-Hungarians were forced to retreat, marking the first [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory of the war over the [[Central Powers]] led by Germany and Austria-Hungary. Casualties numbered 23,000 for the Austro-Hungarians (of whom 4,500 were captured) and 16,500 for the Serbs.\n\n=== Battle of Drina ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Drina}}\n[[File:Maxim \u041c.1909 of Serbian Royal Army.jpg|thumb|right|Maxim \u041cG 10 of Serbian Royal Army]]\nUnder pressure from its allies, Serbia conducted a limited offensive across the [[Sava]] river into the Austro-Hungarian region of Syrmia with its [[First Army (Serbia)|Serbian First Army]]. The main operational goal was to delay the transport of the Austro-Hungarian Second Army to the Russian front. The objective was shown to be futile as forces of the Second Army were already in transport. Meanwhile, the Timok division I of the Serbian Second Army suffered a heavy defeat in a diversionary crossing, suffering around 6,000 casualties while inflicting only 2,000.\n\nWith most of his forces in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], Potiorek decided that the best way to stop the Serbian offensive was to launch another invasion into Serbia to force the Serbs to recall their troops to defend their much smaller homeland.\n\n{{Quote box|width=38%|align=left|quote=\"The Serbians, seasoned, war-hardened men, inspired by the fiercest patriotism, the result of generations of torment and struggle, awaited undaunted whatever fate might bestow.\"|source=[[Winston Churchill]], ''The Great War''.<ref name=Jordan25>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=25}}</ref>}}\n\n7 September brought a renewed Austro-Hungarian attack from the west, across the river Drina, this time with both the Fifth Army in [[Ma\u010dva]] and the Sixth further south.<ref name=Jordan31>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=31}}</ref> The initial attack by the Fifth Army was repelled by the Serbian Second Army, with 4,000 Austro-Hungarian casualties, but the stronger Sixth Army managed to surprise the Serbian Third Army and gain a foothold. After some units from the Serbian Second Army were sent to bolster the Third, the Austro-Hungarian Fifth Army also managed to establish a bridgehead with a renewed attack. At that time, Marshal Putnik withdrew the First Army from Syrmia (against much popular opposition) and used it to deliver a fierce counterattack against the Sixth Army that initially went well, but finally bogged down in a bloody four-day fight for a peak of the Jagodnja mountain called Ma\u010dkov Kamen, in which both sides suffered horrendous losses in successive frontal attacks and counterattacks. Two Serbian divisions lost around 11,000 men, while Austro-Hungarian losses were probably comparable.\n\nMarshal Putnik ordered a retreat into the surrounding hills and the front settled into a month and a half of trench warfare, which was highly unfavourable to the Serbs, who had little in the way of an industrial base and were deficient in heavy artillery, ammunition stocks, shell production and footwear, since the vast majority of infantry wore the traditional (though state-issued) [[opanak]]s,<ref name=Jordan20/> while the Austro-Hungarians had waterproof leather boots. Most of their war material was supplied by the Allies, who were short of such materials themselves. In such a situation, Serbian artillery quickly became almost silent, while the Austro-Hungarians steadily increased their fire. Serbian casualties reached 100 soldiers a day from all causes in some divisions.\n\nDuring the first weeks of trench warfare, the Serbian U\u017eice Army (first strengthened division) and the Montenegrin Sanjak Army (roughly a division) conducted an abortive offensive into Bosnia. In addition, both sides conducted a few local attacks, most of which were soundly defeated. In one such attack, the Serbian Army used [[Mining (military)|mine warfare]] for the first time: the Combined Division dug tunnels beneath the Austro-Hungarian trenches (that were only 20\u201330 meters away from the Serbian ones on this sector), planted mines and set them off just before an infantry charge.\n\n=== Battle of Kolubara ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Kolubara}}\n[[File:Battle of Kolubara.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Later Operations in Serbia, 1914]]\nHaving thus weakened the Serbian army, the Austro-Hungarian Army launched another massive attack on 5 November. The Serbs withdrew step by step, offering strong resistance at the [[Kolubara]] River, but to no avail, due to the lack of artillery ammunition. It was at that time that General [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] was made commander of the battered First Army, replacing the wounded Petar Bojovi\u0107. He insisted on a deep withdrawal in order to give the troops some much-needed rest and to shorten the front. Marshal Putnik finally relented, but the consequence was the abandonment of the capital city of Belgrade. After suffering heavy losses, the Austro-Hungarian Army entered the city on 2 December. This action led Potiorek to move the whole Fifth Army into the Belgrade area and use it to crush the Serbian right flank. This, however, left the Sixth alone for a few days to face the whole Serbian army.\n\nAt this point, artillery ammunition finally arrived from France and Greece. In addition, some replacements were sent to the units and Marshal Putnik correctly sensed that the Austro-Hungarian forces were dangerously overstretched and weakened in the previous offensives, so he ordered a full-scale counterattack with the entire Serbian Army on 3 December against the Sixth Army. The Fifth hurried its flanking maneuver, but it was already too late \u2013 with the Sixth Army broken, the Second and Third Serbian Armies overwhelmed the Fifth. Finally, Potiorek lost his nerve and ordered yet another retreat back across the rivers into Austria-Hungary's territory. The Serbian Army recaptured Belgrade on 15 December.\n\nThe first phase of the war against Serbia had ended with no change in the border, but casualties were enormous compared to earlier wars, albeit comparable to other campaigns of World War I. The Serbian army suffered 170,000 men killed, wounded, captured or missing. Austro-Hungarian losses were approaching 215,000 men killed, wounded or missing.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Austro-Hungarian General Potiorek was removed from command and replaced by [[Archduke Eugen of Austria]] (C. Falls p.&nbsp;54). On the Serbian side, a deadly [[typhus]] epidemic killed hundreds of thousands of Serb civilians during the winter. \n\nAfter the Battle of Kolubara, the Serbian Parliament adopted the Ni\u0161 Declaration (7 December 1914) on the war goals of Serbia:\n\"Convinced that the entire Serbian nation is determined to persevere in the holy struggle for the defense of their homesteads and their freedom, the government of the Kingdom (of Serbia) considers that, in these fateful times, its main and only task is to ensure the successful completion of this great warfare which, at the moment when it started, also became a struggle for the liberation and unification of all our unliberated Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian brothers. The great success which is to crown this warfare will make up for the extremely bloody sacrifices which this generation of Serbs is making\". This amounted to announcing Serbia's intention to annex extensive amounts of Austria-Hungary's Balkan provinces.\n\n== 1915 ==\n\n=== Prelude ===\n\n[[File:Nikola Pasic 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, Serbian prime minister in 1915]]\n[[File:Fl\u00fcchtlingstransport Leibnitz - k.k. Innenministerium - 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Refugee Transport from Serbia 1914/15 in [[Leibnitz]], [[Styria]]]]\nEarly in 1915, with Ottoman defeats at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] and in the [[First Suez Offensive]], the German [[Chief of the General Staff (Germany)|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] tried to convince the Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff, [[Franz Graf Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf|Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], of the importance of conquering Serbia. If Serbia were taken, then the Germans would have a direct rail link from Germany through Austria-Hungary, then down to [[Istanbul]] and beyond. This would allow the Germans to send military supplies and even troops to help the [[Ottoman Empire]]. While this was hardly in Austria-Hungary's interests, the Austro-Hungarians did want to defeat Serbia. However, Russia was the more dangerous enemy, and furthermore, with the entry of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] into the war on the Allied side, the Austro-Hungarians had their hands full (see [[Italian Front (World War I)]]).\n\nBoth the Allies and the Central Powers tried to get Bulgaria to pick a side in the Great War. Bulgaria and Serbia had fought two wars in the last 30 years: the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] in 1885, and the Second Balkan War in 1913. The result was that the Bulgarian government and people felt that Serbia was in possession of lands to which Bulgaria was entitled, and when the Central Powers offered to give them what they claimed, the Bulgarians entered the war on their side. With the Allied loss in the [[Gallipoli campaign]] and the Russian defeat at [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|Gorlice]], King [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] signed a treaty with Germany and on 23 September 1915, Bulgaria began mobilizing for war.\n\n[[Jevto Dedijer]] stated in 1915 that \u201cthe occupation of Kosovo and Methoija gives Serbia a favourable position in occupying the rest of the Balkans\u201d.<ref>Abdullai Fejuzallhu, \"Albanofobia\", 2019. {{ISBN|9780359952373}} (p. 106)</ref>\n\n=== Opposing forces ===\nDuring the preceding nine months, the Serbs had tried and failed to rebuild their battered armies and improve their supply situation. Despite their efforts, the Serbian Army was only about 30,000 men stronger than at the start of the war (around 225,000) and was still badly equipped. Although Britain and France had talked about sending serious military forces to Serbia, nothing was done until it was too late. When Bulgaria began mobilizing, the French and British sent two divisions, but they arrived late in the [[Greece|Greek]] town of [[Salonika]]. Part of the reason for the delay was the [[National schism]] in Greek politics of the time that generating conflicting views about the war.\n\nAgainst Serbia were marshalled the Bulgarian [[First Army (Bulgaria)|First Army]] commanded by [[Kliment Boyadzhiev]], the German [[11th Army (German Empire)|Eleventh Army]] commanded by [[Max von Gallwitz]] and the Austro-Hungarian [[3rd Army (Austria-Hungary)|Third Army]] commanded by [[Hermann K\u00f6vess von K\u00f6vessh\u00e1za]], all under the control of Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]]. In addition the Bulgarian [[Second Army (Bulgaria)|Second Army]] commanded by ([[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]]), which remained under the direct control of the Bulgarian high command, was deployed against [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\n=== Course of the campaign ===\n{{see also|Great Retreat (Serbian){{!}}Great Retreat}}\nThe Austro-Hungarians and Germans began their attack on 7 October with their troops crossing the Drina and Sava rivers, covered by heavy artillery fire. Once they crossed the Danube, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians moved on Belgrade itself. Vicious street fighting ensued,<ref name=\"Jordan53\">{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=53}}</ref> and the Serbs' resistance in the city was finally crushed on 9 October.<ref name=\"Willmott120\">{{harvnb|Willmott|2008|p=120}}</ref>\n\nThen, on 14 October, the Bulgarian Army attacked from the north of Bulgaria towards [[Ni\u0161]] and from the south towards [[Skopje]] (see map). The Bulgarian First Army defeated the Serbian Second Army at the [[Battle of Morava]], while the Bulgarian Second Army defeated the Serbians at the [[Battle of Ovche Pole]]. With the Bulgarian breakthrough, the Serbian position became untenable; the main army in the north (around Belgrade) could either retreat or be surrounded and forced to surrender. In the [[battle of Kosovo (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]], the Serbs made a last and desperate attempt to join the two incomplete Allied divisions that made a limited advance from the south, but were unable to gather enough forces due to the pressure from the north and east. They were halted by the Bulgarians under General Todorov and had to pull back.\n\n[[File:Serbian retreat WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Serbian Army during its retreat towards Albania]]\n\nMarshal Putnik ordered the [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|Great Retreat]], a full retreat south and west through Montenegro and into Albania. The weather was terrible, the roads poor, and the army had to help the tens of thousands of civilians who retreated with them with almost no supplies or food left. But the bad weather and poor roads worked for the refugees as well, as the Central Powers forces could not press them hard enough, so they evaded capture.

All told, only some 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reached the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and embarked on Allied transport ships that carried the army to various Greek islands (many to [[Corfu]]) before being sent to Salonika. The evacuation of the Serbian army from Albania was completed on 10 February 1916. The survivors were so weakened that thousands of them died from sheer exhaustion in the weeks after their rescue. Marshal Putnik had to be carried during the whole retreat and he died around fifteen months later in a hospital in France.\n\nThe French and British divisions had marched north from Thessaloniki in October 1915 under the command of French General [[Maurice Sarrail]]. The War Office in London was reluctant to advance too deep into Serbia, so the French divisions advanced on their own up the [[Vardar]] River. This advance gave some limited help to the retreating Serbian Army, as the Bulgarians had to concentrate larger forces on their southern flank to deal with the threat, which led to the [[Battle of Krivolak]] (October\u2013November 1915). By the end of November, General Sarrail had to retreat in the face of massive Bulgarian assaults on his positions. During his retreat, the British at the [[Battle of Kosturino]] were also forced to retreat. By 12 December, all allied forces were back in Greece.\n\n[[File:QG Triplice Macedoine.jpg|thumb|German and Bulgarian commanders in Serbia on 16 November 1915.

The Austrian-Hungarians launched their [[Montenegrin Campaign of World War I|Montenegrin campaign]] on 5 January 1916 and despite some success of The Montenegrins in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]], they were completely defeated within 2 weeks.\n\nThis was a nearly complete victory for the Central Powers at a cost of around 67,000 casualties as compared to around 94,000 Serbs killed or wounded and 174,000 captured, of which 70,000 were wounded.{{sfn|DiNardo|2015|p=122}} The railroad from Berlin to Istanbul was finally opened. The only flaw in the victory was that much of the Serbian Army had successfully retreated, although it was left very disorganized and required rebuilding.\n\n== 1916\u20131918 ==\n{{Main article|Macedonian Front|Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)}}\nThe Serbian army was evacuated to Greece and joined up with the [[Allied Army of the Orient]]. They then fought a trench war against the Bulgarians on the Macedonia Front. The Macedonian Front in the beginning was mostly static. French and Serbian forces re-took limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916 as a result of the costly [[Monastir Offensive]], which brought stabilization of the front.\n\nFrench and Serbian troops finally made a breakthrough in the [[Vardar Offensive]] in 1918, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had withdrawn. This breakthrough was significant in defeating Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary, which led to the final victory of World War I. After the Allied breakthrough, Bulgaria capitulated on 29 September 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Wood|Murphy|1999|p=120}}</ref> Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and insisted on an immediate peace settlement during a meeting with government officials a day after the Bulgarian collapse.<ref name=\"Doughty\">{{cite book|author=Robert A.

They pushed forward in September 1918, forced Bulgaria to leave the war and eventually managed to liberate Serbia two weeks before the end of World War I.\n\n== End of the War ==\nThe ramifications of the war were manifold. When World War I ended, the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] awarded [[Western Thrace]] to Greece, whereas Serbia received some minor territorial concessions from Bulgaria. Austria-Hungary was broken apart, and Hungary lost much land to both Yugoslavia and Romania in the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Serbia assumed the leading position in the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], joined by its old ally, [[Montenegro]]. Meanwhile, Italy established a quasi-protectorate over Albania and Greece re-occupied Albania's southern part, which was autonomous under a local Greek provisional government (see [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]]), despite Albania's neutrality during the war.\n\n== Casualties ==\n[[File:WorldWarI-MilitaryDeaths-EntentePowers-Piechart.svg|thumb|left|The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] casualties]]\n\nBefore the war, the Kingdom of Serbia had 4,500,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWinSerbia.htm|title=Serbia in 1914|publisher=}}</ref> According to the [[New York Times]], 150,000 people are estimated to have died in 1915 alone during the worst [[typhus|typhus epidemic]] in world history.

This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=keegan48-49>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already unravelling in what was known as \"the [[powder keg of Europe]]\".<ref name=keegan48-49 />\n[[File:TelegramWW1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Austro-Hungarian government's declaration of war in a telegram sent to the government of Serbia on 28 July 1914, signed by Imperial Foreign Minister [[Count Leopold Berchtold]].]]\nIn 1912 and 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] of [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], and [[Montenegro]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire by creating an independent [[Principality of Albania]] and enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of its Macedonian region to those countries, and additionally the [[Southern Dobruja]] region to Romania and Adrianople (the present-day city of [[Edirne]]) to Turkey in the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], which further destabilized the region.<ref name=Willmott22-23>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=2\u201323}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] student and member of a multi-ethnic organisation of national revolutionaries called [[Young Bosnia]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia.<ref name=Willmott26>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=26}}</ref>\nThe political objective of the assassination was the independence of the southern Austro-Hungarian provinces mainly populated by Slavs from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, though it also inadvertently triggered a chain of events that embroiled Russia and the major European powers. This began a period of diplomatic manoeuvring among Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, and Britain called the [[July Crisis]]. Austria-Hungary delivered the [[July Ultimatum of 1914|July Ultimatum]] to Serbia, a series of ten demands intentionally made unacceptable in order to provoke a war with Serbia.<ref name=Willmott27>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=27}}</ref> When Serbia agreed to only eight of the ten demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July 1914.\n\nThe dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia escalated into what is now known as World War I, and drew in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[German Empire|Germany]], France, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Within a week, Austria-Hungary had to face a war with Russia, Serbia's patron, which had the largest army in the world at the time. The result was that Serbia became a subsidiary front in the massive fight that started to unfold along Austria-Hungary's border with Russia. Serbia had an experienced army, but it was also exhausted from the conflicts of the Balkan Wars and poorly equipped, which led the Austro-Hungarians to believe that it would fall in less than a month. Serbia's strategy was to hold on as long as it could and hope the Russians could defeat the main [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], with or without the help of other allies. Serbia constantly had to worry about its hostile neighbor to the east, [[History of Independent Bulgaria#World War I|Bulgaria]], with which it had fought several wars, most recently in the Second Balkan War of 1913.\n\n== Military forces ==\n\n=== Austro-Hungarian ===\n{{also|Alfred Redl}}\nThe standing peacetime Austro-Hungarian army had some 36,000 officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s and 414,000 enlisted personnel. During the mobilization, this number was increased to a total of 3,350,000 men of all ranks. The operational army had over 1,420,000 men, and a further 600,000 were allocated to support and logistic units (train, munition and supply columns, etc.) while the rest \u2013 around 1,350,000 \u2013 were reserve troops available for replacing losses and the formation of new units.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\u00d6sterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 - 1918, vol. 1, Wienn 1930, p68</ref> This vast manpower allowed the Austro-Hungarian army to replace its losses regularly and keep units at their formation strength. According to some sources, during 1914 there were on average 150,000 men per month sent to replace the losses in the field army. During 1915 these numbers rose to 200,000 per month.<ref>http://digi.landesbibliothek.at/viewer/image/AC03568741/1/LOG_0003/\nDie Entwicklung der \u00f6st.-ung. Wehrmacht in den ersten zwei Kriegsjahren, 10</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2013}}{{Better source|date=November 2013}} According to the official Austrian documents in the period from September until the end of December 1914, some 160,000 replacement troops were sent to the Balkan theater of war, as well as 82,000 reinforcements as part of newly formed units.<ref>http://digi.landesbibliothek.at/viewer/image/AC01351505/1/LOG_0003/ \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 -1918, vol. 2 Beilagen, Wienn 1930, table I )</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe pre-war Austro-Hungarian plan for invasion of Serbia envisioned the concentration of three armies (2nd, 5th and 6th) on the western and northern borders of Serbia with the main goal of enveloping and destroying the bulk of the Serbian army. However, with the beginning of the Russian general mobilization, the ''Armeeoberkommando'' (AOK, Austro-Hungarian Supreme Command) decided to move the 2nd Army to [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] to counter Russian forces. Due to the congestion of railroad lines towards Galicia, the 2nd Army could only start its departure on 18 August, which allowed the AOK to assign some units of the 2nd Army to take part in operations in Serbia before that date. Eventually, the AOK allowed General [[Oskar Potiorek]] to deploy a significant part of the 2nd Army (around four divisions) in fighting against Serbia, which caused a delay of transport of these troops to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]] for more than a week. Furthermore, the Austro-Hungarian defeats suffered during the first invasion of Serbia forced the AOK to transfer two divisions from the 2nd Army permanently to Potiorek's force. By 12 August, Austria-Hungary had amassed over 500,000 soldiers on Serbian frontiers, including some 380,000 operational troops. With the departure of the major part of the 2nd Army to the Russian front, this number fell to some 285,000 of operational troops, including garrisons.<ref>http://honsi.org/literature/svejk/dokumenty/oulk/band1.html \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 - 1918, vol. 1, Wienn 1930, p68</ref> Apart from land forces, Austria-Hungary also deployed its Danube River flotilla of six monitors and six patrol boats.\n\nMany Austro-Hungarian soldiers were not of good quality.<ref name=Jordan20>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=20}}</ref> About one-quarter of them were illiterate, and most of the conscripts from the empire's subject nationalities did not speak or understand German or Hungarian. In addition to this, most of the soldiers \u2014 ethnic Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Romanians and South Slavs \u2014 had linguistic and cultural links with the empire's various enemies.<ref name=Willmott69>{{harvnb|Willmott|2009|p=69}}</ref>\n\n=== Serbian ===\nThe Serbian military command issued orders for the mobilization of its armed forces on 25 July and the mobilization began the following day. By 30 July, the mobilization was completed and the troops began to be deployed according to the war plan. Deployments were completed by 9 August, when all of the troops had arrived at their designated strategic positions. During mobilization, Serbia raised approximately 450,000 men of three age-defined classes (or bans) called ''poziv'', which comprised all able-bodied men between 21 and 45 years of age.\n\nThe operational army consisted of 11 and 1/2 infantry (six of 1st and five of the 2nd ban) and 1 cavalry division. Aged men of the 3rd ban were organized in 15 infantry regiments with some 45\u201350,000 men designated for use in rear and line of communications duties. However, some of them were by necessity used as part of operational army as well, bringing its strength up to around 250,000 men.<ref>James Lyon, A peasant mob: The Serbian army in the eve of the Great War, JMH 61, 1997, p501</ref> Serbia was in a much more disadvantageous position when compared with Austria-Hungary with regard to human reserves and replacement troops, as its only source of replacements were new recruits reaching the age of military enlistment. Their maximum annual number was theoretically around 60,000, which was insufficient to replace the losses of more than 132,000 sustained during operations from August to December 1914. This shortage of manpower forced the Serbian army to recruit under- and over-aged men to make up for losses in the opening phase of the war.\n\nBecause of the poor financial state of the Serbian economy and losses in the recent Balkan Wars, the Serbian army lacked much of the modern weaponry and equipment necessary to engage in combat with their larger and wealthier adversaries. There were only 180,000 modern rifles available for the operational army, which meant that the Serbian Army lacked between one-quarter to one-third of the rifles necessary to fully equip even their front line units, let alone reserve forces.<ref>James Lyon, p496</ref> Although Serbia tried to remedy this deficit by ordering 120,000 rifles from Russia in 1914, the weapons did not begin to arrive until the second half of August. Only 1st ban troops had complete grey-green M1908 uniforms, while 2nd ban troops often wore the obsolete dark blue M1896 issue, with the 3rd ban having no proper uniforms at all and were reduced to wearing their civilian clothes with military greatcoats and caps.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nigel|last=Thomas|page=38|title=Armies in the Balkans 1914-18|ISBN=1-84176-194-X}}</ref> The Serbian troops did not have service issued boots at all, and the vast majority of them wore everyday footwear made of pig skin called ''[[opanak]]''.\n\nAmmunition reserves were also insufficient for sustained field operations as most of it had been used in the 1912\u201313 Balkan wars. Artillery ammunition was sparse and only amounted to several hundred shells per unit. Because Serbia lacked a significant domestic military-industrial complex, its army was completely dependent on imports of ammunition and arms from France and Russia, which themselves were chronically short of supplies. The inevitable shortages of ammunition, which later would include a complete lack of artillery ammunition, reached their peak during decisive moments of the Austro-Hungarian invasion.\n\n=== Comparative strength ===\n\nThese figures detail the number of all Austro-Hungarian troops concentrated on the southern (Serbian) theater of war at the beginning of August 1914 and the resources of the entire Serbian army (the number of troops actually available for the operations on both sides was however somewhat less):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

However, since the railroad lines leading to Galicia were busy with transport of other troops, the 2nd Army could only start its departure northward on 18 August. In order to make use of the temporary presence of the 2nd Army, AOK allowed parts of it to be used in the Serbian campaign until that date. Eventually, AOK directed significant parts of the 2nd Army (around four divisions) to assist General [[Oskar Potiorek|Potiorek]]'s main force and postponed their transportation to Russia until the last week of August. Defeats suffered in the first invasion of Serbia eventually forced AOK to transfer two divisions from 2nd Army to Potiorek's army permanently.\n\nThe V and VI Austro-Hungarian Armies had about 270,000 men who were much better equipped than the Serbs. Overall, Austro-Hungarian command was in the hands of General Potiorek. The Austro-Hungarian Empire had the third largest population in Europe in 1914, behind Russia and Germany (almost twelve times the population of the Kingdom of Serbia), giving it an enormous manpower advantage.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1915, the Serbian campaign resulted in crimes against the Muslim population, mostly Albanians. Some people were converted to Eastern Orthodox Church and ethnically cleansed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=William W. |first1=Hagen |title=The Balkans' Lethal Nationalisms.

The Second Army was due to be transported to Galicia to face the Russians at the end of August, but he made use of it until then. The Sixth was positioning itself in southern Bosnia and was not yet able to commence offensive operations. Potiorek's desire was to win a victory before Emperor Franz Joseph's birthday and to knock Serbia out as soon as possible. Thus he made two grave strategic errors by attacking with only just over half of his strength and attacking hilly western Serbia instead of the open plains of the north. This move surprised Marshal [[Radomir Putnik|Putnik]], who expected attack from the north and initially believed that it was a feint. Once it became clear that it was the main thrust, the strong Second Army under the command of General [[Stepa Stepanovi\u0107]] was sent to join the small Third Army under [[Pavle Juri\u0161i\u0107 \u0160turm]] already facing the Austro-Hungarians and expel the invaders. After a fierce four-day battle, the Austro-Hungarians were forced to retreat, marking the first [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory of the war over the [[Central Powers]] led by Germany and Austria-Hungary. Casualties numbered 23,000 for the Austro-Hungarians (of whom 4,500 were captured) and 16,500 for the Serbs.\n\n=== Battle of Drina ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Drina}}\n[[File:Maxim \u041c.1909 of Serbian Royal Army.jpg|thumb|right|Maxim \u041cG 10 of Serbian Royal Army]]\nUnder pressure from its allies, Serbia conducted a limited offensive across the [[Sava]] river into the Austro-Hungarian region of Syrmia with its [[First Army (Serbia)|Serbian First Army]]. The main operational goal was to delay the transport of the Austro-Hungarian Second Army to the Russian front. The objective was shown to be futile as forces of the Second Army were already in transport. Meanwhile, the Timok division I of the Serbian Second Army suffered a heavy defeat in a diversionary crossing, suffering around 6,000 casualties while inflicting only 2,000.\n\nWith most of his forces in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], Potiorek decided that the best way to stop the Serbian offensive was to launch another invasion into Serbia to force the Serbs to recall their troops to defend their much smaller homeland.\n\n{{Quote box|width=38%|align=left|quote=\"The Serbians, seasoned, war-hardened men, inspired by the fiercest patriotism, the result of generations of torment and struggle, awaited undaunted whatever fate might bestow.\"|source=[[Winston Churchill]], ''The Great War''.<ref name=Jordan25>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=25}}</ref>}}\n\n7 September brought a renewed Austro-Hungarian attack from the west, across the river Drina, this time with both the Fifth Army in [[Ma\u010dva]] and the Sixth further south.<ref name=Jordan31>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=31}}</ref> The initial attack by the Fifth Army was repelled by the Serbian Second Army, with 4,000 Austro-Hungarian casualties, but the stronger Sixth Army managed to surprise the Serbian Third Army and gain a foothold. After some units from the Serbian Second Army were sent to bolster the Third, the Austro-Hungarian Fifth Army also managed to establish a bridgehead with a renewed attack. At that time, Marshal Putnik withdrew the First Army from Syrmia (against much popular opposition) and used it to deliver a fierce counterattack against the Sixth Army that initially went well, but finally bogged down in a bloody four-day fight for a peak of the Jagodnja mountain called Ma\u010dkov Kamen, in which both sides suffered horrendous losses in successive frontal attacks and counterattacks. Two Serbian divisions lost around 11,000 men, while Austro-Hungarian losses were probably comparable.\n\nMarshal Putnik ordered a retreat into the surrounding hills and the front settled into a month and a half of trench warfare, which was highly unfavourable to the Serbs, who had little in the way of an industrial base and were deficient in heavy artillery, ammunition stocks, shell production and footwear, since the vast majority of infantry wore the traditional (though state-issued) [[opanak]]s,<ref name=Jordan20/> while the Austro-Hungarians had waterproof leather boots. Most of their war material was supplied by the Allies, who were short of such materials themselves. In such a situation, Serbian artillery quickly became almost silent, while the Austro-Hungarians steadily increased their fire. Serbian casualties reached 100 soldiers a day from all causes in some divisions.\n\nDuring the first weeks of trench warfare, the Serbian U\u017eice Army (first strengthened division) and the Montenegrin Sanjak Army (roughly a division) conducted an abortive offensive into Bosnia. In addition, both sides conducted a few local attacks, most of which were soundly defeated. In one such attack, the Serbian Army used [[Mining (military)|mine warfare]] for the first time: the Combined Division dug tunnels beneath the Austro-Hungarian trenches (that were only 20\u201330 meters away from the Serbian ones on this sector), planted mines and set them off just before an infantry charge.\n\n=== Battle of Kolubara ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Kolubara}}\n[[File:Battle of Kolubara.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Later Operations in Serbia, 1914]]\nHaving thus weakened the Serbian army, the Austro-Hungarian Army launched another massive attack on 5 November. The Serbs withdrew step by step, offering strong resistance at the [[Kolubara]] River, but to no avail, due to the lack of artillery ammunition. It was at that time that General [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] was made commander of the battered First Army, replacing the wounded Petar Bojovi\u0107. He insisted on a deep withdrawal in order to give the troops some much-needed rest and to shorten the front. Marshal Putnik finally relented, but the consequence was the abandonment of the capital city of Belgrade. After suffering heavy losses, the Austro-Hungarian Army entered the city on 2 December. This action led Potiorek to move the whole Fifth Army into the Belgrade area and use it to crush the Serbian right flank. This, however, left the Sixth alone for a few days to face the whole Serbian army.\n\nAt this point, artillery ammunition finally arrived from France and Greece. In addition, some replacements were sent to the units and Marshal Putnik correctly sensed that the Austro-Hungarian forces were dangerously overstretched and weakened in the previous offensives, so he ordered a full-scale counterattack with the entire Serbian Army on 3 December against the Sixth Army. The Fifth hurried its flanking maneuver, but it was already too late \u2013 with the Sixth Army broken, the Second and Third Serbian Armies overwhelmed the Fifth. Finally, Potiorek lost his nerve and ordered yet another retreat back across the rivers into Austria-Hungary's territory. The Serbian Army recaptured Belgrade on 15 December.\n\nThe first phase of the war against Serbia had ended with no change in the border, but casualties were enormous compared to earlier wars, albeit comparable to other campaigns of World War I. The Serbian army suffered 170,000 men killed, wounded, captured or missing. Austro-Hungarian losses were approaching 215,000 men killed, wounded or missing.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Austro-Hungarian General Potiorek was removed from command and replaced by [[Archduke Eugen of Austria]] (C. Falls p.&nbsp;54). On the Serbian side, a deadly [[typhus]] epidemic killed hundreds of thousands of Serb civilians during the winter. \n\nAfter the Battle of Kolubara, the Serbian Parliament adopted the Ni\u0161 Declaration (7 December 1914) on the war goals of Serbia:\n\"Convinced that the entire Serbian nation is determined to persevere in the holy struggle for the defense of their homesteads and their freedom, the government of the Kingdom (of Serbia) considers that, in these fateful times, its main and only task is to ensure the successful completion of this great warfare which, at the moment when it started, also became a struggle for the liberation and unification of all our unliberated Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian brothers. The great success which is to crown this warfare will make up for the extremely bloody sacrifices which this generation of Serbs is making\". This amounted to announcing Serbia's intention to annex extensive amounts of Austria-Hungary's Balkan provinces.\n\n== 1915 ==\n\n=== Prelude ===\n\n[[File:Nikola Pasic 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, Serbian prime minister in 1915]]\n[[File:Fl\u00fcchtlingstransport Leibnitz - k.k. Innenministerium - 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Refugee Transport from Serbia 1914/15 in [[Leibnitz]], [[Styria]]]]\nEarly in 1915, with Ottoman defeats at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] and in the [[First Suez Offensive]], the German [[Chief of the General Staff (Germany)|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] tried to convince the Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff, [[Franz Graf Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf|Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], of the importance of conquering Serbia. If Serbia were taken, then the Germans would have a direct rail link from Germany through Austria-Hungary, then down to [[Istanbul]] and beyond. This would allow the Germans to send military supplies and even troops to help the [[Ottoman Empire]]. While this was hardly in Austria-Hungary's interests, the Austro-Hungarians did want to defeat Serbia. However, Russia was the more dangerous enemy, and furthermore, with the entry of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] into the war on the Allied side, the Austro-Hungarians had their hands full (see [[Italian Front (World War I)]]).\n\nBoth the Allies and the Central Powers tried to get Bulgaria to pick a side in the Great War. Bulgaria and Serbia had fought two wars in the last 30 years: the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] in 1885, and the Second Balkan War in 1913. The result was that the Bulgarian government and people felt that Serbia was in possession of lands to which Bulgaria was entitled, and when the Central Powers offered to give them what they claimed, the Bulgarians entered the war on their side. With the Allied loss in the [[Gallipoli campaign]] and the Russian defeat at [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|Gorlice]], King [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] signed a treaty with Germany and on 23 September 1915, Bulgaria began mobilizing for war.\n\n[[Jevto Dedijer]] stated in 1915 that \u201cthe occupation of Kosovo and Methoija gives Serbia a favourable position in occupying the rest of the Balkans\u201d.<ref>Abdullai Fejuzallhu, \"Albanofobia\", 2019. {{ISBN|9780359952373}} (p. 106)</ref>\n\n=== Opposing forces ===\nDuring the preceding nine months, the Serbs had tried and failed to rebuild their battered armies and improve their supply situation. Despite their efforts, the Serbian Army was only about 30,000 men stronger than at the start of the war (around 225,000) and was still badly equipped. Although Britain and France had talked about sending serious military forces to Serbia, nothing was done until it was too late. When Bulgaria began mobilizing, the French and British sent two divisions, but they arrived late in the [[Greece|Greek]] town of [[Salonika]]. Part of the reason for the delay was the [[National schism]] in Greek politics of the time that generating conflicting views about the war.\n\nAgainst Serbia were marshalled the Bulgarian [[First Army (Bulgaria)|First Army]] commanded by [[Kliment Boyadzhiev]], the German [[11th Army (German Empire)|Eleventh Army]] commanded by [[Max von Gallwitz]] and the Austro-Hungarian [[3rd Army (Austria-Hungary)|Third Army]] commanded by [[Hermann K\u00f6vess von K\u00f6vessh\u00e1za]], all under the control of Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]]. In addition the Bulgarian [[Second Army (Bulgaria)|Second Army]] commanded by ([[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]]), which remained under the direct control of the Bulgarian high command, was deployed against [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\n=== Course of the campaign ===\n{{see also|Great Retreat (Serbian){{!}}Great Retreat}}\nThe Austro-Hungarians and Germans began their attack on 7 October with their troops crossing the Drina and Sava rivers, covered by heavy artillery fire. Once they crossed the Danube, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians moved on Belgrade itself. Vicious street fighting ensued,<ref name=\"Jordan53\">{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=53}}</ref> and the Serbs' resistance in the city was finally crushed on 9 October.<ref name=\"Willmott120\">{{harvnb|Willmott|2008|p=120}}</ref>\n\nThen, on 14 October, the Bulgarian Army attacked from the north of Bulgaria towards [[Ni\u0161]] and from the south towards [[Skopje]] (see map). The Bulgarian First Army defeated the Serbian Second Army at the [[Battle of Morava]], while the Bulgarian Second Army defeated the Serbians at the [[Battle of Ovche Pole]]. With the Bulgarian breakthrough, the Serbian position became untenable; the main army in the north (around Belgrade) could either retreat or be surrounded and forced to surrender. In the [[battle of Kosovo (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]], the Serbs made a last and desperate attempt to join the two incomplete Allied divisions that made a limited advance from the south, but were unable to gather enough forces due to the pressure from the north and east. They were halted by the Bulgarians under General Todorov and had to pull back.\n\n[[File:Serbian retreat WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Serbian Army during its retreat towards Albania]]\n\nMarshal Putnik ordered the [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|Great Retreat]], a full retreat south and west through Montenegro and into Albania. The weather was terrible, the roads poor, and the army had to help the tens of thousands of civilians who retreated with them with almost no supplies or food left. But the bad weather and poor roads worked for the refugees as well, as the Central Powers forces could not press them hard enough, so they evaded capture. Many of the fleeing soldiers and civilians did not make it to the coast, though \u2013 they were lost to hunger, disease, and attacks by enemy forces and Albanian tribal bands<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=1075\u20136}}</ref>, due to the memory of suppressed rebellions and [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DiNardo |first1=Richard L. |title=Invasion: The Conquest of Serbia, 1915: The Conquest of Serbia, 1915 |date=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-4408-0093-1 |pages=117-118 |edition=\"The Muslim population of Serbia had been subjekt to all manner of mistreatment oat the hands of the Serbian Orthodox majority during the Balkan Wars.\" |url=https://books.google.se/books?id=6ZeIBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116&dq=Serbian+retreat+1915+Albanians&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiU9f2JzbzoAhUjxKYKHRz7AqYQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=28 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Lieberman |first1=Benjamin |title=Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe |date=2013 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4422-3038-5 |pages=83-84 |edition=\"Driven out of the north and east, the Serb retreat ended up in Kosovo in November 1915.

All told, only some 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reached the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and embarked on Allied transport ships that carried the army to various Greek islands (many to [[Corfu]]) before being sent to Salonika. The evacuation of the Serbian army from Albania was completed on 10 February 1916. The survivors were so weakened that thousands of them died from sheer exhaustion in the weeks after their rescue. Marshal Putnik had to be carried during the whole retreat and he died around fifteen months later in a hospital in France.\n\nThe French and British divisions had marched north from Thessaloniki in October 1915 under the command of French General [[Maurice Sarrail]]. The War Office in London was reluctant to advance too deep into Serbia, so the French divisions advanced on their own up the [[Vardar]] River. This advance gave some limited help to the retreating Serbian Army, as the Bulgarians had to concentrate larger forces on their southern flank to deal with the threat, which led to the [[Battle of Krivolak]] (October\u2013November 1915). By the end of November, General Sarrail had to retreat in the face of massive Bulgarian assaults on his positions. During his retreat, the British at the [[Battle of Kosturino]] were also forced to retreat. By 12 December, all allied forces were back in Greece.\n\n[[File:QG Triplice Macedoine.jpg|thumb|German and Bulgarian commanders in Serbia on 16 November 1915.

The Austrian-Hungarians launched their [[Montenegrin Campaign of World War I|Montenegrin campaign]] on 5 January 1916 and despite some success of The Montenegrins in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]], they were completely defeated within 2 weeks.\n\nThis was a nearly complete victory for the Central Powers at a cost of around 67,000 casualties as compared to around 94,000 Serbs killed or wounded and 174,000 captured, of which 70,000 were wounded.{{sfn|DiNardo|2015|p=122}} The railroad from Berlin to Istanbul was finally opened. The only flaw in the victory was that much of the Serbian Army had successfully retreated, although it was left very disorganized and required rebuilding.\n\n== 1916\u20131918 ==\n{{Main article|Macedonian Front|Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)}}\nThe Serbian army was evacuated to Greece and joined up with the [[Allied Army of the Orient]]. They then fought a trench war against the Bulgarians on the Macedonia Front. The Macedonian Front in the beginning was mostly static. French and Serbian forces re-took limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916 as a result of the costly [[Monastir Offensive]], which brought stabilization of the front.\n\nFrench and Serbian troops finally made a breakthrough in the [[Vardar Offensive]] in 1918, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had withdrawn. This breakthrough was significant in defeating Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary, which led to the final victory of World War I. After the Allied breakthrough, Bulgaria capitulated on 29 September 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Wood|Murphy|1999|p=120}}</ref> Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and insisted on an immediate peace settlement during a meeting with government officials a day after the Bulgarian collapse.<ref name=\"Doughty\">{{cite book|author=Robert A.

They pushed forward in September 1918, forced Bulgaria to leave the war and eventually managed to liberate Serbia two weeks before the end of World War I.\n\n== End of the War ==\nThe ramifications of the war were manifold. When World War I ended, the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] awarded [[Western Thrace]] to Greece, whereas Serbia received some minor territorial concessions from Bulgaria. Austria-Hungary was broken apart, and Hungary lost much land to both Yugoslavia and Romania in the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Serbia assumed the leading position in the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], joined by its old ally, [[Montenegro]]. Meanwhile, Italy established a quasi-protectorate over Albania and Greece re-occupied Albania's southern part, which was autonomous under a local Greek provisional government (see [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]]), despite Albania's neutrality during the war.\n\n== Casualties ==\n[[File:WorldWarI-MilitaryDeaths-EntentePowers-Piechart.svg|thumb|left|The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] casualties]]\n\nBefore the war, the Kingdom of Serbia had 4,500,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWinSerbia.htm|title=Serbia in 1914|publisher=}}</ref> According to the [[New York Times]], 150,000 people are estimated to have died in 1915 alone during the worst [[typhus|typhus epidemic]] in world history.

With this extra time to work on these and future episodes while taking in reception from this season, I think the next will really benefit in the long term. Plus, it gets the rare honor of being a new Fox animated show that actually GOT a second season, which has not happened since ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' got its first renewal at the start of the decade. Fox is thinking outside the box to keep its adult animation thriving, which hopefully means more chances for exploration in future seasons. I\u2019ll tell you what, these Harts are quite blessed to be given the chance to be Fox\u2019s next enduring animated series.\"<ref>{{cite

With this extra time to work on these and future episodes while taking in reception from this season, I think the next will really benefit in the long term. Plus, it gets the rare honor of being a new Fox animated show that actually GOT a second season, which has not happened since ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' got its first renewal at the start of the decade. Fox is thinking outside the box to keep its adult animation thriving, which hopefully means more chances for exploration in future seasons. I\u2019ll tell you what, these Harts are quite blessed to be given the chance to be Fox\u2019s next enduring animated series.\"<ref>{{cite

The season was produced by [[ABC Studios]], in association with Shondaland Production Company and [[Mark Gordon|The Mark Gordon Company]]; the [[showrunner]] being [[Shonda Rhimes]] and head writer [[Krista Vernoff]]. Actors [[Ellen Pompeo]], [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], and [[Justin Chambers]] reprised their roles as surgical residents [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], [[Izzie Stevens]], and [[Alex Karev]], respectively. Heigl was released from her contract in the middle of the season, while [[T.R. Knight]] did not appear as [[George O'Malley]], because Knight was released from his contract at the conclusion of [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|season five]]. Main cast members [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens, Jr.]], [[Sara Ramirez]], [[Eric Dane]], [[Chyler Leigh]], and [[Kevin McKidd]] also returned, while previous recurring star [[Jessica Capshaw]] was promoted to a series regular, and [[Kim Raver]] was given star billing after the commencement of the season.\n\nThe season follows the story of [[surgery|surgical]] [[Internship (medicine)|interns]], [[residency (medicine)|residents]] and their competent mentors, as they experience the difficulties of the competitive careers they have chosen. It is set in the surgical wing of the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in [[Seattle, Washington]]. A major storyline of the season is the characters adapting to change, as their beloved co-worker Stevens departed following the breakdown of her marriage, O'Malley died in the season premiere\u2014following his being dragged by a bus, and new [[cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] [[Teddy Altman]] is given employment at the hospital. Further storylines include Shepherd being promoted to chief of surgery, Seattle Grace Hospital merging with the neighboring Mercy West&nbsp;\u2014introducing several new doctors, and several physicians lives being placed into danger\u2014when a grieving deceased patient's husband embarks on a shooting spree at the hospital, seeking revenge for his wife's death. \n\nThe series ended its sixth season with 13.26 million viewers, ranking #17 in terms of ratings, the lowest the series had ever ranked up to then. The season received mixed critical feedback, with the season's premiere and finale given heavier critical acclaim, in contrast to the middle.

It was certainly the best ''Grey's Anatomy'' has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like ''Grey's Anatomy'', and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours.

The season was produced by [[ABC Studios]], in association with Shondaland Production Company and [[Mark Gordon|The Mark Gordon Company]]; the [[showrunner]] being [[Shonda Rhimes]] and head writer [[Krista Vernoff]]. Actors [[Ellen Pompeo]], [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], and [[Justin Chambers]] reprised their roles as surgical residents [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], [[Izzie Stevens]], and [[Alex Karev]], respectively. Heigl was released from her contract in the middle of the season, while [[T.R. Knight]] did not appear as [[George O'Malley]], because Knight was released from his contract at the conclusion of [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|season five]]. Main cast members [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens, Jr.]], [[Sara Ramirez]], [[Eric Dane]], [[Chyler Leigh]], and [[Kevin McKidd]] also returned, while previous recurring star [[Jessica Capshaw]] was promoted to a series regular, and [[Kim Raver]] was given star billing after the commencement of the season.\n\nThe season follows the story of [[surgery|surgical]] [[Internship (medicine)|interns]], [[residency (medicine)|residents]] and their competent mentors, as they experience the difficulties of the competitive careers they have chosen. It is set in the surgical wing of the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in [[Seattle, Washington]]. A major storyline of the season is the characters adapting to change, as their beloved co-worker Stevens departed following the breakdown of her marriage, O'Malley died in the season premiere\u2014following his being dragged by a bus, and new [[cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] [[Teddy Altman]] is given employment at the hospital. Further storylines include Shepherd being promoted to chief of surgery, Seattle Grace Hospital merging with the neighboring Mercy West&nbsp;\u2014introducing several new doctors, and several physicians lives being placed into danger\u2014when a grieving deceased patient's husband embarks on a shooting spree at the hospital, seeking revenge for his wife's death. \n\nThe series ended its sixth season with 13.26 million viewers, ranking #17 in terms of ratings, the lowest the series had ever ranked up to then. The season received mixed critical feedback, with the season's premiere and finale given heavier critical acclaim, in contrast to the middle. The season was one of the least acclaimed in terms of awards and nominations, being the show's only season not to warrant a [[Primetime Emmy]] nomination. Despite the negative aspects of ratings and awards, the season managed to receive a spot on ''[[Movieline]]''{{'s}} top ten list. [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] released the season onto a DVD box-set, being made available to regions 1 and 2.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{main|List of Grey's Anatomy cast members|List of Grey's Anatomy characters}}\n{{Columns-start|num=3}}\n=== Main ===\n* [[Ellen Pompeo]] as [[Meredith Grey|Dr. Meredith Grey]]\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as [[Cristina Yang|Dr. Cristina Yang]]\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as [[Izzie Stevens|Dr. Izzie Stevens]]\n* [[Justin Chambers]] as [[Alex Karev|Dr. Alex Karev]]\n* [[Chandra Wilson]] as [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]]\n* [[James Pickens Jr.]] as [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]]\n* [[Sara Ramirez]] as [[Callie Torres|Dr. Callie Torres]]\n* [[Eric Dane]] as [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Dr. Mark Sloan]]\n* [[Chyler Leigh]] as [[Lexie Grey|Dr. Lexie Grey]]\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as [[Owen Hunt|Dr. Owen Hunt]]\n* [[Jessica Capshaw]] as [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]]\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]]\n* [[Kim Raver]] as [[Teddy Altman|Dr. Teddy Altman]]\n{{column}}\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* [[Nora Zehetner]] as Reed Adamson\n* [[Robert Baker (actor) |Robert Baker]] as Charles Percy\n* [[Sarah Drew]] as [[April Kepner]]\n* [[Jesse Williams (actor) |Jesse Williams]] as [[Jackson Avery]]\n* [[Jason Winston George |Jason George]] as Ben Warren\n* [[Leven Rambin]] as Sloan Riley\n* [[Jeff Perry (American actor) |Jeff Perry]] as Thatcher Grey\n* [[Kate Walsh (actress) |Kate Walsh]] as [[Addison Montgomery]]\n{{column}}\n\n=== Notable guests ===\n* [[Demi Lovato]] as Hayley\n* [[Sara Gilbert]] as Kim Allen\n* [[Marion Ross]] as Betty\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Mary Portman\n* [[Ryan Devlin]] as Bill Portman\n* Nick Purcell as Doug\n* [[Michael O'Neill (actor) |Michael O'Neill]] as Gary Clark\n* [[Danielle Panabaker]] as Kelsey\n* [[Adrienne Barbeau]] as Jodie Crawley\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Mr. Torres\n* [[Cody Christian]] as Brad Walker\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Pam Michaelson\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Adele Webber\n* [[Mitch Pileggi]] as \tLarry Jennings\n* [[Sarah Utterback]] as Olivia Harper\n* [[Steven W.

Unfortunately, Meredith is also fooled and the shock of thinking her husband is dead is enough to trigger a miscarriage. Gary ends up in the sanctuary with one bullet left. Webber, realizing Gary's actions are partly his fault due to his mishandling his wife's illness, enters the chapel and sits down next to him. Gary admits that his plan was to save two bullets and kill Webber with one and himself with the last, but now he doesn't know what to do with one bullet left.

Marsi gave the episode five stars, and expressed that it may have been the best episode of the series, adding: \"The writing and acting were absolutely stellar, and may lead to many Emmy nominations, but even more impressively, despite a killing spree, it remained distinctly Grey's. Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know where to begin now.
