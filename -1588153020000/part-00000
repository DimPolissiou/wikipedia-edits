Although the Dukedom and estates had passed, a large share of the Hamilton lands and properties, including Easton park, went to Lady Mary, the 12th Duke and Duchess's only child.\n\nAfter [[World War I]] the British government imposed colossal taxes on the rich to help defray the cost of the war. Faced with these taxes and with the cost of restoring Easton Park from it use as a Red Cross Hospital during the war, the late-12th Duke's daughter the Duchess of Montrose and her husband [[James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose]], decided to sell the estate.\n\nThe land was divided into 137 lots and sold by auction in 1919. The sale attracted a great deal of attention and raised \u00a358,000 (\u00a34.6 million today) but Easton park itself (often referred to as 'the Mansion') and its 150-acre parkland remained unsold. It was sold privately for \u00a311,278 (\u00a3900,000 today) and the parkland was transferred to Martley Hall. With very little land the Mansion's fate was sealed and in December 1924 demolition began.

The pack of [[harrier (dog)|harrier]]s was established and funded entirely by the duke, much to the delight of the local landowners and farmers. Following his death in 1895, the committee received the Dowager Duchess's permission to name the pack the 'Hamilton Hounds' in his memory. Since the succession of the 13th Duke and the consequent split of Easton away from the Hamilton estate, the connection between the family and the hunt has waned. The hunt is now called the Easton Harriers and is still an integral part of the village, and shows good sport in the local area.\n\nEaston is also the home of Easton Farm Park, a farming museum with a selection of rare breeds and depicting other countryside related activities.\n\nEaston is also the home of Little Legs and The Guv'nor.

He is best known for his partnership with [[Amanda Evora]], with whom he competed at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], placing tenth. They won bronze at an ISU Grand Prix event, the [[2010 Cup of Russia]], and two [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. national]] silver medals. He later skated with [[Lindsay Davis (figure skater)|Lindsay Davis]] for one season.\n\n==Personal life==\nMark Ladwig was born in [[Fargo, North Dakota]] to Carol and John, a medical technician and a doctor respectively, and grew up in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]] with two siblings, Todd and Erin.<ref name=USFS-AEML/> He married his wife, Janet, in August 2006.<ref name=bio1112/> A boy named Holden Everett was born September 13, 2009.<ref name=tie090921/> A second son, Felix Rye Ladwig, was born July 1, 2014.<ref name=IN140703/>\n\n==Career==\nLadwig skated with Kelsey Sollom until 1999 in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]] and then with Keri Blakinger while at the [[University of Delaware Figure Skating Club]] in [[Newark, Delaware]].<ref name=9900usn/><ref name=0001usn/> He volunteered at the 2002 Winter Olympics and worked in Salt Lake Olympic Square.<ref name=grate/>\n\nIn June 2002, Ladwig began skating with [[Amanda Evora]]. They finished 12th in their debut at the U.S. Championships and fifth at their first ISU Championship, the [[2005 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2005 Four Continents]]. In 2007, Ladwig began serving on the [[U.S. Figure Skating]] Athletes Advisory Committee.<ref name=aacl/> He was the pairs vice-chair of the 2008\u201309 Athletes Advisory Committee.<ref name=0809aac/>\n\n2009\u201310 was a breakthrough season for Evora/Ladwig. They took second at the [[2010 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S Championships]], their best finish at the event, which led to their selection for the US Olympic team. At the [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Vancouver Olympics]], they beat their previous personal best by a sizable margin, and finished tenth, making them the top US pair at the Olympics.<ref name=mh100216/> They later competed at [[2010 World Figure Skating Championships|Worlds]] for the first time in their career, and finished in ninth place.\n\nDuring 2010\u20132011 season, Evora/Ladwig were assigned to compete at Cup of China where they finished fifth (151.66 pts) and later earned their first Grand Prix medal, a bronze, at Rostelecom Cup, with a season's best of 110.27 and total score of 162.85. Evora/Ladwig repeated at US Nationals earning their second silver medal, and were selected to compete at [[2011 Four Continents Championships|Four Continents]] and [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships|Worlds]]. At Four Continents, Ladwig's left skate heel broke during the short program, but he and Evora were able to resume the program within the allowed three minutes after Canadian [[Rudi Swiegers]] lent his own boot to Ladwig.<ref name=sd110217/> Ladwig was able to repair his skate prior to the free skate,<ref name=taipei/> and the pair went on to finish sixth overall. Evora/Ladwig were noted for their longevity as a pair, which is rare in U.S. pair skating.<ref name=ic051811/> Their partnership ended when Evora retired from competitive skating on April 10, 2012.<ref name=usfs120410/>\n\nLadwig was elected to the USOC AAC in 2012. In May, he announced that he had teamed up with [[Lindsay Davis (figure skater)|Lindsay Davis]].<ref name=in120504/> Davis/Ladwig competed at two [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] events and won the pewter medal at the [[2013 United States Figure Skating Championships|2013 U.S. Championships]].

Directed by [[Sylvain White]], ''Stomp the Yard'' centers on DJ Williams, a college student at a fictional [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically Black university]] who pledges to join a fictional [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|Greek-letter fraternity]]. The film's central conflict involves DJ's fraternity competing in various [[stepping (African-American)|stepping]] competitions against a rival fraternity from the same school. The film's script was written by [[Robert Adetuyi]], working from an original draft by [[Gregory Anderson (screenwriter)|Gregory Ramon Anderson]]. The film was originally titled ''Steppin''', but to avoid confusion over the [[2006 in film|2006]] film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]'', the title was changed. [[Delta Sigma Theta]] along with other sororities like Gamma Theta were in the movie.\n\nThe film stars [[Columbus Short]], [[Meagan Good]], [[Darrin Henson]], [[Brian J. White|Brian White]], [[Laz Alonso]], and [[Valarie Pettiford]], with [[Harry Lennix]], and, in their film debuts, R&B singers [[Ne-Yo]] & [[Chris Brown]]. ''Stomp the Yard'' was filmed in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], on the campuses of [[Morris Brown College]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], [[Morehouse College]], and [[Clark Atlanta University]], and in the [[MAK Historic District]] of [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]], Georgia. Elsewhere Short, Alonso and Brown had also starred together in the film ''[[This Christmas (film)|This Christmas]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nDJ Williams is a young man in inner-city [[Los Angeles]]. He and his younger brother Duron compete in local dance competitions as members of a crew known as the \"Goon Squad\". During the battle there are backs and forths, but in the end of the battle the Goon Squad win a cash-prize, and Sphere, the leader of The Thug Unit goes all in for a double or nothing battle, which DJ accepts much to the dismay of his brother who knows that if the opposing crew leader thinks he got hustled the crew won't be able to spend the money they win. The Goon Squad wins the second battle and the losing home crew responds by ambushing DJ and his crewmates after the show. A fight breaks out, and the leader of the rival crew starts beating up DJ. Duron pushes him away and starts fighting him, leading the rival to pull out a gun and shoot Duron, killing him.\n\nAfter DJ is Arrested for assault, his mother, (wanting him to bypass Juvenile Hall) sends him to live with his aunt Jackie and uncle Nate in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where he is to attend [[HBCU|historically black]] Truth University. Nate, the [[physical plant]] director at Truth, aims to teach DJ responsibility and puts him to work doing maintenance as part of a [[Cooperative education|work-study]] program.\n\nDJ sees April Palmer, to whom he is immediately attracted. After registration, he moves into his dorm room, where he meets his new roommate Rich Brown. Rich meets DJ at a [[Stepping (African-American)|stepping]] competition on the green between the Truth chapters of rival [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] Theta Nu Theta and Mu Gamma Xi. The Mu Gamma Xi crew, seven-time national stepping champions, easily steals the show until DJ sees April across the way and runs right through their step line in an attempt to speak to her.\n\nThat night, Rich and his friends go out to a local club called the Phoenix and invite DJ along. Hoping to impress April and upstage Grant and the Gammas (all of whom are also in attendance), DJ takes to the floor. Despite the animosity between DJ and Grant, the Gammas recognize his skills as a dancer and their chapter president Zeke invites him to pledge for Mu Gamma Xi. DJ turns down both Zeke's offer as well as an offer from the Theta Nu Theta chapter's leader Sylvester.\n\nAfter learning that April is a student history tutor, DJ signs himself up for tutoring so that he can spend time with her. The two slowly begin a friendship and DJ takes April out to dinner. During their date, April discusses the importance of [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|black fraternities and sororities]] with DJ, and tells him to visit Heritage Hall on the campus' Greek Row.\n\nThe next day, DJ learns about the significant number of African-American historical figures and celebrities who were members of various Greek-letter organizations, and decides to pledge for the Theta chapter along with Rich and their friend Noel. After \"crossing over\" to become official Theta members, DJ, Rich, and Noel join the Thetas' step crew.\n\nWhile having dinner, April breaks up with Grant due to his chauvinistic attitude and his failure to know anything about her, particularly that green is her favorite color. She grows closer to DJ and they eventually become a couple. While at practice, DJ, Rich, Noel and other new members realize the step dance moves are old fashioned and aren't good enough to win the stepping competition. So they decide to take the time to learn fresher moves. Sly then gathers his older member and challenges DJ and the rest to an old school vs. new school stepping contest. DJ blows the contest due to his showboating. They remind DJ, much like Duron did earlier in the film, that it is about the team and not about him. DJ apologizes to the entire fraternity and is quickly forgiven. Sly also requests that DJ show the team some of his street moves.\n\nA few days before the competition, Grant stumbles upon DJ's file and discovers his assault record and presents it to the board. The board then decides to suspend DJ for not disclosing his criminal record. Dr. Palmer, who is April's father, calls in DJ to his office. He was willing to lift his suspension on the condition that he is to no longer date April. DJ declines the ultimatum and walks away. DJ then tells Nate and Jackie about the suspension. They then reveal that Jackie dated Dr. Palmer until she met Nate and there has been some animosity between Nate and Palmer ever since. Jackie confronts Dr. Palmer about DJ's suspension and Palmer claims he was only protecting April. April then confronted her father about the situation. Palmer then overturned the board's decision deciding that he would rather deal with DJ in April's life than lose his daughter in his.\n\nDJ's suspension was finally lifted and he rejoins the Thetas to compete alongside them against the Gammas in the stepping competition. Both teams were tied at the end and it was brought into sudden death rules to determine a winner. Unknown to DJ and the Thetas, the Gammas had recorded DJ practicing his moves prior to the competition. Going first, Grant does DJ's exact routine from the videotape. After he finishes, DJ matches Grant move for move, but tosses in something the Gammas didn't get on tape. The Thetas finally defeat the Gammas. April goes on stage to hug and kiss DJ. While celebrating their victory, DJ is still wearing Duron's gloves, and he kisses his fist and throws it in the air in honor of his brother.

Directed by [[Sylvain White]], ''Stomp the Yard'' centers on DJ Williams, a college student at a fictional [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically Black university]] who pledges to join a fictional [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|Greek-letter fraternity]]. The film's central conflict involves DJ's fraternity competing in various [[stepping (African-American)|stepping]] competitions against a rival fraternity from the same school. The film's script was written by [[Robert Adetuyi]], working from an original draft by [[Gregory Anderson (screenwriter)|Gregory Ramon Anderson]]. The film was originally titled ''Steppin''', but to avoid confusion over the [[2006 in film|2006]] film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]'', the title was changed. [[Delta Sigma Theta]] along with other sororities like Gamma Theta were in the movie.\n\nThe film stars [[Columbus Short]], [[Meagan Good]], [[Darrin Henson]], [[Brian J. White|Brian White]], [[Laz Alonso]], and [[Valarie Pettiford]], with [[Harry Lennix]], and, in their film debuts, R&B singers [[Ne-Yo]] & [[Chris Brown]]. ''Stomp the Yard'' was filmed in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], on the campuses of [[Morris Brown College]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], [[Morehouse College]], and [[Clark Atlanta University]], and in the [[MAK Historic District]] of [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]], Georgia. Elsewhere Short, Alonso and Brown had also starred together in the film ''[[This Christmas (film)|This Christmas]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nDJ Williams is a young man in inner-city [[Los Angeles]]. He and his younger brother Duron compete in local dance competitions as members of a crew known as the \"Goon Squad\". During the battle there are backs and forths, but in the end of the battle the Goon Squad win a cash-prize, and Sphere, the leader of The Thug Unit goes all in for a double or nothing battle, which DJ accepts much to the dismay of his brother who knows that if the opposing crew leader thinks he got hustled the crew won't be able to spend the money they win. The Goon Squad wins the second battle and the losing home crew responds by ambushing DJ and his crewmates after the show. A fight breaks out, and the leader of the rival crew starts beating up DJ. Duron pushes him away and starts fighting him, leading the rival to pull out a gun and shoot Duron, killing him.\n\nAfter DJ is Arrested for assault, his mother, (wanting him to bypass Juvenile Hall) sends him to live with his aunt Jackie and uncle Nate in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where he is to attend [[HBCU|historically black]] Truth University. Nate, the [[physical plant]] director at Truth, aims to teach DJ responsibility and puts him to work doing maintenance as part of a [[Cooperative education|work-study]] program.\n\nDJ sees April Palmer, to whom he is immediately attracted. After registration, he moves into his dorm room, where he meets his new roommate Rich Brown. Rich meets DJ at a [[Stepping (African-American)|stepping]] competition on the green between the Truth chapters of rival [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] Theta Nu Theta and Mu Gamma Xi. The Mu Gamma Xi crew, seven-time national stepping champions, easily steals the show until DJ sees April across the way and runs right through their step line in an attempt to speak to her.\n\nThat night, Rich and his friends go out to a local club called the Phoenix and invite DJ along. Hoping to impress April and upstage Grant and the Gammas (all of whom are also in attendance), DJ takes to the floor. Despite the animosity between DJ and Grant, the Gammas recognize his skills as a dancer and their chapter president Zeke invites him to pledge for Mu Gamma Xi. DJ turns down both Zeke's offer as well as an offer from the Theta Nu Theta chapter's leader Sylvester.\n\nAfter learning that April is a student history tutor, DJ signs himself up for tutoring so that he can spend time with her. The two slowly begin a friendship and DJ takes April out to dinner. During their date, April discusses the importance of [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|black fraternities and sororities]] with DJ, and tells him to visit Heritage Hall on the campus' Greek Row.\n\nThe next day, DJ learns about the significant number of African-American historical figures and celebrities who were members of various Greek-letter organizations, and decides to pledge for the Theta chapter along with Rich and their friend Noel. After \"crossing over\" to become official Theta members, DJ, Rich, and Noel join the Thetas' step crew.\n\nWhile having dinner, April breaks up with Grant due to his chauvinistic attitude and his failure to know anything about her, particularly that green is her favorite color. She grows closer to DJ and they eventually become a couple. While at practice, DJ, Rich, Noel and other new members realize the step dance moves are old fashioned and aren't good enough to win the stepping competition. So they decide to take the time to learn fresher moves. Sly then gathers his older member and challenges DJ and the rest to an old school vs. new school stepping contest. DJ blows the contest due to his showboating. They remind DJ, much like Duron did earlier in the film, that it is about the team and not about him. DJ apologizes to the entire fraternity and is quickly forgiven. Sly also requests that DJ show the team some of his street moves.\n\nA few days before the competition, Grant stumbles upon DJ's file and discovers his assault record and presents it to the board. The board then decides to suspend DJ for not disclosing his criminal record. Dr. Palmer, who is April's father, calls in DJ to his office. He was willing to lift his suspension on the condition that he is to no longer date April. DJ declines the ultimatum and walks away. DJ then tells Nate and Jackie about the suspension. They then reveal that Jackie dated Dr. Palmer until she met Nate and there has been some animosity between Nate and Palmer ever since. Jackie confronts Dr. Palmer about DJ's suspension and Palmer claims he was only protecting April. April then confronted her father about the situation. Palmer then overturned the board's decision deciding that he would rather deal with DJ in April's life than lose his daughter in his.\n\nDJ's suspension was finally lifted and he rejoins the Thetas to compete alongside them against the Gammas in the stepping competition. Both teams were tied at the end and it was brought into sudden death rules to determine a winner. Unknown to DJ and the Thetas, the Gammas had recorded DJ practicing his moves prior to the competition. Going first, Grant does DJ's exact routine from the videotape. After he finishes, DJ matches Grant move for move, but tosses in something the Gammas didn't get on tape. The Thetas finally defeat the Gammas. April goes on stage to hug and kiss DJ. While celebrating their victory, DJ is still wearing Duron's gloves, and he kisses his fist and throws it in the air in honor of his brother. The Thetas then do their new cheer and have their picture taken where it is hung in the Heritage Hall.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Columbus Short]] as Darnell James \u201cDJ\u201d Williams, a gifted street dancer who starts out being a selfish loner.\n*[[Meagan Good]] as April Palmer, DJ's love interest, and Dr. Palmer's daughter.\n*[[Ne-Yo]] as Rich Brown, DJ's roommate.\n*[[Darrin Henson]] as Grant, the star stepper of Truth University and DJ's adversary.\n*[[Harry J.

He is the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories, many of them widely considered classics in the field and winners of multiple literary awards. Three of his novels have been filmed. \n\nSince he first came to prominence in the mid-1960s, critics have cited Campbell as one of the leading writers in his field: [[T. E. D. Klein]] has written that \"Campbell reigns supreme in the field today\",<ref>Klein, T. E. D. \"Ramsey Campbell: An Appreciation\", quoted in ''Ramsey Campbell and Modern Horror Fiction'' (Liverpool University Press, 2001) by S. T. Joshi</ref> and Robert Hadji has described him as \"perhaps the finest living exponent of the British weird fiction tradition\",<ref>Robert Hadji, \"[John] Ramsey Campbell\" in Jack Sullivan (ed), ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural'' (NY and Harmondsworth UK: Penguin, 1986), p. 67</ref> while [[S.

He was educated by [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] at [[St. Edward's College|St Edward's College]], Liverpool. Campbell's childhood and adolescence were marked by the rift between his parents, who became estranged shortly after his birth. Campbell's father became a shadowy presence more often heard than seen.<ref>S.T. Joshi, \"[John] Ramsey Campbell\" in Joshi and Stefan Dziemianowicz (eds). ''Supernatural Literature of the World'', Westport CT: Greenwood Press, 2005, p. 203</ref> Campbell states, \"I didn't see my father face to face for nearly twenty years, and that was when he was dying.\" Years later, Campbell's mother degenerated into paranoia and [[schizophrenia]], rendering his own life a living hell\u2014an experience he has discussed in detail in the introduction and afterword to the restored text of ''The Face That Must Die''.<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. \"At the Back of My Mind: A Guided Tour\", introduction to ''The Face That Must Die'' (1990), pp.vii-xxv, and Afterword (pp.236-238). {{ISBN|0-7088-4394-8}}</ref> Other autobiographical pieces regarding Campbell's life are available in Section V, \"On Ramsey Campbell\" in his essay collection ''Ramsey Campbell, Probably: 30 Years of Essays and Articles'' (ed. [[S.T. Joshi]], Hornsea, UK: PS Publishing, 2002).\n\nCampbell's mother \"wrote a great deal, novel after novel, but was largely unpublished aside from a handful of short stories in writer's magazines.\" She encouraged her young son to send his writing off from an early age.<ref name=\"catalystmedia.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/issues/misc/articles/ramsey_campbell.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171313/http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/issues/misc/articles/ramsey_campbell.php|url-status=dead|title=Mark Langshaw, \"Interview with Ramsey Campbell\", ''Nerve'' online|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref> Growing up in the blitzed landscape of post-war Liverpool, Campbell avidly consumed the work of Lovecraft, [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Franz Kafka]] and the cinema of [[film noir]]. \n\n===''Ghostly Tales''===\n\nCampbell's earliest tales, written when he was 11 years old (1957\u201358; under the influence of a magazine from [[Bolton]], Lancashire, called ''Phantom''), comprised a self-illustrated collection of sixteen stories and a poem he entitled \"Ghostly Tales\". Campbell intended to submit to ''Phantom'', but his mother, who regarded literary success as a possible way of financing her escape from her disastrous marriage, persuaded him to wait until he had a whole book to show to publishers. His English teacher, Brother Kelly, used to have him read his stories to the class. Campbell (as John R. Campbell) submitted ''Ghostly Tales'' to \"numerous publishers\" <ref name=\"catalystmedia.org.uk\"/> including Tom Boardman publisher; Boardman rejected it as they did not publish ghost stories, but his rejection letter included encouragement to Campbell to keep writing.<ref>Ramsey Campbell, \"It Came from the Past\", ''Ghostly Tales: Crypt of Cthulhu'' 6, No 8, whole number 50, Michaelmas 1987, edited by [[Robert M. Price]]), p. 3</ref> This collection of [[juvenilia]] was published thirty years later, as a special issue of ''[[Crypt of Cthulhu]]'' magazine titled ''Ghostly Tales: Crypt of Cthulhu'' 6, No 8, whole number 50, Michaelmas 1987, edited by [[Robert M. Price]]. It is of interest that, though the stories are mostly mainstream spectral lore, one story (\"The Hollow in the Woods\") can be considered a very early mythos yarn.\n\nAnother issue of this magazine ''Crypt of Cthulhu'' No 43 (Hallowmas 1983), titled ''The Tomb-Herd and Others'' collects various early stories, including some early drafts of tales later published revised in Campbell's first book, ''The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants'' ([[Arkham House]], 1964)). The manuscripts of Campbell's early tales are housed at the Local History Library of the Liverpool Public Libraries.\n\n===The influence of H. P. Lovecraft and ''The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants''===\n\nCampbell first encountered [[H. P. Lovecraft]] at age eight (1954), via the story \"[[The Colour Out of Space]]\", which he found in the [[Groff Conklin]] anthology ''Strange Travels in Science Fiction'', and within the next few years read \"[[The Rats in the Walls]]\" and \"[[The Dunwich Horror]]\", encountered in the Wise and Fraser anthology ''Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural''. At the age of twelve, Campbell attempted to write a novel titled ''Broken Moon'', influenced by [[Arthur Machen]], but it petered out after fifty pages.<ref>Stefan R. Dziemanowicz. \"An Interview with Ramsey Campbell\" in S.T. Joshi, ed. ''The Count of Thirty: A Tribute to Ramsey Campbell'', West Warwick, RI: [[Necronomicon Press]], 1993, p. 15</ref> By the age of 14, he discovered Lovecraft's ''Cry Horror!'', a British edition of the collection entitled ''The Lurking Fear'', and read it in one day, finding the fiction's sense of awesomeness as well as horror extraordinarily appealing. He had also read [[Arthur Machen]]'s major horror stories by this age, and some works by [[John Dickson Carr]], which led him to write a 100-page Carr pastiche (unfinished) titled ''Murder By Moonlight''.<ref>Stefan R. Dziemanowicz, \"The Ramsey Campbell Interview\", ''Tekeli-li! Journal of Terror'' No 3 (Fall 1991), p. 19-20.</ref>\n[[File:Glaaki.jpg|thumb|right|An image of Gla'aki and one of its minions, derived from Campbell's story \"The Inhabitant of the Lake\".]]\n\nOn leaving school at age sixteen, Campbell went to work in the Inland Revenue as a tax officer (1962\u201366). Campbell sold various of his early stories to editors including [[August Derleth]] and [[Robert A.W. Lowndes]]. His concept of what was possible in the weird genre became highly imbued with the influence of Lovecraft for the next few years. In December 1961, Campbell completed the story \"The Church in High Street\" (previously titled \"The Tomb-Herd\") which he sent to [[August Derleth]] at [[Arkham House]], an imprint singlehandedly responsible for preserving the legacy of H P Lovecraft. Derleth accepted the story in February 1962 and it became Campbell's first professionally published tale, appearing in the Derleth-edited anthology ''[[Dark Mind, Dark Heart]]''. Campbell wrote various other tales of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] between 1961 and 1963. Derleth gave the young writer invaluable advice on improving his writing style (their correspondence has lately been published in a single volume from PS Publishing).\n\nForming his literary apprenticeship with stories modelled after Lovecraft's themes, Campbell's first collection, ''[[The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants]]'' (Arkham House, 1964), published when he was but eighteen years old, collects his Lovecraftian pastiches to that date. Campbell has written, \"In 1964 I was several kinds of lucky to find a publisher, and one kind depended on my having written a Lovecraftian book for Arkham House, the only publisher likely even to have considered it and one of the very few then to be publishing horror.\"<ref>Ramsey Campbell. ''Alone With the Horrors'' Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1993, p. ix</ref> The title story of the collection introduces Campbell's invention of a tome of occult lore similar to Lovecraft's forbidden [[Necronomicon]], ''The Revelations of Gla'aki'' (see [[Books of the Cthulhu Mythos]]).  At the suggestion of [[August Derleth]], he rewrote many of his earliest stories, which he had originally set in the [[Massachusetts]] locales of [[Arkham]], [[Dunwich]] and [[Innsmouth]], and moved them to English settings in and around the fictional [[Gloucestershire]] city of [[Severn Valley (Cthulhu Mythos)#Brichester|Brichester]], near the [[River Severn]], creating his own [[Severn Valley (Cthulhu Mythos)|Severn Valley]] milieu for Lovecraftian horrors.<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. \"Chasing the Unknown\", introduction to ''Cold Print'' (1993), pp.11-13. {{ISBN|0-8125-1660-5}}</ref> The invented locale of Brichester was deeply influenced by Campbell's native Liverpool, and much of his later work is set in the real locales of [[Liverpool]] and the [[Merseyside]] area. His later work continues the focus on Liverpool; in particular, his 2005 novel ''Secret Stories'' (published in the U.S. in an abridged edition<ref>Joshi, S. T., ''Classics and Contemporaries'', Hippocampus Press 2009, p.131.</ref> as ''Secret Story'' (2006)) both exemplifies and satirizes Liverpudlian speech, characters, humour and culture, while ''Creatures of the Pool'' draws on the city's geography and history.\n\nThe story \"Cold Print\" (1969) marked an end to Campbell's literary apprenticeship, taking the essence of Lovecraft out of the New England backwoods into a modern urban setting. Subsequently Campbell briefly disavowed Lovecraft, while working on the radically experimental tales which would be published as the collection ''Demons by Daylight''; but he later acknowledged Lovecraft's lasting influence, and his subsequent Cthulhu Mythos tales, collected in ''Cold Print'' (1985; expanded in 1993), confirm the transition from pastiche to homage, most notably in such tales as \"The Faces at Pine Dunes\" and the eerily surreal \"The Voice on the Beach\" (1982). Later work still seeks to \"ascend the cosmic peaks achieved by Lovecraft\", particularly the novel ''The Darkest Part of the Woods'' (2003), the novella ''The Last Revelation of Gla'aki'' (2013), and three novels that form his Brichester Mythos trilogy (2016-18). \n\n===The 1970s: \"Determined to be myself\": ''Demons by Daylight'' and early novels===\n\nWith his stories written between 1964 and 1968, beginning with ''The Reshaping of Rossiter'' (first draft of ''The Scar''), ''A Garden at Night'' (first draft of ''Made in Goatswood'') and ''The Successor'' (first draft of ''Cold Print''), Campbell set out to be as unlike Lovecraft as possible. Having discovered writers such as [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Robert Aickman]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Iris Murdoch]], [[William Burroughs]] and [[Henry Miller]], and such influences as the French 'new novel', he became interested in expanding the stylistic possibilities of his work. He finished the collection that would become ''Demons by Daylight'' in 1968, but it would not see print until 1973. Meanwhile, from 1969 to 1973, he continued to write short stories in which he gradually developed his own voice and themes and left the influence of Lovecraft far behind. Campbell worked in the Liverpool Public Libraries as a library assistant (1966\u201373) and was acting librarian in charge (1971\u201373).\n\nIn 1969, he had written ''Lovecraft in Retrospect'', a violent diatribe against Lovecraft, for the [[fanzine]] ''Shadow'',<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. ''Lovecraft in Retrospect'', ''Shadow'' 8 (1969).</ref> \"condemning [Lovecraft's] work outright.\"<ref>''Chasing the Unknown'', p.16.</ref>  However, in his 1985 book ''Cold Print'', which collects his Lovecraftian stories, Campbell disavowed the opinions expressed in the article, stating: \"I believe Lovecraft is one of the most important writers in the field\"<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. ''Lovecraft: An Introduction'', ''Cold Print'' (1993), p. 1.</ref> and \"the first book of Lovecraft's I read made me into a writer.\"<ref>''Chasing the Unknown'', p. 9.</ref>\n\nAround 1970, Campbell stopped using his first initial \"J.\" on his work, though a few stories earlier than this appeared as by \"Ramsey Campbell\", and a few after still saw print as by \"J. Ramsey Campbell\". Campbell later legally changed his name to remove the \"John\".\n\nAfter working four years in the tax office and seven years in public libraries, by 1973, Campbell became a fulltime writer, encouraged by the issuance by Arkham House of his second collection, ''[[Demons by Daylight]]'' (as by Ramsey Campbell). That collection had been due for publication in 1971, but was held back two years by the death of [[August Derleth]]. ''Demons by Daylight'' includes ''The Franklyn Paragraphs'', which uses Lovecraft's documentary narrative technique without slipping into parody of his writing style. Other tales, such as ''The End of a Summer's Day'' and ''Concussion'', show the emergence of Campbell's highly distinctive mature style, of which [[S. T. Joshi]] has written:\n<blockquote>\nCertainly much of the power of his work derives purely from his prose style, one of the most fluid, dense and evocative in all modern literature [...] His eye for the details and resonances of even the most mundane objects, and his ability to express them crisply and almost prose-poetically, give to his work at once a clarity and a dreamlike nebulousness that is difficult to describe but easy to sense.<ref>Joshi, S. T. ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001), p. 166.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe book's appearance induced [[T. E. D. Klein]] to write an extensive and highly positive review, ''Ramsey Campbell: An Appreciation'' in ''Nyctalops'' magazine and critic [[S. T. Joshi]] has stated<ref>Joshi, S. T. ''Ramsey Campbell and Modern Horror Fiction'' (2001), p.56</ref> that:\n<blockquote>its [...] allusiveness of narration; careful, at times even obsessive focusing on the fleeting sensations and psychological processes of characters; an aggressively modern setting that allows commentary on social, cultural and political issues''\u2014''all conjoin to make ''Demons by Daylight'' perhaps the most important book of horror fiction since [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraft]]'s ''[[The Outsider and Others]]''.</blockquote>\n\nCampbell has written that \"Having completed ''Demons by Daylight'' in 1968, I felt directionless, and it shows in quite a few of the subsequent tales.\"<ref name=\"Ramsey Campbell 2008\">\"\"Truth or Consequences\" in Ramsey Campbell, ''Inconsequential Tales'', NY: Hippocampus Press, 2008, 11.</ref> He wrote only four tales in 1970, and five stories in 1971.  He has written that \"retrospect demonstrates how untimely my decision [to write fulltime] was. Kirby McCauley, now my agent, had to tell me that the market for short horror stories was very limited... My solution was to lurch into science fiction as best I could. Little of it sold...\"<ref>\"\"Truth or Consequences\" in Ramsey Campbell, ''Inconsequential Tales'' NY: Hippocampus Press, 2008, 13.</ref> Many of the science fiction tales are collected in ''Inconsequential Tales'' (2008); he also wrote the novella ''Medusa'' (1973) and the short story \"Slow\" (collected in ''[[Told by the Dead]]''), but has stated that his science fiction \"tried to deal with Themes, too consciously, I feel\".<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. Introduction to ''Strange Things and Stranger Places'' (1993), quoted in S. T. Joshi, ''Ramsey Campbell and Modern Horror Fiction'' (2001), p.150.</ref>\n\nOutside the world of horror, he wrote a series of fantasy stories starring Ryre the Swordsman, who battles enemies on an alien world called Tond. Initially published in various anthologies, these stories were finally gathered in the collection ''Far Away & Never'' (Necronomicon Press, July 1996). In 1976 he 'completed' three of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s unfinished [[Solomon Kane]] stories, ''Hawk of Basti'', ''The Castle of the Devil'' and ''The Children of Asshur'' (published in 1978 and 1979). By the time Arkham House published his second hardcover collection of horror stories, ''[[The Height of the Scream]]'' (1976), he was beginning to be seen as one of the major modern writers of horror.\n\n1976 also saw the publication of Campbell's first novel, ''The Doll Who Ate His Mother'', which immediately drew acclaim from figures such as [[Fritz Leiber]] and [[T.E.D. Klein]]. In this and ''The Face that Must Die'' (1979), Campbell began to fully explore the enigma of evil, touching on the psychological themes of possession, madness and alienation which feature in many of his subsequent novels. He also continued to write short stories, mainly supernatural, receiving the [[World Fantasy Award]] for \"The Chimney\" (1977) and \"Mackintosh Willy\" (1980).\n\nCampbell has been a lifelong enthusiast of [[film]]; early stories such as ''The Reshaping of Rossiter'' (1964; an early version of ''The Scar'') show the influence of directors such as [[Alain Resnais]], and as early as 1969 Campbell had become the film reviewer for [[BBC Radio Merseyside]].<ref name=\"Ramsey Campbell 2008\"/> He worked in Merseyside on the Friday edition of \"Breakfast\" and less frequently on Claire Hamilton's Sunday show. A longer version of his Merseyside reviews appeared on the Radio Merseyside website, where he also reviewed DVDs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/films/ramsey/ramsey_reviews.shtml|title=BBC - Liverpool - Films - BBC Radio Merseyside - Ramsey reviews|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> His love of old movies features prominently in two of Campbell's later novels, ''Ancient Images'' and ''The Grin of the Dark''.\n\nCampbell wrote [[Novelization|novelisations]] and introductions for a series of novelisations of [[Universal Monsters|Universal horror]] films. The series has a rather complex publishing history. They were published in paperback in 1977 in the US, with uniform packaging, by Berkley Medallion Books as ''The Universal Horror Library''. All six of the Berkley editions were published under the [[pen name|house name]] 'Carl Dreadstone'; all six of the US editions featured stills from the relevant films. It is believed this set was made available as boxed set in slipcase, as well as sold individually. Only three of the novels were actually written by Campbell, though he contributed introductions to all six volumes. No US hardcover edition of the series is known. Campbell's contributions to the series were ''Bride of Frankenstein'', ''Dracula's Daughter'' and ''The Wolfman'', published as Carl Dreadstone. Three further novelisations which appeared under this house name were not by Campbell but written by other authors.<ref>Joshi, S. T., ''Ramsey Campbell and Modern Horror Fiction'' (2001), p.145-147.</ref>  [[Walter Harris (author)|Walter Harris]] wrote two of the novels: ''Werewolf of London'' and ''Creature from the Black Lagoon''. The author of the sixth Dreadstone (''The Mummy'') remains unknown.<ref>Ian Covell [https://terrortakeaways.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/ian-covell-on-carl-dreadstone/#comment-1567 \"Ian Covell on \u2018Carl Dreadstone\u2019\"], ''Souvenirs Of Terror fiendish film & TV show tie-ins'', 3 October 2007, accessed 11 July 2011.</ref> UK editions followed\u2014in 1978, Universal Books (a paperback division of [[Virgin Books|W. H. Allen Ltd]]) published ''The Bride of Frankenstein'' (by Campbell) together with Harris's ''The Werewolf of London'' and the (unknown author) ''The Mummy'' under the 'Carl Dreadstone' house name, with similar packaging under the title 'The Classic Library of Horror'. A further two years would elapse before the rest of the series was issued in the UK. The last three of the series were issued by Star Books (a W. H. Allen imprint) in 1980 (with different packaging from the 1978 titles) and these three appeared under a different house-name\u2014'E. K. Leyton'. These were Campbell's remaining two novels of the series, ''Dracula's Daughter'' and ''The Wolfman'', together with Harris's ''Creature from the Black Lagoon''. At least one hardcover omnibus was published, presumably prior to the UK paperbacks: ''The Classic Library of Horror Omnibus\u2014The Mummy & The Werewolf of London'' (London: Allan Wingate, 1978). Its existence suggests there may have been two companion hardcover omnibuses collecting the balance of the series (if this were the case they would contain the Campbell-authored novels), but their existence/issuance is uncertain. All six of the UK paperbacks and the hardcover omnibus omitted the film stills which appeared in the original US editions.<ref>Private collection of [[Leigh Blackmore]]</ref>\n\n1979 saw the publication of the non-supernatural thriller ''The Face That Must Die'', the story of a [[homophobic]] [[serial killer]] told largely from the killer's point of view. Initially considered by numerous publishers, including Campbell's British publisher [[Thomas Tessier]] at Millington Books, as too grim to publish, it is regarded by many critics as one of Campbell's finest works. The novel was cut by Star Books, who first issued it in a paperback edition in 1979; it was not issued complete until the US Scream Press edition of 1983.\n\n===The 1980s: ''The Parasite'' to ''Ancient Images''===\n\nCampbell became even more prolific during the 1980s, issuing no less than eight novels (of which six won major awards) and three short story collections. He has written that after moving away from Lovecraft's influence he was \"determined to sound like myself\" but also that \"The Chicago and San Francisco tales of [[Fritz Leiber]] were now my models in various ways. I wanted to achieve that sense of supernatural terror which derives from the everyday urban landscape rather than invading it, and I greatly admired\u2014still do\u2014how Fritz wrote thoroughly contemporary weird tales which were nevertheless rooted in the best traditions of the field, and which drew some of their strength from uniting British and American influences.\"<ref>Ramsey Campbell, ''Alone With the Horrors'' Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1993, p. x</ref>\n\nIn 1981, [[Stephen King]] published a semi-autobiographical overview of the horror field, ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]].'' In a chapter focusing on 20th century practitioners, King devoted a whole section to Campbell's fiction, alongside that of [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Shirley Jackson]], [[Peter Straub]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[Jack Finney]] and others. On the basis of Campbell's earliest work, especially ''The Doll Who Ate His Mother'', King argued that the author's strength lies in his hallucinogenic prose and edgy psychology, the way his characters view the world and how this affects readers:\n\n<blockquote>In a Campbell novel or story, one seems to view the world through the thin and shifting perceptual haze of an LSD trip that is just ending ... or just beginning. The polish of his writing and his mannered turns of phrase and image make him seem something like the genre's Joyce Carol Oates [...] as when journeying on LSD, there is something chilly and faintly schizophrenic in the way his characters see things ... and in the things they see [...] Good stuff. But strange; so uniquely Campbell that it might as well be trademarked.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Danse Macabre|last=King|first=Stephen|publisher=Futura|year=1981|isbn=978-0708821817|location=London|pages=396\u20137}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKing also singled out one of Campbell's early short stories for particular praise: \"{{-'}}The Companion' may be the best horror tale to be written in the English language in thirty years; it is surely one of the half a dozen or so which will still be in print and commonly read a hundred years from now.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Danse Macabre|last=King|first=Stephen|publisher=Futura|year=1981|isbn=978-0708821817|location=London|page=398}}</ref> This story appeared in Campbell's 1982 collection, ''Dark Companions'', alongside other tales from that period commonly cited as classics: \"The Chimney\", \"Mackintosh Willy\", and \"Call First\".\n\n''The Parasite'' (1980; published in the US with a different ending as ''To Wake the Dead'') is an intense novel told from the point of view of a female protagonist who becomes embroiled in occult practices (with Lovecraftian undertones). In ''The Nameless'' (1981), also told from the point of view of a woman, a child goes missing and returns only years later, affiliated to a nefarious organisation. ''Obsession'' (1982) involves a group of childhood friends make a wish apiece concerning their futures, the manifestations tormenting them in later life; however, as is common in Campbell's work involving aberrant mental states, it is not entirely apparent that these events have a supernatural origin. In ''Incarnate'' (1983), the boundaries between dream and reality are gradually broken down (the novel was written during the \"terrible nightmare year\" of Campbell's mother's last mental breakdown) as a group of characters involved in a psychological experiment begin to experience fragmentation in their everyday lives. \n\nIn ''The Claw'' (1983; originally published under the pseudonym Jay Ramsey) and ''The Hungry Moon'' (1986), Campbell writes in a more commercially minded way than in earlier novels. The latter is a multi-character 'small town' horror story along the lines of similar work in this period, a subgenre perhaps 'pump-primed' by the likes of Stephen King's '''Salem's Lot''. In characteristically honest and self-critical afterwords,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Claw|last=Campbell|first=Ramsey|publisher=Warner Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0708852583|location=London|pages=369\u2013380}}</ref> Campbell has claimed that ''The Hungry Moon,'' along with the similarly commercially minded ''The Parasite'' and, to a lesser degree, ''The Claw'', are among of his least successful of his works, by turns awkwardly structured, containing too many ideas, and/or tending towards explicit violence. By contrast, ''The Influence'' (1988) and ''Ancient Images'' (1989) are tightly plotted novels of supernatural menace, each with (predominantly) female central characters and generating unease through the author's trademark suggestiveness and surreal imagery. In 1987, Campbell published ''Scared Stiff'', a collection of \"sex and horror\" short stories.      \n\nIn the early 1980s Campbell had crossed paths a number of time in Liverpool at cinemas and various parties with a young Liverpool writer named [[Clive Barker]], who had been working around London as a playwright. Barker asked Campbell if he knew any markets for short stories and eventually asked him to look over a soon-to-be-published manuscript and the contract he had been offered for it. Campbell says \"My jaw dropped when I looked at the manuscript\u2014it turned out to be the ''[[Books of Blood]]''.\" Campbell wrote the introduction to the first edition. \n\nCampbell contributed numerous articles on horror cinema to ''[[The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural]]'' (1986). \n\n===The 1990s: ''Midnight Sun'' to ''The Last Voice They Hear''===\n\nThe 1990s again saw Campbell publish eight novels, though in the second half of this decade he moved away from traditional horror to explore crime and tales of social alienation. Four of this decade's novels won major awards for Best Novel. \n\nIn ''Midnight Sun'' (1990), an alien entity apparently seeks entry to the world through the mind of a children's writer. In its fusion of horror with awe, ''Midnight Sun'' shows the influence of [[Algernon Blackwood]] and [[Arthur Machen]] as well as Lovecraft. Although the author considers this novel \"an honourable failure\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Klaehn|first=Jeffrey|date=Spring 2016|title=Reaching for the awesome and numinous: an interview with horror author Ramsey Campbell|journal=New Writing: The International Journal for the Practice and Theory of Creative Writing|volume=13|issue=2|pages=308\u2013314|doi=10.1080/14790726.2016.1167921}}</ref> it is one that many enthusiasts single out as a highlight of this stage of his career. ''Needing Ghosts'' (1990), a novella, is a nightmarish work that blends the horrific and the comic; Campbell himself has described the composition of this piece as unique among his work in that it \"felt like dreaming on the page\" and was written relatively quickly without technical or structural challenges. \n\nA sympathetic serial murderer appears in the black comedy ''The Count of Eleven'' (1991), which displays Campbell's gift for [[word play]], and which the author has said is disturbing \"because it doesn't stop being funny when you think it should\".<ref>Campbell, Ramsey, interviewed in ''The Count of Thirty'' (1994).</ref> A review at the time suggested that the central character might be played in a film by Stan Laurel, an observation that delighted Campbell, who is a great admirer of Laurel and Hardy. Other novels of this decade include ''The Long Lost'' (1993), in which a [[sin-eater]] is discovered by a couple holidaying in Wales and brought home ostensibly as an relative, with considerable impact on a community. A haunted house novel called ''The House on Nazareth Hill'' (1996), combining the author's M R Jamesian suggestiveness with an increasingly idiosyncratic prose style, is a harrowing study of familial psychology and the unchanging nature of social processes, particularly those relating to the young's quest for independence and the threat this presents to others. Enthusiasts consider it one of Campbell's more powerful works. \n\nCampbell had earlier published a non-supernatural novel called ''The One Safe Place'' (1995), which uses a highly charged [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] narrative to examine social problems such as the deprivation and abuse of children, and in 1998 he turned away for a more sustained period from the supernatural work with which he was associated. By this time, horror had become commercially less successful and publishers were taking fewer chances on publishing such material, encouraging Campbell to write a number of crimes novels. The first, ''The Last Voice They Hear'' (1998), is a tightly plotted thriller which ranges back and forth in time as two brothers become engaged in a cat-and-mouse game redolent of earlier events in their lives. Although written \"under protest\", Campbell came to think of the book, during composition, as bearing his own stamp, and his next two novels were also non-supernatural. \n\nIn this decade Campbell issued no less than four short story collections, including, in 1993, the 30-year career retrospective ''[[Alone with the Horrors: The Great Short Fiction of Ramsey Campbell 1961\u20131991|Alone with the Horrors: The Great Short Fiction of Ramsey Campbell 1961-1991]]'', published by Campbell's original publisher, [[Arkham House]]. This volume, illustrated by Jeff K. Potter, is not a comprehensive collection of all the stories Campbell had published in those thirty years, but 39 tales which Campbell and his editor Jim Turner thought representative. Drawing on material across his whole career to that date, it is commonly considered to be a good entry point for readers hitherto unfamiliar with the author's work. ''[[Waking Nightmares]]'' (1991), ''[[Strange Things and Stranger Places]]'' (1993), and ''[[Ghosts and Grisly Things]]'' (1998) collect much of Campbell's short fiction from this period. Two of this decade's short story collections won major awards for best collection. \n\nIn 1999, Campbell was awarded both the Grand Master Award from the World Horror Convention and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Horror Writers Association. \n\n===The 2000s: ''Silent Children'' to ''Creatures of the Pool''===\nIn the \"noughties\", Campbell continued his prolific output, publishing an average of a novel a year, along with three short story collections. He reviewed films and DVDs weekly for [[BBC Radio Merseyside]] until 2007. He began to contribute a monthly film column, \"Ramsey's Ramblings\", for ''[[Video Watchdog]]'' magazine. In 2002, PS Publishing issued a collection of Campbell's essays on horror and other areas of interest: ''Ramsey Campbell, Probably'' (this volume was expanded to include further material in a 2014 reprint). The collection includes  book reviews, film reviews, autobiographical writings and other nonfiction, along with reminiscences and appreciations of authors such as [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], [[Bob Shaw]] and [[K. W. Jeter]], and an extensive, negative critique of [[Shaun Hutson]]'s ''Heathen'', [[parody]]ing Hutson's style.\n\nFollowing the publication of two more crime novels\u2014''Silent Children'' (2000), the story of an eccentric child killer; and ''Pact of the Fathers'' (2001), which draws on arcane religious practices\u2014Campbell determined to return to the supernatural and otherworldly. ''The Darkest Part of the Woods'' (2003) successfully evokes the cosmic terrors of H P Lovecraft and was the first of Campbell's work published by [[PS Publishing]]; the author would go on to enjoy a long-term relationship with the UK imprint, granting first print rights to most new work. Having spent a number of months working full-time in a [[Borders Group|Borders]] store, Campbell wrote ''The Overnight'' (2004), about [[bookshop]] staff trapped in their hellish workplace during an overnight shelf-filling shift. In ''Secret Stories'' (2005; abridged US edition, ''Secret Story'', 2006) Campbell returned voluntarily to the crime genre, offering a blackly comic study of a latter-day serial killer whose written accounts of his crimes inadvertently win a fiction competition, resulting in further murders.  \n\n''The Grin of the Dark'' (2007)\u2014considered by many to be Campbell's masterpiece, a showcase of his stylistic method and powerfully focused on contemporaneous issues arising from wide-scale Internet use\u2014draws on the author's interest in the history of cinema, as a character hunts material relating to a silent film comedian by the name of Tubby Thackeray. The author himself, often critical of his own output, continues to cite this novel as one with which he remains pleased. ''Thieving Fear'' (2008) and ''The Creatures of the Pool'' (2009) use locations, in and around the author's native Liverpool, to eerie effect.  \n\n''[[Told by the Dead]]'' (2003) and ''[[Just Behind You]]'' (2009) collected Campbell's more recent short fiction, while ''[[Inconsequential Tales]]'' (2008), collecting a number of unpublished stories, documents his early evolution as a stylist.    \n\nIn 2007, Campbell was awarded the Living Legend Award from the International Horror Guild.\n\n=== The 2010: ''The Seven Days of Cain'' to the \"Brichester Mythos Trilogy\" ===\nAfter 2010, Campbell continued to have published at least a book a year, including a collection of letters from his early career between himself and his first mentor August Derleth (''Letters to Arkham: The Letters of Ramsey Campbell and August Derleth, 1961-1971'', ed. S. T. Joshi, 2014) . \n\nBoth ''The Seven Days of Cain'' (2010) and ''Think Yourself Lucky'' (2014) explore the use of the internet, as characters appearing online start to impact upon the lived world with disconcerting effects. In 2010, Campbell was commissioned to write the novelisation of the movie ''[[Solomon Kane (film)|Solomon Kane]],'' which was based on the swords and sorcery stories of Robert E. Howard (some of which Campbell had completed in his early career)''.'' ''Ghosts Know'' (2011), one of the author's few latter-day non-supernatural excursions (on the surface, at least), explores the mendacity of stage mediums/psychics in the context of a missing person story; it also showcases a later development in the Campbell's work, social comedy and confusions inherent in everyday communication. ''The Kind Folk'' (2012) is a delicately written evocation of fairy folk, told in the modern day.  \n\nIn 2013, ''[[Holes for Faces]]'', a further collection of short fiction appeared, gathering together his work from the 2000s. During the same period, PS Publishing issued two novellas by Campbell: ''The Last Revelation of Gla'aki'' (2013) and ''The Pretence'' (2013); a third novella appeared in 2016 entitled ''The Booking,'' from Dark Regions Press. These were the first novellas Campbell had written since 1990's ''Needing Ghosts''. 2015 saw the release of ''Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach'', one of Campbell's few novels set outside the UK; a family holiday on a Greek island involves communion with a familiar supernatural character from literature. Campbell's collection of playful limericks based on famous horror works of fiction appeared in 2016: ''Limericks of the Alarming and Phantasmal.'' \n\n''The Searching Dead'' (2016) was the first novel in a trilogy of H P Lovecraft-influenced works which, like the novella ''The Last Revelation of Gla'aki,'' revisits themes from Campbell's early work in that subgenre. Described by the author as his \"Brichester Mythos trilogy,\" the three-book series, including ''Born to the Dark'' (2017) and ''The Way of the Worm'' (2018), documents a character's engagement with a nefarious organisation over three time periods (1950s, 1980s, 2010s) and evokes a cosmic entity by the name of Daoloth. The trilogy draws together multiple themes that have preoccupied the author during his whole career: the cosmic, family, scapegoating, the vulnerability of children, and the seductiveness of totalising belief systems. \n\nA new short story collection, ''By the Light of my Skull,'' was also released in 2018, gathering together some of Campbell's more recent works, some of which\u2014as has been the case in his later fiction\u2014deal with older age. ''Visions from Brichester'' (2017) collected all of the author's Lovecraftian short fiction not originally published in ''The Inhabitant of the Lake''. PS Publishing will issue a two-volume retrospective focused on Campbell's most representative short fiction across his entire career, the first of which is ''The Companion & Other Phantasmagorical Stories'' (2019).  \n\nIn 2015, Campbell received the World Fantasy Award's Life Award, and in 2017, in Spain, he was awarded the Premio Sheridan Le Fanu for his career achievements. In 2015, the author received an Honorary Fellowship from John Moores University, Liverpool, for \"outstanding services to literature\". \n\n=== The 2020s: ''The Wise Friend'' to present ===\nCampbell's next novel, ''The Wise Friend'', is due to be published in spring 2020, by new publisher Flame Tree Press (which has also reissued earlier Campbell novels in hardcover, paperback and audiobook). A new novella, ''The Enigma of the Flat Policeman,'' part of Borderlands Press's Little Book series (in this case, ''A Little Green Book of Grins & Gravity'') was released in March, 2020. The second volume of his career retrospective, ''The Retrospective & Other Phantasmagorical Stories,'' will be published later in 2020. He has recently completed a new novel called ''Somebody's Voice'' (publication forthcoming) and is currently working on his next, ''Fellstones''. \n\n=== Style and themes ===\nCampbell's style is characterised by an idiosyncratic use of language. His fictional worlds feel unusual, threatening, and dislocated. Such an approach has prompted [[Peter Straub]] to write: \"Horrors in his fiction are never merely invented, they are felt and experienced, and affect the reader for days afterward.\"{{cn|date=October 2019}} The horrors Campbell evokes are commonly suggested to the reader by ambiguous allusions to events his characters are not always mindful of. In this regard, his approach is similar to that of [[M. R. James]]. Indeed, Campbell celebrates James's concentrated prose, choice of detail, and ability to hint at disquieting material much larger than what is explicitly revealed. Campbell has described much of his own later work as \"comedies of paranoia\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/why-i-write/article/48631-why-i-write-ramsey-campbell.html|title=Why I Write...Ramsey Campbell|last=Campbell|first=Ramsey|date=9 September 2011|website=Publishers Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>, as his characters experience an existential bewilderment that borders on the absurd.  \n\nCampbell himself has cited the following themes as recurrent in his work: \"the vulnerability of children, the willingness of people to espouse a belief system that denies them the right to question, and the growing tendency to create scapegoats for the ills of the world.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lounge-books.com/award-winners-we-lov/ramsey-campbell-horror-author-interview|title=Meet Ramsey Campbell, 'Britain's Most Respected Living Horror Writer'|last=Walker|first=Luke|date=|website=Lounge Books|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref> However, his work has addressed a wide range of issues, including censorship (e.g., ''The One Safe Place'', 1995), the impact of the internet on modern consciousness (e.g., ''The Grin of the Dark'', 2007; ''The Seven Days of Cain'', 2010; ''Think Yourself Lucky'', 2014), corporation-led consumerism (the recurrence of a global organisation called Frugo in his later work, especially ''The Overnight'', 2004, and ''Thieving Fear'', 2008), fatherhood (''The House on Nazareth Hill'', 1996), and older age (''Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach'', 2015). Abnormal human psychology is also a major recurring theme in Campbell's work (e.g., ''The Face That Must Die'', 1979; ''The Count of Eleven'', 1991; ''The Last Voice They Hear'', 1998; ''Secret Stories'', 2005).\n\n===Tributes===\n\nFour tribute anthologies of stories inspired by Campbell's work have been released to date. The first was the 1995 anthology ''Made in Goatswood'' (Chaosium, edited by Scott David Aniolowski), which includes a story by Campbell himself. More recently, ''The Children of Gla'aki'' (2016, Dark Regions Press, edited by Brian M. Sammons and Glynn Owen Barrass) consists of stories focused on one of Campbell's Lovecraftian creations, and ''Darker Companions'' (2017, PS Publishing, edited by Joe Pulver and Scott David Aniolowski) contains tales inspired by the author's vision and prose. In Spain, a further tribute anthology recently appeared entitled ''El Horror Que Vino del Sur: Un Tributo Latino a Ramsey Campbell Y Al Circulo de Lovecraft'' (2018, Bookbaby). All four books demonstrate Campbell's influence in the field on both established and newer writers. \n\nIn 2012, Campbell's centrality in the field attracted a spoof collection of horror stories edited by fellow writer [[Rhys Hughes]]. Hughes contributed a good deal of the fictional content, including the pieces focused on an author called Lamblake Heinz, clearly a parody of Campbell (although Hughes has admitted elsewhere that he has read little if any of Campbell's work).\n\n===Films===\n\nThree of Campbell's novels have been filmed to date, all in Spain. [[Jaume Balaguer\u00f3]]'s ''[[The Nameless (film)|The Nameless]]'' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Los Sin Nombre''; in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Els sense nom''), based on the novel of the same name, takes some liberties with the source material's plot but captures its pungent atmosphere. [[Paco Plaza]]'s ''[[Second Name]]'' (''El Segundo Nombre'' in Spanish) based on the novel ''The Pact of the Fathers'', similarly evokes Campbell's paranoiac fictional world, its story rooted in the world of arcane religious practices. Denis Rovira van Boekholt's ''The Influence'' (''La Influencia'' in Spanish), based on the Campbell novel of the same name and quite faithful (except for changes in the final third), was released in 2019 and was later picked up by [[Netflix]] to stream. \n\n===Books edited===\n\nCampbell has edited a number of [[anthologies]], including ''[[New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos]]'' (1980); ''New Terrors'' and ''New Terrors II'', a groundbreaking two-volume anthology series; and (with [[Stephen Jones (author)|Stephen Jones]]) the first five volumes of the annual ''Best New Horror'' series (1990\u20131994). His 1992 anthology ''[[Uncanny Banquet]]'' was notable for including the first ever reprint of the obscure 1914 horror novel ''The Hole of the Pit'' by [[Adrian Ross]]. ''The Gruesome Book'' was a paperback anthology of horror tales for children. Campbell is extremely well-read in the horror field, and some of his own literary influences are demonstrated by his selections for the 1988 anthology ''Fine Frights: Stories That Scared Me''. In 2002 he edited a collection of fiction in the tradition of M. R. James, entitled ''Meddling with Ghosts''. His 2003 anthology ''Gathering the Bones'' (co-edited with Dennis Etchison and Jack Dann) draws together tales from the UK, US, and Australia. ''The Folio Book of Horror Stories'' (2018), the first collection Campbell had edited in 15 years, draws together classic tales from the last 200 years.\n\n===Personal life===\n\nCampbell married Jenny Chandler (a teacher), daughter of [[A. Bertram Chandler]], on 1 January 1971; has two children, Tamsin (born 1978) and Matthew (born 1981); and still lives in Merseyside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/clive-barker-returns-heres-eight-9289121|title=As Clive Barker returns here's eight other Merseyside sci fi, fantasy and horror writers who have thrilled readers worldwide|first=Jamie|last=Bowman|date=19 May 2015|website=liverpoolecho}}</ref> He commonly describes his wife as the \"best part\" of himself. At various stages of his career\u2014for instance, when he first decided to write on a full-time basis\u2014Campbell received support from Jenny, who worked as a teacher. Campbell is fond of fine dining, travel, and classical music. He is very active as a public speaker and greatly enjoys giving readings of his fiction at literary events. Campbell is eloquent and jolly (a persona he self-effacingly describes as a \"facade\"), and he has claimed that if he hadn't become a horror writer, he might have been a stand-up comedian.  \n\nIn response to an interview question about religion, Campbell has stated, \"As I got older I\u2019m more [[agnosticism|Agnostic]] [...] [a] little religious perspective is no bad thing; I have no set belief.\" He added, \"I don\u2019t think there is any supernatural force out there to make you do stuff.\" <ref>Neil Buchanan, [http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/interviews/1245-an-interview-with-ramsey-campbell \"An Interview With Ramsey Campbell\".] ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'', June 2013. Retrieved 29 September 2016.</ref> When asked whether he believes in the supernatural he claims to have experienced episodes that might be described as involving such activity; however, he remains noncommittal on this issue, stating that he writes about such material because he finds it \"imaginatively appealing\" and to \"repay\" the genre for many treasured reading experiences. Campbell is fiercely opposed to censorship, claiming that the suppression of contentious material leads to it returning in an even worse form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/writing/ramseys-rant-censorship/|title=Ramsey's Rant: Censorship|last=Campbell|first=Ramsey|date=March 2009|website=British Fantasy Society}}</ref> He has been very generous in support of newer writers, frequently writing introductions to their work.   \n\nFor many years Campbell was the President of the [[British Fantasy Society]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Novels ===\n\n*''[[The Doll Who Ate His Mother]]'' (1976; revised text, 1985)\n*''The Face That Must Die'' (expurgated version 1979; restored text: 1983)\n*''The Parasite'' (1980; published in the US with a different ending as ''To Wake the Dead'')\n*''The Nameless'' (1981; filmed in 1999 as ''[[The Nameless (film)|The Nameless]]'')\n*''The Claw'' (1983; also known as ''Night of the Claw'', ''Claw''; written as Jay Ramsay)\n*''Incarnate'' (1983)\n*''Obsession'' (1985; written under the working title ''For the Rest of Their Lives'')\n*''The Hungry Moon'' (1986; written under the working title ''Blind Dark'')\n*''The Influence'' (1988; filmed in 2019 as ''La Influencia'')\n*''Ancient Images'' (1989)\n*''Midnight Sun'' (1990)\n*''The Count of Eleven'' (1991)\n*''The Long Lost'' (1993)\n*''The One Safe Place'' (1995)\n*''The House on Nazareth Hill'' (1996; also known as ''Nazareth Hill'')\n*''The Last Voice They Hear'' (1998)\n*''Silent Children'' (2000)\n*''Pact of the Fathers'' (2001; filmed in 2002 as ''[[Second Name (film)|Second Name]]'')\n*''The Darkest Part of the Woods'' (2003)\n*''The Overnight'' (2004)\n*''Secret Stories'' (2005; abridged US edition, ''Secret Story'', 2006)\n*''The Grin of the Dark'' (2007)\n*''Thieving Fear'' (2008)\n*''Creatures of the Pool'' (2009)\n*''The Seven Days of Cain'' (2010)\n*''Ghosts Know'' (2011)\n*''The Kind Folk'' (2012)\n*''Think Yourself Lucky'' (2014)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pspublishing.co.uk/index.asp?function=ERROR404&type=PRODUCT|title=UK genre publisher of SF, Horror & Fantasy fiction.|website=www.pspublishing.co.uk}}</ref>\n*''Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach'' (2015)\n*''The Searching Dead'' (2016)\n*''Born to the Dark'' (2017)\n*''The Way of the Worm'' (2018)\n*''The Wise Friend'' (2020)\n*''Somebody's Voice'' (announced)\n\n=== Novelisations ===\n\n*''The Bride of Frankenstein'' (1977; of the [[Bride of Frankenstein|1935 film]], written as Carl Dreadstone)\n*''Dracula's Daughter'' (1977; of the [[Dracula's Daughter|1936 film]], written as Carl Dreadstone)\n*''The Wolf Man'' (1977; of the [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|1941 film]], written as Carl Dreadstone)\n*''Solomon Kane'' (2010; of the 2009 film)\n\n=== Novellas ===\n\n*''Medusa'' (1973; published standalone; later collected in ''Strange Things and Stranger Places'')\n*''Needing Ghosts'' (1990; published standalone; later collected in ''Strange Things and Stranger Places'')\n*''The Last Revelation of Gla'aki'' (2013)\n*''The Pretence'' (2013)\n*''The Booking'' (2016)\n*''The Enigma of the Flat Policeman (A Little Green Book of Grins & Gravity)'' (2020)\n\n===Collections===\n\n*''[[The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants]]'' (1964, as J.

He was educated by [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] at [[St. Edward's College|St Edward's College]], Liverpool. Campbell's childhood and adolescence were marked by the rift between his parents, who became estranged shortly after his birth. Campbell's father became a shadowy presence more often heard than seen.<ref>S.T. Joshi, \"[John] Ramsey Campbell\" in Joshi and Stefan Dziemianowicz (eds). ''Supernatural Literature of the World'', Westport CT: Greenwood Press, 2005, p. 203</ref> Campbell states, \"I didn't see my father face to face for nearly twenty years, and that was when he was dying.\" Years later, Campbell's mother degenerated into paranoia and [[schizophrenia]], rendering his own life a living hell\u2014an experience he has discussed in detail in the introduction and afterword to the restored text of ''The Face That Must Die''.<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. \"At the Back of My Mind: A Guided Tour\", introduction to ''The Face That Must Die'' (1990), pp.vii-xxv, and Afterword (pp.236-238). {{ISBN|0-7088-4394-8}}</ref> Other autobiographical pieces regarding Campbell's life are available in Section V, \"On Ramsey Campbell\" in his essay collection ''Ramsey Campbell, Probably: 30 Years of Essays and Articles'' (ed.

Campbell intended to submit to ''Phantom'', but his mother, who regarded literary success as a possible way of financing her escape from her disastrous marriage, persuaded him to wait until he had a whole book to show to publishers. His English teacher, Brother Kelly, used to have him read his stories to the class. Campbell (as John R. Campbell) submitted ''Ghostly Tales'' to \"numerous publishers\" <ref name=\"catalystmedia.org.uk\"/> including Tom Boardman publisher; Boardman rejected it as they did not publish ghost stories, but his rejection letter included encouragement to Campbell to keep writing.<ref>Ramsey Campbell, \"It Came from the Past\", ''Ghostly Tales: Crypt of Cthulhu'' 6, No 8, whole number 50, Michaelmas 1987, edited by [[Robert M. Price]]), p. 3</ref> This collection of [[juvenilia]] was published thirty years later, as a special issue of ''[[Crypt of Cthulhu]]'' magazine titled ''Ghostly Tales: Crypt of Cthulhu'' 6, No 8, whole number 50, Michaelmas 1987, edited by [[Robert M. Price]]. It is of interest that, though the stories are mostly mainstream spectral lore, one story (\"The Hollow in the Woods\") can be considered a very early mythos yarn.\n\nAnother issue of this magazine ''Crypt of Cthulhu'' No 43 (Hallowmas 1983), titled ''The Tomb-Herd and Others'' collects various early stories, including some early drafts of tales later published revised in Campbell's first book, ''The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants'' ([[Arkham House]], 1964)). The manuscripts of Campbell's early tales are housed at the Local History Library of the Liverpool Public Libraries.\n\n===The influence of H. P. Lovecraft and ''The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants''===\n\nCampbell first encountered [[H. P. Lovecraft]] at age eight (1954), via the story \"[[The Colour Out of Space]]\", which he found in the [[Groff Conklin]] anthology ''Strange Travels in Science Fiction'', and within the next few years read \"[[The Rats in the Walls]]\" and \"[[The Dunwich Horror]]\", encountered in the Wise and Fraser anthology ''Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural''. At the age of twelve, Campbell attempted to write a novel titled ''Broken Moon'', influenced by [[Arthur Machen]], but it petered out after fifty pages.<ref>Stefan R. Dziemanowicz. \"An Interview with Ramsey Campbell\" in S.T. Joshi, ed. ''The Count of Thirty: A Tribute to Ramsey Campbell'', West Warwick, RI: [[Necronomicon Press]], 1993, p. 15</ref> By the age of 14, he discovered Lovecraft's ''Cry Horror!'', a British edition of the collection entitled ''The Lurking Fear'', and read it in one day, finding the fiction's sense of awesomeness as well as horror extraordinarily appealing. He had also read [[Arthur Machen]]'s major horror stories by this age, and some works by [[John Dickson Carr]], which led him to write a 100-page Carr pastiche (unfinished) titled ''Murder By Moonlight''.<ref>Stefan R. Dziemanowicz, \"The Ramsey Campbell Interview\", ''Tekeli-li! Journal of Terror'' No 3 (Fall 1991), p. 19-20.</ref>\n[[File:Glaaki.jpg|thumb|right|An image of Gla'aki and one of its minions, derived from Campbell's story \"The Inhabitant of the Lake\".]]\n\nOn leaving school at age sixteen, Campbell went to work in the Inland Revenue as a tax officer (1962\u201366). Campbell sold various of his early stories to editors including [[August Derleth]] and [[Robert A.W. Lowndes]]. His concept of what was possible in the weird genre became highly imbued with the influence of Lovecraft for the next few years. In December 1961, Campbell completed the story \"The Church in High Street\" (previously titled \"The Tomb-Herd\") which he sent to [[August Derleth]] at [[Arkham House]], an imprint singlehandedly responsible for preserving the legacy of H P Lovecraft. Derleth accepted the story in February 1962 and it became Campbell's first professionally published tale, appearing in the Derleth-edited anthology ''[[Dark Mind, Dark Heart]]''. Campbell wrote various other tales of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] between 1961 and 1963. Derleth gave the young writer invaluable advice on improving his writing style (their correspondence has lately been published in a single volume from PS Publishing).\n\nForming his literary apprenticeship with stories modelled after Lovecraft's themes, Campbell's first collection, ''[[The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants]]'' (Arkham House, 1964), published when he was but eighteen years old, collects his Lovecraftian pastiches to that date. Campbell has written, \"In 1964 I was several kinds of lucky to find a publisher, and one kind depended on my having written a Lovecraftian book for Arkham House, the only publisher likely even to have considered it and one of the very few then to be publishing horror.\"<ref>Ramsey Campbell. ''Alone With the Horrors'' Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1993, p. ix</ref> The title story of the collection introduces Campbell's invention of a tome of occult lore similar to Lovecraft's forbidden [[Necronomicon]], ''The Revelations of Gla'aki'' (see [[Books of the Cthulhu Mythos]]).  At the suggestion of [[August Derleth]], he rewrote many of his earliest stories, which he had originally set in the [[Massachusetts]] locales of [[Arkham]], [[Dunwich]] and [[Innsmouth]], and moved them to English settings in and around the fictional [[Gloucestershire]] city of [[Severn Valley (Cthulhu Mythos)#Brichester|Brichester]], near the [[River Severn]], creating his own [[Severn Valley (Cthulhu Mythos)|Severn Valley]] milieu for Lovecraftian horrors.<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. \"Chasing the Unknown\", introduction to ''Cold Print'' (1993), pp.11-13. {{ISBN|0-8125-1660-5}}</ref> The invented locale of Brichester was deeply influenced by Campbell's native Liverpool, and much of his later work is set in the real locales of [[Liverpool]] and the [[Merseyside]] area. His later work continues the focus on Liverpool; in particular, his 2005 novel ''Secret Stories'' (published in the U.S. in an abridged edition<ref>Joshi, S. T., ''Classics and Contemporaries'', Hippocampus Press 2009, p.131.</ref> as ''Secret Story'' (2006)) both exemplifies and satirizes Liverpudlian speech, characters, humour and culture, while ''Creatures of the Pool'' draws on the city's geography and history.\n\nThe story \"Cold Print\" (1969) marked an end to Campbell's literary apprenticeship, taking the essence of Lovecraft out of the New England backwoods into a modern urban setting. Subsequently Campbell briefly disavowed Lovecraft, while working on the radically experimental tales which would be published as the collection ''Demons by Daylight''; but he later acknowledged Lovecraft's lasting influence, and his subsequent Cthulhu Mythos tales, collected in ''Cold Print'' (1985; expanded in 1993), confirm the transition from pastiche to homage, most notably in such tales as \"The Faces at Pine Dunes\" and the eerily surreal \"The Voice on the Beach\" (1982). Later work still seeks to \"ascend the cosmic peaks achieved by Lovecraft\", particularly the novel ''The Darkest Part of the Woods'' (2003), the novella ''The Last Revelation of Gla'aki'' (2013), and three novels that form his Brichester Mythos trilogy (2016-18). \n\n===The 1970s: \"Determined to be myself\": ''Demons by Daylight'' and early novels===\n\nWith his stories written between 1964 and 1968, beginning with ''The Reshaping of Rossiter'' (first draft of ''The Scar''), ''A Garden at Night'' (first draft of ''Made in Goatswood'') and ''The Successor'' (first draft of ''Cold Print''), Campbell set out to be as unlike Lovecraft as possible. Having discovered writers such as [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Robert Aickman]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Iris Murdoch]], [[William Burroughs]] and [[Henry Miller]], and such influences as the French 'new novel', he became interested in expanding the stylistic possibilities of his work. He finished the collection that would become ''Demons by Daylight'' in 1968, but it would not see print until 1973. Meanwhile, from 1969 to 1973, he continued to write short stories in which he gradually developed his own voice and themes and left the influence of Lovecraft far behind. Campbell worked in the Liverpool Public Libraries as a library assistant (1966\u201373) and was acting librarian in charge (1971\u201373).\n\nIn 1969, he had written ''Lovecraft in Retrospect'', a violent diatribe against Lovecraft, for the [[fanzine]] ''Shadow'',<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. ''Lovecraft in Retrospect'', ''Shadow'' 8 (1969).</ref> \"condemning [Lovecraft's] work outright.\"<ref>''Chasing the Unknown'', p.16.</ref>  However, in his 1985 book ''Cold Print'', which collects his Lovecraftian stories, Campbell disavowed the opinions expressed in the article, stating: \"I believe Lovecraft is one of the most important writers in the field\"<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. ''Lovecraft: An Introduction'', ''Cold Print'' (1993), p. 1.</ref> and \"the first book of Lovecraft's I read made me into a writer.\"<ref>''Chasing the Unknown'', p. 9.</ref>\n\nAround 1970, Campbell stopped using his first initial \"J.\" on his work, though a few stories earlier than this appeared as by \"Ramsey Campbell\", and a few after still saw print as by \"J. Ramsey Campbell\". Campbell later legally changed his name to remove the \"John\".\n\nAfter working four years in the tax office and seven years in public libraries, by 1973, Campbell became a fulltime writer, encouraged by the issuance by Arkham House of his second collection, ''[[Demons by Daylight]]'' (as by Ramsey Campbell). That collection had been due for publication in 1971, but was held back two years by the death of [[August Derleth]]. ''Demons by Daylight'' includes ''The Franklyn Paragraphs'', which uses Lovecraft's documentary narrative technique without slipping into parody of his writing style. Other tales, such as ''The End of a Summer's Day'' and ''Concussion'', show the emergence of Campbell's highly distinctive mature style, of which [[S. T. Joshi]] has written:\n<blockquote>\nCertainly much of the power of his work derives purely from his prose style, one of the most fluid, dense and evocative in all modern literature [...] His eye for the details and resonances of even the most mundane objects, and his ability to express them crisply and almost prose-poetically, give to his work at once a clarity and a dreamlike nebulousness that is difficult to describe but easy to sense.<ref>Joshi, S. T. ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001), p. 166.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe book's appearance induced [[T. E. D. Klein]] to write an extensive and highly positive review, ''Ramsey Campbell: An Appreciation'' in ''Nyctalops'' magazine and critic [[S. T. Joshi]] has stated<ref>Joshi, S. T. ''Ramsey Campbell and Modern Horror Fiction'' (2001), p.56</ref> that:\n<blockquote>its [...] allusiveness of narration; careful, at times even obsessive focusing on the fleeting sensations and psychological processes of characters; an aggressively modern setting that allows commentary on social, cultural and political issues''\u2014''all conjoin to make ''Demons by Daylight'' perhaps the most important book of horror fiction since [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraft]]'s ''[[The Outsider and Others]]''.</blockquote>\n\nCampbell has written that \"Having completed ''Demons by Daylight'' in 1968, I felt directionless, and it shows in quite a few of the subsequent tales.\"<ref name=\"Ramsey Campbell 2008\">\"\"Truth or Consequences\" in Ramsey Campbell, ''Inconsequential Tales'', NY: Hippocampus Press, 2008, 11.</ref> He wrote only four tales in 1970, and five stories in 1971.  He has written that \"retrospect demonstrates how untimely my decision [to write fulltime] was. Kirby McCauley, now my agent, had to tell me that the market for short horror stories was very limited... My solution was to lurch into science fiction as best I could. Little of it sold...\"<ref>\"\"Truth or Consequences\" in Ramsey Campbell, ''Inconsequential Tales'' NY: Hippocampus Press, 2008, 13.</ref> Many of the science fiction tales are collected in ''Inconsequential Tales'' (2008); he also wrote the novella ''Medusa'' (1973) and the short story \"Slow\" (collected in ''[[Told by the Dead]]''), but has stated that his science fiction \"tried to deal with Themes, too consciously, I feel\".<ref>Campbell, Ramsey. Introduction to ''Strange Things and Stranger Places'' (1993), quoted in S. T. Joshi, ''Ramsey Campbell and Modern Horror Fiction'' (2001), p.150.</ref>\n\nOutside the world of horror, he wrote a series of fantasy stories starring Ryre the Swordsman, who battles enemies on an alien world called Tond. Initially published in various anthologies, these stories were finally gathered in the collection ''Far Away & Never'' (Necronomicon Press, July 1996). In 1976 he 'completed' three of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s unfinished [[Solomon Kane]] stories, ''Hawk of Basti'', ''The Castle of the Devil'' and ''The Children of Asshur'' (published in 1978 and 1979). By the time Arkham House published his second hardcover collection of horror stories, ''[[The Height of the Scream]]'' (1976), he was beginning to be seen as one of the major modern writers of horror.\n\n1976 also saw the publication of Campbell's first novel, ''The Doll Who Ate His Mother'', which immediately drew acclaim from figures such as [[Fritz Leiber]] and [[T.E.D. Klein]]. In this and ''The Face that Must Die'' (1979), Campbell began to fully explore the enigma of evil, touching on the psychological themes of possession, madness and alienation which feature in many of his subsequent novels. He also continued to write short stories, mainly supernatural, receiving the [[World Fantasy Award]] for \"The Chimney\" (1977) and \"Mackintosh Willy\" (1980).\n\nCampbell has been a lifelong enthusiast of [[film]]; early stories such as ''The Reshaping of Rossiter'' (1964; an early version of ''The Scar'') show the influence of directors such as [[Alain Resnais]], and as early as 1969 Campbell had become the film reviewer for [[BBC Radio Merseyside]].<ref name=\"Ramsey Campbell 2008\"/> He worked in Merseyside on the Friday edition of \"Breakfast\" and less frequently on Claire Hamilton's Sunday show. A longer version of his Merseyside reviews appeared on the Radio Merseyside website, where he also reviewed DVDs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/films/ramsey/ramsey_reviews.shtml|title=BBC - Liverpool - Films - BBC Radio Merseyside - Ramsey reviews|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> His love of old movies features prominently in two of Campbell's later novels, ''Ancient Images'' and ''The Grin of the Dark''.\n\nCampbell wrote [[Novelization|novelisations]] and introductions for a series of novelisations of [[Universal Monsters|Universal horror]] films. The series has a rather complex publishing history. They were published in paperback in 1977 in the US, with uniform packaging, by Berkley Medallion Books as ''The Universal Horror Library''. All six of the Berkley editions were published under the [[pen name|house name]] 'Carl Dreadstone'; all six of the US editions featured stills from the relevant films. It is believed this set was made available as boxed set in slipcase, as well as sold individually. Only three of the novels were actually written by Campbell, though he contributed introductions to all six volumes. No US hardcover edition of the series is known. Campbell's contributions to the series were ''Bride of Frankenstein'', ''Dracula's Daughter'' and ''The Wolfman'', published as Carl Dreadstone. Three further novelisations which appeared under this house name were not by Campbell but written by other authors.<ref>Joshi, S. T., ''Ramsey Campbell and Modern Horror Fiction'' (2001), p.145-147.</ref>  [[Walter Harris (author)|Walter Harris]] wrote two of the novels: ''Werewolf of London'' and ''Creature from the Black Lagoon''. The author of the sixth Dreadstone (''The Mummy'') remains unknown.<ref>Ian Covell [https://terrortakeaways.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/ian-covell-on-carl-dreadstone/#comment-1567 \"Ian Covell on \u2018Carl Dreadstone\u2019\"], ''Souvenirs Of Terror fiendish film & TV show tie-ins'', 3 October 2007, accessed 11 July 2011.</ref> UK editions followed\u2014in 1978, Universal Books (a paperback division of [[Virgin Books|W. H. Allen Ltd]]) published ''The Bride of Frankenstein'' (by Campbell) together with Harris's ''The Werewolf of London'' and the (unknown author) ''The Mummy'' under the 'Carl Dreadstone' house name, with similar packaging under the title 'The Classic Library of Horror'. A further two years would elapse before the rest of the series was issued in the UK. The last three of the series were issued by Star Books (a W. H. Allen imprint) in 1980 (with different packaging from the 1978 titles) and these three appeared under a different house-name\u2014'E. K. Leyton'. These were Campbell's remaining two novels of the series, ''Dracula's Daughter'' and ''The Wolfman'', together with Harris's ''Creature from the Black Lagoon''. At least one hardcover omnibus was published, presumably prior to the UK paperbacks: ''The Classic Library of Horror Omnibus\u2014The Mummy & The Werewolf of London'' (London: Allan Wingate, 1978). Its existence suggests there may have been two companion hardcover omnibuses collecting the balance of the series (if this were the case they would contain the Campbell-authored novels), but their existence/issuance is uncertain. All six of the UK paperbacks and the hardcover omnibus omitted the film stills which appeared in the original US editions.<ref>Private collection of [[Leigh Blackmore]]</ref>\n\n1979 saw the publication of the non-supernatural thriller ''The Face That Must Die'', the story of a [[homophobic]] [[serial killer]] told largely from the killer's point of view. Initially considered by numerous publishers, including Campbell's British publisher [[Thomas Tessier]] at Millington Books, as too grim to publish, it is regarded by many critics as one of Campbell's finest works. The novel was cut by Star Books, who first issued it in a paperback edition in 1979; it was not issued complete until the US Scream Press edition of 1983.\n\n===The 1980s: ''The Parasite'' to ''Ancient Images''===\n\nCampbell became even more prolific during the 1980s, issuing no less than eight novels (of which six won major awards) and three short story collections. He has written that after moving away from Lovecraft's influence he was \"determined to sound like myself\" but also that \"The Chicago and San Francisco tales of [[Fritz Leiber]] were now my models in various ways. I wanted to achieve that sense of supernatural terror which derives from the everyday urban landscape rather than invading it, and I greatly admired\u2014still do\u2014how Fritz wrote thoroughly contemporary weird tales which were nevertheless rooted in the best traditions of the field, and which drew some of their strength from uniting British and American influences.\"<ref>Ramsey Campbell, ''Alone With the Horrors'' Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1993, p. x</ref>\n\nIn 1981, [[Stephen King]] published a semi-autobiographical overview of the horror field, ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]].'' In a chapter focusing on 20th century practitioners, King devoted a whole section to Campbell's fiction, alongside that of [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Shirley Jackson]], [[Peter Straub]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[Jack Finney]] and others. On the basis of Campbell's earliest work, especially ''The Doll Who Ate His Mother'', King argued that the author's strength lies in his hallucinogenic prose and edgy psychology, the way his characters view the world and how this affects readers:\n\n<blockquote>In a Campbell novel or story, one seems to view the world through the thin and shifting perceptual haze of an LSD trip that is just ending ... or just beginning. The polish of his writing and his mannered turns of phrase and image make him seem something like the genre's Joyce Carol Oates [...] as when journeying on LSD, there is something chilly and faintly schizophrenic in the way his characters see things ... and in the things they see [...] Good stuff. But strange; so uniquely Campbell that it might as well be trademarked.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Danse Macabre|last=King|first=Stephen|publisher=Futura|year=1981|isbn=978-0708821817|location=London|pages=396\u20137}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKing also singled out one of Campbell's early short stories for particular praise: \"{{-'}}The Companion' may be the best horror tale to be written in the English language in thirty years; it is surely one of the half a dozen or so which will still be in print and commonly read a hundred years from now.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Danse Macabre|last=King|first=Stephen|publisher=Futura|year=1981|isbn=978-0708821817|location=London|page=398}}</ref> This story appeared in Campbell's 1982 collection, ''Dark Companions'', alongside other tales from that period commonly cited as classics: \"The Chimney\", \"Mackintosh Willy\", and \"Call First\".\n\n''The Parasite'' (1980; published in the US with a different ending as ''To Wake the Dead'') is an intense novel told from the point of view of a female protagonist who becomes embroiled in occult practices (with Lovecraftian undertones). In ''The Nameless'' (1981), also told from the point of view of a woman, a child goes missing and returns only years later, affiliated to a nefarious organisation. ''Obsession'' (1982) involves a group of childhood friends make a wish apiece concerning their futures, the manifestations tormenting them in later life; however, as is common in Campbell's work involving aberrant mental states, it is not entirely apparent that these events have a supernatural origin. In ''Incarnate'' (1983), the boundaries between dream and reality are gradually broken down (the novel was written during the \"terrible nightmare year\" of Campbell's mother's last mental breakdown) as a group of characters involved in a psychological experiment begin to experience fragmentation in their everyday lives. \n\nIn ''The Claw'' (1983; originally published under the pseudonym Jay Ramsey) and ''The Hungry Moon'' (1986), Campbell writes in a more commercially minded way than in earlier novels. The latter is a multi-character 'small town' horror story along the lines of similar work in this period, a subgenre perhaps 'pump-primed' by the likes of Stephen King's '''Salem's Lot''. In characteristically honest and self-critical afterwords,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Claw|last=Campbell|first=Ramsey|publisher=Warner Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0708852583|location=London|pages=369\u2013380}}</ref> Campbell has claimed that ''The Hungry Moon,'' along with the similarly commercially minded ''The Parasite'' and, to a lesser degree, ''The Claw'', are among of his least successful of his works, by turns awkwardly structured, containing too many ideas, and/or tending towards explicit violence. By contrast, ''The Influence'' (1988) and ''Ancient Images'' (1989) are tightly plotted novels of supernatural menace, each with (predominantly) female central characters and generating unease through the author's trademark suggestiveness and surreal imagery. In 1987, Campbell published ''Scared Stiff'', a collection of \"sex and horror\" short stories.      \n\nIn the early 1980s Campbell had crossed paths a number of time in Liverpool at cinemas and various parties with a young Liverpool writer named [[Clive Barker]], who had been working around London as a playwright. Barker asked Campbell if he knew any markets for short stories and eventually asked him to look over a soon-to-be-published manuscript and the contract he had been offered for it. Campbell says \"My jaw dropped when I looked at the manuscript\u2014it turned out to be the ''[[Books of Blood]]''.\" Campbell wrote the introduction to the first edition. \n\nCampbell contributed numerous articles on horror cinema to ''[[The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural]]'' (1986). \n\n===The 1990s: ''Midnight Sun'' to ''The Last Voice They Hear''===\n\nThe 1990s again saw Campbell publish eight novels, though in the second half of this decade he moved away from traditional horror to explore crime and tales of social alienation. Four of this decade's novels won major awards for Best Novel. \n\nIn ''Midnight Sun'' (1990), an alien entity apparently seeks entry to the world through the mind of a children's writer. In its fusion of horror with awe, ''Midnight Sun'' shows the influence of [[Algernon Blackwood]] and [[Arthur Machen]] as well as Lovecraft. Although the author considers this novel \"an honourable failure\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Klaehn|first=Jeffrey|date=Spring 2016|title=Reaching for the awesome and numinous: an interview with horror author Ramsey Campbell|journal=New Writing: The International Journal for the Practice and Theory of Creative Writing|volume=13|issue=2|pages=308\u2013314|doi=10.1080/14790726.2016.1167921}}</ref> it is one that many enthusiasts single out as a highlight of this stage of his career. ''Needing Ghosts'' (1990), a novella, is a nightmarish work that blends the horrific and the comic; Campbell himself has described the composition of this piece as unique among his work in that it \"felt like dreaming on the page\" and was written relatively quickly without technical or structural challenges. \n\nA sympathetic serial murderer appears in the black comedy ''The Count of Eleven'' (1991), which displays Campbell's gift for [[word play]], and which the author has said is disturbing \"because it doesn't stop being funny when you think it should\".<ref>Campbell, Ramsey, interviewed in ''The Count of Thirty'' (1994).</ref> A review at the time suggested that the central character might be played in a film by Stan Laurel, an observation that delighted Campbell, who is a great admirer of Laurel and Hardy. Other novels of this decade include ''The Long Lost'' (1993), in which a [[sin-eater]] is discovered by a couple holidaying in Wales and brought home ostensibly as an relative, with considerable impact on a community. A haunted house novel called ''The House on Nazareth Hill'' (1996), combining the author's M R Jamesian suggestiveness with an increasingly idiosyncratic prose style, is a harrowing study of familial psychology and the unchanging nature of social processes, particularly those relating to the young's quest for independence and the threat this presents to others. Enthusiasts consider it one of Campbell's more powerful works. \n\nCampbell had earlier published a non-supernatural novel called ''The One Safe Place'' (1995), which uses a highly charged [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] narrative to examine social problems such as the deprivation and abuse of children, and in 1998 he turned away for a more sustained period from the supernatural work with which he was associated. By this time, horror had become commercially less successful and publishers were taking fewer chances on publishing such material, encouraging Campbell to write a number of crimes novels. The first, ''The Last Voice They Hear'' (1998), is a tightly plotted thriller which ranges back and forth in time as two brothers become engaged in a cat-and-mouse game redolent of earlier events in their lives. Although written \"under protest\", Campbell came to think of the book, during composition, as bearing his own stamp, and his next two novels were also non-supernatural. \n\nIn this decade Campbell issued no less than four short story collections, including, in 1993, the 30-year career retrospective ''[[Alone with the Horrors: The Great Short Fiction of Ramsey Campbell 1961\u20131991|Alone with the Horrors: The Great Short Fiction of Ramsey Campbell 1961-1991]]'', published by Campbell's original publisher, [[Arkham House]]. This volume, illustrated by Jeff K. Potter, is not a comprehensive collection of all the stories Campbell had published in those thirty years, but 39 tales which Campbell and his editor Jim Turner thought representative. Drawing on material across his whole career to that date, it is commonly considered to be a good entry point for readers hitherto unfamiliar with the author's work. ''[[Waking Nightmares]]'' (1991), ''[[Strange Things and Stranger Places]]'' (1993), and ''[[Ghosts and Grisly Things]]'' (1998) collect much of Campbell's short fiction from this period. Two of this decade's short story collections won major awards for best collection. \n\nIn 1999, Campbell was awarded both the Grand Master Award from the World Horror Convention and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Horror Writers Association. \n\n===The 2000s: ''Silent Children'' to ''Creatures of the Pool''===\nIn the \"noughties\", Campbell continued his prolific output, publishing an average of a novel a year, along with three short story collections. He reviewed films and DVDs weekly for [[BBC Radio Merseyside]] until 2007. He began to contribute a monthly film column, \"Ramsey's Ramblings\", for ''[[Video Watchdog]]'' magazine. In 2002, PS Publishing issued a collection of Campbell's essays on horror and other areas of interest: ''Ramsey Campbell, Probably'' (this volume was expanded to include further material in a 2014 reprint). The collection includes  book reviews, film reviews, autobiographical writings and other nonfiction, along with reminiscences and appreciations of authors such as [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], [[Bob Shaw]] and [[K. W. Jeter]], and an extensive, negative critique of [[Shaun Hutson]]'s ''Heathen'', [[parody]]ing Hutson's style.\n\nFollowing the publication of two more crime novels\u2014''Silent Children'' (2000), the story of an eccentric child killer; and ''Pact of the Fathers'' (2001), which draws on arcane religious practices\u2014Campbell determined to return to the supernatural and otherworldly. ''The Darkest Part of the Woods'' (2003) successfully evokes the cosmic terrors of H P Lovecraft and was the first of Campbell's work published by [[PS Publishing]]; the author would go on to enjoy a long-term relationship with the UK imprint, granting first print rights to most new work. Having spent a number of months working full-time in a [[Borders Group|Borders]] store, Campbell wrote ''The Overnight'' (2004), about [[bookshop]] staff trapped in their hellish workplace during an overnight shelf-filling shift. In ''Secret Stories'' (2005; abridged US edition, ''Secret Story'', 2006) Campbell returned voluntarily to the crime genre, offering a blackly comic study of a latter-day serial killer whose written accounts of his crimes inadvertently win a fiction competition, resulting in further murders.  \n\n''The Grin of the Dark'' (2007)\u2014considered by many to be Campbell's masterpiece, a showcase of his stylistic method and powerfully focused on contemporaneous issues arising from wide-scale Internet use\u2014draws on the author's interest in the history of cinema, as a character hunts material relating to a silent film comedian by the name of Tubby Thackeray. The author himself, often critical of his own output, continues to cite this novel as one with which he remains pleased. ''Thieving Fear'' (2008) and ''The Creatures of the Pool'' (2009) use locations, in and around the author's native Liverpool, to eerie effect.  \n\n''[[Told by the Dead]]'' (2003) and ''[[Just Behind You]]'' (2009) collected Campbell's more recent short fiction, while ''[[Inconsequential Tales]]'' (2008), collecting a number of unpublished stories, documents his early evolution as a stylist.    \n\nIn 2007, Campbell was awarded the Living Legend Award from the International Horror Guild.\n\n=== The 2010: ''The Seven Days of Cain'' to the \"Brichester Mythos Trilogy\" ===\nAfter 2010, Campbell continued to have published at least a book a year, including a collection of letters from his early career between himself and his first mentor August Derleth (''Letters to Arkham: The Letters of Ramsey Campbell and August Derleth, 1961-1971'', ed. S. T. Joshi, 2014) . \n\nBoth ''The Seven Days of Cain'' (2010) and ''Think Yourself Lucky'' (2014) explore the use of the internet, as characters appearing online start to impact upon the lived world with disconcerting effects. In 2010, Campbell was commissioned to write the novelisation of the movie ''[[Solomon Kane (film)|Solomon Kane]],'' which was based on the swords and sorcery stories of Robert E. Howard (some of which Campbell had completed in his early career)''.'' ''Ghosts Know'' (2011), one of the author's few latter-day non-supernatural excursions (on the surface, at least), explores the mendacity of stage mediums/psychics in the context of a missing person story; it also showcases a later development in the Campbell's work, social comedy and confusions inherent in everyday communication. ''The Kind Folk'' (2012) is a delicately written evocation of fairy folk, told in the modern day.  \n\nIn 2013, ''[[Holes for Faces]]'', a further collection of short fiction appeared, gathering together his work from the 2000s. During the same period, PS Publishing issued two novellas by Campbell: ''The Last Revelation of Gla'aki'' (2013) and ''The Pretence'' (2013); a third novella appeared in 2016 entitled ''The Booking,'' from Dark Regions Press. These were the first novellas Campbell had written since 1990's ''Needing Ghosts''. 2015 saw the release of ''Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach'', one of Campbell's few novels set outside the UK; a family holiday on a Greek island involves communion with a familiar supernatural character from literature. Campbell's collection of playful limericks based on famous horror works of fiction appeared in 2016: ''Limericks of the Alarming and Phantasmal.'' \n\n''The Searching Dead'' (2016) was the first novel in a trilogy of H P Lovecraft-influenced works which, like the novella ''The Last Revelation of Gla'aki,'' revisits themes from Campbell's early work in that subgenre. Described by the author as his \"Brichester Mythos trilogy,\" the three-book series, including ''Born to the Dark'' (2017) and ''The Way of the Worm'' (2018), documents a character's engagement with a nefarious organisation over three time periods (1950s, 1980s, 2010s) and evokes a cosmic entity by the name of Daoloth. The trilogy draws together multiple themes that have preoccupied the author during his whole career: the cosmic, family, scapegoating, the vulnerability of children, and the seductiveness of totalising belief systems. \n\nA new short story collection, ''By the Light of my Skull,'' was also released in 2018, gathering together some of Campbell's more recent works, some of which\u2014as has been the case in his later fiction\u2014deal with older age. ''Visions from Brichester'' (2017) collected all of the author's Lovecraftian short fiction not originally published in ''The Inhabitant of the Lake''. PS Publishing will issue a two-volume retrospective focused on Campbell's most representative short fiction across his entire career, the first of which is ''The Companion & Other Phantasmagorical Stories'' (2019).  \n\nIn 2015, Campbell received the World Fantasy Award's Life Award, and in 2017, in Spain, he was awarded the Premio Sheridan Le Fanu for his career achievements. In 2015, the author received an Honorary Fellowship from John Moores University, Liverpool, for \"outstanding services to literature\". \n\n=== The 2020s: ''The Wise Friend'' to present ===\nCampbell's next novel, ''The Wise Friend'', is due to be published in spring 2020, by new publisher Flame Tree Press (which has also reissued earlier Campbell novels in hardcover, paperback and audiobook). A new novella, ''The Enigma of the Flat Policeman,'' part of Borderlands Press's Little Book series (in this case, ''A Little Green Book of Grins & Gravity'') was released in March, 2020. The second volume of his career retrospective, ''The Retrospective & Other Phantasmagorical Stories,'' will be published later in 2020. He is currently working on a new novel called ''Somebody's Voice''. \n\n=== Style and themes ===\nCampbell's style is characterised by an idiosyncratic use of language. His fictional worlds feel unusual, threatening, and dislocated. Such an approach has prompted [[Peter Straub]] to write: \"Horrors in his fiction are never merely invented, they are felt and experienced, and affect the reader for days afterward.\"{{cn|date=October 2019}} The horrors Campbell evokes are commonly suggested to the reader by ambiguous allusions to events his characters are not always mindful of. In this regard, his approach is similar to that of [[M. R. James]]. Indeed, Campbell celebrates James's concentrated prose, choice of detail, and ability to hint at disquieting material much larger than what is explicitly revealed. Campbell has described much of his own later work as \"comedies of paranoia\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/why-i-write/article/48631-why-i-write-ramsey-campbell.html|title=Why I Write...Ramsey Campbell|last=Campbell|first=Ramsey|date=9 September 2011|website=Publishers Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>, as his characters experience an existential bewilderment that borders on the absurd.  \n\nCampbell himself has cited the following themes as recurrent in his work: \"the vulnerability of children, the willingness of people to espouse a belief system that denies them the right to question, and the growing tendency to create scapegoats for the ills of the world.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lounge-books.com/award-winners-we-lov/ramsey-campbell-horror-author-interview|title=Meet Ramsey Campbell, 'Britain's Most Respected Living Horror Writer'|last=Walker|first=Luke|date=|website=Lounge Books|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref> However, his work has addressed a wide range of issues, including censorship (e.g., ''The One Safe Place'', 1995), the impact of the internet on modern consciousness (e.g., ''The Grin of the Dark'', 2007; ''The Seven Days of Cain'', 2010; ''Think Yourself Lucky'', 2014), corporation-led consumerism (the recurrence of a global organisation called Frugo in his later work, especially ''The Overnight'', 2004, and ''Thieving Fear'', 2008), fatherhood (''The House on Nazareth Hill'', 1996), and older age (''Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach'', 2015). Abnormal human psychology is also a major recurring theme in Campbell's work (e.g., ''The Face That Must Die'', 1979; ''The Count of Eleven'', 1991; ''The Last Voice They Hear'', 1998; ''Secret Stories'', 2005).\n\n===Tributes===\n\nFour tribute anthologies of stories inspired by Campbell's work have been released to date. The first was the 1995 anthology ''Made in Goatswood'' (Chaosium, edited by Scott David Aniolowski), which includes a story by Campbell himself. More recently, ''The Children of Gla'aki'' (2016, Dark Regions Press, edited by Brian M. Sammons and Glynn Owen Barrass) consists of stories focused on one of Campbell's Lovecraftian creations, and ''Darker Companions'' (2017, PS Publishing, edited by Joe Pulver and Scott David Aniolowski) contains tales inspired by the author's vision and prose. In Spain, a further tribute anthology recently appeared entitled ''El Horror Que Vino del Sur: Un Tributo Latino a Ramsey Campbell Y Al Circulo de Lovecraft'' (2018, Bookbaby). All four books demonstrate Campbell's influence in the field on both established and newer writers. \n\nIn 2012, Campbell's centrality in the field attracted a spoof collection of horror stories edited by fellow writer [[Rhys Hughes]]. Hughes contributed a good deal of the fictional content, including the pieces focused on an author called Lamblake Heinz, clearly a parody of Campbell (although Hughes has admitted elsewhere that he has read little if any of Campbell's work).\n\n===Films===\n\nThree of Campbell's novels have been filmed to date, all in Spain. [[Jaume Balaguer\u00f3]]'s ''[[The Nameless (film)|The Nameless]]'' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Los Sin Nombre''; in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Els sense nom''), based on the novel of the same name, takes some liberties with the source material's plot but captures its pungent atmosphere. [[Paco Plaza]]'s ''[[Second Name]]'' (''El Segundo Nombre'' in Spanish) based on the novel ''The Pact of the Fathers'', similarly evokes Campbell's paranoiac fictional world, its story rooted in the world of arcane religious practices. Denis Rovira van Boekholt's ''The Influence'' (''La Influencia'' in Spanish), based on the Campbell novel of the same name and quite faithful (except for changes in the final third), was released in 2019 and was later picked up by [[Netflix]] to stream. \n\n===Books edited===\n\nCampbell has edited a number of [[anthologies]], including ''[[New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos]]'' (1980); ''New Terrors'' and ''New Terrors II'', a groundbreaking two-volume anthology series; and (with [[Stephen Jones (author)|Stephen Jones]]) the first five volumes of the annual ''Best New Horror'' series (1990\u20131994). His 1992 anthology ''[[Uncanny Banquet]]'' was notable for including the first ever reprint of the obscure 1914 horror novel ''The Hole of the Pit'' by [[Adrian Ross]]. ''The Gruesome Book'' was a paperback anthology of horror tales for children. Campbell is extremely well-read in the horror field, and some of his own literary influences are demonstrated by his selections for the 1988 anthology ''Fine Frights: Stories That Scared Me''. In 2002 he edited a collection of fiction in the tradition of M. R. James, entitled ''Meddling with Ghosts''. His 2003 anthology ''Gathering the Bones'' (co-edited with Dennis Etchison and Jack Dann) draws together tales from the UK, US, and Australia. ''The Folio Book of Horror Stories'' (2018), the first collection Campbell had edited in 15 years, draws together classic tales from the last 200 years.\n\n===Personal life===\n\nCampbell married Jenny Chandler (a teacher), daughter of [[A. Bertram Chandler]], on 1 January 1971; has two children, Tamsin (born 1978) and Matthew (born 1981); and still lives in Merseyside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/clive-barker-returns-heres-eight-9289121|title=As Clive Barker returns here's eight other Merseyside sci fi, fantasy and horror writers who have thrilled readers worldwide|first=Jamie|last=Bowman|date=19 May 2015|website=liverpoolecho}}</ref> He commonly describes his wife as the \"best part\" of himself. At various stages of his career\u2014for instance, when he first decided to write on a full-time basis\u2014Campbell received support from Jenny, who worked as a teacher. Campbell is fond of fine dining, travel, and classical music. He is very active as a public speaker and greatly enjoys giving readings of his fiction at literary events. Campbell is eloquent and jolly (a persona he self-effacingly describes as a \"facade\"), and he has claimed that if he hadn't become a horror writer, he might have been a stand-up comedian.  \n\nIn response to an interview question about religion, Campbell has stated, \"As I got older I\u2019m more [[agnosticism|Agnostic]] [...] [a] little religious perspective is no bad thing; I have no set belief.\" He added, \"I don\u2019t think there is any supernatural force out there to make you do stuff.\" <ref>Neil Buchanan, [http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/interviews/1245-an-interview-with-ramsey-campbell \"An Interview With Ramsey Campbell\".] ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'', June 2013. Retrieved 29 September 2016.</ref> When asked whether he believes in the supernatural he claims to have experienced episodes that might be described as involving such activity; however, he remains noncommittal on this issue, stating that he writes about such material because he finds it \"imaginatively appealing\" and to \"repay\" the genre for many treasured reading experiences. Campbell is fiercely opposed to censorship, claiming that the suppression of contentious material leads to it returning in an even worse form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/writing/ramseys-rant-censorship/|title=Ramsey's Rant: Censorship|last=Campbell|first=Ramsey|date=March 2009|website=British Fantasy Society}}</ref> He has been very generous in support of newer writers, frequently writing introductions to their work.   \n\nFor many years Campbell was the President of the [[British Fantasy Society]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Novels ===\n\n*''[[The Doll Who Ate His Mother]]'' (1976; revised text, 1985)\n*''The Face That Must Die'' (expurgated version 1979; restored text: 1983)\n*''The Parasite'' (1980; published in the US with a different ending as ''To Wake the Dead'')\n*''The Nameless'' (1981; filmed in 1999 as ''[[The Nameless (film)|The Nameless]]'')\n*''The Claw'' (1983; also known as ''Night of the Claw'', ''Claw''; written as Jay Ramsay)\n*''Incarnate'' (1983)\n*''Obsession'' (1985; written under the working title ''For the Rest of Their Lives'')\n*''The Hungry Moon'' (1986; written under the working title ''Blind Dark'')\n*''The Influence'' (1988; filmed in 2019 as ''La Influencia'')\n*''Ancient Images'' (1989)\n*''Midnight Sun'' (1990)\n*''The Count of Eleven'' (1991)\n*''The Long Lost'' (1993)\n*''The One Safe Place'' (1995)\n*''The House on Nazareth Hill'' (1996; also known as ''Nazareth Hill'')\n*''The Last Voice They Hear'' (1998)\n*''Silent Children'' (2000)\n*''Pact of the Fathers'' (2001; filmed in 2002 as ''[[Second Name (film)|Second Name]]'')\n*''The Darkest Part of the Woods'' (2003)\n*''The Overnight'' (2004)\n*''Secret Stories'' (2005; abridged US edition, ''Secret Story'', 2006)\n*''The Grin of the Dark'' (2007)\n*''Thieving Fear'' (2008)\n*''Creatures of the Pool'' (2009)\n*''The Seven Days of Cain'' (2010)\n*''Ghosts Know'' (2011)\n*''The Kind Folk'' (2012)\n*''Think Yourself Lucky'' (2014)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pspublishing.co.uk/index.asp?function=ERROR404&type=PRODUCT|title=UK genre publisher of SF, Horror & Fantasy fiction.|website=www.pspublishing.co.uk}}</ref>\n*''Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach'' (2015)\n*''The Searching Dead'' (2016)\n*''Born to the Dark'' (2017)\n*''The Way of the Worm'' (2018)\n*''The Wise Friend'' (2020)\n\n=== Novelisations ===\n\n*''The Bride of Frankenstein'' (1977; of the [[Bride of Frankenstein|1935 film]], written as Carl Dreadstone)\n*''Dracula's Daughter'' (1977; of the [[Dracula's Daughter|1936 film]], written as Carl Dreadstone)\n*''The Wolf Man'' (1977; of the [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|1941 film]], written as Carl Dreadstone)\n*''Solomon Kane'' (2010; of the 2009 film)\n\n=== Novellas ===\n\n*''Medusa'' (1973; published standalone; later collected in ''Strange Things and Stranger Places'')\n*''Needing Ghosts'' (1990; published stand-alone; later collected in ''Strange Things and Stranger Places'')\n*''The Last Revelation of Gla'aki'' (2013)\n*''The Pretence'' (2013)\n*''The Booking'' (2016)\n\n*''The Enigma of the Flat Policeman (A Little Green Book of Grins & Gravity)'' (2020)\n\n===Collections===\n\n*''[[The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants]]'' (1964, as J.

He served as [[Governor-General of Australia]] from 1945 to 1947, the only member of the [[British royal family]] to hold the post.\n \nHenry was the first son of a British monarch to be educated at school, where he excelled at sports, and went on to attend [[Eton College]], after which he was commissioned in the [[10th Royal Hussars]], a regiment he hoped to command. But his military career was interrupted by royal duties, and he was nicknamed \"the unknown soldier\". While big-game shooting in Kenya, he met the future aviatrix [[Beryl Markham]], with whom he became romantically involved. The court put pressure on him to end the relationship, but he had to pay regular hush-money to avert a public scandal. In 1935, also under parental pressure, he married [[Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott]], with whom he had two sons, Princes [[Prince William of Gloucester|William]] and [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|Richard]].\n\nFrom 1939 to 1940, Henry served in France as a liaison officer to [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]]. He performed military and diplomatic duties during the rest of the war, then in 1945 was appointed as Australia's governor-general at the request of Prime Minister [[John Curtin]]. The post had originally been offered to his younger brother, the [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]], who died in an air crash. Henry attended the coronation of his niece [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953 and carried out several overseas tours, often accompanied by his wife. From 1965, he became incapacitated by a number of strokes. Upon his death, he was succeeded as the [[Duke of Gloucester]] by his only living son, Richard. \n\nAt the time of his death, Prince Henry was the last surviving child of King George V and Queen Mary. His widow, who died at the age of 102, became the longest-lived member of the British royal family in history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Princejohnandfamily.jpg|thumb|left|The royal children in 1912: (Back row l-r) Albert, Henry and Edward. <br/>(Front row l-r) John, Mary and George]]\nPrince Henry was born on 31 March 1900, at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref name=odnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31220?docPos=2 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']</ref> His father was the Duke of York (later [[King George V]]), the eldest surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]).<ref name=odnb/> His mother was the Duchess of York (later [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), the only daughter of the [[Prince Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]].<ref name=odnb/> At the time of his birth, he was fifth in the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession to the throne]], behind his grandfather, father and two elder brothers.\n\nHe was baptised at the private chapel of [[Windsor Castle]] on 17 May 1900, by [[Randall Thomas Davidson]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], and his godparents were: Queen Victoria (his great-grandmother); the [[William II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] (his first cousin once removed, for whom [[Prince Albert of Prussia (1837\u20131906)|Prince Albert of Prussia]] stood proxy); [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Henry of Battenberg]] (his paternal great-aunt); the [[Princess Thyra of Denmark|Duchess of Cumberland]] (his paternal great-aunt, whose sister, his grandmother the Princess of Wales represented her); [[Prince George of Greece]] (his first cousin once removed, for whom Prince Henry's paternal grandfather the Prince of Wales stood proxy); [[Maud of Wales|Princess Carl of Denmark]] (his paternal aunt, for whom her sister [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria of Wales]] stood proxy); [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Prince Alexander of Teck]] (his maternal uncle, for whom Prince Henry's great-uncle the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] stood proxy); and Field Marshal The [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]] (for whom General Sir [[Dighton Probyn]] stood proxy).<ref name=\"Yvonne\">[http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings Yvonne's Royalty Home Page \u2013 Royal Christenings]</ref> He was informally known to his family as ''Harry''.<ref>http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50561785</ref>\n\n==Childhood and education==\n[[File:Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester circa 1916.jpg|thumb|left|At [[Eton College]] in 1916]]\nAs a young boy, Prince Henry suffered from ill health very much like his older brother [[George VI|Albert]].

He was very small for his age and was prone to get very aggressive colds. \"You must remember that he is rather fragile and must be treated differently to his two elder brothers who are more robust\", wrote Prince George to Henry's tutor, Henry Peter Hansell.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\">{{cite book |last=Van der Kiste |first=John |date=2003 |title=George V's children |location= |publisher=Sutton Publishing LTD |isbn=0750934689}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 May 1910, Prince George ascended the throne as George V, and Henry became the third in line to the throne. The King was persuaded by Hansell that it would be good for Henry's character to attend school, where he could interact with boys his age. The King, having previously rejected this proposition for his two elder sons, agreed on the basis that it would help him \"behave like a boy and not like a little child\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/> \nPrince Henry thus became the first son of a British monarch to attend school. After three days at [[St Peter's Court]] in [[Broadstairs]] as a day boy,  Hansell, noticing he liked it, asked the King to send him as a boarder, to which he agreed.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nHenry spent three years at St Peter's Court. Academically, he was not very bright, although he did show a particular aptitude in mathematics, Henry's sole interest became sports, particularly cricket and football. \"All you write about is your everlasting football of which I am heartily sick\", wrote his mother, answering a fully detailed letter from Henry about a match.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nIn September 1913, Henry started at [[Eton College]].<ref name=odnb/> During the [[First World War]], Crown Prince Leopold of [[Belgium]], later King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]], was a member of his [[House system|house]] (Mr Lubbock's<ref name=odnb/>). His studies did not improve, but his nerves and disposition did. He made friends through his enthusiasm for sports, and his masters were very pleased with him, noting in his report that he was \"thoroughly willing, cheerful, modest & obedient\". To his father, these values were the most important, having no time or interest in what he called \"intellectuals\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nBy the time he went up to [[Trinity College Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1919 with his brother Albert, Henry had outgrown all his brothers, both in height and size, and enjoyed very good health. Their stay at Cambridge lasted just one year and was very uneventful for both of them, as they were not allowed to live in college with the other undergraduates, due to their father's fear of their mixing with undesirable company.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\n==Military career==\nUnlike his brothers, Prince Henry joined the [[British Army|Army]] rather than the [[Royal Navy]].

[[Duke of Gloucester]], [[Earl of Ulster]], and [[Baron Culloden]], three titles that linked him with three parts of the United Kingdom, namely [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33371 |date= 30 March 1928| page=2321 |endpage= |supp=}}</ref> Prince Henry visited Canada sometime in

his regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars, or at least spend as much time in the army as possible. Although he was a capable soldier, as the King's son he was prevented from joining his regiment abroad, and this meant he was generally seen as an outsider to his fellow officers. To his increasing despair, he had to fulfill the many royal duties his father assigned him.<ref name=\"Royal Family: Years of Transition\">{{cite book |title=Royal Family: Years of Transition}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1928, Henry left England with his brother [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], to shoot big game in Africa. The brothers parted in [[Nairobi]], where Henry was to stay for a while. There, he was entertained by [[Mansfield Markham]] and his wife [[Beryl Markham]]. Beryl and Henry soon started an affair (though sources differ over when the affair started; many say it was not until her visit to England). In November, the brothers were recalled to England due to their father's worsening health, and soon after Beryl returned too. At the Grosvenor Hotel, close to [[Buckingham Palace]], the affair continued with Prince Henry openly hosting parties with her in her suite and drinking too much.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nThe affair, widely known by the London society, shocked the Queen, to the delight of the Prince of Wales who remarked that \u201cfor once, Queen Mary\u2019s blue-eyed boy was in trouble instead of himself\u201d. The King stepped in, thinking  that keeping Henry busy would be the best way to end the affair, as would keeping him from drinking too much, too often. That year, he arranged a series of tours for his son to undertake.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/> \n      \nIn 1929, he went to Japan to confer the [[Order of the Garter|Garter]] on the Emperor, and a year later he attended the [[coronation]] of [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] of [[Ethiopia]] in [[Addis Ababa]].<ref name=odnb/> In 1934 George V made him a [[Order of St Patrick|Knight of St Patrick]], Ireland's chivalric order. It was the second to last time this order was awarded (the last appointment being the Duke of York, later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], in 1936); at the time of his death, the Duke of Gloucester was the only remaining knight. In 1934, he went to Australia and New Zealand where the people received him with overwhelming enthusiasm that one journalist wrote, \"(amounted) to something very near adoration\".<ref name=\"Royal Family: Years of Transition\"/>\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Duke and Duchess of Gloucester with sons.jpg|thumb|The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester with their two sons William (standing) and Richard in Canberra]]\nWhen he returned from his trip to Japan in 1929, the affair with Markham ended. Her husband wanted a divorce and threatened to disclose Prince Henry's private letters to his wife if he did not \"take care of Beryl\". The Duke and Beryl never met again, although she did write to him when he visited Kenya in 1950 with his wife, but he didn't write back. Prince Henry's solicitors paid out an annuity until her death in 1985.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/> \n   \nAfter his tour of Australia and New Zealand, and pressured by his parents, Prince Henry decided it was time to settle down and proposed to [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott]], sister of one of Henry's best friends [[Lord William Montagu Douglas Scott]]. The proposal, wrote Lady Alice many years later, was not at all romantic as \"it was not his way\", instead he just \"mumbled it as we were on a walk one day\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |title=The Memoirs of Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester}}</ref>\nThey were married on 6 November 1935. The marriage was originally planned to take place at [[Westminster Abbey]], but was moved to the more modest Private Chapel at [[Buckingham Palace]] due to the death of Lady Alice's father, [[John Montagu Douglas Scott, 7th Duke of Buccleuch]], on 19 October 1935, barely a fortnight before the wedding.

He was born in [[Monken Hadley Common]], He died unmarried and without issue, killed in an airplane crash.\n* [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] (born 26 August 1944), He was born at St Matthew's Hospital in [[Northampton]], He married a Danish commoner, [[Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester|Birgitte van Deurs]], on 8 July 1972. The couple later had three children.\n\nThe couple lived first at the [[Royal Pavilion, Aldershot|Royal Pavilion]] in [[Aldershot]], near the barracks of the Duke's regiment. \"It was a very simple cabin\" recalled the Duchess of Gloucester, and \"the only royal thing about it was my husband's presence\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nAfter his father's death, the Duke bought [[Barnwell Manor]] with the larger part of his inheritance. It was a large country house in [[Northamptonshire]] which had belonged to his wife's ancestors. As their London seat, they were given [[York House, St. James's Palace|York House]] in [[St. James's Palace]].\n\n==Abdication of Edward VIII==\nIn December 1936, Henry's brother Edward VIII [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated the throne]] to marry divorc\u00e9e [[Wallis Simpson]]. His brother, Prince Albert, ascended the throne as [[King George VI]]. Although third in line to the throne, following his two nieces Princesses [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]], he became the first adult in line, meaning he would act as [[regency|regent]] if anything were to happen to the King before Princess Elizabeth came of age on 21 April 1944, her 18th birthday. Because of this, Prince Henry could not leave the UK at the same time as the King. Furthermore, he and his younger brother, the [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]], had to increase their royal engagements considerably to support the new King.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nEdward VIII, who became Duke of Windsor after abdicating, recalled that it was Henry who reacted least to the news of his abdication. The brothers had never been close, and apart from horses, they had not much in common. But Edward did admit regretting the implications the abdication would have on \"The Unknown Soldier\", a nickname he teasingly used to refer to Henry, owing to his low profile.<ref>Bloch {{cite book |last= Bloch |first= Michael|date= 2012 |title= The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor |location= England |isbn= 978-0349001081}}</ref>\n\nThe abrupt change in Prince Henry's somewhat carefree life up to that point was made clear by the new King on the very first evening of his reign. \"If you two think that, now that I have taken this new job on, you can go on behaving just as you like, in the same old way, you are very much mistaken! You two have to pull yourselves together\", the King warned his two younger brothers at dinner.<ref>Cadbury {{cite book |last= Cadbury|first= Deborah|date= 2015 |title= Princes at War |location= England |isbn= 978-1610394031}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Duke of Gloucester supported his brother, and later his niece, tirelessly and dutifully, he had a fondness for whisky. On one occasion, Queen Mary wrote to the Duchess suggesting that if they were planning to visit, the Duke should bring his own supply of whisky, \"as we have not got much left, and it is so expensive\". Even [[Noble Frankland]], who wrote the Duke's biography after his death at the request and under the supervision of the Duchess, wrote that: \"He did not eschew a glass of whisky ... or the occasional blasphemous oath.\"<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/><ref>Frankland {{cite book |last= Frankland |first= Noble |date= 1975 |title= Prince Henry Duke of Gloucester |location= England |isbn= 029777705X}}</ref>\n\nKing George VI had great affection for his younger brother. Circumstances had made them closer following the abdication, and the King trusted Prince Henry with important matters, which he dutifully undertook. Sometimes, though, the organised King found his brother's less systematic manner irritating. On one occasion after a day of shooting at [[Balmoral Castle]], the King found a mistake on his shot-game record, where there seemed to be a pair of grouse missing. A member of staff suggested that the King call and ask the Duke of Gloucester, who was staying at [[Birkhall]]. When the Duke confirmed he had taken the birds, the King's gruff warning to his brother that he should never again take birds without telling him surprised the member of staff.<ref>\n{{cite book \n|last= Corbitt |first= Frederick John \n|date= 1956 \n|title= My Twenty Years in Buckingham Palace: a book of intimate memoirs\n|url= https://archive.org/details/mytwentyyearsinb007031mbp |publisher= David McKay Company Inc.\n|location= New York |isbn= 1258094002\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nAfter the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Duke of Gloucester, as Chief Liaison Officer to [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]], spent almost the entire first year of the war in France. Besides boosting the troops' morale, he was useful as a first-hand witness of the situation; he reported to government officials and to the King, to whom he continually wrote detailed and objective accounts of what was happening. Always eager to get involved, the Duke often found himself in dangerous situations, but did not seem overly worried. \"Motoring about is not nice as many villages are being bombed,\" he wrote to his wife in his usual straightforward and dismissive manner. The Duke's two narrowest escapes both came in May 1940.\n\nHaving known [[King Leopold III of Belgium]] from school days, the Duke wanted to meet him personally to offer support after rumours began circulating that Belgium would surrender to Germany. On 14 May, he and his brother-in-law, [[Lord William Montagu Douglas Scott|Lord William Scott]], drove from Hotel Univers in [[Arras]] into Belgium to see the King of the Belgians at a secret location. That night, Hotel Univers was bombed, resulting in several deaths, including those staying in the rooms next to the Duke's. The Duke wrote to his brother that King Leopold was \"very depressed\". As the Duke and Lord William Scott drove back, they were caught up in heavy enemy bombing in [[Tournai]], where their car caught fire. They managed to get out and dive into an alleyway, although not unscathed as the Duke needed medical attention for a profusely bleeding wound.<ref name=\"Cadbury\">Cadbury</ref>\n\nAlthough generally optimistic, Prince Henry did sometimes suffer from bouts of depression during his service in 1940, especially at the end of his occasional leaves. \"My beloved Alice, I did hate leaving you yesterday so very much that I could hardly keep a straight face\", he wrote to his wife after reporting back. The strains of living at the French front also diminished his resolve at times: \"I think I hate this country and war more than ever... it is such an awful waste of everything,\" he told the Duchess.<ref name=\"Cadbury\"/><ref>Aronson {{cite book |last=Aronson |first=Theo |date=2014 |title=The Royal Family at War |location=England |isbn=978-1910198032}}</ref>\n\nIn June, after the [[Battle of Dunkirk|fall of Dunkirk]], the Duke was ordered back to England by an embarrassed General Headquarters, which had not been able to assure the King's brother's safety. \"Wherever I went or had been, I was bombed\" the Duke explained to his mother, amused.<ref name=\"Cadbury\"/>\n\nIn early 1942 the King arranged a four-month-long military and diplomatic mission for the Duke to the Middle East, India, and East Africa.<ref>FO 954/5B/213, 30 March 1942, The National Archives, Kew, England</ref> The mission came just after Prince Henry had become a father for the first time, and it was considered a dangerous trip, as the Germans were rapidly advancing toward some of the territories the Duke would visit. The King even wrote to his sister-in-law that he would act as guardian of the newly-born Prince William if anything should happen to his brother.<ref name=\"Cadbury\"/><ref name=\"Aronson\">Aronson</ref>\n\nAfter Prince Henry's younger brother, the Duke of Kent, died in a plane crash in August 1942, it was decided that the Duke of Gloucester would not be sent on any further missions that could prove dangerous.<ref name=\"Aronson\"/>\n\n==Governor-General of Australia==\n[[File:King George VI and Queen Elizabeth with the Gloucesters.jpg|thumb|The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester are seen off on their departure for Australia by the [[George VI|King]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]], 1945]]\nIn late 1944 the Duke was unexpectedly appointed [[Governor-General of Australia]]<ref name=odnb/> after his younger brother, the [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]], who had been offered the position, died in an aeroplane crash in Scotland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/from-the-archives-the-crown-and-the-people-20200125-p53unu.html|title=From the Archives: The Crown and the people|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 January 2020|accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Duke had made a successful visit to Australia in 1934.

of Gloucester''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KG|KT|KP|GCB|GCMG|GCVO|PC}} (Henry William Frederick Albert; 31 March 1900 \u2013 10 June 1974) was the third son and fourth child of [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He served as [[Governor-General of Australia]] from 1945 to 1947, the only member of the [[British royal family]] to hold the post.\n \nHenry was the first son of a British monarch to be educated at school, where he excelled at sports, and went on to attend [[Eton College]], after which he was commissioned in the [[10th Royal Hussars]], a regiment he hoped to command. But his military career was interrupted by royal duties, and he was nicknamed \"the unknown soldier\". While big-game shooting in Kenya, he met the future aviatrix [[Beryl Markham]], with whom he became romantically involved. The court put pressure on him to end the relationship, but he had to pay regular hush-money to avert a public scandal. In 1935, also under parental pressure, he married [[Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott]], with whom he had two sons, Princes [[Prince William of Gloucester|William]] and [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|Richard]].\n\nFrom 1939 to 1940, Henry served in France as a liaison officer to [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]]. He performed military and diplomatic duties during the rest of the war, then in 1945 was appointed as Australia's governor-general at the request of Prime Minister [[John Curtin]]. The post had originally been offered to his younger brother, the [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]], who died in an air crash. Henry attended the coronation of his niece [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953 and carried out several overseas tours, often accompanied by his wife. From 1965, he became incapacitated by a number of strokes. Upon his death, he was succeeded as the [[Duke of Gloucester]] by his only living son, Richard. \n\nAt the time of his death, Prince Henry was the last surviving child of King George V and Queen Mary. His widow, who died at the age of 102, became the longest-lived member of the British royal family in history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Princejohnandfamily.jpg|thumb|left|The royal children in 1912: (Back row l-r) Albert, Henry and Edward. <br/>(Front row l-r) John, Mary and George]]\nPrince Henry was born on 31 March 1900, at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref name=odnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31220?docPos=2 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']</ref> His father was the Duke of York (later [[King George V]]), the eldest surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]).<ref name=odnb/> His mother was the Duchess of York (later [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), the only daughter of the [[Prince Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]].<ref name=odnb/> At the time of his birth, he was fifth in the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession to the throne]], behind his grandfather, father and two elder brothers.\n\nHe was baptised at the private chapel of [[Windsor Castle]] on 17 May 1900, by [[Randall Thomas Davidson]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], and his godparents were: Queen Victoria (his great-grandmother); the [[William II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] (his first cousin once removed, for whom [[Prince Albert of Prussia (1837\u20131906)|Prince Albert of Prussia]] stood proxy); [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Henry of Battenberg]] (his paternal great-aunt); the [[Princess Thyra of Denmark|Duchess of Cumberland]] (his paternal great-aunt, whose sister, his grandmother the Princess of Wales represented her); [[Prince George of Greece]] (his first cousin once removed, for whom Prince Henry's paternal grandfather the Prince of Wales stood proxy); [[Maud of Wales|Princess Carl of Denmark]] (his paternal aunt, for whom her sister [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria of Wales]] stood proxy); [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Prince Alexander of Teck]] (his maternal uncle, for whom Prince Henry's great-uncle the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] stood proxy); and Field Marshal The [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]] (for whom General Sir [[Dighton Probyn]] stood proxy).<ref name=\"Yvonne\">[http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings Yvonne's Royalty Home Page \u2013 Royal Christenings]</ref> He was informally known to his family as ''Harry''.<ref>http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50561785</ref>\n\n==Childhood and education==\n[[File:Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester circa 1916.jpg|thumb|left|At [[Eton College]] in 1916]]\nAs a young boy, Prince Henry suffered from ill health very much like his older brother [[George VI|Albert]]. He also had knocked knees, and had to wear painful leg splints. He was an extremely nervous child, and was often victim to spontaneous fits of crying or giggling, and also like his brother, Henry had a combination of speech disorders.<ref>Edwards, Anne {{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Anne |date=1984 |title=Matriarch |location= |publisher=William Morrow |isbn=0688035116 |page=195}} Matriarch</ref> They both had [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacism]], which prevented them from pronouncing the sound r, but while Albert's pronunciation was slightly reminiscent of the \"French r\", Henry was completely unable to pronounce it, causing the intended r to sound like [w]. On top of this, Henry also had a nasal lisp and an unusually high-pitched tone, resulting in a very distinctive voice.<ref>{{cite speech |title=Made on TV by Duke of Gloucester |url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/ITN/1960/04/29/VS290460005/?s=duke%20of%20gloucester |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy 1909, Henry's poor health had become a serious concern for his parents. He was very small for his age and was prone to get very aggressive colds. \"You must remember that he is rather fragile and must be treated differently to his two elder brothers who are more robust\", wrote Prince George to Henry's tutor, Henry Peter Hansell.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\">{{cite book |last=Van der Kiste |first=John |date=2003 |title=George V's children |location= |publisher=Sutton Publishing LTD |isbn=0750934689}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 May 1910, Prince George ascended the throne as George V, and Henry became the third in line to the throne. The King was persuaded by Hansell that it would be good for Henry's character to attend school, where he could interact with boys his age. The King, having previously rejected this proposition for his two elder sons, agreed on the basis that it would help him \"behave like a boy and not like a little child\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/> \nPrince Henry thus became the first son of a British monarch to attend school. After three days at [[St Peter's Court]] in [[Broadstairs]] as a day boy,  Hansell, noticing he liked it, asked the King to send him as a boarder, to which he agreed.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nHenry spent three years at St Peter's Court. Academically, he was not very bright, although he did show a particular aptitude in mathematics, Henry's sole interest became sports, particularly cricket and football. \"All you write about is your everlasting football of which I am heartily sick\", wrote his mother, answering a fully detailed letter from Henry about a match.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nIn September 1913, Henry started at [[Eton College]].<ref name=odnb/> During the [[First World War]], Crown Prince Leopold of [[Belgium]], later King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]], was a member of his [[House system|house]] (Mr Lubbock's<ref name=odnb/>). His studies did not improve, but his nerves and disposition did. He made friends through his enthusiasm for sports, and his masters were very pleased with him, noting in his report that he was \"thoroughly willing, cheerful, modest & obedient\". To his father, these values were the most important, having no time or interest in what he called \"intellectuals\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nBy the time he went up to [[Trinity College Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1919 with his brother Albert, Henry had outgrown all his brothers, both in height and size, and enjoyed very good health. Their stay at Cambridge lasted just one year and was very uneventful for both of them, as they were not allowed to live in college with the other undergraduates, due to their father's fear of their mixing with undesirable company.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\n==Military career==\nUnlike his brothers, Prince Henry joined the [[British Army|Army]] rather than the [[Royal Navy]]. He attended the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in 1919,<ref name=odnb/> and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] on 16 July 1919.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=31505 |date=14 August 1919 |page=10343 |supp=y |nolink=y}}</ref> On 16 July 1921 he was promoted to lieutenant in the [[10th Royal Hussars]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32392 |date=15 July 1921 |page=5702 |supp=y |nolink=y}}</ref><ref name=odnb/> with whom he continued to serve. Though he desired to serve in more active roles as a soldier, his position as a senior member of the royal family effectively ruled out any such options.

[[The Oval]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.cricketarchive.com/Magazine/1921/vol_i_no_17/files/mobile/index.html#10|title=The Cricketer Vol I No 17

[[Duke of Gloucester]], [[Earl of Ulster]], and [[Baron Culloden]], three titles that linked him with three parts of the United Kingdom, namely [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]] and

his regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars, or at least spend as much time in the army as possible. Although he was a capable soldier, as the King's son he was prevented from joining his regiment abroad, and this meant he was generally seen as an outsider to his fellow officers. To his increasing despair, he had to fulfill the many royal duties his father assigned him.<ref name=\"Royal Family: Years of Transition\">{{cite book |title=Royal Family: Years of Transition}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1928, Henry left England with his brother [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], to shoot big game in Africa. The brothers parted in [[Nairobi]], where Henry was to stay for a while. There, he was entertained by [[Mansfield Markham]] and his wife [[Beryl Markham]]. Beryl and Henry soon started an affair (though sources differ over when the affair started; many say it was not until her visit to England). In November, the brothers were recalled to England due to their father's worsening health, and soon after Beryl returned too. At the Grosvenor Hotel, close to [[Buckingham Palace]], the affair continued with Prince Henry openly hosting parties with her in her suite and drinking too much.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nThe affair, widely known by the London society, shocked the Queen, to the delight of the Prince of Wales who remarked that \u201cfor once, Queen Mary\u2019s blue-eyed boy was in trouble instead of himself\u201d. The King stepped in, thinking  that keeping Henry busy would be the best way to end the affair, as would keeping him from drinking too much, too often. That year, he arranged a series of tours for his son to undertake.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/> \n      \nIn 1929, he went to Japan to confer the [[Order of the Garter|Garter]] on the Emperor, and a year later he attended the [[coronation]] of [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] of [[Ethiopia]] in [[Addis Ababa]].<ref name=odnb/> In 1934 George V made him a [[Order of St Patrick|Knight of St Patrick]], Ireland's chivalric order. It was the second to last time this order was awarded (the last appointment being the Duke of York, later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], in 1936); at the time of his death, the Duke of Gloucester was the only remaining knight. In 1934, he went to Australia and New Zealand where the people received him with overwhelming enthusiasm that one journalist wrote, \"(amounted) to something very near adoration\".<ref name=\"Royal Family: Years of Transition\"/>\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Duke and Duchess of Gloucester with sons.jpg|thumb|The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester with their two sons William (standing) and Richard in Canberra]]\nWhen he returned from his trip to Japan in 1929, the affair with Markham ended. Her husband wanted a divorce and threatened to disclose Prince Henry's private letters to his wife if he did not \"take care of Beryl\". The Duke and Beryl never met again, although she did write to him when he visited Kenya in 1950 with his wife, but he didn't write back. Prince Henry's solicitors paid out an annuity until her death in 1985.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/> \n   \nAfter his tour of Australia and New Zealand, and pressured by his parents, Prince Henry decided it was time to settle down and proposed to [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott]], sister of one of Henry's best friends [[Lord William Montagu Douglas Scott]]. The proposal, wrote Lady Alice many years later, was not at all romantic as \"it was not his way\", instead he just \"mumbled it as we were on a walk one day\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |title=The Memoirs of Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester}}</ref>\nThey were married on 6 November 1935. The marriage was originally planned to take place at [[Westminster Abbey]], but was moved to the more modest Private Chapel at [[Buckingham Palace]] due to the death of Lady Alice's father, [[John Montagu Douglas Scott, 7th Duke of Buccleuch]], on 19 October 1935, barely a fortnight before the wedding.

He was born in [[Monken Hadley Common]], He died unmarried and without issue, killed in an airplane crash.\n* [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] (born 26 August 1944), He was born at St Matthew's Hospital in [[Northampton]], He married a Danish commoner, [[Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester|Birgitte van Deurs]], on 8 July 1972. The couple later had three children.\n\nThe couple lived first at the [[Royal Pavilion, Aldershot|Royal Pavilion]] in [[Aldershot]], near the barracks of the Duke's regiment. \"It was a very simple cabin\" recalled the Duchess of Gloucester, and \"the only royal thing about it was my husband's presence\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nAfter his father's death, the Duke bought [[Barnwell Manor]] with the larger part of his inheritance. It was a large country house in [[Northamptonshire]] which had belonged to his wife's ancestors. As their London seat, they were given [[York House, St. James's Palace|York House]] in [[St. James's Palace]].\n\n==Abdication of Edward VIII==\nIn December 1936, Henry's brother Edward VIII [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated the throne]] to marry divorc\u00e9e [[Wallis Simpson]]. His brother, Prince Albert, ascended the throne as [[King George VI]]. Although third in line to the throne, following his two nieces Princesses [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]], he became the first adult in line, meaning he would act as [[regency|regent]] if anything were to happen to the King before Princess Elizabeth came of age on 21 April 1944, her 18th birthday. Because of this, Prince Henry could not leave the UK at the same time as the King. Furthermore, he and his younger brother, the [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]], had to increase their royal engagements considerably to support the new King.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/>\n\nEdward VIII, who became Duke of Windsor after abdicating, recalled that it was Henry who reacted least to the news of his abdication. The brothers had never been close, and apart from horses, they had not much in common. But Edward did admit regretting the implications the abdication would have on \"The Unknown Soldier\", a nickname he teasingly used to refer to Henry, owing to his low profile.<ref>Bloch {{cite book |last= Bloch |first= Michael|date= 2012 |title= The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor |location= England |isbn= 978-0349001081}}</ref>\n\nThe abrupt change in Prince Henry's somewhat carefree life up to that point was made clear by the new King on the very first evening of his reign. \"If you two think that, now that I have taken this new job on, you can go on behaving just as you like, in the same old way, you are very much mistaken! You two have to pull yourselves together\", the King warned his two younger brothers at dinner.<ref>Cadbury {{cite book |last= Cadbury|first= Deborah|date= 2015 |title= Princes at War |location= England |isbn= 978-1610394031}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Duke of Gloucester supported his brother, and later his niece, tirelessly and dutifully, he had a fondness for whisky. On one occasion, Queen Mary wrote to the Duchess suggesting that if they were planning to visit, the Duke should bring his own supply of whisky, \"as we have not got much left, and it is so expensive\". Even [[Noble Frankland]], who wrote the Duke's biography after his death at the request and under the supervision of the Duchess, wrote that: \"He did not eschew a glass of whisky ... or the occasional blasphemous oath.\"<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, J\"/><ref>Frankland {{cite book |last= Frankland |first= Noble |date= 1975 |title= Prince Henry Duke of Gloucester |location= England |isbn= 029777705X}}</ref>\n\nKing George VI had great affection for his younger brother. Circumstances had made them closer following the abdication, and the King trusted Prince Henry with important matters, which he dutifully undertook. Sometimes, though, the organised King found his brother's less systematic manner irritating. On one occasion after a day of shooting at [[Balmoral Castle]], the King found a mistake on his shot-game record, where there seemed to be a pair of grouse missing. A member of staff suggested that the King call and ask the Duke of Gloucester, who was staying at [[Birkhall]]. When the Duke confirmed he had taken the birds, the King's gruff warning to his brother that he should never again take birds without telling him surprised the member of staff.<ref>\n{{cite book \n|last= Corbitt |first= Frederick John \n|date= 1956 \n|title= My Twenty Years in Buckingham Palace: a book of intimate memoirs\n|url= https://archive.org/details/mytwentyyearsinb007031mbp |publisher= David McKay Company Inc.\n|location= New York |isbn= 1258094002\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nAfter the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Duke of Gloucester, as Chief Liaison Officer to [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]], spent almost the entire first year of the war in France. Besides boosting the troops' morale, he was useful as a first-hand witness of the situation; he reported to government officials and to the King, to whom he continually wrote detailed and objective accounts of what was happening. Always eager to get involved, the Duke often found himself in dangerous situations, but did not seem overly worried. \"Motoring about is not nice as many villages are being bombed,\" he wrote to his wife in his usual straightforward and dismissive manner. The Duke's two narrowest escapes both came in May 1940.\n\nHaving known [[King Leopold III of Belgium]] from school days, the Duke wanted to meet him personally to offer support after rumours began circulating that Belgium would surrender to Germany. On 14 May, he and his brother-in-law, [[Lord William Montagu Douglas Scott|Lord William Scott]], drove from Hotel Univers in [[Arras]] into Belgium to see the King of the Belgians at a secret location. That night, Hotel Univers was bombed, resulting in several deaths, including those staying in the rooms next to the Duke's. The Duke wrote to his brother that King Leopold was \"very depressed\". As the Duke and Lord William Scott drove back, they were caught up in heavy enemy bombing in [[Tournai]], where their car caught fire. They managed to get out and dive into an alleyway, although not unscathed as the Duke needed medical attention for a profusely bleeding wound.<ref name=\"Cadbury\">Cadbury</ref>\n\nAlthough generally optimistic, Prince Henry did sometimes suffer from bouts of depression during his service in 1940, especially at the end of his occasional leaves. \"My beloved Alice, I did hate leaving you yesterday so very much that I could hardly keep a straight face\", he wrote to his wife after reporting back. The strains of living at the French front also diminished his resolve at times: \"I think I hate this country and war more than ever... it is such an awful waste of everything,\" he told the Duchess.<ref name=\"Cadbury\"/><ref>Aronson {{cite book |last=Aronson |first=Theo |date=2014 |title=The Royal Family at War |location=England |isbn=978-1910198032}}</ref>\n\nIn June, after the [[Battle of Dunkirk|fall of Dunkirk]], the Duke was ordered back to England by an embarrassed General Headquarters, which had not been able to assure the King's brother's safety. \"Wherever I went or had been, I was bombed\" the Duke explained to his mother, amused.<ref name=\"Cadbury\"/>\n\nIn early 1942 the King arranged a four-month-long military and diplomatic mission for the Duke to the Middle East, India, and East Africa.<ref>FO 954/5B/213, 30 March 1942, The National Archives, Kew, England</ref> The mission came just after Prince Henry had become a father for the first time, and it was considered a dangerous trip, as the Germans were rapidly advancing toward some of the territories the Duke would visit. The King even wrote to his sister-in-law that he would act as guardian of the newly-born Prince William if anything should happen to his brother.<ref name=\"Cadbury\"/><ref name=\"Aronson\">Aronson</ref>\n\nAfter Prince Henry's younger brother, the Duke of Kent, died in a plane crash in August 1942, it was decided that the Duke of Gloucester would not be sent on any further missions that could prove dangerous.<ref name=\"Aronson\"/>\n\n==Governor-General of Australia==\n[[File:King George VI and Queen Elizabeth with the Gloucesters.jpg|thumb|The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester are seen off on their departure for Australia by the [[George VI|King]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]], 1945]]\nIn late 1944 the Duke was unexpectedly appointed [[Governor-General of Australia]]<ref name=odnb/> after his younger brother, the [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]], who had been offered the position, died in an aeroplane crash in Scotland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/from-the-archives-the-crown-and-the-people-20200125-p53unu.html|title=From the Archives: The Crown and the people|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 January 2020|accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Duke had made a successful visit to Australia in 1934. Because the Duke was shy,<ref name=odnb/> he sometimes appeared stiff and formal, but he and the Duchess travelled widely in Australia using his own plane during their time in office. When Prime Minister Curtin died in 1945, the Duke appointed [[Frank Forde]] as prime minister.\n\nGloucester left Australia in March 1947, after two years in the post, due to the need to act as Senior [[Counsellor of State]] during a visit by King George VI and Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret to South Africa.<ref name=odnb/> As a parting gift, he left his own plane for use by the government and people of Australia.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Australia stamp Gloucesters 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Stamp of Australia, 1945, showing the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, when the Duke became Governor-General]]\nIn May 1949, May 1961, May 1962, and May 1963, the Duke served in the office of [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]] to the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], which temporarily afforded him [[Order of precedence in Scotland|precedence in Scotland]] immediately below the King and Queen.\n\nThe Duke attended the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation of his niece Elizabeth II]] in 1953. Both the Duke and Duchess carried out royal engagements, including several overseas tours.<ref name=odnb/> In 1954 the Duke served as the Treasurer of the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. He suffered a series of strokes in later years,<ref name=odnb/> and was too ill to attend the funeral of his elder brother, the Duke of Windsor in May or to attend the July wedding of his younger son, Prince Richard, in 1972.  \n\nHenry's first stroke was in 1965 while he and his wife, Alice, were returning from [[Sir Winston Churchill]]'s funeral ceremony in their vehicle which resulted in a car crash.<ref name=\"Independent-Alice\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/princess-alice-duchess-of-gloucester-31357.html|title=Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|newspaper=The Independent|date=1 November 2004|accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> This, together with later strokes, left him dependent on a wheelchair, and he was unable to speak in his last remaining years.<ref name=\"Independent-Alice\"/> His last public appearance was at the unveiling of Queen Mary's plaque at Marlborough House in 1967, where he appeared weak and considerably older than the Duke of Windsor.

The Duke's widow, [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Alice]], received permission from Queen Elizabeth II to be styled ''Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester'', to distinguish herself from Prince Richard's wife.
