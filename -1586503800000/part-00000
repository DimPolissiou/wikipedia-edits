The payloads, which include instruments to assess the composition of the lunar surface, test precision landing technologies, and evaluate the radiation on the Moon, are being delivered under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative as part of the agency's [[Artemis program]]. The US$75.9 million award includes end-to-end services for delivery of the instruments, including payload integration, launch from Earth, landing on the surface of the Moon, and operation for at least 12 days. Masten Space Systems will land these payloads on the Moon with its XL-1 lander. The payloads that will be delivered have been developed predominantly from the two recent NASA Provided Lunar Payloads (NPLP) and Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads (LSITP) solicitations.<ref name=\"NASA\">{{cite web|title=NASA Awards Contract to Deliver Science, Tech to Moon Ahead of Human Missions|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-deliver-science-tech-to-moon-ahead-of-human-missions|website=www.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=8 April 2020|accessdate=10 April 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===XL-1T===\nThe XT-1T is a (T)errestrial technology and process demonstrator for the XL-1 and XEUS.

Unlike the traditional NTO/MMH [[bipropellant]], the two propellant chemicals in MXP-351 are safer to handle because they are nontoxic. The bipropellant can also be stored at room temperatures, unlike liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The [[hypergolic propellant |hypergolic]] combination has an [[Specific impulse|ISP]] of 322 seconds. The storage life of MXP-351 before use is undergoing long term studies but is expected to be a few years.

The bipropellant can also be stored at room temperatures, unlike liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The [[hypergolic propellant |hypergolic]] combination has an [[Specific impulse|ISP]] of 322 seconds. The storage life of MXP-351 before use is undergoing long term studies but is expected to be a few years.

Their founder [[Babur]], a Timurid prince from the [[Fergana Valley]] (in modern [[Uzbekistan]]), was a direct descendant of [[Timur]] (generally known in western nations as Tamerlane) and also affiliated with [[Genghis Khan]] through Timur's marriage to a [[Genghisid]] princess. \n\nMany of the later Mughal emperors had significant [[Rajput| Indian Rajput]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] ancestry through marriage alliances as emperors were born to Rajput and Persian princesses.<ref>Jeroen Duindam (2015), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5ky2CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105 ''Dynasties: A Global History of Power, 1300\u20131800'', page 105], [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Malika|last=Mohammada|title=The Foundations of the Composite Culture in India|publisher=Akkar Books|date=January 1, 2007|pages=300|isbn=978-8-189-83318-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwzbYvQszf4C&pg=PA300}}</ref> [[Akbar]], for instance, was half-Persian (his mother was of Persian origin), [[Jahangir]] was half-Rajput and quarter-Persian, and [[Shah Jahan]] was three-quarters Rajput.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Mughals and their India|author=Dirk Collier|publisher=[[Hay House]]|year=2016|page=15|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=40ywDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT15|isbn=9789384544980}}</ref> \n\nDuring [[Aurangzeb]]'s Islamic [[sharia]] based government, the empire, as the world's largest economy, worth over 25% of world GDP, controlled nearly all of the Indian subcontinent, extending from [[Chittagong]] in the east to [[Kabul]] and [[Baluchistan]] in the west, [[Kashmir]] in the north to the [[Kaveri River]] basin in the south.<ref> \n{{cite book\n|last=Chandra\n|first=Satish\n|title=Medieval India: From Sultanate To The Mughals\n| page=202\n}}\n</ref> \n[[File:Mughal Genealogical Table.svg|thumb|right|Genealogy of the Mughal Dynasty.

Aurangzeb expanded the empire to include almost the whole of South Asia,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} but at his death in 1707, \"many parts of the empire were in open revolt\".<ref name=\"Berndl\"/> Aurangzeb's attempts to reconquer his family's ancestral lands in Central Asia were not successful while his successful conquest of the Deccan region proved to be a Pyrrhic victory that cost the empire heavily in both blood and treasure.<ref name=\"D'souza pages 3-30\">D'souza, Rohan \"Crisis before the Fall: Some Speculations on the Decline of the Ottomans, Safavids and Mughals\" pages 3\u201330 from ''Social Scientist'', Volume 30, Issue # 9/10, September\u2013October 2002 page 21.</ref>  A further problem for Aurangzeb was the army had always been based upon the land-owning aristocracy of northern India who provided the cavalry for the campaigns, and the empire had nothing equivalent to the [[Janissaries|Janissary]] corps of the Ottoman Empire.<ref>D'souza, Rohan \"Crisis before the Fall: Some Speculations on the Decline of the Ottomans, Safavids and Mughals\" pages 3\u201330 from ''Social Scientist'', Volume 30, Issue # 9/10, September\u2013October 2002 page 22.</ref> The long and costly conquest of the Deccan had badly dented the \"aura of success\" that surrounded Aurangzeb, and from the late 17th century onwards, the aristocracy become increasing unwilling to provide forces for the empire's wars as the prospect of being rewarded with land as a result of a successful war was seen as less and less likely.<ref>D'souza, Rohan \"Crisis before the Fall: Some Speculations on the Decline of the Ottomans, Safavids and Mughals\" pages 3\u201330 from ''Social Scientist'', Volume 30, Issue # 9/10, September\u2013October 2002 pages 22\u201323.</ref> Furthermore, the fact that at the conclusion of the conquest of the Deccan, Aurangzeb had very selectively rewarded some of the noble families with confiscated land in the Deccan had left those aristocrats who received no confiscated land as reward and for whom the conquest of the Deccan had cost dearly, feeling strongly disgruntled and unwilling to participate in further campaigns.<ref>D'souza, Rohan \"Crisis before the Fall: Some Speculations on the Decline of the Ottomans, Safavids and Mughals\" pages 3\u201330 from ''Social Scientist'', Volume 30, Issue # 9/10, September\u2013October 2002 pages 21\u201322.</ref> Aurangzeb's son, [[Bahadur Shah I|Shah Alam]], repealed the religious policies of his father, and attempted to reform the administration. \"However, after his death in 1712, the Mughal dynasty sank into chaos and violent feuds.

Mughal warfare had always been based upon heavy artillery for sieges, heavy cavalry for offensive operations and light cavalry for skirmishing and raids.<ref name=\"D'souza pages 3-30\"/> To control a region, the Mughals had always sought to occupy a strategic fortress in some region, which would serve as a nodal point from which the Mughal army would emerge to take on any enemy that challenged the empire.<ref name=\"D'souza pages 3-30\"/> This system was not only expensive, but also made the army somewhat inflexible as the assumption was always the enemy would retreat into a fortress to be besieged or would engage in a set-piece decisive battle of annihilation on open ground.<ref name=\"D'souza pages 3-30\"/> The Hindu Marathas were expert horsemen who refused to engage in set-piece battles, but rather engaged in campaigns of guerrilla warfare, a war of raids, ambushes and attacks upon the Mughal supply lines.<ref name=\"D'souza pages 3-30\"/> The Marathas were unable to take the Mughal fortresses via storm or formal siege as they lacked the artillery, but by constantly intercepting supply columns, they were able to starve Mughal fortresses into submission.<ref name=\"D'souza pages 3-30\"/> Successive Mughal commanders refused to adjust their tactics and develop an appropriate counter-insurgency strategy, which led to the Mughals losing more and more ground to the Maratha.<ref name=\"D'souza pages 3-30\"/> The [[Nader Shah's invasion of India|Indian campaign]] of [[Nader Shah]] of Persia culminated with the [[Sack of Delhi]] and shattered the remnants of Mughal power and prestige, as well as drastically accelerating its decline. Many of the empire's elites now sought to control their own affairs, and broke away to form independent kingdoms.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The Mughal Emperor, however, continued to be the highest manifestation of sovereignty. Not only the Muslim gentry, but the Maratha, Hindu, and Sikh leaders took part in ceremonial acknowledgements of the emperor as the sovereign of India.<ref name=\"MSA2\">{{Cite book\n| last1 = Bose\n| first1 = Sugata\n| author-link1 = Sugata Bose\n| last2 = Jalal\n| first2 = Ayesha\n| author-link2 = Ayesha Jalal\n| year = 2004\n| title = Modern South Asia: History, Culture, Political Economy\n| edition = 2nd\n| publisher = Routledge\n| page = 41\n| isbn = 978-0-203-71253-5\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the next decades, the [[Afghanistan|Afghans]], [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]], and [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] battled against each other and the Mughals, only to prove the fragmented state of the empire. The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] made futile attempts to reverse the Mughal decline, and ultimately had to seek the protection of outside powers. In 1784, the Marathas under [[Mahadji Scindia]] won acknowledgement as the protectors of the emperor in Delhi, a state of affairs that continued until after the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]]. Thereafter, the [[British East India Company]] became the protectors of the Mughal dynasty in Delhi.<ref name=\"MSA2\"/> After a crushed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]] which he nominally led in 1857\u201358, the last Mughal, [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]], was deposed by the British, who then assumed formal control of a large part of the former empire,<ref name=\"Berndl\"/> marking the start of the [[British Raj]].\n\n==List of Mughal Emperors==\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!
