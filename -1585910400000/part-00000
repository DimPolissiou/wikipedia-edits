His mother, Jane Nimmo, died when he was six years old.<ref name=\"Waterston\"/>\n\nBrown, who was descended from eminent [[Presbyterian]] clergy, was educated at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|Edinburgh High School]]. He graduated with an M. D. from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1833, and practised as a physician in the city. After qualifying, he was apprenticed to [[James Syme]]. Brown subsequently acquired a large medical practice in Edinburgh at a time when infectious diseases took a heavy toll of life.\n\nBrown was a sociable man: his house at 23 Rutland Street was the scene of many social gatherings. In 1840 he married Catherine Scott McKay. They had three children, a baby who died shortly after birth (a girl), a daughter, Helen, who was to marry Captain Alexander Laws, and a son \"Jock\" Brown. Helen Laws moved to Ireland and outlived her father. However, Jock was to survive into the 20th century and worked hard to pay tribute to his father, collecting all his letters, and working to erect a plaque on his house.<ref>http://openplaques.org/plaques/10725</ref> which remains to this day.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lettersdrjohnbr02mclagoog ''Letters of Dr John Brown''], edited by his son and U.W. Forrest, with biography by ET McLaren (1907).</ref> In 1847 Brown became a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]], and for a while was Honorary Librarian. He held strong views on the inappropriateness of examinations for evaluating student progress and was unimpressed by the view that scientific advances were in patients' best interests.\n\nBrown was the friend of many contemporaries, including [[Thackeray]] and [[Mark Twain]]. His reputation is based on the two volumes of essays, ''Horae Subsecivae'' (''Leisure Hours'') (1858, 1861), ''John Leech and Other Papers'' (1882), ''[[Rab and His Friends]]'' (1859), and ''Marjorie Fleming: a Sketch'' (1863) (generally called ''Pet Marjorie''). His first writing was in response to a request for contributions to the notices of paintings exhibited by the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]. The editor of the ''Scotsman'' newspaper then asked him to write regularly for the paper. He was 48 years old when he published ''Rab and His Friends''. His  writings were philosophical, [[Classical antiquity|classical]], [[artistic]], medical, of rural life, the [[Jacobite Rebellion]], notable characters, humble folk and canine friends. These were published as a collection in 1858 as ''Hor\u00e6 Subseciv\u00e6'', which ran to many editions. The first volume deals mainly with the equipment and duties of a physician, the second with subjects outside his profession.\n\nBrown was revered and beloved to uncommon degree, and he was the cherished friend of many distinguished contemporaries, including [[Thackeray]]. Among those whose writing he encouraged was [[Henrietta Keddie]], then a schoolgirl in Leith, who would become a prolific novelist and writer for children.<ref>[http://www.visitdunkeld.com/henrietta-keddie.html Henrietta Keddie (1827\u20131914) \u2013 Novelist]. visitdunkeld.com</ref> In the mingling of tenderness and delicate humour, Brown has much in common with Lamb; in his insight into dog-nature he is unique.

Traditionally, two meals were eaten per day, breakfast (''{{lang|ain|kunneywa ipe}}'') and dinner (''{{lang|ain|onuman ipe}}''), and a third meal, lunch (''{{lang|ain|tokes ipe}}''), was added during the [[Taisho period]]. A night meal (''{{lang|ain|kunne ipe}}'') was sometimes eaten during night fishing or other late activities.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|416}}\n\nFood was transferred from the cooking pot using a ladle (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'') into a lacquerware bowl (''{{lang|ain|itanki}}'') for eating. These bowls were obtained through trade with the ethnic Japanese and were large enough to hold 400 ml worth of food. Chunks of meat or fish that were too large to fit in the bowl were placed on mats woven from reeds.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}} Items such as fish roasted on a spit or ''{{lang|ain|sito}}'' were eaten by hand, but otherwise, most foods were eaten with chopsticks (''{{lang|ain|pasuy}}'') or spoons (''{{lang|ain|parapasuy}}''). ''{{lang|ain|Parapasuy}}'' translated literally means \u201cwide chopstick\u201d. Both spoons and chopsticks were carved from wood.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}\n\nWhen guests were over for food, the head woman of the house would offer food and say \u201c''{{lang|ain|ipeyan}}''\u201d (please eat). The guest would express their gratitude, and, if it were a valuable meal such as bear meat, they would raise the food to their forehead in thanks before beginning. However, the family would not say anything before eating if there were no guests. Once finished, it was customary to say \u201c''{{lang|ain|hunna}}''\u201d to express their gratitude for the food.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|412}}\n\nSimilar to the ethnic Japanese, it was considered polite to eat all food that was provided. Because of this, it was considered polite to use one's finger to wipe the remaining sauce from inside the bowl and lick it. This custom is the reason for the Ainu name for the pointer finger, \u201c''{{lang|ain|itanki kem atsukep}}''\u201d, literally meaning \u201cbowl-licking finger\u201d.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}<ref name=\"\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u306e\u6b74\u53f294\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kayano |first=Shigeru (\u8431\u91ce\u8302) |author-link=Shigeru Kayano |title=\u8431\u91ce\u8302\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 (Kayano Shigeru no ainu go jiten) |publisher=Sanseid\u014d |year=1996}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Batchelor |first=John |title=Ainu-English-Japanese Dictionary: (including A Grammar of the Ainu Language |place=London |publisher=Methodist Publishing House |year=1905 |url=https://archive.org/details/anainuenglishja00batcgoog}}\n*{{citation|last1=Batchelor |first1=John |last2=Miyabe |first2=Kingo |title=Ainu economic plants |journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan|year=1893 |volume=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA198 |pages=198\u2013240}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Japan|Food}}\n{{commons category|Ainu food}}\n*[http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng06.html Ainu Agriculture]\n*[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu2.html Origins of Ainu]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828185844/http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/english/english.html English site of the Ainu Museum]\n*[https://www.poronno.com/ Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Poron'no''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.sh.rim.or.jp/~moshiri/marukibune/rest.html Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Marukibune by Moshiri''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{cuisines}}\n\n[[Category:Ainu cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Culture articles needing translation from Japanese Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Cuisine by ethnicity]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{expand Japanese|\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6599\u7406|date=March 2013}}\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2012}}\n{{cleanup lang|date=May 2019}}\n}}\n[[File:Ainu ohaw.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ohaw]], traditional Ainu soup]]\n'''Ainu cuisine''' is the [[cuisine]] of the ethnic [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in [[Japan]].

There are no specific requirements of ingredients to use for ''{{lang|ain|ohaw}}'', but was generally made as described below.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\"/>{{rp|35\u201337}}\n# A stock is created by heating animal bone or small dried fish in water.\n# Roughly chopped meat or fish is added to the stock and cooked. Dried meat and fish require longer cooking times.

The soup is allowed to cook further until all ingredients are soft.\n# The soup is flavored with animal or fish fats, a small amount of salt, and topped with ground dried kelp or dried ''{{lang|ain|pukusa}}''.\n\nDifferent varieties of ''{{lang|ain|ohaw}}'' are named by their main ingredient such as ''{{lang|ain|cep ohaw}}'' (fish soup), ''{{lang|ain|kamuy ohaw}}'' (bear soup), ''{{lang|ain|kam ohaw}}'' (meat soup), and ''{{lang|ain|kina ohaw}}'' (vegetable soup). ''Anemone flaccida'' was particularly suited for use in soups and was therefore called ''{{lang|ain|ohaw kina}}'', which literally translates as \u201csoup grass\u201d.\n\n==={{lang|ain|Rataskep}}===\n\nTranslated literally, ''{{lang|ain|rataskep}}'' means \u201cmixed food\u201d.

Dried strips of pumpkin (''{{lang|ain|kabocha}}'') are rehydrated in water then boiled along with the beans. Once the pumpkin begins to break apart, the ''{{lang|ain|rataskep}}'' is seasoned with fish fats and salt and topped with berries from the Amur corktree (''{{lang|ain|sikerpe}}'').\n\n'''''{{lang|ain|Cipor rataskep}}'''''\n\n:Also called ''{{lang|ain|cipor imo}}''. Potatoes (''{{lang|ain|imo}}'') are boiled with skin on. Salmon roe (''{{lang|ain|cipor}}'') is placed in a separate pot and cooked over low heat until it starts to break down. The skin is removed from the cooked potatoes and they are sliced thickly before placing into the pot with the salmon roe. Salt is added and everything is mixed well.\n\n'''''{{lang|ain|Nisew rataskep}}'''''\n\n:The hull is removed from acorns (''{{lang|ain|nisew}}'') which are then boiled and drained multiple times with the seed coat on to remove the bitter taste. They are then placed in water with beans and boiled together. The resulting broth is discarded. The water is replaced and the mixture is boiled further until soft, at which point corn flour is added. It is cooked to the desired consistency. Rice flour is added, the mixture is kneaded, and salt and animal fats are added for seasoning.\n\n==={{lang|ain|Sayo}}===\n\nA thin porridge made from boiling Japanese millet or rice. Generally, the grains are boiled alone, but occasionally gathered vegetables are added. Unlike other porridges in agricultural societies, ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' is not a staple food. Rather, Ainu would fill up on fatty soups and grilled meats then drink it like tea as a palate cleanser.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\"/>{{rp|37\u201339}} For that reason, ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' was made in a small dedicated pot so as to avoid mixing oils in from other dishes. Care was also taken to avoid mixing flavors when serving by using a separate ladle specifically for serving ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' (''{{lang|ain|sayo kasup}}''), rather than the usual ladle for serving soup (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'').<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406\u2013420}} As the porridge used very little grains to make, a month's supply for one person was approximately 1.8 liters. 108 liters would provide plenty for a family of five for a year.<ref>{{cite book |last1=\u6797\u559c |first1=\u8302 |title=\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u306e\u8fb2\u8015\u6587\u5316 |date=1969 |publisher=\u6176\u53cb\u793e |page=158 |asin=B000J9W90Q}}</ref>\n\nThe following are examples of {{lang|ain|sayo}} varieties.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\"/>{{rp|37\u201339}}\n\n'''''{{lang|ain|Turep sayo}}'''''\n\n:''{{lang|ain|Sayo}}'' which contains ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'', the fermented remains from the process of making ''cardiocrinum cordatum'' (''{{lang|ain|turep}}'') starch.

Traditionally, two meals were eaten per day, breakfast (''{{lang|ain|kunneywa ipe}}'') and dinner (''{{lang|ain|onuman ipe}}''), and a third meal, lunch (''{{lang|ain|tokes ipe}}''), was added during the [[Taisho period]]. A night meal (''{{lang|ain|kunne ipe}}'') was sometimes eaten during night fishing or other late activities.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|416}}\n\nFood was transferred from the cooking pot using a ladle (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'') into a lacquerware bowl (''{{lang|ain|itanki}}'') for eating. These bowls were obtained through trade with the ethnic Japanese and were large enough to hold 400 ml worth of food. Chunks of meat or fish that were too large to fit in the bowl were placed on mats woven from reeds.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}} Items such as fish roasted on a spit or ''{{lang|ain|sito}}'' were eaten by hand, but otherwise, most foods were eaten with chopsticks (''{{lang|ain|pasuy}}'') or spoons (''{{lang|ain|parapasuy}}''). ''{{lang|ain|Parapasuy}}'' translated literally means \u201cwide chopstick\u201d. Both spoons and chopsticks were carved from wood.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}\n\nWhen guests were over for food, the head woman of the house would offer food and say \u201c''{{lang|ain|ipeyan}}''\u201d (please eat). The guest would express their gratitude, and, if it were a valuable meal such as bear meat, they would raise the food to their forehead in thanks before beginning. However, the family would not say anything before eating if there were no guests. Once finished, it was customary to say \u201c''{{lang|ain|hunna}}''\u201d to express their gratitude for the food.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|412}}\n\nSimilar to the ethnic Japanese, it was considered polite to eat all food that was provided. Because of this, it was considered polite to use one's finger to wipe the remaining sauce from inside the bowl and lick it. This custom is the reason for the Ainu name for the pointer finger, \u201c''{{lang|ain|itanki kem atsukep}}''\u201d, literally meaning \u201cbowl-licking finger\u201d.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}<ref name=\"\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u306e\u6b74\u53f294\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kayano |first=Shigeru (\u8431\u91ce\u8302) |author-link=Shigeru Kayano |title=\u8431\u91ce\u8302\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 (Kayano Shigeru no ainu go jiten) |publisher=Sanseid\u014d |year=1996}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Batchelor |first=John |title=Ainu-English-Japanese Dictionary: (including A Grammar of the Ainu Language |place=London |publisher=Methodist Publishing House |year=1905 |url=https://archive.org/details/anainuenglishja00batcgoog}}\n*{{citation|last1=Batchelor |first1=John |last2=Miyabe |first2=Kingo |title=Ainu economic plants |journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan|year=1893 |volume=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA198 |pages=198\u2013240}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Japan|Food}}\n{{commons category|Ainu food}}\n*[http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng06.html Ainu Agriculture]\n*[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu2.html Origins of Ainu]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828185844/http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/english/english.html English site of the Ainu Museum]\n*[https://www.poronno.com/ Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Poron'no''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.sh.rim.or.jp/~moshiri/marukibune/rest.html Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Marukibune by Moshiri''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{cuisines}}\n\n[[Category:Ainu cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Culture articles needing translation from Japanese Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Cuisine by ethnicity]]\n", "name_user": "Erynamrod", "label": "safe", "comment": "Consolidating references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_cuisine"}
