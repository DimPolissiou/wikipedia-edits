The move provoked hostility: the Salamancans revolted in 1162<ref>Such urban revolts were not uncommon in Le\u00f3n, cf. [[Mutiny of the Trout]].</ref> and Portugal, threatened by a new royal fortress so near its border, invaded in 1163.<ref name=Fletcher>[[Richard A.

On 13 February Ferdinand issued a charter (called the ''fuero eclesi\u00e1stico'') for the new diocese, in which he gave the metropolitan [[Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela]] full authority to appoint the bishop without reference to the cathedral chapter. The king did not consult the pope, [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]], who showed he was displeased by the ''fuero'' in a bull of 1175. By that time it may have even been allowed to lapse, since a further royal charter of 20 September 1168 does not mention the special provision of 1161. It is uncertain how the first bishop, Domingo, came into his office, or even when. He is not recorded in any document before 1168 and he was dead by 1172 or 1173.<ref name=Fletcher/> Of the early bishops, only [[Pedro de Ponte]] is well known. Mart\u00edn (1190\u20131211) and Lombardo (1214\u201327) are known only from the witness lists of royal charters and from Mart\u00edn's stint as a [[papal judge-delegate]].<ref>Fletcher, ''Episcopate'', 36\u201337. He notes that Lombardo may have been the archdeacon of Medina and Alba in the diocese of Salamanca before becoming bishop.</ref>\n\nThe [[Almohads]] attacked the city (''Alsibdat'' in Arabic sources) in 1174, the same year that a dispute over the boundary between the diocese of Ciudad Rodrigo and [[Diocese of Salamanca|that of Salamanca]] was settled.

On 13 February Ferdinand issued a charter (called the ''fuero eclesi\u00e1stico'') for the new diocese, in which he gave the metropolitan [[Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela]] full authority to appoint the bishop without reference to the cathedral chapter. The king did not consult the pope, [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]], who showed he was displeased by the ''fuero'' in a bull of 1175. By that time it may have even been allowed to lapse, since a further royal charter of 20 September 1168 does not mention the special provision of 1161. It is uncertain how the first bishop, Domingo, came into his office, or even when. He is not recorded in any document before 1168 and he was dead by 1172 or 1173.<ref name=Fletcher/> Of the early bishops, only [[Pedro de Ponte]] is well known. Mart\u00edn (1190\u20131211) and Lombardo (1214\u201327) are known only from the witness lists of royal charters and from Mart\u00edn's stint as a [[papal judge-delegate]].<ref>Fletcher, ''Episcopate'', 36\u201337.

The \"Europe\" theme was pursued further with the opening of \"Holland\" (1984), \"England\" (1988), \"France\" (1990), \"Scandinavia\" (1992) and \"Spain\" (1994) sections.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nVisitor count passed the 2 million mark in 1991.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The development of the hotel resort began in 1995 with ''El Andaluz'', followed by ''Castillo Alcazar'' in 1999.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nBy the year 2000, the number of visitors had risen to 3 million, and the hotels had been booked to nearly 98% of their capacity.

Shortly thereafter, the fire spread throughout neighboring areas, and eventually, the entire park was evacuated. Despite the efforts of the fire department, the complex was destroyed, along with parts of the neighboring Scandinavian section. The adjacent fjord rafting ride was affected by debris from burned-down wooden facades because part of its canal runs along the hall complex and the damaged part of the Scandinavian themed area. According to the operators, the incident resulted in tens of millions in property damage. No visitors and employees were injured, while seven firefighters suffered minor injuries during firefighting operations. With the exception of a few hot spots, the fire was mostly extinguished and the park reopened regularly the very next morning. Only the destroyed attractions, restaurants, show stages and shops, the affected fjord rafting, as well as the neighboring attraction \"Koffiekopjes\" remained closed for the time being.\n\nInitially closed was also \"Vindjammer\", the giant swinging ship ride, since one of the two entrance lines runs across the fire-destroyed Scandinavian-themed area. After closing this entrance and making adjustments to the other one, the ride was nevertheless in operation again, shortly after the park opened the next day. The attraction \"Koffiekopjes\" reopened four days later. The park reopened the Fjord-Rafting ride in the Scandinavian section on the 9th June 2018, which happened after the collection of evidence to determine the cause of fire was finished and the canal was freed from rubble. A warehouse near \"The Pirates of Batavia\" attraction was suspected at first to be the location where the fire broke out.\n\nAccording to the current state of the investigation, on the 6th of June 2018, [[Offenburg]] police believe that the fire broke out due to a technical failure in the fjord rafting area. However, the investigation is still ongoing. The Scandinavian village and the Pirates in Batavia will be both rebuilt as close to the original as possible, taking into account current terms and regulations as well as the use of more modern technology (e.g. electromechanical instead of pneumatic animatronics). The Scandinavian village reopened in July 2019 and the theme ride Pirates in Batavia is scheduled to follow in 2020.\n\n==Accommodation and transportation==\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:Einschienenbahn (Monorail) im Europa-Park.JPG|thumb|The monorail]]\nAmong other features, in 1995 the park installed a [[monorail]] system, the EP-Express, with three monorail trains reassigned after the [[World Expo 88|1988 World Expo in Brisbane]]. It was partially extended in 2016 in order to provide additional space for development in 2017.\n\nAmong the other systems of transportation are the Monorail, another monorail system since 1990, and the Panoramabahn, a miniature train ride.\n\n=== Europa-Park Resort ===\nEuropa-Park is home to six resort hotels. For guests on a lower budget, the resort also has a large Camp Resort, where guests can stay in a Tipi, Chuck Wagon or Log Cabin provided they bring their own sleeping bag. Camping and caravaning is also provided for, next to the Camp Resort.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n====Hotels====\n*Hotel Colosseo (four star superior), themed around the Roman Colosseum and features a fountain show created by French company Aquatique Show International\n*Hotel Santa Isabel (four star superior), themed around a Portuguese Monastery\n*Hotel El Andaluz (four stars), themed as a Spanish Villa\n*Hotel Castillo Alcazar (four stars), themed as a Spanish Finca\n*Hotel Bell Rock (four star superior), themed around New England and features a lighthouse\n*Hotel KR\u00d8NAS\u00c5R (four star superior), themed as a natural history museum the museum shows unique and historical objects collected by the \"Adventure Club of Europe\"\n<gallery>\nFile:ENTRANCE EL ANDALUZ.jpg|El Andaluz\nFile:ENTRANCE AL CANZAR.jpg|Alcazar\nFile:Colosseo.jpg|Colosseo\n</gallery>\n\n====Features====\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\n*Guesthouse Circus Rolando (Closed as of 2016)\n*Europa-Park Camp Resort and Tipi Village\n*Santa Isabel Wellness and Spa\n*Colosseo Wellness and Spa\n*Boston Red Socks Fitness and Spa\n*Europa-Park Golf (Located 15 minutes away by car)\n*Magic Cinema 4D\n*Confertainment Facilities\n*Europa-Park Dome\n\n=== On-Site Transportation ===\n\nThere are three different railway systems which also double as rides. The E.P. Express, the Monorail train, and the Panoramabahn. Additionally, another station was installed in 2015 onto the parking lot called Express Lane. \n\n==== Panoramabahn ====\n\nThe Panoramabahn has been installed since the opening of the park in 1975.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/panorama-train-station-germany</ref> At first, it served as a sightseeing train which departed and arrived near the entrance of the park in Germany. Today the train also stops at train stations in England, Spain, and Russia. The Europa-Park owns five type C. P. Huntington trains manufactured by the US-American company Chance Morgan. \n\n==== Monorail ====\n\nThe monorail was put into operation in 1990 and was originally intended for sightseeing only, with its starting and finishing point inside the Historama in Luxembourg.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/monorail</ref> In 2009, the monorail was extended by an additional stop in Iceland allowing passengers to use it as a means of transportation.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/monorail-station-iceland</ref>\n\n==== E.P. Express ====\n\nThe E.P. Express was built by AEG and Roll and has always been intended for transportation purposes besides its function as a panorama railway. It is a monorail modelled after a type of Alweg-monorail with closed, air-conditioned carriages, and it reaches a maximum speed of 20 km/h on a 2,5 km circuit at an average height of 6 meters.\nInaugurated together with the Hotel 'El Andaluz' in 1995, one of the purposes of the E.P. Express of the Europa-Park was to connect the hotel to the main entrance. Over the course of time, the stops 'Greece' and 'Europa-Park Hotel Resort' were added to the existing 'Alexanderplatz' (main entrance) and 'Spain' stations.\n\n==Events==\n{{See also|Euro Dance Festival}}\n[[File:Dance dome.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Euro Dance Festival]] in 2007]]\n[[Euro Dance Festival]], located annually at Europa-Park since 2007, is best known for its wide range of music and dancing styles. These are [[Ballroom Dance]], [[Argentine Tango]], [[Swing Dance]], [[Hip Hop]] and [[Breakdance]]. A combination of dancing classes and shows and a trade fair caters for the needs of both beginners and professionals including dance instructors and choreographers. Since its foundation it has taken place for four days every year in early spring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euro-dance-festival.com/|title=Euro Dance Festival im Europa Park|first=Marc|last=Tr\u00f6ndle|website=Euro Dance Festival}}</ref>\n\nEuropa-Park host dozens of events throughout the summer season. The biggest of these include the Midsummer Party, when the theme park hosts a fireworks display and is open until midnight. Horror Nights takes place through October evenings and features a range of halloween horror mazes, rides and shows. For the last week of the main season, the park hosts a daily firework show and music production.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==== Euro Dance Festival ====\n\nEvery February, when the amusement park is closed during the winter break, the Euro Dance Festival takes place. Dance enthusiasts from all over the world gather at the park to learn new steps and techniques in over 200 workshops taught by some of the best and most well-known international dancers.<ref>https://www.euro-dance-festival.com/</ref> Amongst others, star guests like [[Detlef_Soost|Detlef D! Soost]], William Pino, Alessandra Bucharelli, [[Isabel Edvardsson]], Franco Formica, Oliver Wessel-Therhorn, Kristina & Peter Stokkebroe, Luis Vasquez & Melissa Fernandez have taught there already.\n\n==== Ladies Only Festival ====\n\nThe Ladies Only Festival takes place on one weekend between the months of January and March, when the park is closed for a winter break. On this occasion, the festival connects elements of fitness, dance, health, beauty and wellness. More than 200 workshops and seminars held by roughly 80 coaches are spread out over four days.\n\n==== Miss Germany Pageant ====\n\nSince 2002, the official election of Miss Germany has taken place every February in the Europa-Park Dome, arranged by the Miss Germany Corporation from Oldenburg. The collaboration was so successful that in 2010 it was extended for another decade.\n\n==== Dinner Theater ====\n\nThe Europa-Park offers a variety of dinner events on several nights of the year after the amusement park closes. There are several different events you can choose from. For example the Dinner Show<ref>https://dinnershow.europapark.de/de/</ref>, the Baden Medieval Banquet<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/events/baden-medieval-banquet</ref> as well as the Dinner & Movie<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/events/dinner-movie</ref>.\n\n==== Science Days ====\n\nFor several days every May and October, the park offers Science Days for younger and older schoolchildren, respectively. The Science Days are the oldest science festival in Germany, featuring science talks and shows, as well as exhibitors from the industrial sector, schools, hospitals, and universities.\n\n==== CloudFest ====\nFormerly known as WebHostingDays, CloudFest is an annual conference in March about [[cloud computing]] aimed at [[Business|commercial organizations]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cloudfest.com/|title=CloudFest 2020: The world\u2019s #1 cloud computing conference|website=CloudFest|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> CloudFest 2020 was cancelled due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303123342/https://www.cloudfest.com/|title=CloudFest 2020: The world\u2019s #1 cloud computing conference|date=2020-03-03|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\n== Halloween ==\n\nEuropa-Park has been celebrating Halloween since 1998. Every year from the end of September until the beginning of November, visitors find themselves in a creepy environment, surrounded by hay bales, corn stalks, skeletons, and countless pumpkins of all colours. Numerous attractions, shows, and food and beverage facilities adopt a Halloween theme every year,<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows-events/top-entertainment-every-season/halloween-europa-park</ref> as does the daily parade.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows/europa-park-halloween-parade</ref> In the 2014 season, Europa-Park premiered their independently-produced Halloween musical, \"Spook Me!\"\n\n==== Horror Nights ====\n\nBetween 2007 \u2013 2011, the park's Terenzi Horror Nights were organised in the month of October in cooperation with [[Marc Terenzi]]. Visitors were able go on night-time walks through the Italian and French themed areas in 2007 \u2013 2008 and through the Greek and Swiss themed areas in 2009, where they would be chased and spooked by actors dressed as various horror-themed monsters such as zombies. The event was again included in Europa-Park's yearly program between 2010 and 2016, billed as Horror Nights starring Marc Terenzi. Between 2013 and 2015 it was simply called Horror Nights, as it took place without Marc Terenzi during that period.\n\n==== Traumatica ====\n\nIn 2017, the Horror Nights were replaced by the Traumatica event<ref>https://traumatica.com/en/</ref>. It takes place in the evenings, partly in the Greek-themed area and partly outside of the theme park's territory. Visitors are taken into a post-apocalyptic world in which five different groups fight for dominance. The group members are played by live actors and are set up in haunted houses with special effects as their main quarters, which can be attended by visitors.\n\n==== Tortuga - Vergessene Piraten ====\n\nTortuga - Vergessene Piraten (''English: Forgotten Pirates'') took place in the Greek-themed area in 2006, and in the Scandinavian-themed area from 2007 to 2011. Visitors would walk through dark alleys and get scared by pirates, which ensured heart-stopping moments. The Spanish name Tortuga designates [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Haiti's second largest island]] which was a focal point for pirates in the years 1640 to 1670. The maze only took place in the weeks around Halloween.\n\n==== The Villa ====\n\nAfter the horror maze Tortuga - Vergessene Piraten was cancelled, The Villa put the fear of God into visitors in 2012 and 2013. Numerous horror actors and special effects awaited the visitors in the horror maze that was situated in a 19th century style, Victorian dream house.\n\n==== Tenem's Revenge ====\n\nIn the years 2015-2016 the daytime maze Tenems Rache (''English: Tenem\u2019s Revenge'') was located below the waiting area of the Poseidon. Visitors had to navigate through a horror mansion and its dark corridors, where boos crews were creeping through lighting and fog effects. The design of the house was inspired by Egyptian burial chambers.\n\n==== Halloween Festival Mysteria ====\n\nEvery other year from 2011 through 2016, the park's festival grounds were home to the Halloween show Mysteria, offering live music, artistic performances, pyrotechnics, and lighting effects. During off years, 30-minute concerts by the Swiss DJ BoBo took the place of the show. Starting in 2011, the show was set in a ghostly castle, with the title Mysteria: Castillo Mystico. In 2013, the park introduced an entirely new story revolving around two enemy gangs in a shantytown on the outskirts of the city.\n\n==== Hellfire Fountains ====\n\nIn 2017, the show was replaced by the fountain and fire show Hellfire Fountains, offered multiple times every evening in the last week of the season.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows/hellfire-fountains</ref>\n\n==Seasonal Hours of Operation==\nDuring the main summer season, the park opens at 9:00&nbsp;am and closes from 6:00&nbsp;pm. Closing time is extended by up to 3 1/2 hours, depending on how busy the park is. This is usually the case on weekends and holiday periods. The park opens selected rides 30 minutes early for hotel guests.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn 2001, Europa-Park opened for its first winter season. That year, approximately 180,000 visitors attended during the winter; as of 2012, that number had grown to 500,000.<ref>https://www.badische-zeitung.de/rust/europa-park-beendet-wintersaison-mit-rekordzahlen--54439283.html</ref> The park celebrates the winter in style \u2013 offering an ice rink, a [[Skibobbing|skibob]] track, the Big Wheel Bellevue<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/big-wheel-bellevue</ref> and festive decor.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows-events/top-entertainment-every-season/winter-europa-park</ref> The park is also home to an annual Christmas market.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/historic-christmas-market</ref> Since 2002, the park hosts an annual Weihnachtsmann-Treffen (''English: Santa Claus Convention''). Visitors who enter the park wearing a Santa Claus costume can purchase their tickets at a discount.<ref>https://www.parkerlebnis.de/europa-park-weihnachtsmann-treffen-2016_35040.html</ref>\n\nDuring the winter, most outdoor and/or water rides are closed: the African Queen, Atlantica SuperSplash, Fjord-Rafting, Poseidon and the cable ferry.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows-events/top-entertainment-every-season/winter-europa-park</ref> Both the Blue Fire Megacoaster and Silver Star are only in service if the weather allows.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/blue-fire-megacoaster-powered-gazprom</ref><ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/silver-star</ref> The park opens at 11:00&nbsp;am and closes at 7:00&nbsp;pm and opens selected rides 1 hour early for hotel guests. Although the park does extend closing time if it's busy, this doesn't happen as often in the winter seasons, partly due to low temperatures in the evening. In the winter season 2019/20, the park will reopen the once-destroyed attraction Pirates of Batavia, now resurrected as Batavia of Ice.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/batavia-ice</ref>\n\n==Themed areas==\n\n=== Adventureland ===\n* African Queen \u2013 A boat ride around the lake.\n* Jungle Rafts \u2013 A tow boat / dark ride through an African settlement.\n* Water Playground\n\n=== Austria ===\n* Alpenexpress Coastiality\n* Alpenexpress Enzian \u2013 [[Powered roller coaster]] which is themed like a [[mine train roller coaster]] and, after a brief encounter with some hungry bears, includes a trip inside the World of Diamonds (which can also be viewed by foot).

Europa-Park is located in [[Rust, Germany|Rust]], in south-western Germany, between [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] and [[Strasbourg]] (in neighboring France).\n\nThe park is home to 13 [[roller coaster]]s, the oldest being Alpenexpress Enzian, a powered coaster that speeds through a diamond mine, and the newest coaster being the Ba-a-a Express, a small kiddie roller coaster. Europa-Park has very high capacity roller coasters and attractions meaning the park can accommodate approximately 60,000 guests per day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eturbonews.com/186116/europa-park-evacuated-after-huge-fire-engulfs-2nd-most-visited-european-theme-park|title=Europa-Park evacuated after huge fire engulfs Europe's 2nd busiest theme park|last=Editor|first=Chief Assignment|date=26 May 2018|website=Travel News {{!}} eTurboNews|language=en-US|access-date=8 December 2018}}</ref> It counted 5.7 million visitors in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/europa-amusement-park-fire-evacuated-visitors-rust-germany-a8371811.html|title=Fire rips through Germany's largest amusement park as 25,000 people are evacuated|work=The Independent|access-date=28 November 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> It is also the location of the [[Euro Dance Festival]].\n\nSince 2014, Europa-Park has been named the world's best amusement park by the [[Golden Ticket Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World's best amusement park 2019 is in Germany and themed around Europe|language=en|date=10 September 2019|website=Relaxnews|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/worlds-best-amusement-park-2019-is-in-germany-and-themed-around-europe/ar-AAH56US?ocid=spartanntp}}</ref> In November 2019, Europa-Park's [[Rulantica]] water park opened, along with a new themed hotel \"Kr\u00f8nas\u00e5r\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Background and founding===\n{{See also|Mack Rides}}\n[[File:Europa-Park - Entr\u00e9e du parc (02).JPG|thumb|260px|The entrance to Europa-Park]]\nEuropa-Park is run by the Mack family, which have produced vehicles since 1780, circus wagons since 1880 and rollercoasters since 1921. \nFranz Mack (1921\u20132010) in 1958 took over the family firm, '' Mack GmbH & Co'' (now ''[[Mack Rides]]''), together with his brothers. Together with his son Roland (b. 1949) he visited the US in 1972 and was inspired to open a theme park in Germany, as an exhibition site for his company's products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/reise/article8320964/Warum-der-Europa-Park-Rust-anfangs-belaechelt-wurde.html|title=Freizeitpark: Warum der Europa-Park Rust anfangs bel\u00e4chelt wurde|last=Ruf|first=J\u00fcrgen|date=9 July 2010|access-date=3 February 2019}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAt first the park was planned to be located in [[Breisach]].  It was named \"Europa-Park\" after Breisach's nearby ''Europaweiher'', a small artificial lake which commemorates a historical pilot poll in Breisach held in 1950, in which 95.6% of voters were in favour of [[European unification]]. The Breisach site was deemed unsuitable because of flooding hazard, and the project was moved some {{convert|30|km}} further north, where the Macks bought the park of the historical ''Balthasar'' castle in Rust.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe park opened in 1975 with an area of {{convert|16|ha}}. It counted 250,000 visitors in the first year, 700,000 in the second, passing the million mark in 1978.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Themed areas and growth (1980s\u20132012)===\n[[File:Europapark Rust.JL.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Overview of the park, showing themed areas such as ''Griechenland''.]]\nThe first country-themed section was \"Italy\", opened 1982. Like most of the original themed areas at Europa-Park, it was designed by Ulrich Damrau. The ''Alpenexpress \"Enzian\"'' and ''Schweizer Bobbahn'' rides opened in 1984 and 1985, respectively. The \"Europe\" theme was pursued further with the opening of \"Holland\" (1984), \"England\" (1988), \"France\" (1990), \"Scandinavia\" (1992) and \"Spain\" (1994) sections.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nVisitor count passed the 2 million mark in 1991.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The development of the hotel resort began in 1995 with ''El Andaluz'', followed by ''Castillo Alcazar'' in 1999.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nBy the year 2000, the number of visitors had risen to 3 million, and the hotels had been booked to nearly 98% of their capacity. The park opened during the winter season for the first time in 2001/2. The current logo was registered in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/303155973/DE|title=DPMAregister &#124; Marken - Registerauskunft|website=register.dpma.de}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, there were 4.5&nbsp;million visitors, and by 2012 the park encompassed an area of 90 hectares, featuring eleven roller-coasters, five themed hotels with a turnover of close to EUR 300 million and more than 3,000 employees.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 2012, Roland Mack announced investments in excess of EUR 60 million, the largest yearly investment in the park's history.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.news.de/vermischtes/855288586/europa-park-investiert-mehr-als-60-millionen-euro/1/ |title=news.de |access-date=22 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331042504/http://www.news.de/vermischtes/855288586/europa-park-investiert-mehr-als-60-millionen-euro/1/ |archive-date=31 March 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The total sum invested in the park is estimated at close to EUR 700 million.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n=== 2013-Present ===\n[[File:Euromaus.JPG|thumb|200px|Ed Euromaus, the park mascot developed by MackMedia, had 4D films based on his character in 2011 and 2015.]]\n\nOn 3 June 2017, Europa-Park opened the 'Voletarium' attraction. The attraction is the biggest [[flight]] [[motion simulator]] theater in Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} It features a queue line with multiple pre-show elements culminating in the main ride section: a film showcasing European landmarks which lasts for 5 minutes.

There will be 25 water attractions, including 17 water slides. Other attractions include a wave pool, a surf simulator (probably on a static wave) and a wild river. There is an indoor part of {{cvt|32600|m2}} and an outdoor part of {{cvt|8000|m2}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.europapark.de/en/rulantica/rulantica-new-europa-park-water-world|title=The Europa-Park Water World|website=www.europapark.de}}</ref>\n\n==== 2018 Fire Incident ====\nOn 26 May 2018, a fire broke out in the indoor complex between the park's Dutch and Scandinavian sections, and the complex, home to the attraction \"The Pirates of Batavia,\" a theater, a restaurant, and an employee costume shop, was vacated. Shortly thereafter, the fire spread throughout neighboring areas, and eventually, the entire park was evacuated. Despite the efforts of the fire department, the complex was destroyed, along with parts of the neighboring Scandinavian section. The adjacent fjord rafting ride was affected by debris from burned-down wooden facades because part of its canal runs along the hall complex and the damaged part of the Scandinavian themed area. According to the operators, the incident resulted in tens of millions in property damage. No visitors and employees were injured, while seven firefighters suffered minor injuries during firefighting operations. With the exception of a few hot spots, the fire was mostly extinguished and the park reopened regularly the very next morning. Only the destroyed attractions, restaurants, show stages and shops, the affected fjord rafting, as well as the neighboring attraction \"Koffiekopjes\" remained closed for the time being.\n\nInitially closed was also \"Vindjammer\", the giant swinging ship ride, since one of the two entrance lines runs across the fire-destroyed Scandinavian-themed area. After closing this entrance and making adjustments to the other one, the ride was nevertheless in operation again, shortly after the park opened the next day. The attraction \"Koffiekopjes\" reopened four days later. The park reopened the Fjord-Rafting ride in the Scandinavian section on the 9th June 2018, which happened after the collection of evidence to determine the cause of fire was finished and the canal was freed from rubble. A warehouse near the \"The Pirates of Batavia\" attraction was suspected at first to be the location where the fire broke out.\n\nAccording to the current state of the investigation, on the 6th of June 2018, [[Offenburg]] police believe that the fire broke out due to a technical failure in the fjord rafting area. However, the investigation is still ongoing. The Scandinavian village and the Pirates in Batavia will be both rebuilt as close to the original as possible, taking into account current terms and regulations as well as the use of more modern technology (e.g. electromechanical instead of pneumatic animatronics). The Scandinavian village reopened in July 2019 and the theme ride Pirates in Batavia is scheduled to follow in 2020.\n\n==Accommodation and transportation==\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:Einschienenbahn (Monorail) im Europa-Park.JPG|thumb|The monorail]]\nAmong other features, in 1995 the park installed a [[monorail]] system, the EP-Express, with three monorail trains reassigned after the [[World Expo 88|1988 World Expo in Brisbane]]. It was partially extended in 2016 in order to provide additional space for development in 2017.\n\nAmong the other systems of transportation are the Monorail, another monorail system since 1990, and the Panoramabahn, a miniature train ride.\n\n=== Europa-Park Resort ===\nEuropa-Park is home to six resort hotels. For guests on a lower budget, the resort also has a large Camp Resort, where guests can stay in a Tipi, Chuck Wagon or Log Cabin provided they bring their own sleeping bag. Camping and caravaning is also provided for, next to the Camp Resort.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n====Hotels====\n*Hotel Colosseo (four star superior), themed around the Roman Colosseum and features a fountain show created by French company Aquatique Show International\n*Hotel Santa Isabel (four star superior), themed around a Portuguese Monastery\n*Hotel El Andaluz (four stars), themed as a Spanish Villa\n*Hotel Castillo Alcazar (four stars), themed as a Spanish Finca\n*Hotel Bell Rock (four star superior), themed around New England and features a lighthouse\n*Hotel KR\u00d8NAS\u00c5R (four star superior), themed as a natural history museum the museum shows unique and historical objects collected by the \"Adventure Club of Europe\"\n<gallery>\nFile:ENTRANCE EL ANDALUZ.jpg|El Andaluz\nFile:ENTRANCE AL CANZAR.jpg|Alcazar\nFile:Colosseo.jpg|Colosseo\n</gallery>\n\n====Features====\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\n*Guesthouse Circus Rolando (Closed as of 2016)\n*Europa-Park Camp Resort and Tipi Village\n*Santa Isabel Wellness and Spa\n*Colosseo Wellness and Spa\n*Boston Red Socks Fitness and Spa\n*Europa-Park Golf (Located 15 minutes away by car)\n*Magic Cinema 4D\n*Confertainment Facilities\n*Europa-Park Dome\n\n=== On-Site Transportation ===\n\nThere are three different railway systems which also double as rides. The E.P. Express, the Monorail train, and the Panoramabahn. Additionally, another station was installed in 2015 onto the parking lot called Express Lane. \n\n==== Panoramabahn ====\n\nThe Panoramabahn has been installed since the opening of the park in 1975.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/panorama-train-station-germany</ref> At first, it served as a sightseeing train which departed and arrived near the entrance of the park in Germany. Today the train also stops at train stations in England, Spain, and Russia. The Europa-Park owns five type C. P. Huntington trains manufactured by the US-American company Chance Morgan. \n\n==== Monorail ====\n\nThe monorail was put into operation in 1990 and was originally intended for sightseeing only, with its starting and finishing point inside the Historama in Luxembourg.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/monorail</ref> In 2009, the monorail was extended by an additional stop in Iceland allowing passengers to use it as a means of transportation.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/monorail-station-iceland</ref>\n\n==== E.P. Express ====\n\nThe E.P. Express was built by AEG and Roll and has always been intended for transportation purposes besides its function as a panorama railway. It is a monorail modelled after a type of Alweg-monorail with closed, air-conditioned carriages, and it reaches a maximum speed of 20 km/h on a 2,5 km circuit at an average height of 6 meters.\nInaugurated together with the Hotel 'El Andaluz' in 1995, one of the purposes of the E.P. Express of the Europa-Park was to connect the hotel to the main entrance. Over the course of time, the stops 'Greece' and 'Europa-Park Hotel Resort' were added to the existing 'Alexanderplatz' (main entrance) and 'Spain' stations.\n\n==Events==\n{{See also|Euro Dance Festival}}\n[[File:Dance dome.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Euro Dance Festival]] in 2007]]\n[[Euro Dance Festival]], located annually at Europa-Park since 2007, is best known for its wide range of music and dancing styles. These are [[Ballroom Dance]], [[Argentine Tango]], [[Swing Dance]], [[Hip Hop]] and [[Breakdance]]. A combination of dancing classes and shows and a trade fair caters for the needs of both beginners and professionals including dance instructors and choreographers. Since its foundation it has taken place for four days every year in early spring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euro-dance-festival.com/|title=Euro Dance Festival im Europa Park|first=Marc|last=Tr\u00f6ndle|website=Euro Dance Festival}}</ref>\n\nEuropa-Park host dozens of events throughout the summer season. The biggest of these include the Midsummer Party, when the theme park hosts a fireworks display and is open until midnight. Horror Nights takes place through October evenings and features a range of halloween horror mazes, rides and shows. For the last week of the main season, the park hosts a daily firework show and music production.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==== Euro Dance Festival ====\n\nEvery February, when the amusement park is closed during the winter break, the Euro Dance Festival takes place. Dance enthusiasts from all over the world gather at the park to learn new steps and techniques in over 200 workshops taught by some of the best and most well-known international dancers.<ref>https://www.euro-dance-festival.com/</ref> Amongst others, star guests like [[Detlef_Soost|Detlef D! Soost]], William Pino, Alessandra Bucharelli, [[Isabel Edvardsson]], Franco Formica, Oliver Wessel-Therhorn, Kristina & Peter Stokkebroe, Luis Vasquez & Melissa Fernandez have taught there already.\n\n==== Ladies Only Festival ====\n\nThe Ladies Only Festival takes place on one weekend between the months of January and March, when the park is closed for a winter break. On this occasion, the festival connects elements of fitness, dance, health, beauty and wellness. More than 200 workshops and seminars held by roughly 80 coaches are spread out over four days.\n\n==== Miss Germany Pageant ====\n\nSince 2002, the official election of Miss Germany has taken place every February in the Europa-Park Dome, arranged by the Miss Germany Corporation from Oldenburg. The collaboration was so successful that in 2010 it was extended for another decade.\n\n==== Dinner Theater ====\n\nThe Europa-Park offers a variety of dinner events on several nights of the year after the amusement park closes. There are several different events you can choose from. For example the Dinner Show<ref>https://dinnershow.europapark.de/de/</ref>, the Baden Medieval Banquet<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/events/baden-medieval-banquet</ref> as well as the Dinner & Movie<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/events/dinner-movie</ref>.\n\n==== Science Days ====\n\nFor several days every May and October, the park offers Science Days for younger and older schoolchildren, respectively. The Science Days are the oldest science festival in Germany, featuring science talks and shows, as well as exhibitors from the industrial sector, schools, hospitals, and universities.\n\n==== CloudFest ====\nFormerly known as WebHostingDays, CloudFest is an annual conference in March about [[cloud computing]] aimed at [[Business|commercial organizations]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cloudfest.com/|title=CloudFest 2020: The world\u2019s #1 cloud computing conference|website=CloudFest|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> CloudFest 2020 was cancelled due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303123342/https://www.cloudfest.com/|title=CloudFest 2020: The world\u2019s #1 cloud computing conference|date=2020-03-03|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\n== Halloween ==\n\nEuropa-Park has been celebrating Halloween since 1998. Every year from the end of September until the beginning of November, visitors find themselves in a creepy environment, surrounded by hay bales, corn stalks, skeletons, and countless pumpkins of all colours. Numerous attractions, shows, and food and beverage facilities adopt a Halloween theme every year,<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows-events/top-entertainment-every-season/halloween-europa-park</ref> as does the daily parade.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows/europa-park-halloween-parade</ref> In the 2014 season, Europa-Park premiered their independently-produced Halloween musical, \"Spook Me!\"\n\n==== Horror Nights ====\n\nBetween 2007 \u2013 2011, the park's Terenzi Horror Nights were organised in the month of October in cooperation with [[Marc Terenzi]]. Visitors were able go on night-time walks through the Italian and French themed areas in 2007 \u2013 2008 and through the Greek and Swiss themed areas in 2009, where they would be chased and spooked by actors dressed as various horror-themed monsters such as zombies. The event was again included in Europa-Park's yearly program between 2010 and 2016, billed as Horror Nights starring Marc Terenzi. Between 2013 and 2015 it was simply called Horror Nights, as it took place without Marc Terenzi during that period.\n\n==== Traumatica ====\n\nIn 2017, the Horror Nights were replaced by the Traumatica event<ref>https://traumatica.com/en/</ref>. It takes place in the evenings, partly in the Greek-themed area and partly outside of the theme park's territory. Visitors are taken into a post-apocalyptic world in which five different groups fight for dominance. The group members are played by live actors and are set up in haunted houses with special effects as their main quarters, which can be attended by visitors.\n\n==== Tortuga - Vergessene Piraten ====\n\nTortuga - Vergessene Piraten (''English: Forgotten Pirates'') took place in the Greek-themed area in 2006, and in the Scandinavian-themed area from 2007 to 2011. Visitors would walk through dark alleys and get scared by pirates, which ensured heart-stopping moments. The Spanish name Tortuga designates [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Haiti's second largest island]] which was a focal point for pirates in the years 1640 to 1670. The maze only took place in the weeks around Halloween.\n\n==== The Villa ====\n\nAfter the horror maze Tortuga - Vergessene Piraten was cancelled, The Villa put the fear of God into visitors in 2012 and 2013. Numerous horror actors and special effects awaited the visitors in the horror maze that was situated in a 19th century style, Victorian dream house.\n\n==== Tenem's Revenge ====\n\nIn the years 2015-2016 the daytime maze Tenems Rache (''English: Tenem\u2019s Revenge'') was located below the waiting area of the Poseidon. Visitors had to navigate through a horror mansion and its dark corridors, where boos crews were creeping through lighting and fog effects. The design of the house was inspired by Egyptian burial chambers.\n\n==== Halloween Festival Mysteria ====\n\nEvery other year from 2011 through 2016, the park's festival grounds were home to the Halloween show Mysteria, offering live music, artistic performances, pyrotechnics, and lighting effects. During off years, 30-minute concerts by the Swiss DJ BoBo took the place of the show. Starting in 2011, the show was set in a ghostly castle, with the title Mysteria: Castillo Mystico. In 2013, the park introduced an entirely new story revolving around two enemy gangs in a shantytown on the outskirts of the city.\n\n==== Hellfire Fountains ====\n\nIn 2017, the show was replaced by the fountain and fire show Hellfire Fountains, offered multiple times every evening in the last week of the season.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows/hellfire-fountains</ref>\n\n==Seasonal Hours of Operation==\nDuring the main summer season, the park opens at 9:00&nbsp;am and closes from 6:00&nbsp;pm. Closing time is extended by up to 3 1/2 hours, depending on how busy the park is. This is usually the case on weekends and holiday periods. The park opens selected rides 30 minutes early for hotel guests.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn 2001, Europa-Park opened for its first winter season. That year, approximately 180,000 visitors attended during the winter; as of 2012, that number had grown to 500,000.<ref>https://www.badische-zeitung.de/rust/europa-park-beendet-wintersaison-mit-rekordzahlen--54439283.html</ref> The park celebrates the winter in style \u2013 offering an ice rink, a [[Skibobbing|skibob]] track, the Big Wheel Bellevue<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/big-wheel-bellevue</ref> and festive decor.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows-events/top-entertainment-every-season/winter-europa-park</ref> The park is also home to an annual Christmas market.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/historic-christmas-market</ref> Since 2002, the park hosts an annual Weihnachtsmann-Treffen (''English: Santa Claus Convention''). Visitors who enter the park wearing a Santa Claus costume can purchase their tickets at a discount.<ref>https://www.parkerlebnis.de/europa-park-weihnachtsmann-treffen-2016_35040.html</ref>\n\nDuring the winter, most outdoor and/or water rides are closed: the African Queen, Atlantica SuperSplash, Fjord-Rafting, Poseidon and the cable ferry.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/shows-events/top-entertainment-every-season/winter-europa-park</ref> Both the Blue Fire Megacoaster and Silver Star are only in service if the weather allows.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/blue-fire-megacoaster-powered-gazprom</ref><ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/silver-star</ref> The park opens at 11:00&nbsp;am and closes at 7:00&nbsp;pm and opens selected rides 1 hour early for hotel guests. Although the park does extend closing time if it's busy, this doesn't happen as often in the winter seasons, partly due to low temperatures in the evening. In the winter season 2019/20, the park will reopen the once-destroyed attraction Pirates of Batavia, now resurrected as Batavia of Ice.<ref>https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/batavia-ice</ref>\n\n==Themed areas==\n\n=== Adventureland ===\n* African Queen \u2013 A boat ride around the lake.\n* Jungle Rafts \u2013 A tow boat / dark ride through an African settlement.\n* Water Playground\n\n=== Austria ===\n* Alpenexpress Coastiality\n* Alpenexpress Enzian \u2013 [[Powered roller coaster]] which is themed like a [[mine train roller coaster]] and, after a brief encounter with some hungry bears, includes a trip inside the World of Diamonds (which can also be viewed by foot).

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for that seat since 1979, [[John Townend]], won the new seat, and held it until he retired at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. His successor, the current incumbent [[Greg Knight]], had previously represented the [[marginal seat]] of [[Derby North (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby North]] from 1983 until he was defeated in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} To date it has been a Conservative [[safe seat]] and ranks 170th in terms of their share of

Upon seeing one of his possible futures dying old with Jessica, Morty begins taking whatever action would lead to that future, resulting in him inadvertently killing Rick. Holographic Rick then appears and instructs Morty to collect Rick's DNA so he can be cloned and resurrected. Seeing that following Holographic Rick's instructions won't give him the future he wants, Morty refuses to clone Rick. Meanwhile, Rick's consciousness is routed into clones of alternate universe Ricks. All of the alternate Ricks end up being fascist and hostile except for Wasp Rick, who agrees to help. Morty meanwhile causes chaos as he kills numerous people and uses special ferro-fluid to turn himself into a cyborg abomination to pursue his desired future. Rick, Wasp Rick, and Holographic Rick team up to turn Morty back to normal. The ferro-fluid then bonds with Holographic Rick, causing him to become hostile and forcing Wasp Rick to kill him. Jerry and Beth are angry at Rick, but Morty takes responsibility for the damage he caused. Rick and Morty agree to share responsibility in future adventures.\n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Morty overhears Jessica telling her friends that she plans to become a hospice worker to care for the elderly in their dying moments, causing him to become angry that the future the crystal showed him was misleading. \n| LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 33\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n | Title           = [[The Old Man and the Seat]]\n | DirectedBy      = Jacob Hair\n | WrittenBy       = Michael Waldron\n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|17}}\n | Viewers         = 1.67<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-11-17-2019.html |title=Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 11.17.2019 |work=Showbuzz Daily |author=Mitch Metcalf |date=November 19, 2019 |access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref>\n | ShortSummary    = Rick leaves the house for his personal toilet since he is a private pooper. While Rick is gone, Jerry disobeys his explicit instructions and asks Rick's new intern Glootie to develop an app for him. Glootie develops a matchmaking app that Jerry names \"Lovefinderrz\", whose advice its users, including Summer, impulsively follow as the app constantly changes who they should be matched with. Beth attempts to block Summer's relationships due to her still being underage. Morty forces Glootie to take him and Jerry to his mothership, where it is revealed Glootie's species plans to use the app to distract humanity while they invade Earth for its water. Jerry convinces Glootie to help by showing him that they both are considered incompatible to anybody by the app, and Glootie sabotages the app by implementing an ad wall. Meanwhile, Rick finds out someone else used his toilet and tracks down an alien businessman named Tony, who admits his guilt and points out they are both private poopers since pooping is the only amount of control they feel they have in their lives. Despite many threats, Rick never follows through with killing Tony, and when he dies in an accident, Rick provides Tony's father with a means to clone him. It's then revealed that Rick prepared an elaborate holographic routine that would have insulted Tony the next time he used his toilet. \n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Jerry ingests a fluid developed by Rick to show its user their deepest desire.

Rick then assembles a crew to gain entry into HeistCon to confront Miles. They agree to a bet to see who can steal the Crystal Skull of Horowitz first. Miles then reveals he already stole the Crystal Skull by recruiting Rick's team, but Rick reveals with the help of Heist-o-Tron, he predicted Miles' plan and hypnotized his team to steal the Crystal Skull for him instead. He then orders the HeistCon crowd, who have also been hypnotized by Heist-o-Tron, to steal HeistCon, which results in Miles' death. Heist-o-Tron then goes rogue and begins stealing planets, forcing Rick to organize a second team which includes Mr. Poopybutthole. To counter Heist-o-Tron, Rick builds Rand-o-Tron, whose random instructions help the team track down Heist-o-Tron. Rick and Heist-o-Tron then get into an argument over whose plan is superior before Heist-o-Tron realizes the perfect heist is the one that will never be written and self destructs. Morty then goes to Netflix to submit his heist screenplay but loses motivation when he realizes how formulaic his screenplay is. It is then revealed that Rick orchestrated the entire heist adventure to sour Morty on heists so that he won't join Netflix and continue adventuring with Rick instead.  \n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Rick has a beer with Mr. Poopybutthole on the roof, where he admits he paid Mr. Poopybutthole's students to attack him to test his karate skills.

Meanwhile, Jerry encounters a talking cat in his bedroom, but Rick insists he has nothing to do with it. The cat convinces Jerry to take it to Florida to find fun at beach party, but the cat betrays Jerry by accusing him of defecating on the beach. However, the cat only ends up annoying everybody at the party, resulting in it getting kicked out along with Jerry. Morty tries to play with Balthromaw, but it is clear Balthromaw doesn't like Morty, which frustrates him. Angered at Balthromaw stealing Morty's attention, Rick tries to kill the dragon, but they both end up realizing they have much in common and inadvertently soul bond. The Wizard then arrives, accuses Balthromaw of being a \"slut dragon\", and takes him away to be executed. Rick helps Morty rescue Balthromaw, since the soul bond means he will die if Balthromaw does. With the help of other slut dragons, Rick and Morty are able to rescue Balthromaw, kill the Wizard, and break the soul bond. Now uncomfortable with how sexual dragons are, Rick and Morty part ways with Balthromaw. Rick and Jerry scan the cat's mind to figure out why it can talk, and are horrified at what they see. They chase the cat away and Rick erases Jerry's memory of the incident. \n----\n''Post-credit scene'': The talking cat crosses paths with Balthromaw, and asks him if he can fly him to Florida. \n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 36\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n | Title           = [[Rattlestar Ricklactica]]\n | DirectedBy      = Jacob Hair\n | WrittenBy       = James Siciliano\n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|15}}\n | Viewers         = 1.32<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-12-15-2019.html |title=Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 12.15.2019 |work=Showbuzz Daily |author=Mitch Metcalf |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = In order to keep Jerry from hurting himself while putting up Christmas lights, Rick makes him lighter than air, but Jerry later loses his shoe which causes him to float away and get lost. While traveling through space, Rick's spaceship gets a \"flat tire\", which requires Rick to stop to repair it. Morty disobeys Rick's order to stay in the spaceship, and is bitten by a space snake. As Rick analyzes the snake for an antidote, he and Morty learn that it is in fact an astronaut from a planet of intelligent snakes that are on the brink of a world war. Feeling guilty, Morty secretly replaces the dead snake astronaut with a regular snake and drops it off at the snake planet. The alien snakes soon realize Morty's snake is not native to their planet. Later, time-traveling robot snakes arrive at Morty's house to try to protect and kill him. With help from a future version of himself, Rick travels back in time and leaves the secrets of time travel to the snakes earlier in their timeline, which eventually results in them abusing time travel enough to attract the attention of the Time Police, who destroy their civilization by eliminating their first intelligent ancestor. Jerry manages to make his way back home but ends up injuring himself like Rick predicted. Rick and Morty then meet their future selves, who remind them they need to help their past selves solve the snake problem and close the time loop.\n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Rick and Morty finish preparing the items they need to give to their past selves. However, upon returning to the snake planet, Rick punches Morty for disobeying him, explaining why Future Morty has a black eye. \n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 37\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n | Title           = Never Ricking Morty\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\" />\n | DirectedBy      = \n | WrittenBy       = \n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|3}}\n | Viewers         = \n | ShortSummary    = \n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 38\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n | Title           = Promortyus\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\" />\n | DirectedBy      = \n | WrittenBy       = \n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|10}}\n | Viewers         = \n | ShortSummary    =\n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 39\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n | Title           = The Vat of Acid Episode\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\" />\n | DirectedBy      = \n | WrittenBy       = \n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|17}}\n | Viewers         = \n | ShortSummary    =\n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 40\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n | Title           = Childrick of Mort\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\" />\n | DirectedBy      = \n | WrittenBy       = \n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|24}}\n | Viewers         = \n | ShortSummary    =\n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 41\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n | Title           = Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\">{{cite tweet |user=RickandMorty |author=Rick and Morty |number=1250076355967975425 |title=Imagining episodes based on their name is almost as fun as watching episodes.

Seeing that following Holographic Rick's instructions won't give him the future he wants, Morty refuses to clone Rick. Meanwhile, Rick's consciousness is routed into clones of alternate universe Ricks. All of the alternate Ricks end up being fascist and hostile except for Wasp Rick, who agrees to help. Morty meanwhile causes chaos as he kills numerous people and uses special ferro-fluid to turn himself into a cyborg abomination to pursue his desired future. Rick, Wasp Rick, and Holographic Rick team up to turn Morty back to normal. The ferro-fluid then bonds with Holographic Rick, causing him to become hostile and forcing Wasp Rick to kill him.

While Rick is gone, Jerry disobeys his explicit instructions and asks Rick's new intern Glootie to develop an app for him. Glootie develops a matchmaking app that Jerry names \"Lovefinderrz\", whose advice its users, including Summer, impulsively follow as the app constantly changes who they should be matched with. Beth attempts to block Summer's relationships due to her still being underage. Morty forces Glootie to take him and Jerry to his mothership, where it is revealed Glootie's species plans to use the app to distract humanity while they invade Earth for its water. Jerry convinces Glootie to help by showing him that they both are considered incompatible to anybody by the app, and Glootie sabotages the app by implementing an ad wall. Meanwhile, Rick finds out someone else used his toilet and tracks down an alien businessman named Tony, who admits his guilt and points out they are both private poopers since pooping is the only amount of control they feel they have in their lives. Despite many threats, Rick never follows through with killing Tony, and when he dies in an accident, Rick provides Tony's father with a means to clone him. It's then revealed that Rick prepared an elaborate holographic routine that would have insulted Tony the next time he used his toilet. \n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Jerry ingests a fluid developed by Rick to show its user their deepest desire.

Miles then reveals he already stole the Crystal Skull by recruiting Rick's team, but Rick reveals with the help of Heist-o-Tron, he predicted Miles' plan and hypnotized his team to steal the Crystal Skull for him instead. He then orders the HeistCon crowd, who have also been hypnotized by Heist-o-Tron, to steal HeistCon, which results in Miles' death. Heist-o-Tron then goes rogue and begins stealing planets, forcing Rick to organize a second team which includes Mr. Poopybutthole.

Meanwhile, Jerry encounters a talking cat in his bedroom, but Rick insists he has nothing to do with it. The cat convinces Jerry to take it to Florida to find fun at beach party, but the cat betrays Jerry by accusing him of defecating on the beach. However, the cat only ends up annoying everybody at the party, resulting in it getting kicked out along with Jerry. Morty tries to play with Balthromaw, but it is clear Balthromaw doesn't like Morty, which frustrates him. Angered at Balthromaw stealing Morty's attention, Rick tries to kill the dragon, but they both end up realizing they have much in common and inadvertently soul bond. The Wizard then arrives, accuses Balthromaw of being a \"slut dragon\", and takes him away to be executed. Rick helps Morty rescue Balthromaw, since the soul bond means he will die if Balthromaw does. With the help of other slut dragons, Rick and Morty are able to rescue Balthromaw, kill the Wizard, and break the soul bond. Now uncomfortable with how sexual dragons are, Rick and Morty part ways with Balthromaw. Rick and Jerry scan the cat's mind to figure out why it can talk, and are horrified at what they see. They chase the cat away and Rick erases Jerry's memory of the incident. \n----\n''Post-credit scene'': The talking cat crosses paths with Balthromaw, and asks him if he can fly him to Florida. \n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 36\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n | Title           = [[Rattlestar Ricklactica]]\n | DirectedBy      = Jacob Hair\n | WrittenBy       = James Siciliano\n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|15}}\n | Viewers         = 1.32<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-12-15-2019.html |title=Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 12.15.2019 |work=Showbuzz Daily |author=Mitch Metcalf |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = In order to keep Jerry from hurting himself while putting up Christmas lights, Rick makes him lighter than air, but Jerry later loses his shoe which causes him to float away and get lost. While traveling through space, Rick's spaceship gets a \"flat tire\", which requires Rick to stop to repair it. Morty disobeys Rick's order to stay in the spaceship, and is bitten by a space snake. As Rick analyzes the snake for an antidote, he and Morty learn that it is in fact an astronaut from a planet of intelligent snakes that are on the brink of a world war. Feeling guilty, Morty secretly replaces the dead snake astronaut with a regular snake and drops it off at the snake planet. The alien snakes soon realize Morty's snake is not native to their planet. Later, time-traveling robot snakes arrive at Morty's house to try to protect and kill him. With help from a future version of himself, Rick travels back in time and leaves the secrets of time travel to the snakes earlier in their timeline, which eventually results in them abusing time travel enough to attract the attention of the Time Police, who destroy their civilization by eliminating their first intelligent ancestor. Jerry manages to make his way back home but ends up injuring himself like Rick predicted. Rick and Morty then meet their future selves, who remind them they need to help their past selves solve the snake problem and close the time loop.\n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Rick and Morty finish preparing the items they need to give to their past selves. However, upon returning to the snake planet, Rick punches Morty for disobeying him, explaining why Future Morty has a black eye. \n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 37\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n | Title           = Never Ricking Morty\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\" />\n | DirectedBy      = \n | WrittenBy       = \n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|3}}\n | Viewers         = \n | ShortSummary    = \n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 38\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n | Title           = Promortyus\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\" />\n | DirectedBy      = \n | WrittenBy       = \n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|10}}\n | Viewers         = \n | ShortSummary    =\n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 39\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n | Title           = The Vat of Acid Episode\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\" />\n | DirectedBy      = \n | WrittenBy       = \n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|17}}\n | Viewers         = \n | ShortSummary    =\n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 40\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n | Title           = Childrick of Mort\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\" />\n | DirectedBy      = \n | WrittenBy       = \n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|24}}\n | Viewers         = \n | ShortSummary    =\n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 41\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n | Title           = Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri\n | RTitle = <ref name=\"4BTitles\">{{cite tweet |user=RickandMorty |author=Rick and Morty |number=1250076355967975425 |title=Imagining episodes based on their name is almost as fun as watching episodes.
