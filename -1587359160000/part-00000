At the 2004 Junior Nationals, he won the 1&nbsp;m, 3&nbsp;m, and 10&nbsp;m and 3&nbsp;m synchro titles. At the 2004 Olympic Trials, he placed 3rd on the 3&nbsp;m and 10&nbsp;m individual events, 2nd on the 3&nbsp;m and 10&nbsp;m synchro events, and did not qualify for the Olympic team. In 2005, Mitcham won his first senior national title. He competed at the Australian Olympic Youth Festival, where he won the silver medal in the 1&nbsp;m with a score of 508.35, and won the 3&nbsp;m, 10&nbsp;m and 3&nbsp;m synchro (with [[Scott Robertson (diver)|Scott Robertson]]) titles with scores of 565, 555.8, and 316.23 respectively. At the [[2005 World Aquatics Championships]] in Montreal, he placed 12th on the 10&nbsp;m platform with a score of 560.73.\n\nIn 2006, Mitcham competed in the German Grand Prix event, placing 16th on the 3&nbsp;m and 6th on the 10&nbsp;m, and at the US Grand Prix at Fort Lauderdale, placing 8th on the 3m springboard.

Mitcham is quoted as saying \"I had still failed to achieve my childhood dream of becoming the best in the world at something,\" and so had turned to drug use.

It is part of the [[Marion County School District (Florida)|Marion County School District]] and serves students residing in southeastern [[Marion County, Florida|Marion County]], including the [[Ocala National Forest]], [[Silver Springs Shores, Florida|Silver Springs Shores]] and [[Summerfield, Florida|Summerfield]]. The school colors are [[purple]] and [[gold (color)|gold]] and its mascot is the [[hurricane]].\n\nLake Weir High School was established in 1955 as a consolidation of Weirsdale and Summerfield High Schools on a hill overlooking Lake Weir with a student body of about 300 students in grades 7 through 12.  Mr. Leo Armstrong, former principal of Weirsdale High School was the first principal.  The school served students coming from elementary schools at [[Belleview, Florida]], [[Summerfield, Florida]] and [[Weirsdale, Florida]] that served the communities of Belleview, Candler, East Lake Weir, Ocklawaha, Pedro, Summerfield, Sunset Harbor, and Weirsdale.  The first class of 1956 graduated 33.  In 1967, Marion County changed to the elementary, middle and high school organization and the school changed to grades 9 through 12.  In August, 1975, a new Lake Weir High School was constructed on Maricamp Road in Candler with a student body in excess of 1200 students, which grew to 2500 by 1993.  The former Lake Weir High School campus then became home to Lake Weir Middle School, which serves grades 6 through 8.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Tim Hicks (American football)|Tim Hicks]], gridiron football player\n*[[Eddie L.

Mr. Leo Armstrong, former principal of Weirsdale High School was the first principal.  The school served students coming from elementary schools at [[Belleview, Florida]], [[Summerfield, Florida]] and [[Weirsdale, Florida]] that served the communities of Belleview, Candler, East Lake Weir, Ocklawaha, Pedro, Summerfield, Sunset Harbor, and Weirsdale.
