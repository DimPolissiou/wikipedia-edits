{"title_page": "Race and intelligence", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Disputed|date=February 2020}}\n{{POV|date=February 2020}}\n}}\nThe connection between '''race and intelligence''' has been a subject of debate in both [[popular science]] and [[academic research]] since the inception of [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] testing in the early 20th century. Since then, there have been observed differences between average IQ scores of different population groups, but whether and to what extent these differences reflect environmental factors as opposed to genetic ones, as well as what the definitions of \"[[Race (human categorization)|race]]\" and \"[[intelligence]]\" are, and whether they can be objectively defined, is the subject of much dispute. At present, there is no direct evidence that these differences in test scores have a genetic component. The validity of IQ tests as a metric for general intelligence is itself disputed.\n\nThe first tests showing differences in IQ scores between different population groups in the United States were the tests of [[United States Army]] recruits in [[World War I]]. In the 1920s, groups of [[eugenics]] lobbyists argued that this demonstrated that [[African-Americans]] and certain immigrant groups were of inferior intellect to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[white people]], due to innate biological differences, using this as an argument for policies of [[racial segregation]]. However, soon, other studies appeared, contesting these conclusions and arguing instead that the Army tests had not adequately controlled for environmental factors, such as socio-economic and educational [[racial inequality in the United States|inequality between black people and white people]]. Later observations of phenomena such as the [[Flynn effect]] have also suggested that environmental factors play a greater role in group IQ differences than previously expected. \n\nThe causes of differences in IQ test scores are not well-understood, and the topic remains controversial among researchers.\n==History of the debate==\n{{Main|History of the race and intelligence controversy}}\n{{See also|Scientific racism}}\n[[File:Alfred Binet.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Alfred Binet]] (1857\u20131911), inventor of the first intelligence test]]\n\nClaims of races having different intelligence were used to justify [[colonialism]], [[slavery]], [[racism]], [[social Darwinism]], and racial [[eugenic]]s. Racial thinkers such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]] relied crucially on the assumption that black people were innately inferior to white people in developing their ideologies of [[white supremacy]]. Even enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], a slave owner, believed black people to be innately inferior to white people in physique and intellect.{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|p=23}}\n\n===Early IQ testing===\nThe first practical intelligence test was developed between 1905 and 1908 by [[Alfred Binet]] in France for school placement of children. Binet warned that results from his test should not be assumed to measure innate intelligence or used to label individuals permanently.{{sfn|Plotnik|Kouyoumdjian|2011}} Binet's test was translated into English and revised in 1916 by [[Lewis Terman]] (who introduced IQ scoring for the test results) and published under the name the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales]]. As Terman's test was published, there was great concern in the United States about the abilities and skills of recent immigrants. Different immigrant nationalities were sometimes thought to belong to different races, such as [[Slavs]]. A different set of tests developed by [[Robert Yerkes]] were used to evaluate draftees for World War I, and researchers found that people from southern and eastern Europe scored lower than native-born Americans, that Americans from northern states had higher scores than Americans from southern states, and that black Americans scored lower than white Americans.{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|page=116}} The results were widely publicized by a lobby of anti-immigration activists, including the New York patrician and conservationist [[Madison Grant]], who considered the [[Nordic race]] to be superior, but under threat of immigration by inferior breeds. In his influential work, ''A Study of American Intelligence,'' psychologist [[Carl Brigham]] used the results of the Army tests to argue for a stricter immigration policy, limiting immigration to countries considered to belong to the \"Nordic race\".{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|page=116, 309}}\n\nIn the 1920s, states like Virginia enacted [[eugenic]] laws, such as its [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|1924 Racial Integrity Act]], which established the [[one-drop rule]] as law. Many scientists reacted negatively to eugenicist claims linking abilities and moral character to racial or genetic ancestry. They pointed to the contribution of environment to test results (such as speaking English as a second language).{{sfn|Pickren|Rutherford|2010|p=163}} By the mid-1930s, many United States psychologists adopted the view that environmental and cultural factors played a dominant role in IQ test results, among them Carl Brigham, who repudiated his own previous arguments on the grounds that he realized that the tests were not a measure of innate intelligence. Discussion of the issue in the United States also influenced [[Germans|German]] [[Nazi]] claims of the \"Nordics\" being a \"[[master race]]\", influenced by Grant's writings.{{sfn|Spiro|2009}} As the American public sentiment shifted against the Germans, claims of racial differences in intelligence increasingly came to be regarded as problematic.<ref name=\"Ludy 2006\">{{harvnb|Ludy|2006}}</ref> Anthropologists such as [[Franz Boas]], and [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Gene Weltfish]], did much to demonstrate the unscientific status of many of the claims about racial hierarchies of intelligence.{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|pages=130\u201332}} Nonetheless, a powerful eugenics and segregation lobby funded largely by textile-magnate [[Wickliffe Draper]] continued to publicize studies using intelligence studies as an argument for eugenics, segregation, and anti-immigration legislation.{{sfn|Tucker|2002}}\n\n===Pioneer Fund and ''The Bell Curve''===\n{{See also|Pioneer Fund}}\nAs the de-segregation of the American South gained traction in the 1950s, debate about black intelligence resurfaced. [[Audrey Shuey]], funded by Draper's [[Pioneer fund|Pioneer Fund]], published a new analysis of Yerkes' tests, concluding that black people really were of inferior intellect to white people. This study was used by segregationists as an argument that it was to the advantage of black children to be educated separately from the superior white children.{{sfn|Jackson|2005}} In the 1960s, the debate was further revived when [[William Shockley]] publicly defended the argument that black children were innately unable to learn as well as white children.{{sfn|Shurkin|2006}} [[Arthur Jensen]] caused discussion of the issue with his ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'' article, \"[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?]]\", questioning remedial education for African-American children. He suggested their poor educational performance reflected an underlying genetic cause rather than lack of stimulation at home.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Panofsky |first1=Aaron |title=Misbehaving Science.

''The Bell Curve'' also led to a 1995 report from the [[American Psychological Association]], \"[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]\", acknowledging a difference between mean IQ scores of white people and black people as well as the absence of any adequate explanation of it, either environmental or genetic.

While there is some consensus about how to define intelligence, it is not universally accepted that it is  something that can be unequivocally measured by a single figure.<ref name=\"Schacter, Gilbert & Wegner 2007, pp 350-1\">{{harvnb|Schacter|Gilbert|Wegner|2007|pp=350\u20131}}</ref> A recurring criticism is that different societies value and promote different kinds of skills and that the concept of intelligence is therefore culturally variable and cannot be measured by the same criteria in different societies.<ref name=\"Schacter, Gilbert & Wegner 2007, pp 350-1\"/> Consequently, some critics argue that proposed relationships to other variables are necessarily tentative.<ref name=\"Sternberg, Grigorenko & Kidd 2005\">{{harvnb|Sternberg|Grigorenko|Kidd|2005}}</ref>\n\nIn relation to the study of racial differences in IQ test scores, it becomes a crucial question of what exactly it is that IQ tests measure. Arthur Jensen was a proponent of the view that there is a correlation between scores on all the known types of IQ tests, and that this correlation points to an underlying factor of [[general intelligence]], or ''g''. In most conceptions of ''g,'' it is considered to be fairly fixed in a given individual and unresponsive to training or other environmental influences. In this view, test score differences, especially in those tasks considered to be particularly \"g-loaded\", reflect the test taker's innate capability.\n\nOther psychometricians argue that, while there may or may not be a general intelligence factor, performance on tests relies crucially on knowledge acquired through prior exposure to the types of tasks that such tests contain. This view would mean that tests cannot be expected to reflect only the innate abilities of a given individual, because the expression of potential will always be mediated by experience and cognitive habits. It also means that comparison of test scores from persons with widely different life experiences and cognitive habits is not an expression of their relative innate potentials.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|p=359}}\n\n===Race===\n{{Main|Race (classification of humans)|Race and genetics}}\nThe majority of anthropologists today consider race to be a sociopolitical phenomenon rather than a biological one,{{sfn|Daley|Onwuegbuzie|2011|p=294}} a view supported by considerable genetics research.{{sfn|Smay|Armelagos|2000}}<ref>{{Cite journal| journal = Nature Genetics |date=2004 | volume = 36 |issue=11 Suppl | pages = 43\u201347 |author1=Rotimi, Charles N. | title = Are medical and nonmedical uses of large-scale genomic markers conflating genetics and 'race'? | doi=10.1038/ng1439 |quote=\"Two facts are relevant: (i) as a result of different evolutionary forces, including natural selection, there are geographical patterns of genetic variations that correspond, for the most part, to continental origin; and (ii) observed patterns of geographical differences in genetic information do not correspond to our notion of social identities, including 'race' and 'ethnicity\" | pmid=15508002}}</ref>  The current mainstream view in the social sciences and biology is that race is a social construction based on folk ideologies that construct groups based on social disparities and superficial physical characteristics.<ref>{{harvnb|Schaefer|2008}}</ref> {{harvp|Sternberg|Grigorenko|Kidd|2005}} state, \"Race is a socially constructed concept, not a biological one. It derives from people's desire to classify.\"<ref name=\"Sternberg, Grigorenko & Kidd 2005\"/> The concept of human \"races\" as natural and separate divisions within the human species has also been rejected by the [[American Anthropological Association]]. The official position of the AAA, adopted in 1998, is that advances in scientific knowledge have made it \"clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups\" and that \"any attempt to establish lines of division among biological populations [is] both arbitrary and subjective.\"<ref name=\"AAA\">{{harvnb|AAA|1998}}</ref>\n\nRace in studies of human intelligence is almost always determined using self-reports, rather than based on analyses of the genetic characteristics of the tested individuals. According to psychologist David Rowe, self-report is the preferred method for racial classification in studies of racial differences because classification based on genetic markers alone ignore the \"cultural, behavioral, sociological, psychological, and epidemiological variables\" that distinguish racial groups.<ref name=\"Rowe 2005\">{{harvnb|Rowe|2005}}</ref> Hunt and Carlson write that \"Nevertheless, self-identification is a surprisingly reliable guide to genetic composition. {{harvp|Tang et al.|2005}} applied mathematical clustering techniques to sort genomic markers for over 3,600 people in the United States and Taiwan into four groups.

Loring Brace]]<ref name=\"Brace 2005\">{{harvnb|Brace|2005}}</ref> and geneticist [[Joseph L. Graves|Joseph Graves]] disagree with the idea that cluster analysis and the correlation between self-reported race and genetic ancestry support biological race.<ref>{{harvnb|Graves|2001}}</ref>  They argue that while it is possible to find biological and genetic variation corresponding roughly to the groupings normally defined as races, this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clusters would be different. {{harvnb|Kaplan|2011}} therefore concludes that, while differences in particular allele frequencies can be used to identify populations that loosely correspond to the racial categories common in Western social discourse, the differences are of no more biological significance than the differences found between any human populations (e.g., the Spanish and Portuguese).\n\n[[Earl B. Hunt]] agrees that racial categories are defined by social conventions, though he points out that they also correlate with clusters of both genetic traits and cultural traits. Hunt explains that, due to this, racial IQ differences are caused by these variables that correlate with race, and race itself is rarely a causal variable. Researchers who study racial disparities in test scores are studying the relationship between the scores and the many race-related factors which could potentially affect performance. These factors include health, wealth, biological differences, and education.<ref name=\"Hunt 2010, pp 408\u201310\">{{harvnb|Hunt|2010|pp=408\u201310}}</ref>\n\n==Group differences==\nThe study of human intelligence is one of the most controversial topics in psychology. It remains unclear whether group differences in intelligence test scores are caused by heritable factors or by \"other correlated demographic variables such as [[socioeconomic]] status, [[Education|education level]], and motivation.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Hampshire|Highfield|Parkin|Owen|2012}}.</ref>\nHunt and Carlson outlined four contemporary positions on differences in IQ based on race or ethnicity. The first is that these reflect real differences in average group intelligence, which is caused by a combination of environmental factors and heritable differences in brain function. A second position is that differences in average cognitive ability between races are caused entirely by social and/or environmental factors. A third position holds that differences in average cognitive ability between races do not exist, and that the differences in average test scores are the result of inappropriate use of the tests themselves. Finally, a fourth position is that either or both of the concepts of [[race (classification of humans)|race]] and [[general intelligence factor|general intelligence]] are poorly constructed and therefore any comparisons between races are meaningless.<ref name=\"Hunt & Carlson 2007\"/>\n\n===Test scores===\n{{main|Achievement gap in the United States}}\nIn the US, generally, individuals identifying themselves as Asian tend to score higher on IQ tests than do Caucasians, who score higher than Hispanics, who score higher than African Americans. Nevertheless, greater variation in IQ scores exists within each ethnic group than between them.<ref name=SAGE>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDDqLBBk7BcC |title=Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education |date=2012 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=9781412981521 |pages=1209 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the controversial 1994 book ''[[The Bell Curve]]'', the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) formed a task-force of eleven experts, which issued a report, \"[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]\" in 1995. Regarding group differences, the report reaffirmed the consensus that differences within groups are much wider than difference between groups, and that that claims of ethnic difference in intelligence should be scrutinized carefully, as this had been used to justify racial discrimination. It also acknowledged limitations in the racial categories used, as these categories are neither consistently applied, nor homogeneous (see also [[race and ethnicity in the United States]]).{{sfn|Neisser|Boodoo|Bouchard|Boykin|1996}}\n\n{{harvp|Roth et al.|2001}}, in a review of the results of a total of 6,246,729 participants on other tests of cognitive ability or aptitude, found a difference in mean IQ scores between black people and white people of 1.1 SD. Consistent results were found for college and university application tests such as the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] (N = 2.4 million) and [[Graduate Record Examination]] (N = 2.3 million), as well as for tests of job applicants in corporate sections (N = 0.5 million) and in the military (N = 0.4 million).<ref name=\"Roth et al. 2001\">{{harvnb|Roth et al.|2001}}</ref> According to the same study, [[East Asia]]ns have tended to score relatively higher on visuospatial subtests with lower scores in verbal subtests while [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|Ashkenazi Jews score higher in verbal subtests]] with lower scores in visuospatial subtests.

Cultural differences may also factor in IQ test performance and outcomes. Therefore, results in the United States and Europe do not necessarily correlate to results in other populations.<ref>{{harvnb|Niu|Brass|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Flynn effect and the closing gap===\n{{Main|Flynn effect}}\nFor the past century raw scores on IQ tests have been rising; this score increase is known as the \"Flynn effect\", named after [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]]. In the United States, the increase was continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to about 1998 when the gains stopped and some tests even showed decreasing test scores. For example, in the United States the average scores of black people on some IQ tests in 1995 were the same as the scores of white people in 1945.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1998|p=162}}</ref> As one pair of academics phrased it, \"the typical African American today probably has a slightly higher IQ than the grandparents of today's average white American.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Swain | first = Carol | title = Contemporary voices of white nationalism in America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0521016933 | page = [https://archive.org/details/contemporaryvoic00swai/page/70 70] | url = https://archive.org/details/contemporaryvoic00swai/page/70 }} Note: this quote is from the authors' introductory essay, not from the interviews.</ref>\n\nFlynn has argued that given that these changes take place between one generation and the next it is highly unlikely that genetic factors could account for the increasing scores, which must then be caused by environmental factors. The Flynn Effect has often been used as an argument that the racial gap in IQ test scores must be environmental too, but this is not generally agreed \u2013 others have asserted that the two may have entirely different causes. A meta-analysis by Te Nijenhuis and [[Henk van der Flier|van der Flier]] (2013) concluded that the Flynn effect and group differences in intelligence were likely to have different causes. They stated that the Flynn effect is caused primarily by environmental factors and that it's unlikely these same environmental factors play an important role in explaining group differences in IQ.<ref name=\"Nijenhuis\">{{cite journal|last1=te Nijenhuis|first1=Jan |last2=van der Flier |first2=Henk | author-link2 = Henk van der Flier | title=Is the Flynn effect on g?: A meta-analysis|journal=Intelligence|volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=802\u2013807 |year=2013|url=|ref=harv |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2013.03.001}}</ref> The importance of the Flynn effect in the debate over the causes for the IQ gap lies in demonstrating that environmental factors may cause changes in test scores on the scale of 1 SD. This had previously been doubted.\n\nA separate phenomenon from the Flynn effect has been the discovery that the IQ gap has been gradually closing over the last decades of the 20th century, as black test-takers increased their average scores relative to white test-takers. For instance, Vincent reported in 1991 that the black-white IQ gap was decreasing among children, but that it was remaining constant among adults.{{sfn|Vincent|1991}} Similarly, a 2006 study by Dickens and Flynn estimated that the difference between mean scores of black people and white people closed by about 5 or 6 IQ points between 1972 and 2002,{{sfn|Dickens|Flynn|2006}} a reduction of about one-third. In the same period, the educational achievement disparity also diminished.<ref>Neisser, Ulric (Ed). 1998. The rising curve: Long-term gains in IQ and related measures. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association</ref> In a 2006 study, Murray agreed with Dickens and Flynn that there has been a narrowing of the difference; \"Dickens' and Flynn's estimate of 3\u20136 IQ points from a base of about 16\u201318 points is a useful, though provisional, starting point\". But he argued that this has stalled and that there has been no further narrowing for people born after the late 1970s.{{sfn|Murray|2006}} A subsequent study by Murray, based on the [[Woodcock\u2013Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities]], estimated that the black-white IQ difference decreased by about one-half of one standard deviation from those born in the 1920s to those born in the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Murray|2007}} Recent reviews by Flynn and Dickens (2006), Mackintosh (2011), and Nisbett ''et al.'' 2012 accept the gradual closing of the gap as a fact. In his review of the historical trends, {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=411}} states: \"There is some variety in the results, but not a great deal. The African American means are about 1 standard deviation unit (15 points on the IQ scale) below the white means, and the Hispanic means fall in between.\"\n\nSome studies reviewed by {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=418}} found that rise in the average achievement of African Americans was caused by a reduction in the number of African American students in the lowest range of scores without a corresponding increase in the number of students in the highest ranges. A 2012 review of the literature found that the IQ gap had diminished by 0.33 standard deviations since first reported.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}}{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012b}}\n\nA 2013 analysis of the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] found that from 1971 to 2008, the size of the black\u2013white IQ gap in the United States decreased from 16.33 to 9.94 IQ points. It has also concluded however that, while IQ means are continuing to rise in all ethnic groups, this growth is occurring more slowly among 17-year-old students than among younger students and the black-white IQ gap is no longer narrowing. As of 2008, a study published in 2013 by Heiner Rindermann, Stefan Pinchelmann, and James Thompson have estimated the IQ means of 17-year-old black, white, and Hispanic students to range respectively from 90.45\u201394.15, 102.29\u2013104.57 and 92.30\u201395.90 points. They explain that the gap may persist due to the [[crack epidemic]], the degradation of [[African-American family structure]], the rise of fraud in the educational system (especially with respect to ''[[No Child Left Behind]]''), the decrease in unskilled real wages and employment among African-Americans due to [[globalization]] and [[minimum wage]] increases, differences in parental practices (such as breastfeeding or reading to children), and \"environmental conditions shaped by [African-Americans] themselves.\" To resolve this, they ultimately recommend the reestablishment of \"meritoric principles\" and \"blindly graded objective central exams,\" as opposed to \"[[affirmative action|ethnically based policies]],\" in education.{{sfn|Rindermann|Thompson|2013}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rindermann|first1=Heiner|last2=Pinchelmann|first2=Stefan|title=Future Cognitive Ability: US IQ Prediction until 2060 Based on NAEP|journal=PLOS One|date=13 October 2015|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0138412|pmid=26460731|pmc=4603674|volume=10|issue=10|page=e0138412|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1038412R}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental influences on group differences in IQ==\nThe following environmental factors are some of those suggested as explaining a portion of the differences in average IQ between races. These factors are not mutually exclusive with one another, and some may, in fact, contribute directly to others. Furthermore, the relationship between genetics and environmental factors may be complicated.

Templeton]] argues that the question about the possible genetic effects on the test score gap is muddled by the general focus on \"race\" rather than on populations defined by gene frequency or by geographical proximity, and by the general insistence on phrasing the question in terms of heritability.<ref name=\"Templeton 2001\">{{harvnb|Templeton|2001}}</ref> Templeton points out that racial groups neither represent [[sub-species]] nor distinct [[lineage (evolution)|evolutionary lineages]], and that therefore there is no basis for making claims about the general intelligence of races.<ref name=\"Templeton 2001\"/> From this point of view the search for possible genetic influences on the black-white test score gap is a priori flawed, because there is no genetic material shared by all  Africans or by all Europeans. {{harvp|Mackintosh|2011}}, however, argues that by using genetic cluster analysis to correlate gene frequencies with continental populations it might be possible to show that African populations have a higher frequency of certain genetic variants that contribute to an average lower intelligence. Such a hypothetical situation could hold without all Africans carrying the same genes or belonging to a single evolutionary lineage. According to Mackintosh, a biological basis for the gap thus cannot be ruled out on a priori grounds.\n\nIntelligence is a [[polygenic trait]]. This means that intelligence is under the influence of several genes, possibly several thousand. The effect of most individual genetic variants on intelligence is thought to be very small, well below 1% of the variance in ''g''. Current studies using [[quantitative trait loci]] have yielded little success in the search for genes influencing intelligence. [[Robert Plomin]] is confident that QTLs responsible for the variation in IQ scores exist, but due to their small effect sizes, more powerful tools of analysis will be required to detect them.<ref>{{harvnb|Plomin|Kennedy|Craig|2005|p=513}}</ref> Others assert that no useful answers can be reasonably expected from such research before an understanding of the relation between DNA and human phenotypes emerges.<ref name=\"Cooper 2005\">{{harvnb|Cooper|2005}}</ref> Several candidate genes have been proposed to have a relationship with intelligence.<ref>{{harvnb|Zinkstok et al.|2007}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dick et al.|2007}}</ref> However, a review of candidate genes for intelligence published in {{harvp|Deary|Johnson|Houlihan|2009}} failed to find evidence of an association between these genes and general intelligence, stating \"there is still almost no replicated evidence concerning the individual genes, which have variants that contribute to intelligence differences\".<ref name=\"Deary, Johnson & Houlihan 2009\">{{harvnb|Deary|Johnson|Houlihan|2009}}</ref> In 2001, a review in the ''[[Journal of Black Psychology]]'' refuted eight major premises on which the hereditarian view regarding race and intelligence is based.<ref name=\"Onwegbuzie & Daley 2001\">{{harvnb|Onwuegbuzie|Daley|2001}}</ref>\n\nA 2005 literature review article by Sternberg, Grigorenko and Kidd stated that no gene has been shown to be linked to intelligence, \"so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time\".{{sfn|Sternberg|Grigorenko|Kidd|2005|p=46}} {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=447}} and {{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|page=344}} concurred, both scholars noting that while several environmental factors have been shown to influence the IQ gap, the evidence for a genetic influence has been circumstantial, and according to Mackintosh negligible. Mackintosh however suggests that it may never become possible to account satisfyingly for the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors. The 2012 review by {{harvp|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair| Dickens|2012a}} concluded that \"Almost no genetic polymorphisms have been discovered that are consistently associated with variation in IQ in the normal range\". Hunt and several other researchers however maintain that genetic causes cannot be ruled out, and that new evidence may yet show a genetic contribution to the gap. Hunt concurs with Rushton and Jensen who considered the 100% environmental hypothesis to be impossible. Nonetheless, Nisbett and colleagues (2012) consider the entire IQ gap to be explained by the environmental factors that have thus far been demonstrated to influence it, and Mackintosh does not find this view to be unreasonable.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}}\n\n===Heritability within and between groups===\n[[File:Heritability plants.jpeg|thumb| An environmental factor that varies between groups but not within groups can cause group differences in a trait that is otherwise 100 percent [[heritable]].]]\n\n[[Twin studies]] of intelligence have reported high heritability values. However, these studies are based on questionable assumptions.{{sfn|Carson|Beckwith|2001}} When used in the context of human [[behavior genetics]], the term \"heritability\" is highly misleading, as it does not convey any information about the relative importance of genetic or environmental factors on the development of a given trait, nor does it convey the extent to which that trait is genetically determined.{{sfn|Moore|Shenk|2016}} Arguments in support of a genetic explanation of racial differences in IQ are sometimes fallacious. For instance, hereditarians have sometimes cited the failure of known environmental factors to account for such differences, or the high heritability of intelligence within races, as evidence that racial differences in IQ are genetic.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1984}}</ref>\n\nPsychometricians have found that intelligence is substantially heritable within populations, with 30\u201350% of variance in IQ scores in early childhood being attributable to genetic factors in analyzed US populations, increasing to 75\u201380% by late adolescence.{{sfn|Neisser|Boodoo|Bouchard|Boykin|1996}}<ref name=\"Deary, Johnson & Houlihan 2009\"/> In biology heritability  is defined as the ratio of variation attributable to genetic differences in an observable [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the trait's total observable variation. The heritability of a trait describes the proportion of variation in the trait that is attributable to genetic factors within a particular population. A heritability of 1 indicates that variation correlates fully with genetic variation and a heritability of 0 indicates that there is no correlation between the trait and genes at all. In psychological testing, heritability tends to be understood as the degree of correlation between the results of a test taker and those of their biological parents. However, since high heritability is simply a correlation between traits and genes, it does not describe the causes of heritability which in humans can be either genetic or environmental.\n\nTherefore, a high heritability measure does not imply that a trait is genetic or unchangeable, however, as environmental factors that affect all group members equally will not be measured by heritability and the heritability of a trait may also change over time in response to changes in the distribution of genes and environmental factors.{{sfn|Neisser|Boodoo|Bouchard|Boykin|1996}} High heritability also doesn't imply that all of the heritability is genetically determined, but can also be due to environmental differences that affect only a certain genetically defined group (indirect heritability).<ref name=\"Block 2002\">{{harvnb|Block|2002}}</ref> The figure to the left demonstrates how heritability works. In both gardens the difference between tall and short cornstalks is 100% heritable as cornstalks that are genetically disposed for growing tall will become taller than those without this disposition, but the difference in height between the cornstalks to the left and those on the right is 100% environmental as it is due to different nutrients being supplied to the two gardens. Hence the causes of differences within a group and between groups may not be the same, even when looking at traits that are highly heritable.<ref name=\"Block 2002\" /> In his [[The Bell Curve#Cognitive sorting|criticism of ''the Bell Curve'']], [[Noam Chomsky]] further illustrated this with the example of women wearing earrings:{{quote|To borrow an example from Ned Block, \"some years ago when only women wore earrings, the heritability of having an earring was high because differences in whether a person had an earring was due to a chromosomal difference, XX vs. XY.\" No one has yet suggested that wearing earrings, or ties, is \"in our genes,\" an inescapable fate that environment cannot influence, \"dooming the liberal notion.\"<ref name=Rollback>[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199505--.htm#TXT2.23 Rollback, Part II] Noam Chomsky, 1995</ref>}}\n\nIn regards to the IQ gap the question becomes whether racial groups can be shown to be influenced by different environmental factors that may account for the observed differences between them. Jensen originally argued that given the high heritability of IQ the only way that the IQ gap could be explained as caused by the environment would be if it could be shown that all black people were subject to a single \"x-factor\" which affected no white populations while affecting all black populations equally.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=A.R.|year=1998|title=''The ''g'' factor: The science of mental ability''|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-96103-9|ref=harv|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gfactorscienc00jens/page/456 456\u20138]|url=https://archive.org/details/gfactorscienc00jens/page/456}}</ref> Jensen considered the existence of such an x-factor to be extremely improbable, but Flynn's discovery of the Flynn effect showed that in spite of high heritability environmental factors could cause considerable disparities in IQ between generations of the same population, showing that the existence of such an x-factor was not only possible but real.{{sfn|Flynn|2012|pages=134\u2013141}}\n\nJensen has also argued that heritability of traits rises with age as the genetic potential of individuals becomes expressed. He sees this as related to the fact that the IQ gap between white and black test takers has been shown to appear gradually, with the gap widening as cohorts reach adulthood. This he sees as a further argument in favor of Spearman's hypothesis (see section below).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn contrast, Dickens and Flynn argued that the conventional interpretation ignores the role of [[feedback]] between factors, such as those with a small initial IQ advantage, genetic or environmental, seeking out more stimulating environments which will gradually greatly increase their advantage, which, as one consequence in their alternative model, would mean that the \"heritability\" figure is only in part due to direct effects of genotype on IQ.{{sfn|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}{{sfn|Nisbett|2009|p=212}}{{sfn|Dickens|Flynn|2001}}\n\nToday researchers such as {{harvp|Hunt|2010}}, {{harvp|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}} and {{harvp|Mackintosh|2011}} consider that rather than a single factor accounting for the entire gap, probably many different environmental factors differ systematically between the environments of white and black people converge to create part of the gap and perhaps all of it. They argue that it does not make sense to talk about a single universal heritability figure for IQ, rather, they state, heritability of IQ varies between and within groups. They point specifically to studies showing a higher heritability of test scores in white and medium-high SES families, but considerably lower heritability for black and low-SES families. This they interpret to mean that children who grow up with limited resources do not get to develop their full genetic potential.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}}\n\nMultiple studies have been conducted over the past several decades to survey scientific estimates on the heritability of the IQ gap. A [[The IQ Controversy, the Media and Public Policy (book)|review by Snydermann and Rothman]] in 1988 found that 45% of the scientists they questioned believed the gap to be \"a product of genetic and environmental variation,\" 15% and 1% respectively \"entirely to environmental\" and \"genetic variation,\" while the remaining 38% either declined to answer or stated that the evidence was inconclusive.<ref>Snyderman & Rothman (1987:255), cited in Eysenck (1994:66).</ref> The heritability of intelligence was estimated on average to be 59.6% for white Americans and 57.0% for black Americans among those who answered that the evidence was sufficiently conclusive.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=250}}</ref>{{broken footnote|date=March 2020}} The ''Wall Street Journal'' published an [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence|editorial by Linda Gottfredson in 1994]], signed by 52 professors specializing in intelligence and allied fields, that estimated the heritability of individual variation to range between 40\u201380%, but also stating that \"there is no definitive answer\" to explain the racial gap.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gottfredson |first=Linda |title=Mainstream Science on Intelligence: An Editorial With 52 Signatories, History, and Bibliography |url=http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf |journal=Intelligence |year=1997 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=13\u201323|doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(97)90011-8 }}</ref> Social psychologist [[Donald T.

This survey however yielded a response rate of 18% (228 participants) compared to Snyderman & Rothman's 65% (661 participants).<ref>{{Cite web|title=2013 survey of expert opinion on intelligence|authors=Heiner Rindermann, Thomas R.

The hypothesis was first formalized by [[Arthur Jensen]] who devised the statistical Method of Correlated Vectors to test it. Jensen holds that if Spearman's hypothesis holds true then some cognitive tasks have a higher g-load than others, and that these tasks are exactly the tasks in which the gap between black and white test takers are greatest. Jensen, and other psychometricians such as Rushton and Lynn, take this to show that the cause of ''g'' and the cause of the gap are the same\u2014in their view genetic differences.{{sfn|Rushton|Jensen|2005}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|pages=338\u201339}} acknowledges that Jensen and Rushton have shown a modest correlation between g-loading, heritability, and the test score gap, but did not accept that this demonstrates a genetic origin of the gap. Mackintosh points out that it is the results of exactly those tests that Rushton and Jensen consider to have the highest g-loading and heritability, such as the Wechsler test, that have seen the highest increases due to the Flynn effect. This likely suggests that they are also the most sensitive to environmental changes, which undermines Jensen's argument that the black-white gap is most likely caused by genetic factors. Mackintosh also argues that Spearman's hypothesis, which he considers to be likely to be correct, simply shows that the test score gap is based on whatever cognitive faculty is central to intelligence, but not what this factor is. {{harvtxt|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a|page=146}} make the same point, noting also that the increase in the IQ scores of black test takers is necessarily also an increase in ''g''.\n\nJames {{harvtxt|Flynn|2012|pages=140\u20131}} argues that there is an inherent flaw in Jensen's argument that the correlation between g-loadings, test scores and heritability support a genetic cause of the gap. He points out that as the difficulty of a task increases a low performing group will naturally fall further behind, and heritability will therefore also naturally increase. The same holds for increases in performance which will first affect the least difficult tasks, but only gradually affect the most difficult ones. Flynn thus sees the correlation between in g-loading and the test score gap to offer no clue to the cause of the gap.{{sfn|Flynn|2010}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=415}} states that many of conclusions of Jensen, and his colleagues rest on the validity of Spearman's hypothesis, and the method of correlated vectors used to test it. Hunt points out that other researchers have found this method of calculation to produce false positive results, and that other statistical methods should be used instead. According to Hunt, Jensen and Rushton's frequent claim that Spearman's hypothesis should be regarded as empirical fact does not hold, and that new studies based on better statistical methods would be required to confirm or reject the hypothesis that the correlation between g-loading, heritability and the IQ gap is due to IQ gaps consisting mostly of g.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Adoption studies===\nA number of studies have been done on the effect of similar rearing conditions on children from different races. The hypothesis is that by investigating whether black children adopted into white families demonstrated gains in IQ test scores relative to black children reared in black families. Depending on whether their test scores are more similar to their biological or adoptive families, that could be interpreted as either supporting a genetic or an environmental hypothesis. The main point of critique in studies like these however is whether the environment of black children\u2014even when raised in white families\u2014is truly comparable to the environment of white children. Several reviews of the [[adoption study]] literature has pointed out that it is perhaps impossible to avoid confounding of biological and environmental factors in this type of studies.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|p=337}} Given the differing heritability estimates in medium-high SES and low-SES families, {{harvtxt|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a|pages=134}} argue that adoption studies on the whole tend to overstate the role of genetics because they represent a restricted set of environments, mostly in the medium-high SES range.\n\nThe [[Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study]] (1976) examined the [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] test scores of 122 [[adopted]] children and 143 nonadopted children reared by advantaged white families. The children were restudied ten years later.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1992\">{{harvnb|Weinberg|Scarr|Waldman|1992}}</ref>{{sfn|Scarr|Weinberg|1976}}{{sfn|Loehlin|2000|p=185}} The study found higher IQ for white people compared to black people, both at age 7 and age 17.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1992\"/> Acknowledging the existence of confounding factors, Scarr and Weinberg, the authors of the original study, did not themselves consider that it provided support for either the hereditarian or environmentalist view.{{sfn|Scarr|Weinberg|1990}}\n\nThree other adoption studies found contrary evidence to the Minnesota study, lending support to a mostly environmental hypothesis: \n*{{harvp|Eyferth|1961}} studied the out-of-wedlock children of black and white soldiers stationed in Germany after World War 2 and then raised by white German mothers in what has become known as the [[Eyferth study]]. He found no significant differences in average IQ between groups. \n*{{harvp|Tizard et al.|1972}} studied black (West Indian), white, and mixed-race children raised in British long-stay residential nurseries. Two out of three tests found no significant differences. One test found higher scores for non-white people.\n*{{harvp|Moore|1986}} compared black and mixed-race children adopted by either black or white middle-class families in the United States. Moore observed that 23 black and interracial children raised by white parents had a significantly higher mean score than 23 age-matched children raised by black parents (117 vs 104), and argued that differences in early socialization explained these differences.\n\nFrydman and Lynn (1989) showed a mean IQ of 119 for Korean infants adopted by Belgian families. After correcting for the [[Flynn effect]], the IQ of the adopted Korean children was still 10 points higher than the indigenous Belgian children.{{sfn|Loehlin|2000|p=187}}{{sfn|Rushton|Jensen|2005}}<ref name=\"Frydman and Lynn\">{{cite journal |author=Frydman and Lynn |journal=Personality and Individual Differences  |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=1323\u20131325|year=1989 |url= |title=The intelligence of Korean children adopted in Belgium|ref=harv |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(89)90246-8}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the evidence from adoption studies, Mackintosh considers the studies by Tizard and Eyferth to be inconclusive, and the Minnesota study to be consistent only with a partial genetic hypothesis. On the whole, he finds that environmental and genetic variables remain confounded and considers evidence from adoption studies inconclusive, and fully compatible with a 100% environmental explanation.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|page=337}} Similarly, Drew Thomas argues that race differences in IQ that appear in adoption studies are in fact an artifact of methodology and that East Asian IQ advantages and Black IQ disadvantages disappear when this is controlled for.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Drew | year = 2017 | title = Racial IQ Differences among Transracial Adoptees: Fact or Artifact? | url = | journal = Journal of Intelligence | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 1 }}</ref>\n\n===Racial admixture studies===\nMost people have an ancestry from different geographic regions, particularly African Americans typically have ancestors from both Africa and Europe, with, on average, 20% of their genome inherited from European ancestors.<ref>{{harvnb|Bryc et al.|2009}}</ref> If racial IQ gaps have a partially genetic basis, one might expect black people with a higher degree of European ancestry to score higher on IQ tests than black people with less European ancestry, because the genes inherited from European ancestors would likely include some genes with a positive effect on IQ.{{sfn|Loehlin|2000}} Geneticist [[Alan Templeton]] has argued that an experiment based on the Mendelian \"common garden\" design where specimens with different hybrid compositions are subjected to the same environmental influences, would be the only way to definitively show a causal relation between genes and IQ. Summarizing the findings of admixture studies, he concludes that it has shown no significant correlation between any cognitive and the degree of African or European ancestry.{{sfn|Templeton|2001}}\n\nStudies have employed different ways of measuring or approximating relative degrees of ancestry from Africa and Europe. One set of studies have used skin color as a measure, and other studies have used blood groups. {{harvp|Loehlin|2000}} surveys the literature and argues that the blood groups studies may be seen as providing some support to the genetic hypothesis, even though the correlation between ancestry and IQ was quite low. He finds that studies by {{harvp|Eyferth|1961}}, Willerman, Naylor & Myrianthopoulos (1970) did not find a correlation between degree of African/European ancestry and IQ. The latter study did find a difference based on the race of the mother, with children of white mothers with black fathers scoring higher than children of black mothers and white fathers. Loehlin considers that such a finding is compatible with either a genetic or an environmental cause. All in all Loehlin finds admixture studies inconclusive and recommends more research.\n\nReviewing the evidence from admixture studies {{harvp|Hunt|2010}} considers it to be inconclusive because of too many uncontrolled variables. {{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|p=338}} quotes a statement by {{harvp|Nisbett|2009}} to the effect that admixture studies have not provided a shred of evidence in favor of a genetic basis for the gap.\n\n===Mental chronometry===\n{{Main|Mental chronometry}}\n[[Mental chronometry]] measures the elapsed time between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent behavioral response by the participant. This reaction time (RT) is considered a measure of the speed and efficiency with which the brain processes information.<ref name=\"Jensen 2006\">{{harvnb|Jensen|2006}}</ref> Scores on most types of RT tasks tend to correlate with scores on standard IQ tests as well as with ''g'', and no relationship has been found between RT and any other psychometric factors independent of ''g''.<ref name=\"Jensen 2006\"/> The strength of the correlation with IQ varies from one RT test to another, but [[Hans Eysenck]] gives 0.40 as a typical correlation under favorable conditions.<ref>{{harvnb|Eysenck|1987}}</ref> According to Jensen individual differences in RT have a substantial genetic component, and heritability is higher for performance on tests that correlate more strongly with IQ.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998\">{{harvnb|Jensen|1998}}</ref> Nisbett argues that some studies have found correlations closer to 0.2, and that the correlation is not always found.<ref name=\"Nisbett 2009\">{{harvnb|Nisbett|2009}}</ref><!--page number needed-->\n\nSeveral studies have found differences between races in average reaction times. These studies have generally found that reaction times among black, Asian and white children follow the same pattern as IQ scores.{{sfn|Lynn|Vanhanen|2002}}{{sfn|Jensen|Whang|1993}}{{sfn|Pesta|Poznanski|2008}} Black-white differences in reaction time, however, tend to be small (average [[effect size]] .18).{{sfn|Sheppard|Vernon|2008}} {{harvp|Rushton|Jensen|2005}} have argued that reaction time is independent of culture and that the existence of race differences in average reaction time is evidence that the cause of racial IQ gaps is partially genetic instead of entirely cultural. Responding to this argument in ''Intelligence and How to Get It'', Nisbett has pointed to the {{harvp|Jensen|Whang|1993}} study in which a group of Chinese Americans had longer reaction times than a group of European Americans, despite having higher IQs. Nisbett also mentions findings in {{harvp|Flynn|1991}} and {{harvp|Deary|2001}} suggesting that movement time (the measure of how long it takes a person to move a finger after making the decision to do so) correlates with IQ just as strongly as reaction time, and that average movement time is faster for black people than for white people.{{sfn|Nisbett|2009|pp=221\u20132}} {{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|page=339}} considers reaction time evidence unconvincing and points out that other cognitive tests that also correlate well with IQ show no disparity at all, for example the habituation/[[dishabituation]] test. And he points out that studies show that rhesus monkeys have shorter reaction times than American college students, suggesting that different reaction times may not tell us anything useful about intelligence.\n\n===Brain size===\n{{main|Brain size}}\nA number of studies have reported a moderate statistical correlation between differences in IQ and brain size between individuals in the same group.{{sfn|Deary|Penke|Johnson|2010}}{{sfn|McDaniel|2005}} Some scholars have reported differences in average brain sizes between racial groups,{{sfn|Ho et al.|1980}} although this is unlikely to be a good measure of IQ as brain size also differs between men and women, but without significant differences in IQ. At the same time newborn black children have the same average brain size as white children, suggesting that the difference in average size could be accounted for by differences in environment. Several factors that reduce brain size have been demonstrated to disproportionately affect black children.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}}\n\n[[Earl B. Hunt|Earl Hunt]] states that brain size is found to have a correlation of about .35 with intelligence among white people and cites studies showing that genes may account for as much as 90% of individual variation in brain size. According to Hunt, race differences in average brain size could potentially be an important argument for a possible genetic contribution to racial IQ gaps. Nonetheless, Hunt notes that Rushton's head size data would account for a difference of .09 standard deviations between black and white average test scores, less than a tenth of the 1.0 standard deviation gap in average scores that is observed.{{sfn|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}{{sfn|Hunt|2010|pp=433\u2013434}} Wicherts, Borsboom, & Dolan (2010) argue that black-white differences in brain size are insufficient to explain 91% to 95% of the black-white IQ gap.{{sfn|Wicherts|Borsboom|Dolan|2010b}}\n\n===Archaeological data===\nArchaeological evidence does not support claims by Rushton and others that black people' cognitive ability was inferior to white people' during prehistoric times as a result of evolution.{{sfn|MacEachern|2006}}\n\n==Policy relevance and ethics==\n{{Main|Intelligence and public policy}}\nThe 1996 report of the APA commented on the [[ethics]] of research on race and intelligence.<ref name=\"Hunt & Carlson 2007\">{{harvnb|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}</ref> {{harvp|Gray|Thompson|2004}} as well as {{harvp|Hunt|Carlson|2007}} have also discussed different possible ethical guidelines.<ref name=\"Hunt & Carlson 2007\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Gray|Thompson|2004}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=February 2013}} [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in 2009 featured two editorials on the ethics of research in race and intelligence by [[Steven Rose]] (against) and [[Stephen J.

Since then, there have been observed differences between average IQ scores of different population groups, but whether and to what extent these differences reflect environmental factors as opposed to genetic ones, as well as what the definitions of \"[[Race (human categorization)|race]]\" and \"[[intelligence]]\" are, and whether they can be objectively defined, is the subject of much dispute. At present, there is no direct evidence that these differences in test scores have a genetic component. The validity of IQ tests as a metric for general intelligence is itself disputed.\n\nThe first tests showing differences in IQ scores between different population groups in the United States were the tests of [[United States Army]] recruits in [[World War I]]. In the 1920s, groups of [[eugenics]] lobbyists argued that this demonstrated that [[African-Americans]] and certain immigrant groups were of inferior intellect to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[white people]], due to innate biological differences, using this as an argument for policies of [[racial segregation]]. However, soon, other studies appeared, contesting these conclusions and arguing instead that the Army tests had not adequately controlled for environmental factors, such as socio-economic and educational [[racial inequality in the United States|inequality between black people and white people]]. Later observations of phenomena such as the [[Flynn effect]] have also suggested that environmental factors play a greater role in group IQ differences than previously expected. \n\nThe causes of differences in IQ test scores are not well-understood, and the topic remains controversial among researchers.\n==History of the debate==\n{{Main|History of the race and intelligence controversy}}\n{{See also|Scientific racism}}\n[[File:Alfred Binet.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Alfred Binet]] (1857\u20131911), inventor of the first intelligence test]]\n\nClaims of races having different intelligence were used to justify [[colonialism]], [[slavery]], [[racism]], [[social Darwinism]], and racial [[eugenic]]s. Racial thinkers such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]] relied crucially on the assumption that black people were innately inferior to white people in developing their ideologies of [[white supremacy]]. Even enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], a slave owner, believed black people to be innately inferior to white people in physique and intellect.{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|p=23}}\n\n===Early IQ testing===\nThe first practical intelligence test was developed between 1905 and 1908 by [[Alfred Binet]] in France for school placement of children. Binet warned that results from his test should not be assumed to measure innate intelligence or used to label individuals permanently.{{sfn|Plotnik|Kouyoumdjian|2011}} Binet's test was translated into English and revised in 1916 by [[Lewis Terman]] (who introduced IQ scoring for the test results) and published under the name the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales]]. As Terman's test was published, there was great concern in the United States about the abilities and skills of recent immigrants. Different immigrant nationalities were sometimes thought to belong to different races, such as [[Slavs]]. A different set of tests developed by [[Robert Yerkes]] were used to evaluate draftees for World War I, and researchers found that people from southern and eastern Europe scored lower than native-born Americans, that Americans from northern states had higher scores than Americans from southern states, and that black Americans scored lower than white Americans.{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|page=116}} The results were widely publicized by a lobby of anti-immigration activists, including the New York patrician and conservationist [[Madison Grant]], who considered the [[Nordic race]] to be superior, but under threat of immigration by inferior breeds. In his influential work, ''A Study of American Intelligence,'' psychologist [[Carl Brigham]] used the results of the Army tests to argue for a stricter immigration policy, limiting immigration to countries considered to belong to the \"Nordic race\".{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|page=116, 309}}\n\nIn the 1920s, states like Virginia enacted [[eugenic]] laws, such as its [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|1924 Racial Integrity Act]], which established the [[one-drop rule]] as law. Many scientists reacted negatively to eugenicist claims linking abilities and moral character to racial or genetic ancestry. They pointed to the contribution of environment to test results (such as speaking English as a second language).{{sfn|Pickren|Rutherford|2010|p=163}} By the mid-1930s, many United States psychologists adopted the view that environmental and cultural factors played a dominant role in IQ test results, among them Carl Brigham, who repudiated his own previous arguments on the grounds that he realized that the tests were not a measure of innate intelligence. Discussion of the issue in the United States also influenced [[Germans|German]] [[Nazi]] claims of the \"Nordics\" being a \"[[master race]]\", influenced by Grant's writings.{{sfn|Spiro|2009}} As the American public sentiment shifted against the Germans, claims of racial differences in intelligence increasingly came to be regarded as problematic.<ref name=\"Ludy 2006\">{{harvnb|Ludy|2006}}</ref> Anthropologists such as [[Franz Boas]], and [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Gene Weltfish]], did much to demonstrate the unscientific status of many of the claims about racial hierarchies of intelligence.{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|pages=130\u201332}} Nonetheless, a powerful eugenics and segregation lobby funded largely by textile-magnate [[Wickliffe Draper]] continued to publicize studies using intelligence studies as an argument for eugenics, segregation, and anti-immigration legislation.{{sfn|Tucker|2002}}\n\n===Pioneer Fund and ''The Bell Curve''===\n{{See also|Pioneer Fund}}\nAs the de-segregation of the American South gained traction in the 1950s, debate about black intelligence resurfaced. [[Audrey Shuey]], funded by Draper's [[Pioneer fund|Pioneer Fund]], published a new analysis of Yerkes' tests, concluding that black people really were of inferior intellect to white people. This study was used by segregationists as an argument that it was to the advantage of black children to be educated separately from the superior white children.{{sfn|Jackson|2005}} In the 1960s, the debate was further revived when [[William Shockley]] publicly defended the argument that black children were innately unable to learn as well as white children.{{sfn|Shurkin|2006}} [[Arthur Jensen]] caused discussion of the issue with his ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'' article, \"[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?]]\", questioning remedial education for African-American children. He suggested their poor educational performance reflected an underlying genetic cause rather than lack of stimulation at home.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Panofsky |first1=Aaron |title=Misbehaving Science.

''The Bell Curve'' also led to a 1995 report from the [[American Psychological Association]], \"[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]\", acknowledging a difference between mean IQ scores of white people and black people as well as the absence of any adequate explanation of it, either environmental or genetic. ''The Bell Curve'' prompted the publication of several multiple-author books responding from a variety of points of view.<ref name=\"Mackintosh 1998\">{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1998}}</ref><ref name=\"Maltby, Day & Macaskill 2007\"/> They include ''[[The Bell Curve Debate]]'' (1995), ''[[Inequality by Design]]'' (1996) and a second edition of ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1996) by [[Stephen Jay Gould]].<ref name=\"Maltby, Day & Macaskill 2007\"/>\n\nSome of the authors proposing genetic explanations for group differences have received funding from the [[Pioneer Fund]], which was headed by [[J.

While there is some consensus about how to define intelligence, it is not universally accepted that it is  something that can be unequivocally measured by a single figure.<ref name=\"Schacter, Gilbert & Wegner 2007, pp 350-1\">{{harvnb|Schacter|Gilbert|Wegner|2007|pp=350\u20131}}</ref> A recurring criticism is that different societies value and promote different kinds of skills and that the concept of intelligence is therefore culturally variable and cannot be measured by the same criteria in different societies.<ref name=\"Schacter, Gilbert & Wegner 2007, pp 350-1\"/> Consequently, some critics argue that proposed relationships to other variables are necessarily tentative.<ref name=\"Sternberg, Grigorenko & Kidd 2005\">{{harvnb|Sternberg|Grigorenko|Kidd|2005}}</ref>\n\nIn relation to the study of racial differences in IQ test scores, it becomes a crucial question of what exactly it is that IQ tests measure. Arthur Jensen was a proponent of the view that there is a correlation between scores on all the known types of IQ tests, and that this correlation points to an underlying factor of [[general intelligence]], or ''g''. In most conceptions of ''g,'' it is considered to be fairly fixed in a given individual and unresponsive to training or other environmental influences. In this view, test score differences, especially in those tasks considered to be particularly \"g-loaded\", reflect the test taker's innate capability.\n\nOther psychometricians argue that, while there may or may not be a general intelligence factor, performance on tests relies crucially on knowledge acquired through prior exposure to the types of tasks that such tests contain. This view would mean that tests cannot be expected to reflect only the innate abilities of a given individual, because the expression of potential will always be mediated by experience and cognitive habits. It also means that comparison of test scores from persons with widely different life experiences and cognitive habits is not an expression of their relative innate potentials.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|p=359}}\n\n===Race===\n{{Main|Race (classification of humans)|Race and genetics}}\nThe majority of anthropologists today consider race to be a sociopolitical phenomenon rather than a biological one,{{sfn|Daley|Onwuegbuzie|2011|p=294}} a view supported by considerable genetics research.{{sfn|Smay|Armelagos|2000}}<ref>{{Cite journal| journal = Nature Genetics |date=2004 | volume = 36 |issue=11 Suppl | pages = 43\u201347 |author1=Rotimi, Charles N. | title = Are medical and nonmedical uses of large-scale genomic markers conflating genetics and 'race'? | doi=10.1038/ng1439 |quote=\"Two facts are relevant: (i) as a result of different evolutionary forces, including natural selection, there are geographical patterns of genetic variations that correspond, for the most part, to continental origin; and (ii) observed patterns of geographical differences in genetic information do not correspond to our notion of social identities, including 'race' and 'ethnicity\" | pmid=15508002}}</ref>  The current mainstream view in the social sciences and biology is that race is a social construction based on folk ideologies that construct groups based on social disparities and superficial physical characteristics.<ref>{{harvnb|Schaefer|2008}}</ref> {{harvp|Sternberg|Grigorenko|Kidd|2005}} state, \"Race is a socially constructed concept, not a biological one. It derives from people's desire to classify.\"<ref name=\"Sternberg, Grigorenko & Kidd 2005\"/> The concept of human \"races\" as natural and separate divisions within the human species has also been rejected by the [[American Anthropological Association]]. The official position of the AAA, adopted in 1998, is that advances in scientific knowledge have made it \"clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups\" and that \"any attempt to establish lines of division among biological populations [is] both arbitrary and subjective.\"<ref name=\"AAA\">{{harvnb|AAA|1998}}</ref>\n\nRace in studies of human intelligence is almost always determined using self-reports, rather than based on analyses of the genetic characteristics of the tested individuals. According to psychologist David Rowe, self-report is the preferred method for racial classification in studies of racial differences because classification based on genetic markers alone ignore the \"cultural, behavioral, sociological, psychological, and epidemiological variables\" that distinguish racial groups.<ref name=\"Rowe 2005\">{{harvnb|Rowe|2005}}</ref> Hunt and Carlson write that \"Nevertheless, self-identification is a surprisingly reliable guide to genetic composition. {{harvp|Tang et al.|2005}} applied mathematical clustering techniques to sort genomic markers for over 3,600 people in the United States and Taiwan into four groups. There was almost perfect agreement between cluster assignment and individuals' self-reports of racial/ethnic identification as white, black, East Asian, or Latino.\"<ref name=\"Hunt & Carlson 2007\">{{harvnb|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}</ref> Sternberg and Grigorenko disagree with Hunt and Carlson's interpretation of Tang, \"Tang et al.'s point was that ancient geographic ancestry rather than current residence is associated with self-identification and not that such self-identification provides evidence for the existence of biological race.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Sternberg|Grigorenko|2007}}</ref>\n\nAnthropologist [[C. Loring Brace]]<ref name=\"Brace 2005\">{{harvnb|Brace|2005}}</ref> and geneticist [[Joseph L. Graves|Joseph Graves]] disagree with the idea that cluster analysis and the correlation between self-reported race and genetic ancestry support biological race.<ref>{{harvnb|Graves|2001}}</ref>  They argue that while it is possible to find biological and genetic variation corresponding roughly to the groupings normally defined as races, this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clusters would be different. {{harvnb|Kaplan|2011}} therefore concludes that, while differences in particular allele frequencies can be used to identify populations that loosely correspond to the racial categories common in Western social discourse, the differences are of no more biological significance than the differences found between any human populations (e.g., the Spanish and Portuguese).\n\n[[Earl B. Hunt]] agrees that racial categories are defined by social conventions, though he points out that they also correlate with clusters of both genetic traits and cultural traits. Hunt explains that, due to this, racial IQ differences are caused by these variables that correlate with race, and race itself is rarely a causal variable. Researchers who study racial disparities in test scores are studying the relationship between the scores and the many race-related factors which could potentially affect performance. These factors include health, wealth, biological differences, and education.<ref name=\"Hunt 2010, pp 408\u201310\">{{harvnb|Hunt|2010|pp=408\u201310}}</ref>\n\n==Group differences==\nThe study of human intelligence is one of the most controversial topics in psychology. It remains unclear whether group differences in intelligence test scores are caused by heritable factors or by \"other correlated demographic variables such as [[socioeconomic]] status, [[Education|education level]], and motivation.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Hampshire|Highfield|Parkin|Owen|2012}}.</ref>\nHunt and Carlson outlined four contemporary positions on differences in IQ based on race or ethnicity. The first is that these reflect real differences in average group intelligence, which is caused by a combination of environmental factors and heritable differences in brain function. A second position is that differences in average cognitive ability between races are caused entirely by social and/or environmental factors. A third position holds that differences in average cognitive ability between races do not exist, and that the differences in average test scores are the result of inappropriate use of the tests themselves. Finally, a fourth position is that either or both of the concepts of [[race (classification of humans)|race]] and [[general intelligence factor|general intelligence]] are poorly constructed and therefore any comparisons between races are meaningless.<ref name=\"Hunt & Carlson 2007\"/>\n\n===Test scores===\n{{main|Achievement gap in the United States}}\nIn the US, generally, individuals identifying themselves as Asian tend to score higher on IQ tests than do Caucasians, who score higher than Hispanics, who score higher than African Americans. Nevertheless, greater variation in IQ scores exists within each ethnic group than between them.<ref name=SAGE>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDDqLBBk7BcC |title=Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education |date=2012 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=9781412981521 |pages=1209 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the controversial 1994 book ''[[The Bell Curve]]'', the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) formed a task-force of eleven experts, which issued a report, \"[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]\" in 1995. Regarding group differences, the report reaffirmed the consensus that differences within groups are much wider than difference between groups, and that that claims of ethnic difference in intelligence should be scrutinized carefully, as this had been used to justify racial discrimination. It also acknowledged limitations in the racial categories used, as these categories are neither consistently applied, nor homogeneous (see also [[race and ethnicity in the United States]]).{{sfn|Neisser|Boodoo|Bouchard|Boykin|1996}}\n\n{{harvp|Roth et al.|2001}}, in a review of the results of a total of 6,246,729 participants on other tests of cognitive ability or aptitude, found a difference in mean IQ scores between black people and white people of 1.1 SD. Consistent results were found for college and university application tests such as the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] (N = 2.4 million) and [[Graduate Record Examination]] (N = 2.3 million), as well as for tests of job applicants in corporate sections (N = 0.5 million) and in the military (N = 0.4 million).<ref name=\"Roth et al. 2001\">{{harvnb|Roth et al.|2001}}</ref> According to the same study, [[East Asia]]ns have tended to score relatively higher on visuospatial subtests with lower scores in verbal subtests while [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|Ashkenazi Jews score higher in verbal subtests]] with lower scores in visuospatial subtests.

Cultural differences may also factor in IQ test performance and outcomes. Therefore, results in the United States and Europe do not necessarily correlate to results in other populations.<ref>{{harvnb|Niu|Brass|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Flynn effect and the closing gap===\n{{Main|Flynn effect}}\nFor the past century raw scores on IQ tests have been rising; this score increase is known as the \"Flynn effect\", named after [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]]. In the United States, the increase was continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to about 1998 when the gains stopped and some tests even showed decreasing test scores. For example, in the United States the average scores of black people on some IQ tests in 1995 were the same as the scores of white people in 1945.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1998|p=162}}</ref> As one pair of academics phrased it, \"the typical African American today probably has a slightly higher IQ than the grandparents of today's average white American.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Swain | first = Carol | title = Contemporary voices of white nationalism in America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0521016933 | page = [https://archive.org/details/contemporaryvoic00swai/page/70 70] | url = https://archive.org/details/contemporaryvoic00swai/page/70 }} Note: this quote is from the authors' introductory essay, not from the interviews.</ref>\n\nFlynn has argued that given that these changes take place between one generation and the next it is highly unlikely that genetic factors could account for the increasing scores, which must then be caused by environmental factors. The Flynn Effect has often been used as an argument that the racial gap in IQ test scores must be environmental too, but this is not generally agreed \u2013 others have asserted that the two may have entirely different causes. A meta-analysis by Te Nijenhuis and [[Henk van der Flier|van der Flier]] (2013) concluded that the Flynn effect and group differences in intelligence were likely to have different causes. They stated that the Flynn effect is caused primarily by environmental factors and that it's unlikely these same environmental factors play an important role in explaining group differences in IQ.<ref name=\"Nijenhuis\">{{cite journal|last1=te Nijenhuis|first1=Jan |last2=van der Flier |first2=Henk | author-link2 = Henk van der Flier | title=Is the Flynn effect on g?: A meta-analysis|journal=Intelligence|volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=802\u2013807 |year=2013|url=|ref=harv |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2013.03.001}}</ref> The importance of the Flynn effect in the debate over the causes for the IQ gap lies in demonstrating that environmental factors may cause changes in test scores on the scale of 1 SD. This had previously been doubted.\n\nA separate phenomenon from the Flynn effect has been the discovery that the IQ gap has been gradually closing over the last decades of the 20th century, as black test-takers increased their average scores relative to white test-takers. For instance, Vincent reported in 1991 that the black-white IQ gap was decreasing among children, but that it was remaining constant among adults.{{sfn|Vincent|1991}} Similarly, a 2006 study by Dickens and Flynn estimated that the difference between mean scores of black people and white people closed by about 5 or 6 IQ points between 1972 and 2002,{{sfn|Dickens|Flynn|2006}} a reduction of about one-third. In the same period, the educational achievement disparity also diminished.<ref>Neisser, Ulric (Ed). 1998. The rising curve: Long-term gains in IQ and related measures. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association</ref> In a 2006 study, Murray agreed with Dickens and Flynn that there has been a narrowing of the difference; \"Dickens' and Flynn's estimate of 3\u20136 IQ points from a base of about 16\u201318 points is a useful, though provisional, starting point\". But he argued that this has stalled and that there has been no further narrowing for people born after the late 1970s.{{sfn|Murray|2006}} A subsequent study by Murray, based on the [[Woodcock\u2013Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities]], estimated that the black-white IQ difference decreased by about one-half of one standard deviation from those born in the 1920s to those born in the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Murray|2007}} Recent reviews by Flynn and Dickens (2006), Mackintosh (2011), and Nisbett ''et al.'' 2012 accept the gradual closing of the gap as a fact. In his review of the historical trends, {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=411}} states: \"There is some variety in the results, but not a great deal. The African American means are about 1 standard deviation unit (15 points on the IQ scale) below the white means, and the Hispanic means fall in between.\"\n\nSome studies reviewed by {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=418}} found that rise in the average achievement of African Americans was caused by a reduction in the number of African American students in the lowest range of scores without a corresponding increase in the number of students in the highest ranges. A 2012 review of the literature found that the IQ gap had diminished by 0.33 standard deviations since first reported.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}}{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012b}}\n\nA 2013 analysis of the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] found that from 1971 to 2008, the size of the black\u2013white IQ gap in the United States decreased from 16.33 to 9.94 IQ points. It has also concluded however that, while IQ means are continuing to rise in all ethnic groups, this growth is occurring more slowly among 17-year-old students than among younger students and the black-white IQ gap is no longer narrowing. As of 2008, a study published in 2013 by Heiner Rindermann, Stefan Pinchelmann, and James Thompson have estimated the IQ means of 17-year-old black, white, and Hispanic students to range respectively from 90.45\u201394.15, 102.29\u2013104.57 and 92.30\u201395.90 points. They explain that the gap may persist due to the [[crack epidemic]], the degradation of [[African-American family structure]], the rise of fraud in the educational system (especially with respect to ''[[No Child Left Behind]]''), the decrease in unskilled real wages and employment among African-Americans due to [[globalization]] and [[minimum wage]] increases, differences in parental practices (such as breastfeeding or reading to children), and \"environmental conditions shaped by [African-Americans] themselves.\" To resolve this, they ultimately recommend the reestablishment of \"meritoric principles\" and \"blindly graded objective central exams,\" as opposed to \"[[affirmative action|ethnically based policies]],\" in education.{{sfn|Rindermann|Thompson|2013}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rindermann|first1=Heiner|last2=Pinchelmann|first2=Stefan|title=Future Cognitive Ability: US IQ Prediction until 2060 Based on NAEP|journal=PLOS One|date=13 October 2015|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0138412|pmid=26460731|pmc=4603674|volume=10|issue=10|page=e0138412|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1038412R}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental influences on group differences in IQ==\nThe following environmental factors are some of those suggested as explaining a portion of the differences in average IQ between races.

Templeton]] argues that the question about the possible genetic effects on the test score gap is muddled by the general focus on \"race\" rather than on populations defined by gene frequency or by geographical proximity, and by the general insistence on phrasing the question in terms of heritability.<ref name=\"Templeton 2001\">{{harvnb|Templeton|2001}}</ref> Templeton points out that racial groups neither represent [[sub-species]] nor distinct [[lineage (evolution)|evolutionary lineages]], and that therefore there is no basis for making claims about the general intelligence of races.<ref name=\"Templeton 2001\"/> From this point of view the search for possible genetic influences on the black-white test score gap is a priori flawed, because there is no genetic material shared by all  Africans or by all Europeans. {{harvp|Mackintosh|2011}}, however, argues that by using genetic cluster analysis to correlate gene frequencies with continental populations it might be possible to show that African populations have a higher frequency of certain genetic variants that contribute to an average lower intelligence. Such a hypothetical situation could hold without all Africans carrying the same genes or belonging to a single evolutionary lineage. According to Mackintosh, a biological basis for the gap thus cannot be ruled out on a priori grounds.\n\nIntelligence is a [[polygenic trait]]. This means that intelligence is under the influence of several genes, possibly several thousand. The effect of most individual genetic variants on intelligence is thought to be very small, well below 1% of the variance in ''g''. Current studies using [[quantitative trait loci]] have yielded little success in the search for genes influencing intelligence. [[Robert Plomin]] is confident that QTLs responsible for the variation in IQ scores exist, but due to their small effect sizes, more powerful tools of analysis will be required to detect them.<ref>{{harvnb|Plomin|Kennedy|Craig|2005|p=513}}</ref> Others assert that no useful answers can be reasonably expected from such research before an understanding of the relation between DNA and human phenotypes emerges.<ref name=\"Cooper 2005\">{{harvnb|Cooper|2005}}</ref> Several candidate genes have been proposed to have a relationship with intelligence.<ref>{{harvnb|Zinkstok et al.|2007}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dick et al.|2007}}</ref> However, a review of candidate genes for intelligence published in {{harvp|Deary|Johnson|Houlihan|2009}} failed to find evidence of an association between these genes and general intelligence, stating \"there is still almost no replicated evidence concerning the individual genes, which have variants that contribute to intelligence differences\".<ref name=\"Deary, Johnson & Houlihan 2009\">{{harvnb|Deary|Johnson|Houlihan|2009}}</ref> In 2001, a review in the ''[[Journal of Black Psychology]]'' refuted eight major premises on which the hereditarian view regarding race and intelligence is based.<ref name=\"Onwegbuzie & Daley 2001\">{{harvnb|Onwuegbuzie|Daley|2001}}</ref>\n\nA 2005 literature review article by Sternberg, Grigorenko and Kidd stated that no gene has been shown to be linked to intelligence, \"so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time\".{{sfn|Sternberg|Grigorenko|Kidd|2005|p=46}} {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=447}} and {{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|page=344}} concurred, both scholars noting that while several environmental factors have been shown to influence the IQ gap, the evidence for a genetic influence has been circumstantial, and according to Mackintosh negligible. Mackintosh however suggests that it may never become possible to account satisfyingly for the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors. The 2012 review by {{harvp|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair| Dickens|2012a}} concluded that \"Almost no genetic polymorphisms have been discovered that are consistently associated with variation in IQ in the normal range\". Hunt and several other researchers however maintain that genetic causes cannot be ruled out, and that new evidence may yet show a genetic contribution to the gap. Hunt concurs with Rushton and Jensen who considered the 100% environmental hypothesis to be impossible. Nonetheless, Nisbett and colleagues (2012) consider the entire IQ gap to be explained by the environmental factors that have thus far been demonstrated to influence it, and Mackintosh does not find this view to be unreasonable.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}}\n\n===Heritability within and between groups===\n[[File:Heritability plants.jpeg|thumb| An environmental factor that varies between groups but not within groups can cause group differences in a trait that is otherwise 100 percent [[heritable]].]]\n\n[[Twin studies]] of intelligence have reported high heritability values. However, these studies are based on questionable assumptions.{{sfn|Carson|Beckwith|2001}} When used in the context of human [[behavior genetics]], the term \"heritability\" is highly misleading, as it does not convey any information about the relative importance of genetic or environmental factors on the development of a given trait, nor does it convey the extent to which that trait is genetically determined.{{sfn|Moore|Shenk|2016}} Arguments in support of a genetic explanation of racial differences in IQ are sometimes fallacious. For instance, hereditarians have sometimes cited the failure of known environmental factors to account for such differences, or the high heritability of intelligence within races, as evidence that racial differences in IQ are genetic.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1984}}</ref>\n\nPsychometricians have found that intelligence is substantially heritable within populations, with 30\u201350% of variance in IQ scores in early childhood being attributable to genetic factors in analyzed US populations, increasing to 75\u201380% by late adolescence.{{sfn|Neisser|Boodoo|Bouchard|Boykin|1996}}<ref name=\"Deary, Johnson & Houlihan 2009\"/> In biology heritability  is defined as the ratio of variation attributable to genetic differences in an observable [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the trait's total observable variation. The heritability of a trait describes the proportion of variation in the trait that is attributable to genetic factors within a particular population. A heritability of 1 indicates that variation correlates fully with genetic variation and a heritability of 0 indicates that there is no correlation between the trait and genes at all. In psychological testing, heritability tends to be understood as the degree of correlation between the results of a test taker and those of their biological parents. However, since high heritability is simply a correlation between traits and genes, it does not describe the causes of heritability which in humans can be either genetic or environmental.\n\nTherefore, a high heritability measure does not imply that a trait is genetic or unchangeable, however, as environmental factors that affect all group members equally will not be measured by heritability and the heritability of a trait may also change over time in response to changes in the distribution of genes and environmental factors.{{sfn|Neisser|Boodoo|Bouchard|Boykin|1996}} High heritability also doesn't imply that all of the heritability is genetically determined, but can also be due to environmental differences that affect only a certain genetically defined group (indirect heritability).<ref name=\"Block 2002\">{{harvnb|Block|2002}}</ref> The figure to the left demonstrates how heritability works. In both gardens the difference between tall and short cornstalks is 100% heritable as cornstalks that are genetically disposed for growing tall will become taller than those without this disposition, but the difference in height between the cornstalks to the left and those on the right is 100% environmental as it is due to different nutrients being supplied to the two gardens. Hence the causes of differences within a group and between groups may not be the same, even when looking at traits that are highly heritable.<ref name=\"Block 2002\" /> In his [[The Bell Curve#Cognitive sorting|criticism of ''the Bell Curve'']], [[Noam Chomsky]] further illustrated this with the example of women wearing earrings:{{quote|To borrow an example from Ned Block, \"some years ago when only women wore earrings, the heritability of having an earring was high because differences in whether a person had an earring was due to a chromosomal difference, XX vs. XY.\" No one has yet suggested that wearing earrings, or ties, is \"in our genes,\" an inescapable fate that environment cannot influence, \"dooming the liberal notion.\"<ref name=Rollback>[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199505--.htm#TXT2.23 Rollback, Part II] Noam Chomsky, 1995</ref>}}\n\nIn regards to the IQ gap the question becomes whether racial groups can be shown to be influenced by different environmental factors that may account for the observed differences between them. Jensen originally argued that given the high heritability of IQ the only way that the IQ gap could be explained as caused by the environment would be if it could be shown that all black people were subject to a single \"x-factor\" which affected no white populations while affecting all black populations equally.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=A.R.|year=1998|title=''The ''g'' factor: The science of mental ability''|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-96103-9|ref=harv|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gfactorscienc00jens/page/456 456\u20138]|url=https://archive.org/details/gfactorscienc00jens/page/456}}</ref> Jensen considered the existence of such an x-factor to be extremely improbable, but Flynn's discovery of the Flynn effect showed that in spite of high heritability environmental factors could cause considerable disparities in IQ between generations of the same population, showing that the existence of such an x-factor was not only possible but real.{{sfn|Flynn|2012|pages=134\u2013141}}\n\nJensen has also argued that heritability of traits rises with age as the genetic potential of individuals becomes expressed. He sees this as related to the fact that the IQ gap between white and black test takers has been shown to appear gradually, with the gap widening as cohorts reach adulthood. This he sees as a further argument in favor of Spearman's hypothesis (see section below).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn contrast, Dickens and Flynn argued that the conventional interpretation ignores the role of [[feedback]] between factors, such as those with a small initial IQ advantage, genetic or environmental, seeking out more stimulating environments which will gradually greatly increase their advantage, which, as one consequence in their alternative model, would mean that the \"heritability\" figure is only in part due to direct effects of genotype on IQ.{{sfn|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}{{sfn|Nisbett|2009|p=212}}{{sfn|Dickens|Flynn|2001}}\n\nToday researchers such as {{harvp|Hunt|2010}}, {{harvp|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}} and {{harvp|Mackintosh|2011}} consider that rather than a single factor accounting for the entire gap, probably many different environmental factors differ systematically between the environments of white and black people converge to create part of the gap and perhaps all of it. They argue that it does not make sense to talk about a single universal heritability figure for IQ, rather, they state, heritability of IQ varies between and within groups. They point specifically to studies showing a higher heritability of test scores in white and medium-high SES families, but considerably lower heritability for black and low-SES families. This they interpret to mean that children who grow up with limited resources do not get to develop their full genetic potential.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}}\n\nMultiple studies have been conducted over the past several decades to survey scientific estimates on the heritability of the IQ gap. A [[The IQ Controversy, the Media and Public Policy (book)|review by Snydermann and Rothman]] in 1988 found that 45% of the scientists they questioned believed the gap to be \"a product of genetic and environmental variation,\" 15% and 1% respectively \"entirely to environmental\" and \"genetic variation,\" while the remaining 38% either declined to answer or stated that the evidence was inconclusive.<ref>Snyderman & Rothman (1987:255), cited in Eysenck (1994:66).</ref> The heritability of intelligence was estimated on average to be 59.6% for white Americans and 57.0% for black Americans among those who answered that the evidence was sufficiently conclusive.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=250}}</ref>{{broken footnote|date=March 2020}} The ''Wall Street Journal'' published an [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence|editorial by Linda Gottfredson in 1994]], signed by 52 professors specializing in intelligence and allied fields, that estimated the heritability of individual variation to range between 40\u201380%, but also stating that \"there is no definitive answer\" to explain the racial gap.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gottfredson |first=Linda |title=Mainstream Science on Intelligence: An Editorial With 52 Signatories, History, and Bibliography |url=http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf |journal=Intelligence |year=1997 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=13\u201323|doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(97)90011-8 }}</ref> Social psychologist [[Donald T.

This survey however yielded a response rate of 18% (228 participants) compared to Snyderman & Rothman's 65% (661 participants).<ref>{{Cite web|title=2013 survey of expert opinion on intelligence|authors=Heiner Rindermann, Thomas R.

The hypothesis was first formalized by [[Arthur Jensen]] who devised the statistical Method of Correlated Vectors to test it. Jensen holds that if Spearman's hypothesis holds true then some cognitive tasks have a higher g-load than others, and that these tasks are exactly the tasks in which the gap between black and white test takers are greatest. Jensen, and other psychometricians such as Rushton and Lynn, take this to show that the cause of ''g'' and the cause of the gap are the same\u2014in their view genetic differences.{{sfn|Rushton|Jensen|2005}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|pages=338\u201339}} acknowledges that Jensen and Rushton have shown a modest correlation between g-loading, heritability, and the test score gap, but did not accept that this demonstrates a genetic origin of the gap. Mackintosh points out that it is the results of exactly those tests that Rushton and Jensen consider to have the highest g-loading and heritability, such as the Wechsler test, that have seen the highest increases due to the Flynn effect. This likely suggests that they are also the most sensitive to environmental changes, which undermines Jensen's argument that the black-white gap is most likely caused by genetic factors. Mackintosh also argues that Spearman's hypothesis, which he considers to be likely to be correct, simply shows that the test score gap is based on whatever cognitive faculty is central to intelligence, but not what this factor is. {{harvtxt|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a|page=146}} make the same point, noting also that the increase in the IQ scores of black test takers is necessarily also an increase in ''g''.\n\nJames {{harvtxt|Flynn|2012|pages=140\u20131}} argues that there is an inherent flaw in Jensen's argument that the correlation between g-loadings, test scores and heritability support a genetic cause of the gap. He points out that as the difficulty of a task increases a low performing group will naturally fall further behind, and heritability will therefore also naturally increase. The same holds for increases in performance which will first affect the least difficult tasks, but only gradually affect the most difficult ones. Flynn thus sees the correlation between in g-loading and the test score gap to offer no clue to the cause of the gap.{{sfn|Flynn|2010}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=415}} states that many of conclusions of Jensen, and his colleagues rest on the validity of Spearman's hypothesis, and the method of correlated vectors used to test it. Hunt points out that other researchers have found this method of calculation to produce false positive results, and that other statistical methods should be used instead. According to Hunt, Jensen and Rushton's frequent claim that Spearman's hypothesis should be regarded as empirical fact does not hold, and that new studies based on better statistical methods would be required to confirm or reject the hypothesis that the correlation between g-loading, heritability and the IQ gap is due to IQ gaps consisting mostly of g.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Adoption studies===\nA number of studies have been done on the effect of similar rearing conditions on children from different races. The hypothesis is that by investigating whether black children adopted into white families demonstrated gains in IQ test scores relative to black children reared in black families. Depending on whether their test scores are more similar to their biological or adoptive families, that could be interpreted as either supporting a genetic or an environmental hypothesis. The main point of critique in studies like these however is whether the environment of black children\u2014even when raised in white families\u2014is truly comparable to the environment of white children. Several reviews of the [[adoption study]] literature has pointed out that it is perhaps impossible to avoid confounding of biological and environmental factors in this type of studies.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|p=337}} Given the differing heritability estimates in medium-high SES and low-SES families, {{harvtxt|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a|pages=134}} argue that adoption studies on the whole tend to overstate the role of genetics because they represent a restricted set of environments, mostly in the medium-high SES range.\n\nThe [[Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study]] (1976) examined the [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] test scores of 122 [[adopted]] children and 143 nonadopted children reared by advantaged white families. The children were restudied ten years later.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1992\">{{harvnb|Weinberg|Scarr|Waldman|1992}}</ref>{{sfn|Scarr|Weinberg|1976}}{{sfn|Loehlin|2000|p=185}} The study found higher IQ for white people compared to black people, both at age 7 and age 17.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1992\"/> Acknowledging the existence of confounding factors, Scarr and Weinberg, the authors of the original study, did not themselves consider that it provided support for either the hereditarian or environmentalist view.{{sfn|Scarr|Weinberg|1990}}\n\nThree other adoption studies found contrary evidence to the Minnesota study, lending support to a mostly environmental hypothesis: \n*{{harvp|Eyferth|1961}} studied the out-of-wedlock children of black and white soldiers stationed in Germany after World War 2 and then raised by white German mothers in what has become known as the [[Eyferth study]]. He found no significant differences in average IQ between groups. \n*{{harvp|Tizard et al.|1972}} studied black (West Indian), white, and mixed-race children raised in British long-stay residential nurseries. Two out of three tests found no significant differences. One test found higher scores for non-white people.\n*{{harvp|Moore|1986}} compared black and mixed-race children adopted by either black or white middle-class families in the United States. Moore observed that 23 black and interracial children raised by white parents had a significantly higher mean score than 23 age-matched children raised by black parents (117 vs 104), and argued that differences in early socialization explained these differences.\n\nFrydman and Lynn (1989) showed a mean IQ of 119 for Korean infants adopted by Belgian families. After correcting for the [[Flynn effect]], the IQ of the adopted Korean children was still 10 points higher than the indigenous Belgian children.{{sfn|Loehlin|2000|p=187}}{{sfn|Rushton|Jensen|2005}}<ref name=\"Frydman and Lynn\">{{cite journal |author=Frydman and Lynn |journal=Personality and Individual Differences  |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=1323\u20131325|year=1989 |url= |title=The intelligence of Korean children adopted in Belgium|ref=harv |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(89)90246-8}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the evidence from adoption studies, Mackintosh considers the studies by Tizard and Eyferth to be inconclusive, and the Minnesota study to be consistent only with a partial genetic hypothesis. On the whole, he finds that environmental and genetic variables remain confounded and considers evidence from adoption studies inconclusive, and fully compatible with a 100% environmental explanation.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|page=337}} Similarly, Drew Thomas argues that race differences in IQ that appear in adoption studies are in fact an artifact of methodology and that East Asian IQ advantages and Black IQ disadvantages disappear when this is controlled for.<ref>Thomas, Drew. \"Racial IQ Differences among Transracial Adoptees: Fact or Artifact?.\" Journal of Intelligence 5, no. 1 (2017): 1.</ref>\n\n===Racial admixture studies===\nMost people have an ancestry from different geographic regions, particularly African Americans typically have ancestors from both Africa and Europe, with, on average, 20% of their genome inherited from European ancestors.<ref>{{harvnb|Bryc et al.|2009}}</ref> If racial IQ gaps have a partially genetic basis, one might expect black people with a higher degree of European ancestry to score higher on IQ tests than black people with less European ancestry, because the genes inherited from European ancestors would likely include some genes with a positive effect on IQ.{{sfn|Loehlin|2000}} Geneticist [[Alan Templeton]] has argued that an experiment based on the Mendelian \"common garden\" design where specimens with different hybrid compositions are subjected to the same environmental influences, would be the only way to definitively show a causal relation between genes and IQ. Summarizing the findings of admixture studies, he concludes that it has shown no significant correlation between any cognitive and the degree of African or European ancestry.{{sfn|Templeton|2001}}\n\nStudies have employed different ways of measuring or approximating relative degrees of ancestry from Africa and Europe. One set of studies have used skin color as a measure, and other studies have used blood groups. {{harvp|Loehlin|2000}} surveys the literature and argues that the blood groups studies may be seen as providing some support to the genetic hypothesis, even though the correlation between ancestry and IQ was quite low. He finds that studies by {{harvp|Eyferth|1961}}, Willerman, Naylor & Myrianthopoulos (1970) did not find a correlation between degree of African/European ancestry and IQ. The latter study did find a difference based on the race of the mother, with children of white mothers with black fathers scoring higher than children of black mothers and white fathers. Loehlin considers that such a finding is compatible with either a genetic or an environmental cause. All in all Loehlin finds admixture studies inconclusive and recommends more research.\n\nReviewing the evidence from admixture studies {{harvp|Hunt|2010}} considers it to be inconclusive because of too many uncontrolled variables. {{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|p=338}} quotes a statement by {{harvp|Nisbett|2009}} to the effect that admixture studies have not provided a shred of evidence in favor of a genetic basis for the gap.\n\n===Mental chronometry===\n{{Main|Mental chronometry}}\n[[Mental chronometry]] measures the elapsed time between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent behavioral response by the participant. This reaction time (RT) is considered a measure of the speed and efficiency with which the brain processes information.<ref name=\"Jensen 2006\">{{harvnb|Jensen|2006}}</ref> Scores on most types of RT tasks tend to correlate with scores on standard IQ tests as well as with ''g'', and no relationship has been found between RT and any other psychometric factors independent of ''g''.<ref name=\"Jensen 2006\"/> The strength of the correlation with IQ varies from one RT test to another, but [[Hans Eysenck]] gives 0.40 as a typical correlation under favorable conditions.<ref>{{harvnb|Eysenck|1987}}</ref> According to Jensen individual differences in RT have a substantial genetic component, and heritability is higher for performance on tests that correlate more strongly with IQ.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998\">{{harvnb|Jensen|1998}}</ref> Nisbett argues that some studies have found correlations closer to 0.2, and that the correlation is not always found.<ref name=\"Nisbett 2009\">{{harvnb|Nisbett|2009}}</ref><!--page number needed-->\n\nSeveral studies have found differences between races in average reaction times. These studies have generally found that reaction times among black, Asian and white children follow the same pattern as IQ scores.{{sfn|Lynn|Vanhanen|2002}}{{sfn|Jensen|Whang|1993}}{{sfn|Pesta|Poznanski|2008}} Black-white differences in reaction time, however, tend to be small (average [[effect size]] .18).{{sfn|Sheppard|Vernon|2008}} {{harvp|Rushton|Jensen|2005}} have argued that reaction time is independent of culture and that the existence of race differences in average reaction time is evidence that the cause of racial IQ gaps is partially genetic instead of entirely cultural. Responding to this argument in ''Intelligence and How to Get It'', Nisbett has pointed to the {{harvp|Jensen|Whang|1993}} study in which a group of Chinese Americans had longer reaction times than a group of European Americans, despite having higher IQs. Nisbett also mentions findings in {{harvp|Flynn|1991}} and {{harvp|Deary|2001}} suggesting that movement time (the measure of how long it takes a person to move a finger after making the decision to do so) correlates with IQ just as strongly as reaction time, and that average movement time is faster for black people than for white people.{{sfn|Nisbett|2009|pp=221\u20132}} {{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|page=339}} considers reaction time evidence unconvincing and points out that other cognitive tests that also correlate well with IQ show no disparity at all, for example the habituation/[[dishabituation]] test. And he points out that studies show that rhesus monkeys have shorter reaction times than American college students, suggesting that different reaction times may not tell us anything useful about intelligence.\n\n===Brain size===\n{{main|Brain size}}\nA number of studies have reported a moderate statistical correlation between differences in IQ and brain size between individuals in the same group.{{sfn|Deary|Penke|Johnson|2010}}{{sfn|McDaniel|2005}} Some scholars have reported differences in average brain sizes between racial groups,{{sfn|Ho et al.|1980}} although this is unlikely to be a good measure of IQ as brain size also differs between men and women, but without significant differences in IQ. At the same time newborn black children have the same average brain size as white children, suggesting that the difference in average size could be accounted for by differences in environment. Several factors that reduce brain size have been demonstrated to disproportionately affect black children.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}}\n\n[[Earl B. Hunt|Earl Hunt]] states that brain size is found to have a correlation of about .35 with intelligence among white people and cites studies showing that genes may account for as much as 90% of individual variation in brain size. According to Hunt, race differences in average brain size could potentially be an important argument for a possible genetic contribution to racial IQ gaps. Nonetheless, Hunt notes that Rushton's head size data would account for a difference of .09 standard deviations between black and white average test scores, less than a tenth of the 1.0 standard deviation gap in average scores that is observed.{{sfn|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}{{sfn|Hunt|2010|pp=433\u2013434}} Wicherts, Borsboom, & Dolan (2010) argue that black-white differences in brain size are insufficient to explain 91% to 95% of the black-white IQ gap.{{sfn|Wicherts|Borsboom|Dolan|2010b}}\n\n===Archaeological data===\nArchaeological evidence does not support claims by Rushton and others that black people' cognitive ability was inferior to white people' during prehistoric times as a result of evolution.{{sfn|MacEachern|2006}}\n\n==Policy relevance and ethics==\n{{Main|Intelligence and public policy}}\nThe 1996 report of the APA commented on the [[ethics]] of research on race and intelligence.<ref name=\"Hunt & Carlson 2007\">{{harvnb|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}</ref> {{harvp|Gray|Thompson|2004}} as well as {{harvp|Hunt|Carlson|2007}} have also discussed different possible ethical guidelines.<ref name=\"Hunt & Carlson 2007\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Gray|Thompson|2004}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=February 2013}} [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in 2009 featured two editorials on the ethics of research in race and intelligence by [[Steven Rose]] (against) and [[Stephen J.
