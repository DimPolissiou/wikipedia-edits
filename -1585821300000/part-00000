He is taken to [[London]] by his uncle Sir Charles Tregellis, a highly respected gentleman and arbiter of fashion who is on familiar terms with the most important people of Great Britain. The novel interweaves Rodney's coming-of-age story with that of his friend Boy Jim's boxing endeavours. Jim has been brought up thinking he is a blacksmith's son - the blacksmith Harrison was a famous former boxer and the 'son' wishes to fight too.  So a large portion of it deals with the famous bare-knuckle boxers of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such as [[James Belcher|Jem Belcher]], [[John Jackson (English boxer)|John Jackson]], [[Daniel Mendoza]], [[Dutch Sam]], and others.  The book includes vignettes of a number of historical personages, notably the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]], [[Lord Nelson]], [[Sir John Lade]], [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] and [[Beau Brummell]]. There are also descriptions of thuggery, og gambling and cheating, and of dangerous horse drawn chases.\n\nIt was adapted into a 1913 silent film, ''[[The House of Temperley]]'', directed by [[Harold M. Shaw]].\n\nThe novel was dramatised as a four-part serial on BBC Radio 4 in 1983, which was repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra in March 2020.\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource}}\n{{Gutenberg|no=5148|name=Rodney Stone}}\n\n{{Conan Doyle}}\n\n[[Category:1896 British novels]]\n[[Category:Scottish novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Arthur Conan Doyle]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Sussex]]\n[[Category:Novels set in London]]\n[[Category:Novels about boxing]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of George IV]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Horatio Nelson]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Beau Brummell]]\n\n{{1890s-novel-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{unreferenced|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:RodneyStone.jpg|thumb|First US edition<br>(publ.

The literary works of the [[Sangam period]], namely Akamkrithikal, Pathittipattu and Chilppathikaram, depict the ancient policing system. The feudal system which existed in ancient Kerala gave way to a new structure under the Cheras, comprising Thara, Desomand Nadu ruled by Madampi, Desavazhi and Naduvazhi respectively. The semblance of a modern police force was created in the late 19th century in [[Travancore]] under the British rule. There was no unified geographical entity as 'Kerala' before 1956. The present Kerala Police Department was formed in the same year by re-organizing and merging of police forces in Travancore-Cochin States and the British [[Malabar region|Malabar]] State.<ref>{{cite web|title=Police in ancient Kerala|url=http://keralapolice.gov.in/kerala-police/history/police-in-ancient-kerala|website=keralapolice.gov.in|accessdate=30 Nov 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Modern Police|url=http://keralapolice.gov.in/kerala-police/history/modern-police|website=keralapolice.gov.in|accessdate=30 Nov 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nState police Chief is an IPS official with the rank of [[Director general of police]].
