{"title_page": "Emerico di Quart", "text_new": "'''\u00c9meric de Quart''' (known in Italian as ''Emerico de Quart''), born in the latter part of the 13th century at the castle of [[Quart, Italy|Quart]] in the [[Aosta Valley]], was [[Bishop of Aosta]] from 1302 until his death on 1 September 1313. \nHe is more frequently named in ancient documents as ''Eymericus'' than ''Emericus'' or even ''Aimericus''.\n\n==Life==\nBorn in one of the most powerful families of [[Aosta Valley]], \u00c9meric or Aymeri de Quart was the son of Zacharie, known as Jacques II, lord of [[Quart, Aosta Valley|Quart]], of the ancient and noble Aosta family \u00ab de la Porte Saint-Ours \u00bb,<ref>Alessandro Barbero, ''Valle d'Aosta medievale'', Liguori, {{ISBN|88-207-3162-2}}, p.144</ref> who gave three bishops to the [[Diocese of Aosta]]. The elder brother of \u00c9meric, Jacques III, assured the lineage while Aymon de Quart was [[Bishop of Geneva]], and Guillaume de Quart was an archbishop. Additionally his brother Henri was provost of the [[Aosta Cathedral]] from 1288 until 1318.<ref>[[Joseph-Marie Henry]], ''Histoire populaire, religieuse et civile de la Vall\u00e9e d'Aoste'' (1929), re-edited in 1967, p.151.</ref>\n\nAfter finishing theological studies, \u00c9meric chose to live apart from his noble family as a simple priest in a contemplative and [[Ascetism|ascetic]] manner. After some years however, he decided to reach out to the regular canonics of the [[Aosta Cathedral]]. During this period \u00c9meric was appreciated as a very worthy and pious priest and a friend of the poor.\n\nIn October 1301 he was appointed the new Augustan bishop by all the canonics of Aosta including the ones of Saint Peter and Ursus capitol and in January 1302 he was consecrated as bishop in [[Biella]] by Aimo of Challant, [[bishop]] of [[Vercelli]].\n\nAll his biographers agree about his worthy life, his attention to poor people, his humility and devotion, but also his strength in protecting the rights of the sick and poor from the arrogance of the rich.\n\u00c9meric regularly convoked the [[Synod]] of his diocesis (we better know the one of 1307), promoting the sanctity of the clergy and the laities with rigorous rules especially in items such as fastings and religious feasts. In 1311 he established the feast of the Conception of the Holy Virgin Mary as a [[day of obligation]].\n\nHe died on 1 September 1313 in Aosta and was buried in the chapel of Aosta Cathedral which is dedicated to Holy Mary's Conception.\n\n==Historical debate==\nEven if the majority of historians did not pay particular attention about \u00c9meric, some traditional convictions about his life were challenged by more critical scholars. In particular it was a common point in all the ancient biographies that \u00c9meric was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] in [[Sant'Orso|Saint Orso]] collegiate; but the Aostan historian [[Aim\u00e9-Pierre Frutaz]] noticed that no clergyman called Emericus was mentioned in documents relating to the Collegiate, on the contrary a ''prebendarius'' called Emericus figured in Cathedral's papers.\n\n==Veneration==\nVeneration of Emericus seems to be very ancient: in fact we have a very significant proof of the veneration tributed to him in past times that is an illuminated picture dating 1498 where a Dominican friar is painted in act of veneration of Emericus having a halo.\n\nHe is venerated as a [[Beatification|Blessed]] in the [[Catholic Church]], his long-standing ''[[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]]'' having been confirmed by Pope [[Leo XIII]] in 1881.\n\n==Sources==\nWe know very little about \u00c9meric in particular about the period that precede his appointment as bishop and we don't have any texts personally written by him.\nThe most ancient sources are very short summaries about the date of his death and his pious donations contained in aostan necrologies. Then, almost suddenly,a picture appears in Aosta in 1498 showing \u00c9meric as a blessed, invoked to cure many diseases.\n\nThe first complete biography of \u00c9meric was written more than three hundred years after his death, around 1650 by an Aostan notary named Jean-Claude Mochet. A more historically correct biography was made in 1875 by bishop [[Joseph-Auguste Duc]] (and another in 1908 in his monumental History of the Church in Aosta Valley) who was the same who collected almost all the ancient documents relating to \u00c9meric' espiscopacy.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{citation\n\t|author=Unnamed authors\n\t|year=n.d.\n\t|title= Bonifacio ed Emerico\n\t|publisher=Canonici Regolari Lateranensi\n|url=http://www.lateranensi.it/page.php?22|language=it}}.\n* {{citation\n    |author=Joseph-Auguste Duc\n    |year=1875\n    |title= Les deux bienheureux Emeric de Quart \u00e9v\u00eaques d'Aoste\n    |publisher=Imprimerie de Jean-Baptiste Mensio\n|language=fr}}.\t\n* {{citation\n\t|author=Joseph-Auguste Duc\n\t|year=1879\n\t|title= Documents relatifs \u00e0 l'\u00e9piscopat du Bienheureux \u00c9meric de Quart\n\t|publisher=Imprimerie Edouard Duc\n|language=fr}}.\n* {{citation\n\t|author=Alberto Maria Careggio\n\t|year=1995\n\t|title= La religiosit\u00e0 popolare in Valle d'Aosta : il culto mariano e la devozione ai santi : storia, tradizioni, leggende, preghiere\n\t|publisher=Tipografia valdostana\n|language=it}}.\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emeric di Quart}}\n[[Category:1313 deaths]]\n[[Category:Bishops in Aosta Valley]]\n[[Category:Medieval Italian saints]]\n[[Category:14th-century Roman Catholic archbishops]]\n[[Category:14th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n", "text_old": "'''\u00c9meric de Quart''' (known in Italian as ''Emerico de Quart''), born in the latter part of the 13th century at the castle of [[Quart, Italy|Quart]] in the [[Aosta Valley]], was [[Bishop of Aosta]] from 1302 until his death on 1 September 1313. \nHe is more frequently named in ancient documents as ''Eymericus'' than ''Emericus'' or even ''Aimericus''.\n\n==Life==\nBorn in one of the most powerful families of [[Aosta Valley]], \u00c9meric or Aymeri de Quart was the son of Zacharie, known as Jacques II, lord of [[Quart, Aosta Valley|Quart]], of the ancient and noble Aosta family \u00ab de la Porte Saint-Ours \u00bb,<ref>Alessandro Barbero, ''Valle d'Aosta medievale'', Liguori, {{ISBN|88-207-3162-2}}, p.144</ref> who gave three bishops to the [[Diocese of Aosta]].

Marilyn Bergman: \"We said 'No, it's shone [long vowel sound].' And he said 'No, it's our language!' And we said: 'Yes, but it's our song.'

Alan Bergman: \"Michel [Legrand] played us [ie. Alan and Marilyn Bergman] seven or eight melodies. We listened to all of them and decided to wait until the next day to choose one. We three decided on the same one, a long baroque melody... The lyric we wrote was stream-of-consciousness. We felt that the song had to be a mind trip of some kind\" \u2013 \"The [eventual] title was [originally] a line at the end of a section... When we finished we said: \"What do we call this? It's got to have a title. That line is kind of interesting.' So we restructured the song so that the line appeared again at the end. It came out of the body of the song.

Marilyn Bergman: \"We said 'No, it's shone [long vowel sound].' And he said 'No, it's our language!' And we said: 'Yes, but it's our song.' So reluctantly, he sang shone [long vowel sound] and our rhyme was intact.\"<ref name=\"Marrying The Image\" /> However, Harrison evidently had the last laugh; in the finally released version he sings \"shone\" with a short vowel. Harrison's version had a US single in the US in July 1968 soon after the premiere of the film and similarly was released in the British Isles at the time of the film's 7 February 1969 premiere in the UK and Ireland. As a result, it was a current UK release when \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" received an Academy Award nomination on 24 February 1969: Harrison's single debuted at #36 in the UK Top 50 dated 4 March 1969 and had risen to #15\u2014abetted by performances by Harrison on the 27 March 1969 broadcast of ''[[Top of the Pops|TOTP]]'' and also on variety shows hosted by [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]]\u2014when the song won the Academy Award on 14 April 1969, an endorsement which facilitated the Top Ten entry of Harrison's single on the UK chart dated 22 April 1969 with its chart peak of #8 effected two weeks later.<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/the%20windmills%20of%20your%20mind/ \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" \u2013 Noel Harrison, 3 April 1969], officialcharts.com</ref>\n\n\"The Windmills of Your Mind\" was performed on the Academy Awards ceremony broadcast of 14 April 1969 by [[Jos\u00e9 Feliciano]]; Noel Harrison would recall: \"I was invited to sing it at the Academy Awards... but I was making a movie in England at the time, and the producer (who didn't like me) refused to let me go.\" The film which caused the scheduling conflict has been identified as ''[[Take a Girl Like You (film)|Take a Girl Like You]]'' directed by [[Jonathan Miller]].<ref name=\"The Windmills of Your Mind\"/>\n\n==Dusty Springfield version==\n[[File:The Windmills of Your Mind by Dusty Springfield B-side US vinyl.png|thumb|B-side label of Dusty Springfield's US vinyl single \"I Don't Want to Hear It Anymore\"]]\n[[Jerry Wexler]], president of [[Atlantic Records]], heard \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" on the soundtrack of ''The Thomas Crown Affair'' and championed having [[Dusty Springfield]] record the song for her debut Atlantic album ''[[Dusty in Memphis]]'', overcoming the singer's strong resistance; Springfield's friend and subsequent manager [[Vicki Wickham]] would allege: \"Dusty always said she hated it because she couldn't identify with the words.\"<ref>{{cite book| first1=Vicki| first2=Penny| last1=Wickham| last2=Valentine| title=Dancing with Demons: the authorized biography| year=2000| publisher=Hodder & Stoughton| location=London| isbn=978-0312282028| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/dancingwithdemon00vale}}</ref> During the first sessions for the track at [[American Sound Studio]] in Memphis, problems with getting the proper chords down arose, and at Springfield's suggestion the song was arranged so the first three verses were sung in a slower tempo than the original film version.\n\nIn April 1969 the third [[A-side and B-side|A-side]] release from ''Dusty in Memphis'' was announced as \"I Don't Want to Hear It Anymore\" with \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" as [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]: however Wexler was prepared to promote \"Windmills\" as the A-side if it won the Oscar for Best Song, reportedly instructing mail-room clerks at Atlantic Records' New York City headquarters to listen to the Academy Awards broadcast the night of 14 April 1969; hearing \"The Windmills\" announced as the Best Song winner was these clerks' cue to drive a station wagon loaded with 2500 copies of a double-sided promo single of Springfield's version \u2013 identified on the label as \"Academy Award Winner\" \u2013 to the [[James A.

Written by [[Noel Gallagher]], it was released on 7 July 1997 as the first single from their third album ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997).\n\nThe song reached number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], the third Oasis song to do so. The single also claimed the number-one position in Finland, Ireland  and Spain, and it reached the top five in Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. In the United Kingdom, it sold 162,000 copies during its first day of release and 370,000 copies by the end of the week. It is Oasis's second biggest-selling single in the UK with sales of 745,000, achieving Platinum status in the process, and it was the [[1997 in British music#Top 40 singles|12th biggest-selling single of 1997]] in the UK. In October 2011, ''[[NME]]'' placed it at number 77 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/list/150-best-tracks-of-the-past-15-years/248648/page/8|title=150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years|work=NME}}</ref>\n\nAn edited, remixed and remastered version of the song was released on 14 October 2016 entitled \"D'You Know What I Mean? (NG's 2016 Rethink)\". The reissue formed part of the wider rerelease of the ''Be Here Now'' album to celebrate its 20th anniversary. <ref>[http://www.stereogum.com/1889667/hear-oasis-dyou-know-what-i-mean-ngs-2016-rethink-from-be-here-now-deluxe-reissue/mp3s/ Oasis \u2013 \u201cD\u2019You Know What I Mean?

The song was originally intended to be the \"[[Digsy's Dinner]]\" of ''Be Here Now'' (the lighthearted novelty track, such as \"Digsy's Dinner\" on ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' and \"She's Electric\" on ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]''), until Noel set it aside in favour of \"Magic Pie\". Gallagher claims not to be particularly fond of the track. On 28 October 1998, \"Stay Young\" was released as a CD single in its own right by [[Epic/Sony Records|Epic Records Japan]].<ref>ESCA-7397. {{EAN|4988010739720}}. {{ASIN|B000026X7L|country=uk}}.</ref> One of the other [[B-sides]] is a cover of [[David Bowie]]'s song, [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\".]]\n\n==Interview==\nIn a 1997 interview promoting ''Be Here Now'', [[Noel Gallagher]] had the following to say about the first single: \"I was going to make up some profound statement in the chorus but I couldn't come up with anything that fitted. Then I just thought 'All my people right here, right now, d'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah.' Very vague, very ambiguous, that'll do. Look in the mirror and wink while you're singing it and it's quite saucy. And I fucking love that line, 'Coming in a mess, going out in style'. We were a bunch of scruffs from Manchester and we're going out in a Rolls Royce.\" In another 1997 interview, this time on [[BBC]], Noel Gallagher said: \"I can't believe I wrote it, it's going to blow people away.\"\n\n\"The morse code in the background was inspired by Strawberry Fields. We got hold of a code book and tried to tap out 'Bugger All' to follow that line 'Don't look back cos you know what you might see'. But if anyone can tell me what we really said, please let me know. Profound [[lager]]isms...\"\n\nIn an interview with the BBC for their documentary ''[[Seven Ages of Rock]]'', Gallagher said of the song, \"Its eight and a half minutes, the first single, the drums haven't fuckin' come in for two minutes\u2014its all feedback!\" He also said that he expected someone to ask them to edit the introduction to the song down, but such was their status in Britain, nobody did. They even performed the song on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', omitting most of the lengthy introduction.\n\nThe lyrics [[reference]] two [[Beatles]] songs; \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\", \"[[I Feel Fine]]\" as well as the [[Bob Dylan]] album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' and the Dylan documentary ''[[Dont Look Back]]''. The line \"I ain't good looking but I'm someone's child\" is adapted from a line in [[Blind Willie McTell|Blind Willie McTell's]] \"[[Statesboro Blues]].\" The song also uses an [[Amen break]].\n\n==Packaging==\nThe single cover photograph, by Michael Spencer Jones and directed by [[Brian Cannon]] of [[Microdot]], was taken in front of the 'Blind Steps', a staircase in [[Wigan]] so called because they run past the Blind Workshop, which can be seen to the left of the shot.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oasis \u2013 The Stories Behind Their Cryptic Album And Single Sleeve Art |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/oasis-the-stories-behind-their-cryptic-album-and-single-sleeve-art-1424210 |accessdate=19 September 2019 |work=NME}}</ref> The steps can still be found on Darlington Street. The shoot was shrouded in secrecy to protect mass media coverage, but newspaper ''The Wigan Evening Post'' got exclusive rights to cover the event and subsequently sold the photos to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''. At a lunchtime break, Liam Gallagher and sleeve designer Brian Cannon enjoyed a pint of beer in the nearby Crispin Arms pub by Birkett Bank.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Dom and Nic]], is set in an apparently [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world and shows the band playing as a growing number of military helicopters fly overhead. Several of the helicopters land while a crowd gathers to watch the band play and throw coloured [[smoke grenade]]s. At the end, the band members board one of the helicopters and fly away.\n\nThe video's setting is unclear. It was filmed on location at [[Beckton Gas Works]] in [[London]], but the phrases \"Do you know what I mean?\" and \"Be here now\" can be seen painted in [[Czech language|Czech]] on one of the surrounding buildings. [[Liam Gallagher]] wears a [[snorkel parka]] and sports a unique pair of tailor-made sunglasses.\n\nThe helicopters used were [[British Army]] [[Westland Lynx|Westland ''Lynx'' AH.7]]s. One is an AH.7(DAS) variant, notable for the distinctive ALQ-144 (disco ball) infra-red jammer under the tail. The other is a straight AH.7, albeit with a TOW antitank missile sight mounted over the left-hand front seat. Although only two helicopters were used, [[post-production]] techniques such as [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] editing, and clever camera angling produced the numerous helicopters seen in the video.\n\nThe band was later accused of hypocrisy for hiring the helicopters for the video. In 2002, the band forced the British Army to pull a recruiting video that used \"[[Morning Glory (Oasis song)|Morning Glory]]\" as background music, stating their vehement opposition to war and the military.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top soldier blasts 'whingeing' star|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/28631-top-soldier-blasts-whingeing-star|date=9 December 2006|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|accessdate=17 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n'''CD''' <small>(CRESCD 256)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" \u2013 7:22\n#\"Stay Young\" \u2013 5:06\n#\"Angel Child\" (demo) \u2013 4:28\n#\"[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]]\" ([[David Bowie]], [[Brian Eno]]) \u2013 4:09\n\n'''7\"''' <small>(CRE 256)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" \u2013 7:22\n#\"Stay Young\" \u2013 5:06\n\n'''12\"''' <small>(CRE 256T)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" \u2013 7:22\n#\"Stay Young\" \u2013 5:06\n#\"Angel Child\" (demo) \u2013 4:28\n\n'''Cassette''' <small>(CRECS 256)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" \u2013 7:22\n#\"Stay Young\" \u2013 5:06\n\n'''CD (NG's 2016 Rethink)''' <small>(RKIDSCD86P)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" (NG's 2016 Rethink) (radio edit) \u2013 4:50\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" (NG's 2016 Rethink) (full length version) \u2013 7:24\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Oasis'''\n*[[Liam Gallagher]] \u2013 [[lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[tambourine]]\n*[[Noel Gallagher]] \u2013 [[lead guitar]]s, [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]], [[string section|string arrangements]]\n*[[Paul Arthurs|Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs]] \u2013 [[rhythm guitar]]\n*[[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan]] \u2013 [[bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]] \u2013 [[drum kit|drums]]\n\n'''Additional musicians'''\n*Mark Coyle \u2013 backwards guitar\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!Chart (1997)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|16|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|38|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|32|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Wallonia|25|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|28|chartid=3342|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadarock|1|chartid=3308|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Danmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-08-02.pdf|title=Top National Sellers|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=14|issue=31|page=14|date=2 August 1997|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-08-02.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=14|issue=31|page=12|date=2 August 1997|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n{{singlechart|Finland|1|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|37|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|27|songid=3485|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=197557&pageId=2957605&lang=is&q=H%E1st%F6kk%20vikunnar%20H%E1st%F6kk%20vikunnar|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40 (31.7.

song by the English [[rock music|rock]] band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]. Written by [[Noel Gallagher]], it was released on 7 July 1997 as the first single from their third album ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997).\n\nThe song reached number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], the third Oasis song to do so. The single also claimed the number-one position in Finland, Ireland  and Spain, and it reached the top five in Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. In the United Kingdom, it sold 162,000 copies during its first day of release and 370,000 copies by the end of the week. It is Oasis's second biggest-selling single in the UK with sales of 745,000, achieving Platinum status in the process, and it was the [[1997 in British music#Top 40 singles|12th biggest-selling single of 1997]] in the UK. In October 2011, ''[[NME]]'' placed it at number 77 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/list/150-best-tracks-of-the-past-15-years/248648/page/8|title=150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years|work=NME}}</ref>\n\nAn edited, remixed and remastered version of the song was released on 14 October 2016 entitled \"D'You Know What I Mean? (NG's 2016 Rethink)\". The reissue formed part of the wider rerelease of the ''Be Here Now'' album to celebrate its 20th anniversary. <ref>[http://www.stereogum.com/1889667/hear-oasis-dyou-know-what-i-mean-ngs-2016-rethink-from-be-here-now-deluxe-reissue/mp3s/ Oasis \u2013 \u201cD\u2019You Know What I Mean?

The song was originally intended to be the \"[[Digsy's Dinner]]\" of ''Be Here Now'' (the lighthearted novelty track, such as \"Digsy's Dinner\" on ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' and \"She's Electric\" on ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]''), until Noel set it aside in favour of \"Magic Pie\". Gallagher claims not to be particularly fond of the track. On 28 October 1998, \"Stay Young\" was released as a CD single in its own right by [[Epic/Sony Records|Epic Records Japan]].<ref>ESCA-7397. {{EAN|4988010739720}}. {{ASIN|B000026X7L|country=uk}}.</ref> One of the other [[B-sides]] is a cover of [[David Bowie]]'s song, [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\".]]\n\n==Interview==\nIn a 1997 interview promoting ''Be Here Now'', [[Noel Gallagher]] had the following to say about the first single: \"I was going to make up some profound statement in the chorus but I couldn't come up with anything that fitted. Then I just thought 'All my people right here, right now, d'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah.' Very vague, very ambiguous, that'll do. Look in the mirror and wink while you're singing it and it's quite saucy. And I fucking love that line, 'Coming in a mess, going out in style'. We were a bunch of scruffs from Manchester and we're going out in a Rolls Royce.\" In another 1997 interview, this time on [[BBC]], Noel Gallagher said: \"I can't believe I wrote it, it's going to blow people away.\"\n\n\"The morse code in the background was inspired by Strawberry Fields. We got hold of a code book and tried to tap out 'Bugger All' to follow that line 'Don't look back cos you know what you might see'. But if anyone can tell me what we really said, please let me know. Profound [[lager]]isms...\"\n\nIn an interview with the BBC for their documentary ''[[Seven Ages of Rock]]'', Gallagher said of the song, \"Its eight and a half minutes, the first single, the drums haven't fuckin' come in for two minutes\u2014its all feedback!\" He also said that he expected someone to ask them to edit the introduction to the song down, but such was their status in Britain, nobody did. They even performed the song on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', omitting most of the lengthy introduction.\n\nThe lyrics [[reference]] two [[Beatles]] songs; \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\", \"[[I Feel Fine]]\" as well as the [[Bob Dylan]] album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' and the Dylan documentary ''[[Dont Look Back]]''. The line \"I ain't good looking but I'm someone's child\" is adapted from a line in [[Blind Willie McTell|Blind Willie McTell's]] \"[[Statesboro Blues]].\" The song also uses an [[Amen break]].\n\n==Packaging==\nThe single cover photograph, by Michael Spencer Jones and directed by [[Brian Cannon]] of [[Microdot]], was taken in front of the 'Blind Steps', a staircase in [[Wigan]] so called because they run past the Blind Workshop, which can be seen to the left of the shot.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oasis \u2013 The Stories Behind Their Cryptic Album And Single Sleeve Art |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/oasis-the-stories-behind-their-cryptic-album-and-single-sleeve-art-1424210 |accessdate=19 September 2019 |work=NME}}</ref> The steps can still be found on Darlington Street. The shoot was shrouded in secrecy to protect mass media coverage, but newspaper ''The Wigan Evening Post'' got exclusive rights to cover the event and subsequently sold the photos to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''. At a lunchtime break, Liam Gallagher and sleeve designer Brian Cannon enjoyed a pint of beer in the nearby Crispin Arms pub by Birkett Bank.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Dom and Nic]], is set in an apparently [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world and shows the band playing as a growing number of military helicopters fly overhead. Several of the helicopters land while a crowd gathers to watch the band play and throw coloured [[smoke grenade]]s. At the end, the band members board one of the helicopters and fly away.\n\nThe video's setting is unclear. It was filmed on location at [[Beckton Gas Works]] in [[London]], but the phrases \"Do you know what I mean?\" and \"Be here now\" can be seen painted in [[Czech language|Czech]] on one of the surrounding buildings. [[Liam Gallagher]] wears a [[snorkel parka]] and sports a unique pair of tailor-made sunglasses.\n\nThe helicopters used were [[British Army]] [[Westland Lynx|Westland ''Lynx'' AH.7]]s. One is an AH.7(DAS) variant, notable for the distinctive ALQ-144 (disco ball) infra-red jammer under the tail. The other is a straight AH.7, albeit with a TOW antitank missile sight mounted over the left-hand front seat. Although only two helicopters were used, [[post-production]] techniques such as [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] editing, and clever camera angling produced the numerous helicopters seen in the video.\n\nThe band was later accused of hypocrisy for hiring the helicopters for the video. In 2002, the band forced the British Army to pull a recruiting video that used \"[[Morning Glory (Oasis song)|Morning Glory]]\" as background music, stating their vehement opposition to war and the military.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top soldier blasts 'whingeing' star|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/28631-top-soldier-blasts-whingeing-star|date=9 December 2006|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|accessdate=17 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n'''CD''' <small>(CRESCD 256)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" - 7:22\n#\"Stay Young\" - 5:06\n#\"Angel Child\" (demo) - 4:28\n#\"[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]]\" ([[David Bowie]], [[Brian Eno]]) - 4:09\n\n'''7\"''' <small>(CRE 256)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" - 7:22\n#\"Stay Young\" - 5:06\n\n'''12\"''' <small>(CRE 256T)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" - 7:22\n#\"Stay Young\" - 5:06\n#\"Angel Child\" (demo) - 4:28\n\n'''Cassette''' <small>(CRECS 256)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" - 7:22\n#\"Stay Young\" - 5:06\n\n'''CD (NG's 2016 Rethink)''' <small>(RKIDSCD86P)</small>\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" (NG's 2016 Rethink) (radio edit) - 4:50\n#\"D'You Know What I Mean?\" (NG's 2016 Rethink) (full length version) - 7:24\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Oasis'''\n*[[Liam Gallagher]] \u2013 [[lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[tambourine]]\n*[[Noel Gallagher]] \u2013 [[lead guitar]]s, [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]], [[string section|string arrangements]]\n*[[Paul Arthurs|Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs]] \u2013 [[rhythm guitar]]\n*[[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan]] \u2013 [[bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]] \u2013 [[drum kit|drums]]\n\n'''Additional musicians'''\n*Mark Coyle \u2013 backwards guitar\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!Chart (1997)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|16|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|38|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|32|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Wallonia|25|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|28|chartid=3342|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadarock|1|chartid=3308|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Danmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-08-02.pdf|title=Top National Sellers|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=14|issue=31|page=14|date=2 August 1997|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-08-02.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=14|issue=31|page=12|date=2 August 1997|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n{{singlechart|Finland|1|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|37|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|27|songid=3485|artist=Oasis|song=D'You Know What I Mean?|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=197557&pageId=2957605&lang=is&q=H%E1st%F6kk%20vikunnar%20H%E1st%F6kk%20vikunnar|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40 (31.7.
