It depicts a band of survivors in a [[zombie]] wasteland.\n\n==Plot==\nDexy, a sexually insatiable woman, implores her husband Nathan to find her \"someone to play with\".  Immediately afterward, a man armed with a one-handed [[sledgehammer]] and a number of long spikes is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a zombie, which he ultimately kills by overpowering it and driving a spike into its head with his hammer.  His name is revealed to be \"Matool\". He then sees another zombie approaching him, which appears to annoy him more than frighten him.  He is also shown being extremely protective of his glasses, since zombies have overrun the world and he might find it difficult to acquire another pair.\n\nAs the opening credits roll, short clips are shown of Matool running around the deserted streets of [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico, while Nathan is driving his pickup on those same streets, showing that the city is devoid of human life.\n\nAfterward, a young woman is shown trapped in her car by a group of ravenous zombies outside, while her male companion is pulled down and devoured.  Matool hears this and utters \"Fuck yeah!\" while rushing off to her rescue.  Though she is obviously reluctant, she allows herself to be saved, but Matool is forced to resort to carrying her, as she is overcome by panic.  They take refuge in a rundown, abandoned house, which is already occupied by a middle-aged man and two young boys.  The older man, Mr. Rainville, seems not to be bothered much by what is happening outside, and neither does one of his young friends, but the other boy does not speak at all or show any kind of emotion.  After some amusing introductions, Matool inquires as to the identity of the man who was just killed, and the young woman replies that it was her brother, much to Matool's joy, but she is incensed by his subtle advances, and still believes that they can save her now-dead brother.  Rainville continues to do nothing but sit and watch as all this happens, though he does not hesitate to jump in with a witty comment about he's \"not going to fuck you either\" to Matool, mocking his attempts to get the young lady in bed.  The woman then loses it and tries to leave to save her brother, but is pulled down and devoured by several zombies while Matool has no choice but to run.  Rainville and one of the boys are eaten alive, but the quiet one simply hides, showing no emotion whatsoever.\n\nAs Matool runs, Nathan hits him with the door of his truck.  Matool later wakes up bound in the back of Nathan's truck as they arrive at Nathan's house in the mountains near the city. Also in the truck is the quiet boy who Rainville had taken in (though the purposes for which he did so are implied to be carnal in nature).  After being taken inside, he is cut loose, welcomed, allowed to bathe, and is bluntly informed that Nathan and Dexy have an alternative lifestyle, which involves Nathan watching while other men engage in sexual activity with Dexy.  Matool is intrigued by this and goes along with the idea, but their first time, Dexy's sister Sassy smacks his bare rear with a ruler, surprising Matool, who is even more surprised when he sees that this new woman has a mutated human face on her side, the result of some kind of [[conjoined twins]] situation (the face appears to be self-aware, and is named Dottie).  Matool apologizes for freaking out, seeing that Sassy is very sensitive.\n\nAfter a few days, during which Matool gets used to his new surroundings, and after a few fights with zombies lurking outside, Nathan and Matool become fast friends, and Matool is shown a shed behind the house where Nathan keeps a naked female zombie that he likes to \"look at\", prompting Matool to remark \"Yeah, she'd be pretty fucking hot if she weren't decomposing.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, a small group of soldiers arrive in the rain.  Two are carrying a third, who is badly injured.  Their leader is Mandel, the other is Vega, and the wounded man is Sepulveda, who talk their way inside.  A flashback reveals that they were part of a larger unit surviving on the roads after the zombies overran civilization until a zombie attack (including what they call 'hyperzombies, which can move faster than normal zombies) cost them two soldiers (one, a male, was eaten alive and another, a female, was dragged screaming under their truck), and wounded Sepulveda.  Mandel becomes acquainted with Matool who tells him that the house is well-supplied, has power from an [[electrical generator]], a well, as well as \"more\".  Sepulveda is placed in an unoccupied bedroom where Mandel and Vega take turns watching him, knowing that death and reanimation are inevitable.  Also, Vega becomes acquainted with Sassy, who later admits to Mandel and Matool that the face on her side is \"disturbingly sexy\" (prompting Matool to call him \"disturbingly weird\").\n\nLater, Mandel and Vega begin having sex with Dexy while Nathan watches, causing him obvious frustration, leading him to, while the others are having breakfast, sneak back to his shed and have rough sex with his chained female zombie.  A flashback reveals that the female zombie was one of two survivors who had arrived sometime earlier (the other being a male), who, after seeing Dexy's attraction to them both, shot the man and strangled the woman, keeping her for sexual purposes.\n\nAs the days pass, Vega and Sassy begin a relationship, while Sepulveda continues to die in agony, while Mandel resists Matool's suggestion that he be put down right away.  Nathan and Matool continue to fight and destroy zombies (Nathan with a [[Beretta]] [[pistol]], Matool with his trademark hammer and spikes) as they show up at the house.\n\nThings inevitably fall apart, however, as the quiet boy who has not yet said a word begins feeling an attraction towards Dexy, and takes Nathan's keys and frees his female zombie, leaving it contained in the shed.  Meanwhile, Sepulveda wakes up and sees Sassy for the first time, as well as her conjoined twin, freaking out at how disgusting it is, causing Sassy to lose it and kill him with a pair of scissors.  Mandel, who was watching Sepulveda, instinctively shoots Sassy, killing her.  Nathan goes out to the shed for a tryst, but is killed and devoured by his zombie companion.  Meanwhile, Matool, Mandel, and Vega take Sassy and Sepulveda's bodies out before they reanimate as zombies, while attempting to reassure Dexy that it was \"an accident\".  Matool smashes Sassy's head with a cinder block over Vega's objections who is then attacked and killed by a reanimated Sepulveda.\n\nAs more zombies begin to gather at the house, Matool demands that Mandel go back into the house to get his MP5 submachine gun, but he can't, as the boy has locked them out.  Mandel then kills the Sepulveda zombie with his knife.  Then they head to the shed to find Nathan.  They open the door and see him being devoured by his female zombie and proceed to lock her back in.  As more and more zombies arrive, Mandel punches Matool, claiming Dexy as his own, but Matool fights back.  As they fight, they find themselves surrounded and are forced to run down the same road to escape.  Dexy, meanwhile, looks out the window as the zombies approach the door while the boy comes up to her, still not speaking or expressing any emotion.  She looks at him and says \"Nathan will be back.\"  The boy then holds Dexy's hand.\n\nMatool and Mandel run down a gravel road together, making their escape.\n\n==Partial cast==\n\nKurly Tlapoyawa as Matool\n\nRoss Kelly as Nathan\n\nDiva as Dexy\n\nBilly Garberina as Mandel\n\nKristin Hansen as Sassy\n\nDevin O'Leary as Vega\n\nAndrew Vellenoweth as Sepulveda\n\nBryan Gallegos as the Quiet Boy (referred to in the credits as \"Spooky Kid\")\n\nBob Vardeman as Mr. Rainville\n\n==DVD extras==\n\nThe DVD includes a 46-minute film detailing the adventures of the cast and crew over the twelve days of shooting.\n\nSeven minutes of especially funny outtakes are featured.\n\nThere is also a ten-minute film showing the premier of ''The Stink of Flesh'' at the Guild Theater in Albuquerque, where many independent movies, especially those made in and around Albuquerque, are shown.\n\nAlso featured is a short called \"Rainville, the Early Years\" in which Bob Vardeman, who played Rainville, essentially goes on a random, foul-mouthed rampage while driving, walking around his front yard, petting his cat, and trying on hats for the movie.\n\n==Soundtrack listing==\n\nScore by\nChris Alexander and Carrie Eliza\n\nI Bought You Some Roses,\nWalking Alone,\nA Love More True\nBy\nAngry Johnny and the Killbillies\n\nHell's what I'm used to,\nThrough The Devils Eyes,\nBy\nLONESOME KINGS\n\nLove Her with A Feel,\nRio Grande Blues,\nMatool's Smooth Groove\nBy\nRUDY \u201cBOY\u201d JARMILLO\n\nJuly,\nSinnerman,\nChristine,\nLakeshore,\nBy\nSODA AND HIS MILLION PIECE BAND\n\nCode of The West,\nGo-Go\nBy\nBOOT HILL\n\nSassy's Theme\nBy\nNOAH WOLTERS\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of zombie films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0378808|The Stink of Flesh}}\n* [http://www.downloadhorror.com/viewtitle/?sg=5067&selecttitle=12325 The Stink Of Flesh] at [[DownloadHorror.com]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stink Of Flesh}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:American zombie comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:2005 horror films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Sexploitation films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|{{Notability|Films|date=October 2009}}\n{{unreferenced|date=February 2011}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Stink of Flesh\n| caption        =\n| image = The Stink of Flesh FilmPoster.jpeg\n| director       = [[Scott Phillips (writer)|Scott Phillips]]\n| producer       =\n| writer         = Scott Phillips\n| starring       = Diva,<br>Kurly Tlapoyawa,<br>Ross Kelly\n| music          = Chris Alexander and Carrie Eliza\n| cinematography =\n| editing        =\n| distributor    = [[Tempe DVD]]\n| released       = 2005\n| runtime        = 82 min\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         =\n| preceded_by    =\n| followed_by    =\n}}\n\n'''''The Stink of Flesh''''' is a 2005 [[black comedy]] and [[sexploitation]] film directed by [[Scott Phillips (writer)|Scott Phillips]].

Matool hears this and utters \"Fuck yeah!\" while rushing off to her rescue.  Though she is obviously reluctant, she allows herself to be saved, but Matool is forced to resort to carrying her, as she is overcome by panic.  They take refuge in a rundown, abandoned house, which is already occupied by a middle-aged man and two young boys.  The older man, Mr. Rainville, seems not to be bothered much by what is happening outside, and neither does one of his young friends, but the other boy does not speak at all or show any kind of emotion.  After some amusing introductions, Matool inquires as to the identity of the man who was just killed, and the young woman replies that it was her brother, much to Matool's joy, but she is incensed by his subtle advances, and still believes that they can save her now-dead brother.  Rainville continues to do nothing but sit and watch as all this happens, though he does not hesitate to jump in with a witty comment about he's \"not going to fuck you either\" to Matool, mocking his attempts to get the young lady in bed.  The woman then loses it and tries to leave to save her brother, but is pulled down and devoured by several zombies while Matool has no choice but to run.  Rainville and one of the boys are eaten alive, but the quiet one simply hides, showing no emotion whatsoever.\n\nAs Matool runs, Nathan hits him with the door of his truck.  Matool later wakes up bound in the back of Nathan's truck as they arrive at Nathan's house in the mountains near the city. Also in the truck is the quiet boy who Rainville had taken in (though the purposes for which he did so are implied to be carnal in nature).  After being taken inside, he is cut loose, welcomed, allowed to bathe, and is bluntly informed that Nathan and Dexy have an alternative lifestyle, which involves Nathan watching while other men engage in sexual activity with Dexy.  Matool is intrigued by this and goes along with the idea, but their first time, Dexy's sister Sassy smacks his bare rear with a ruler, surprising Matool, who is even more surprised when he sees that this new woman has a mutated human face on her side, the result of some kind of [[conjoined twins]] situation (the face appears to be self-aware, and is named Dottie).  Matool apologizes for freaking out, seeing that Sassy is very sensitive.\n\nAfter a few days, during which Matool gets used to his new surroundings, and after a few fights with zombies lurking outside, Nathan and Matool become fast friends, and Matool is shown a shed behind the house where Nathan keeps a naked female zombie that he likes to \"look at\", prompting Matool to remark \"Yeah, she'd be pretty fucking hot if she weren't decomposing.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, a small group of soldiers arrive in the rain.  Two are carrying a third, who is badly injured.  Their leader is Mandel, the other is Vega, and the wounded man is Sepulveda, who talk their way inside.  A flashback reveals that they were part of a larger unit surviving on the roads after the zombies overran civilization until a zombie attack (including what they call 'hyperzombies, which can move faster than normal zombies) cost them two soldiers (one, a male, was eaten alive and another, a female, was dragged screaming under their truck), and wounded Sepulveda.  Mandel becomes acquainted with Matool who tells him that the house is well-supplied, has power from an [[electrical generator]], a well, as well as \"more\".  Sepulveda is placed in an unoccupied bedroom where Mandel and Vega take turns watching him, knowing that death and reanimation are inevitable.  Also, Vega becomes acquainted with Sassy, who later admits to Mandel and Matool that the face on her side is \"disturbingly sexy\" (prompting Matool to call him \"disturbingly weird\").\n\nLater, Mandel and Vega begin having sex with Dexy while Nathan watches, causing him obvious frustration, leading him to, while the others are having breakfast, sneak back to his shed and have rough sex with his chained female zombie.  A flashback reveals that the female zombie was one of two survivors who had arrived sometime earlier (the other being a male), who, after seeing Dexy's attraction to them both, shot the man and strangled the woman, keeping her for sexual purposes.\n\nAs the days pass, Vega and Sassy begin a relationship, while Sepulveda continues to die in agony, while Mandel resists Matool's suggestion that he be put down right away.  Nathan and Matool continue to fight and destroy zombies (Nathan with a [[Beretta]] [[pistol]], Matool with his trademark hammer and spikes) as they show up at the house.\n\nThings inevitably fall apart, however, as the quiet boy who has not yet said a word begins feeling an attraction towards Dexy, and takes Nathan's keys and frees his female zombie, leaving it contained in the shed.  Meanwhile, Sepulveda wakes up and sees Sassy for the first time, as well as her conjoined twin, freaking out at how disgusting it is, causing Sassy to lose it and kill him with a pair of scissors.  Mandel, who was watching Sepulveda, instinctively shoots Sassy, killing her.  Nathan goes out to the shed for a tryst, but is killed and devoured by his zombie companion.  Meanwhile, Matool, Mandel, and Vega take Sassy and Sepulveda's bodies out before they reanimate as zombies, while attempting to reassure Dexy that it was \"an accident\".  Matool smashes Sassy's head with a cinder block over Vega's objections who is then attacked and killed by a reanimated Sepulveda.\n\nAs more zombies begin to gather at the house, Matool demands that Mandel go back into the house to get his MP5 submachine gun, but he can't, as the boy has locked them out.  Mandel then kills the Sepulveda zombie with his knife.  Then they head to the shed to find Nathan.  They open the door and see him being devoured by his female zombie and proceed to lock her back in.  As more and more zombies arrive, Mandel punches Matool, claiming Dexy as his own, but Matool fights back.  As they fight, they find themselves surrounded and are forced to run down the same road to escape.  Dexy, meanwhile, looks out the window as the zombies approach the door while the boy comes up to her, still not speaking or expressing any emotion.  She looks at him and says \"Nathan will be back.\"  The boy then holds Dexy's hand.\n\nMatool and Mandel run down a gravel road together, making their escape.\n\n==Partial cast==\n\nKurly Tlapoyawa as Matool\n\nRoss Kelly as Nathan\n\nDiva as Dexy\n\nBilly Garberina as Mandel\n\nKristin Hansen as Sassy\n\nDevin O'Leary as Vega\n\nAndrew Vellenoweth as Sepulveda\n\nBryan Gallegos as the Quiet Boy (referred to in the credits as \"Spooky Kid\")\n\nBob Vardeman as Mr. Rainville\n\n==DVD extras==\n\nThe DVD includes a 46-minute film detailing the adventures of the cast and crew over the twelve days of shooting.\n\nSeven minutes of especially funny outtakes are featured.\n\nThere is also a ten-minute film showing the premier of ''The Stink of Flesh'' at the Guild Theater in Albuquerque, where many independent movies, especially those made in and around Albuquerque, are shown.\n\nAlso featured is a short called \"Rainville, the Early Years\" in which Bob Vardeman, who played Rainville, essentially goes on a random, foul-mouthed rampage while driving, walking around his front yard, petting his cat, and trying on hats for the movie.\n\n==Soundtrack listing==\n\nScore by\nChris Alexander and Carrie Eliza\n\nI Bought You Some Roses,\nWalking Alone,\nA Love More True\nBy\nAngry Johnny and the Killbillies\n\nHell's what I\u2019m used to,\nThrough The Devils Eyes,\nBy\nLONESOME KINGS\n\nLove Her with A Feel,\nRio Grande Blues,\nMatool\u2019s Smooth Groove\nBy\nRUDY \u201cBOY\u201d JARMILLO\n\nJuly,\nSinnerman,\nChristine,\nLakeshore,\nBy\nSODA AND HIS MILLION PIECE BAND\n\nCode of The West,\nGo-Go\nBy\nBOOT HILL\n\nSassy\u2019s Theme\nBy\nNOAH WOLTERS\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of zombie films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0378808|The Stink of Flesh}}\n* [http://www.downloadhorror.com/viewtitle/?sg=5067&selecttitle=12325 The Stink Of Flesh] at [[DownloadHorror.com]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stink Of Flesh}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:American zombie comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:2005 horror films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Sexploitation films]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSoundtrack listing:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: I\u2019m \u2192 I'm, \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stink_of_Flesh"}

The poets [[Sergey Mikhalkov]] and [[Gabriel El-Registan]] were called to Moscow by one of Stalin's staffers, and were told to fix the lyrics to Alexandrov's music. They were instructed to keep the verses the same, but to find a way to change the refrains which described \"a Country of Soviets\". Because of the difficulty of expressing the concepts of the Great Patriotic War in song, that idea was dropped from the version which El-Registan and Mikhalkov completed overnight.

If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 [[24-hour clock|hours]], or slightly earlier at 0458 hours. The anthem is also played on [[New Year's Eve]] after the [[New Year Address]] by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played ''officially'', everybody must stand up (in case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.<ref name='anthemlaw'>{{harvnb|Federal Constitutional Law on the National Anthem of the Russian Federation}}</ref>\n\nThe anthem is performed in 4/4 ([[Time signature|common time]]) or in 2/4 in the key of [[C major]], and has a [[tempo]] of 76 beats per minute. Using either time signature, the anthem must be played in a solemn and singing manner (Russian: ''\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e and \u0420\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e'').

He thought that the song was short and, because of the [[Great Patriotic War]], that it needed a statement about the impending defeat of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] by the [[Red Army]]. The poets [[Sergey Mikhalkov]] and [[Gabriel El-Registan]] were called to Moscow by one of Stalin's staffers, and were told to fix the lyrics to Alexandrov's music. They were instructed to keep the verses the same, but to find a way to change the refrains which described \"a Country of Soviets\". Because of the difficulty of expressing the concepts of the Great Patriotic War in song, that idea was dropped from the version which El-Registan and Mikhalkov completed overnight. After a few minor changes to emphasize the Russian Motherland, Stalin approved the anthem and had it published on 7 November 1943,<ref>{{Harvnb|Montefiore|2005|pp=460\u2013461}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Solomon|last=Volkov|title=Stalin's Best Tune|date=December 16, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/16/opinion/16VOLK.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}</ref> including a line about Stalin \"inspir[ing] us to keep the faith with the people\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Keep|Litvin|2004|pp=41\u201342}}</ref> The revised anthem was announced to all of the USSR on January&nbsp;1, 1944 and became official on March&nbsp;15, 1944.<ref>{{cite journal|title=USSR Information Bulletin|journal=Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|year=1944|volume=4|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o_8qAAAAMAAJ&q=Soviet+anthem+1944&dq=Soviet+anthem+1944&cd=7|accessdate=December 18, 2009|publisher=Embassy of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics|author1=Soviet Union.

It is played on television and radio at the beginning and end of the broadcast day. If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 [[24-hour clock|hours]], or slightly earlier at 0458 hours. The anthem is also played on [[New Year's Eve]] after the [[New Year Address]] by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played ''officially'', everybody must stand up (in case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.<ref name='anthemlaw'>{{harvnb|Federal Constitutional Law on the National Anthem of the Russian Federation}}</ref>\n\nThe anthem is performed in 4/4 ([[Time signature|common time]]) or in 2/4 in the key of [[C major]], and has a [[tempo]] of 76 beats per minute.

The film is directed by American filmmaker Don Edmonds and produced by [[David F. Friedman]] for [[Lionsgate Films|Cin\u00e9pix Film Properties]] in [[Montreal]]. The film stars [[Dyanne Thorne]] in the titular role, who is loosely based on [[Ilse Koch]], the wife of a real-life commandant at the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].\n\nUpon its release in early 1975, the film was immediately met with widespread controversy and critical derision, with [[Gene Siskel]] calling it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown\". Particular criticism was directed at the film's graphic violence; which includes depictions of [[castration]], [[flogging]], human experimentation, and many other forms of [[torture]]. Word-of-mouth quickly spread, and the film was a considerable financial success, becoming a staple of [[grindhouse]] and [[drive-in theatres]].\n\nThe popularity of the film led to the creation of three sequels, each of which saw Thorne reprise her role. The film's infamy eventually evolved into a considerable [[cult following]], with the character of Ilsa becoming a pop cultural icon ubiquitous with \u201cstrong, aggressive\u201d female authority.<ref name=\"av2\" /><ref name=\"av1\" /> The film is considered one of the prominent entries of the [[Nazisploitation]] sub-genre, and to a lesser degree the [[sexploitation]] sub-genre.\n\n==Plot==\nEurope, 1945. Ilsa is [[Kommandant]] of a [[Nazism|Nazi]] prison camp, who conducts [[Nazi human experimentation|sadistic scientific experiments]] designed to demonstrate that women are more capable of enduring pain than men are, and therefore should be allowed to fight in the ever-depleting German armed forces. A sadistic authoritarian, Ilsa has a voracious sexual appetite for men, choosing a new male prisoner each night to copulate with. However, owing to her [[hypersexuality]], she is disappointed when her victims inevitably [[Ejaculation|ejaculates]], and promptly has them [[Castration|castrated]] and put to death.\n\nAfter dispatching her latest conquest, Ilsa oversees the arrival of a new batch of both male and female prisoners. Though largely dismissive and dehumanizing of the majority of her wards, she becomes enamoured by the presence of Wolfe; a blond-haired and blue-eyed prisoner who, unlike his compatriots, resembles the Nazi [[Aryan]] ideal. Wolfe, a [[German Americans|German-American]] student who had been studying in [[Berlin]] before the war broke out, tells his cellmate Mario (one of Ilsa's former victims) that he has the ability to ejaculate at will, allowing him to have sex with incredible endurance and skill. Wolfe demonstrates this when, called to Ilsa's bedroom at night, he manages to bring her to [[orgasm]], becoming her first repeat partner whom she willingly spares.\n\nHaving entered into Ilsa's confidence, Wolfe begins plotting revolt with Mario and a group of female prisoners who have borne the brunt of Ilsa's tortures. Meanwhile, Ilsa becomes gradually more and more anxious by news of [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] breaking through German defenses and ever-encroaching. Believing that the enlistment of women into the German military will help stem the tide, Ilsa attempts to convince a visiting General of her theories of female supremacy by showing him the various inhumane experiments she has subjected her female prisoners to. The General is roundly impressed and awards Ilsa the [[Iron Cross]] for her efforts, while forcing her to fulfill his nascent [[urolagnia]] by giving him a [[golden shower]].\n\nWith the Germans in retreat, the prisoners finally revolt, managing to kill most of the guards and rounding up the surviving staff. Ilsa is tied to her bed with her [[stockings]] by Wolfe during a sex game, before he steals her gun and helps his comrades. Wolfe pleads with the other prisoners to leave the Nazis to be captured and tried by the Allies, but they insist that they'll escape punishment, and [[Summary execution|summarily execute]] them. With retreating Nazi forces fast approaching, Wolfe and a lone female prisoner escape into the nearby hills as the remaining prisoners, including Mario, resolve to fight to the death. They're quickly outgunned by a [[Waffen-SS]] tank troupe, who promptly wipes out the small resistance.\n\nThe Commander disembarks and begins investigating the camp. Upon finding Ilsa tied up helplessly, he coldly shoots her in the head and kills her, before ordering the [[razing]] of the camp to destroy any evidence of their atrocities. As he brags that the Allies will never know what happened, Wolfe and his fellow escapee watch from atop a nearby hill, the sole survivors of Ilsa's death camp.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dyanne Thorne]] as Ilsa\n* Gregory Knoph as Wolfe\n* Tony Mumolo as Mario\n* [[George Buck Flower]] as Binz <small>(as C.D.

Like many of its counterparts, Ilsa follows a [[women in prison film|women-in-prison formula]], but subverts it by having a female authority figure dominating male submissives.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter [[Lee Frost (director)|Lee Frost]] and [[David F. Friedman]]'s ''[[Love Camp 7]]'' (1969) became successful in Canada, Andr\u00e9 Link and [[John Dunning (film producer)|John Dunning]] of [[Cinepix Film Properties]] sought to capitalize by producing their own Nazi-themed exploitation film.<ref name=\"canux\" /> Dunning was inspired by historical records of wartime medical experiments on unwilling human subjects, but also sought to add a female villain.\n\nDunning worked on the screenplay with writer John C.W. Saxton, drawing inspiration from [[Ilse Koch]], wife of the commandant of the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] and, later, [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]].<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" /> Nicknamed \u201cThe Bitch of Buchenwald\u201d, Koch engaged in several war crimes, including an experiment in which she had the skin of tattooed prisoners removed to make furniture. The film's central premise of Ilsa torturing women to test their endurance for pain was based on a wartime medical theory that women could take pain and punishment better than men, because they were better equipped as a result of the birthing ordeal.\n\nLink and Dunning approached ''Love Camp 7'' producer [[David F. Friedman]] to produce, an offer he promptly accepted. Friedman was a veteran exploitation filmmaker, having produced numerous \u201croughie\u201d sexploitation films, as well as [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]]\u2019 seminal ''[[Blood Feast]]''. The director was Don Edmonds, an actor who\u2019d begun directing sexploitation films earlier in the decade. Ilsa would be his third film as director, following ''Wild Honey'' and ''[[Tender Loving Care (film)|Tender Loving Care]]''.\n\n===Casting===\nFriedman\u2019s first choice of casting for the lead role was [[Phyllis Davis]]. When she proved unviable, he sought out [[Dyanne Thorne]] to play the eponymous character. Thorne was a longtime [[Las Vegas]] showgirl who had studied under [[Stella Adler]], who at the time was working as a [[chauffeur]]. Thorne referred to the script as \u201cawful\u201d, but took the role after a friend recommended Edmonds personally.\n\nThe role of Dr. Binz, Ilsa's diminutive male assistant, Edmonds cast his previous collaborator [[George Buck Flower]], who had also worked with Thorne and Friedman in various capacities as an assistant director, casting director, set decorator, and grip. Flower also served as an uncredited assistant director. Binz's appearance is based on that of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], a pioneering German [[sexologist]] (though the real Hirschfeld was fervently anti-Nazi and anti-fascist).\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in nine days.<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" /> It used the [[Culver City]], [[California]] [[Stalag 13 (film set)|set]] of the TV series ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''.<ref name=\"porning\" /> The series had already been cancelled and the show's producers let the film be made on it once they learned that a scene called for it to be burned down, thus saving them the cost of having it demolished.\n\nBecause the film was shot in the United States, it could not legally qualify for the [[Canadian Film Development Corporation]]\u2019s \u201cCapital Gains Allowance\u201d. Link and Dunning chose to both go uncredited in their capacities as executive producers.\n\n===Post-production===\nDuring editing, David Friedman decided to place a notice before the film's opening credits in order to add an air of legitimacy and hopefully tide potential criticism. It reads: \"The film you are about to see is based on documented fact. The atrocities shown were conducted as '[[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]]' in special [[concentration camp]]s throughout [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Although these [[crimes against humanity]] are historically accurate, the characters depicted are composites of notorious Nazi personalities; and the events portrayed, have been condensed into one locality for dramatic purposes. Because of its shocking subject matter, this film is restricted to adult audiences only. We dedicate this film with the hope that these heinous crimes will never happen again.\"\n\n===Use of pseudonyms===\nSeveral key members of the cast and crew were credited under pseudonyms. David F. Friedman is credited as \u201cHerman Traeger\u201d, screenwriter John C.W. Saxton as \u201cJonah Royston\u201d, and actors George Buck Flower as \u201cC.D. Lafleuer\u201d and Richard Kennedy as \u201cWolfgang Roehm\u201d. The credited editor, Kurt Schnit, was likely also a pseudonym, as no such film editor of the time is known to have existed, and does not hold any other credits of any kind.\n\n== Release ==\n''Ilsa'' was rejected by the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] in 1975 and remains unreleased in the country.<ref name=\"bbfc\" /> It was [[List of banned films|banned]] in Australia, Germany, and Norway.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In the United States, the film was released mostly to urban and [[grindhouse]] theatres, as was standard practice for many exploitation films of the time.<ref name=\"grierson\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' has received primarily negative reviews, and holds a rating of 36% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 11 reviews.<ref name=\"rotten\" />\n\n''The Independent Film Journal'' wrote, \"Only the most dangerously sadistic mentalities will manage to sit voluntarily through more than ten minutes of ''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS,'' a graphic, stomach-churning catalogue of Nazi medical atrocities that makes ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' look like a Sunday picnic ... Theatres catering to the lowest possible grade of audience could make a bundle of dirty money. Others would be wise to forget it.\"<ref name=\"ifj\" />\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film zero stars out of four and called it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown ... ''Ilsa'' plays like a textbook for rapists and mutilation freaks.\" He identified the distributors of the film and advised them to \"see it, because I'm certain they would then remove it.\"<ref name=\"siskel\" /> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported walking out on the film and wrote that it \"could possibly be the worst soft-core sex-and-violence film of the decade\u2014and the funniest. It's set in a World War II Nazi concentration camp built in a meadow that looks very southern California. You can almost hear the freeway traffic on the other side of the hill.\"<ref name=\"canby\" /> Dave Kehr of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described the film as \"self-conscious Canadian-made camp\", which \"wasn't notorious until it was fiercely denounced in the high-profile media\".<ref name=\"kehr\" />\n\n''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a scathing review, noting that it \"has absolutely no sense of humor that might go where the obvious lack of moral purpose is\".<ref name=\"av2\" />\n\nThe film's director Don Edmonds described the screenplay as \"the worst piece of shit I ever read\".<ref name=\"av2\" />\n\n==Accolades==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' won Best Alternative Release at the 1985 [[AVN awards]], ten years after its initial release.<ref name=\"avn\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nDespite being almost-universally critically derided, the film has gained a significant cult following, in large part due to the endurance of the lead character and Thorne's [[campy|camp]] performance. Film scholar Rikki Schubert appraises the character as [[feminist]], writing in her book ''Super Bitches and Action Babes: The Female Hero in Popular Cinema, 1970\u20132006''  \u201cshe is not a female hero in any ordinary sense, yet she is a strong, active and aggressive protagonist who has become mythical in Western culture.\u201d\n\nArtist and filmmaker Twiggs Gorie likewise considers the film a feminist parable due to Ilsa's characterization as a strong and authoritarian figure, \u201cCan you imagine the balls it would take to live in this super-patriarchal [Nazi] society and turn around and tell her superior officers, \u2018I want to prove to you that we are just as good as the men\u2019? The whole ideology behind this government is, \u2018Oh no, you\u2019re a woman\u2014all you have to do is spread your legs and pump out some kids.\u2019 I see it as an empowerment film\u2014a wonderful display of strong, confident women. That image is missing in 2017\u2014it's missing from our cinema, it's missing from everything. I was a teenager in the early 2000s, and I saw the advent of those illegal-looking, American Apparel, super-weak-looking girls\u2014that's what everybody wanted. Bondage came into the mainstream, but it was women being submissive, and I was sick of it. I want stronger female role models and stronger female imagery. And when I look at this movie, that's what I see.\u201d\n\nThe character is considered a quintessential pop cultural depiction of [[sadomasochism]] and [[hypersexuality]], with Schubert writing that \u201cThe uniform, the beautiful and harsh appearance, the fierce pride and the cold cruelty are all features of the dominatrix, who is here, quite literally, a \u2018castrating bitch.\u2019 She is a hypersexual creature, fully devoted to her job, and always in search of satisfaction.\u201d\n\n==Sequels==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' was followed by three [[sequel]]s, all variations on the [[sexploitation]] [[Women in prison film|women in prison]] theme:<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" />\n* ''[[Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks]]'' (1976) - the only sequel to be directed by Don Edmonds. The film is set in an unnamed Middle Eastern kingdom in modern times, with Ilsa as the overseer of a wealthy Sheikh\u2019s [[harem]].\n* ''[[Ilsa, the Wicked Warden]]'' (1977) - directed by [[Jes\u00fas Franco]]. ''Wicked Warden'' was not originally an official entry in the series, instead being an unrelated European film starring Dyanne Thorne as a similar warden character named \u2018Wanda\u2019. When released in North America, the rights were purchased by the official Ilsa rights holders, who redubbed the film to rename the main character Ilsa and incorporate it as an official entry in the series. It is the only entry in the series to be produced in Germany.\n* ''[[Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia]]'' (also 1977) - directed by Jean LaFleur. It is the fourth and final entry, and the only entry to be shot on-location in [[Canada]]. It is unique among the series for its \u201ctwo-act\u201d structure, the first half depicting Ilsa as the commandant of a Siberian [[gulag]] in the [[Soviet Union]], while the second half flashes-forward 20 years later to modern-day [[Montreal]], where Ilsa is now the proprietor of a [[brothel]] on the run from Soviet authorities. This entry was produced by [[Ivan Reitman]] and [[Roger Corman]] under the shared alias \u201cJulius Parnell\u201d.\n\nDespite her character being killed off at the end of the first film, Thorne reprised her role in three follow-ups, continuing to depict Ilsa as a sadomasochistic authority figure with an exaggerated German accent. None of these sequels have any story continuity with one another, depicting Ilsa in wildly differing locations and time period and often ending in her death or incapacitation.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In [[J\u00f6rg Buttgereit]]'s 1989 horror film ''[[Der Todesking]]'', a character rents a Nazisploitation movie called ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' (Vera, the Death-Angel of the [[Gestapo]]), which depicts a concentration camp prisoner being castrated by an Ilsa-like prison guard.\n* The 2007 film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' features a faux-trailer for a film called ''Werewolf Women of the S.S.'' by [[Rob Zombie]], whose characters have been referred to as resembling Ilsa. The lead female officer, Eva Krupp (played by Zombie's wife, [[Sheri Moon Zombie|Sheri Moon]]), can also be seen as an Ilsa-like character.<ref name=\"evers\" /><!--\nwho?\n* The American speed metal band At War recorded the song \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\", based on both the film and Ilse Koch.<ref name=\"metal\" /> \n-->\n*The New York hardcore band [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]] wrote the song \"Ilsa\" which was inspired by the movie.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"av1\">{{cite news\n| url = https://www.avclub.com/read-this-the-ongoing-controversy-of-ilsa-she-wolf-of-1798404855 \n| title = Read This: The ongoing controversy of Ilsa: She Wolf Of The SS \n| last = Colburn | first = Randall \n| website = The A.V.

The film is directed by American filmmaker Don Edmonds and produced by [[David F. Friedman]] for [[Lionsgate Films|Cin\u00e9pix Film Properties]] in [[Montreal]]. The film stars [[Dyanne Thorne]] in the titular role, who is loosely based on [[Ilse Koch]], the wife of a real-life commandant at the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].\n\nUpon its release in early 1975, the film was immediately met with widespread controversy and critical derision, with [[Gene Siskel]] calling it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown\". Particular criticism was directed at the film\u2019s graphic violence; which includes depictions of [[castration]], [[flogging]], human experimentation, and many other forms of [[torture]]. Word-of-mouth quickly spread, and the film was a considerable financial success, becoming a staple of [[grindhouse]] and [[drive-in theatres]].\n\nThe popularity of the film led to the creation of three sequels, each of which saw Thorne reprise her role. The film\u2019s infamy eventually evolved into a considerable [[cult following]], with the character of Ilsa becoming a pop cultural icon ubiquitous with \u201cstrong, aggressive\u201d female authority.<ref name=\"av2\" /><ref name=\"av1\" /> The film is considered one of the prominent entries of the [[Nazisploitation]] sub-genre, and to a lesser degree the [[sexploitation]] sub-genre.\n\n==Plot==\nEurope, 1945. Ilsa is [[Kommandant]] of a [[Nazism|Nazi]] prison camp, who conducts [[Nazi human experimentation|sadistic scientific experiments]] designed to demonstrate that women are more capable of enduring pain than men are, and therefore should be allowed to fight in the ever-depleting German armed forces. A sadistic authoritarian, Ilsa has a voracious sexual appetite for men, choosing a new male prisoner each night to copulate with. However, owing to her [[hypersexuality]], she is disappointed when her victims inevitably [[Ejaculation|ejaculates]], and promptly has them [[Castration|castrated]] and put to death.\n\nAfter dispatching her latest conquest, Ilsa oversees the arrival of a new batch of both male and female prisoners. Though largely dismissive and dehumanizing of the majority of her wards, she becomes enamoured by the presence of Wolfe; a blond-haired and blue-eyed prisoner who, unlike his compatriots, resembles the Nazi [[Aryan]] ideal. Wolfe, a [[German Americans|German-American]] student who had been studying in [[Berlin]] before the war broke out, tells his cellmate Mario (one of Ilsa\u2019s former victims) that he has the ability to ejaculate at will, allowing him to have sex with incredible endurance and skill. Wolfe demonstrates this when, called to Ilsa\u2019s bedroom at night, he manages to bring her to [[orgasm]], becoming her first repeat partner whom she willingly spares.\n\nHaving entered into Ilsa\u2019s confidence, Wolfe begins plotting revolt with Mario and a group of female prisoners who have borne the brunt of Ilsa\u2019s tortures. Meanwhile, Ilsa becomes gradually more and more anxious by news of [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] breaking through German defenses and ever-encroaching. Believing that the enlistment of women into the German military will help stem the tide, Ilsa attempts to convince a visiting General of her theories of female supremacy by showing him the various inhumane experiments she has subjected her female prisoners to. The General is roundly impressed and awards Ilsa the [[Iron Cross]] for her efforts, while forcing her to fulfill his nascent [[urolagnia]] by giving him a [[golden shower]].\n\nWith the Germans in retreat, the prisoners finally revolt, managing to kill most of the guards and rounding up the surviving staff. Ilsa is tied to her bed with her [[stockings]] by Wolfe during a sex game, before he steals her gun and helps his comrades. Wolfe pleads with the other prisoners to leave the Nazis to be captured and tried by the Allies, but they insist that they\u2019ll escape punishment, and [[Summary execution|summarily execute]] them. With retreating Nazi forces fast approaching, Wolfe and a lone female prisoner escape into the nearby hills as the remaining prisoners, including Mario, resolve to fight to the death. They\u2019re quickly outgunned by a [[Waffen-SS]] tank troupe, who promptly wipes out the small resistance.\n\nThe Commander disembarks and begins investigating the camp. Upon finding Ilsa tied up helplessly, he coldly shoots her in the head and kills her, before ordering the [[razing]] of the camp to destroy any evidence of their atrocities. As he brags that the Allies will never know what happened, Wolfe and his fellow escapee watch from atop a nearby hill, the sole survivors of Ilsa\u2019s death camp.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dyanne Thorne]] as Ilsa\n* Gregory Knoph as Wolfe\n* Tony Mumolo as Mario\n* [[George Buck Flower]] as Binz <small>(as C.D.

Like many of its counterparts, Ilsa follows a [[women in prison film|women-in-prison formula]], but subverts it by having a female authority figure dominating male submissives.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter [[Lee Frost (director)|Lee Frost]] and [[David F. Friedman]]'s ''[[Love Camp 7]]'' (1969) became successful in Canada, Andr\u00e9 Link and [[John Dunning (film producer)|John Dunning]] of [[Cinepix Film Properties]] sought to capitalize by producing their own Nazi-themed exploitation film.<ref name=\"canux\" /> Dunning was inspired by historical records of wartime medical experiments on unwilling human subjects, but also sought to add a female villain.\n\nDunning worked on the screenplay with writer John C.W. Saxton, drawing inspiration from [[Ilse Koch]], wife of the commandant of the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] and, later, [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]].<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" /> Nicknamed \u201cThe Bitch of Buchenwald\u201d, Koch engaged in several war crimes, including an experiment in which she had the skin of tattooed prisoners removed to make furniture. The film\u2019s central premise of Ilsa torturing women to test their endurance for pain was based on a wartime medical theory that women could take pain and punishment better than men, because they were better equipped as a result of the birthing ordeal.\n\nLink and Dunning approached ''Love Camp 7'' producer [[David F. Friedman]] to produce, an offer he promptly accepted. Friedman was a veteran exploitation filmmaker, having produced numerous \u201croughie\u201d sexploitation films, as well as [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]]\u2019 seminal ''[[Blood Feast]]''. The director was Don Edmonds, an actor who\u2019d begun directing sexploitation films earlier in the decade. Ilsa would be his third film as director, following ''Wild Honey'' and ''[[Tender Loving Care (film)|Tender Loving Care]]''.\n\n===Casting===\nFriedman\u2019s first choice of casting for the lead role was [[Phyllis Davis]]. When she proved unviable, he sought out [[Dyanne Thorne]] to play the eponymous character. Thorne was a longtime [[Las Vegas]] showgirl who had studied under [[Stella Adler]], who at the time was working as a [[chauffeur]]. Thorne referred to the script as \u201cawful\u201d, but took the role after a friend recommended Edmonds personally.\n\nThe role of Dr. Binz, Ilsa\u2019s diminutive male assistant, Edmonds cast his previous collaborator [[George Buck Flower]], who had also worked with Thorne and Friedman in various capacities as an assistant director, casting director, set decorator, and grip. Flower also served as an uncredited assistant director. Binz\u2019s appearance is based on that of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], a pioneering German [[sexologist]] (though the real Hirschfeld was fervently anti-Nazi and anti-fascist).\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in nine days.<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" /> It used the [[Culver City]], [[California]] [[Stalag 13 (film set)|set]] of the TV series ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''.<ref name=\"porning\" /> The series had already been cancelled and the show's producers let the film be made on it once they learned that a scene called for it to be burned down, thus saving them the cost of having it demolished.\n\nBecause the film was shot in the United States, it could not legally qualify for the [[Canadian Film Development Corporation]]\u2019s \u201cCapital Gains Allowance\u201d. Link and Dunning chose to both go uncredited in their capacities as executive producers.\n\n===Post-production===\nDuring editing, David Friedman decided to place a notice before the film\u2019s opening credits in order to add an air of legitimacy and hopefully tide potential criticism. It reads: \"The film you are about to see is based on documented fact. The atrocities shown were conducted as '[[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]]' in special [[concentration camp]]s throughout [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Although these [[crimes against humanity]] are historically accurate, the characters depicted are composites of notorious Nazi personalities; and the events portrayed, have been condensed into one locality for dramatic purposes. Because of its shocking subject matter, this film is restricted to adult audiences only. We dedicate this film with the hope that these heinous crimes will never happen again.\"\n\n===Use of pseudonyms===\nSeveral key members of the cast and crew were credited under pseudonyms. David F. Friedman is credited as \u201cHerman Traeger\u201d, screenwriter John C.W. Saxton as \u201cJonah Royston\u201d, and actors George Buck Flower as \u201cC.D. Lafleuer\u201d and Richard Kennedy as \u201cWolfgang Roehm\u201d. The credited editor, Kurt Schnit, was likely also a pseudonym, as no such film editor of the time is known to have existed, and does not hold any other credits of any kind.\n\n== Release ==\n''Ilsa'' was rejected by the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] in 1975 and remains unreleased in the country.<ref name=\"bbfc\" /> It was [[List of banned films|banned]] in Australia, Germany, and Norway.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In the United States, the film was released mostly to urban and [[grindhouse]] theatres, as was standard practice for many exploitation films of the time.<ref name=\"grierson\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' has received primarily negative reviews, and holds a rating of 36% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 11 reviews.<ref name=\"rotten\" />\n\n''The Independent Film Journal'' wrote, \"Only the most dangerously sadistic mentalities will manage to sit voluntarily through more than ten minutes of ''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS,'' a graphic, stomach-churning catalogue of Nazi medical atrocities that makes ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' look like a Sunday picnic ... Theatres catering to the lowest possible grade of audience could make a bundle of dirty money. Others would be wise to forget it.\"<ref name=\"ifj\" />\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film zero stars out of four and called it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown ... ''Ilsa'' plays like a textbook for rapists and mutilation freaks.\" He identified the distributors of the film and advised them to \"see it, because I'm certain they would then remove it.\"<ref name=\"siskel\" /> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported walking out on the film and wrote that it \"could possibly be the worst soft-core sex-and-violence film of the decade\u2014and the funniest. It's set in a World War II Nazi concentration camp built in a meadow that looks very southern California. You can almost hear the freeway traffic on the other side of the hill.\"<ref name=\"canby\" /> Dave Kehr of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described the film as \"self-conscious Canadian-made camp\", which \"wasn't notorious until it was fiercely denounced in the high-profile media\".<ref name=\"kehr\" />\n\n''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a scathing review, noting that it \"has absolutely no sense of humor that might go where the obvious lack of moral purpose is\".<ref name=\"av2\" />\n\nThe film's director Don Edmonds described the screenplay as \"the worst piece of shit I ever read\".<ref name=\"av2\" />\n\n==Accolades==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' won Best Alternative Release at the 1985 [[AVN awards]], ten years after its initial release.<ref name=\"avn\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nDespite being almost-universally critically derided, the film has gained a significant cult following, in large part due to the endurance of the lead character and Thorne\u2019s [[campy|camp]] performance. Film scholar Rikki Schubert appraises the character as [[feminist]], writing in her book ''Super Bitches and Action Babes: The Female Hero in Popular Cinema, 1970\u20132006''  \u201cshe is not a female hero in any ordinary sense, yet she is a strong, active and aggressive protagonist who has become mythical in Western culture.\u201d\n\nArtist and filmmaker Twiggs Gorie likewise considers the film a feminist parable due to Ilsa\u2019s characterization as a strong and authoritarian figure, \u201cCan you imagine the balls it would take to live in this super-patriarchal [Nazi] society and turn around and tell her superior officers, \u2018I want to prove to you that we are just as good as the men\u2019? The whole ideology behind this government is, \u2018Oh no, you\u2019re a woman\u2014all you have to do is spread your legs and pump out some kids.\u2019 I see it as an empowerment film\u2014a wonderful display of strong, confident women. That image is missing in 2017\u2014it\u2019s missing from our cinema, it\u2019s missing from everything. I was a teenager in the early 2000s, and I saw the advent of those illegal-looking, American Apparel, super-weak-looking girls\u2014that\u2019s what everybody wanted. Bondage came into the mainstream, but it was women being submissive, and I was sick of it. I want stronger female role models and stronger female imagery. And when I look at this movie, that\u2019s what I see.\u201d\n\nThe character is considered a quintessential pop cultural depiction of [[sadomasochism]] and [[hypersexuality]], with Schubert writing that \u201cThe uniform, the beautiful and harsh appearance, the fierce pride and the cold cruelty are all features of the dominatrix, who is here, quite literally, a \u2018castrating bitch.\u2019 She is a hypersexual creature, fully devoted to her job, and always in search of satisfaction.\u201d\n\n==Sequels==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' was followed by three [[sequel]]s, all variations on the [[sexploitation]] [[Women in prison film|women in prison]] theme:<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" />\n* ''[[Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks]]'' (1976) - the only sequel to be directed by Don Edmonds. The film is set in an unnamed Middle Eastern kingdom in modern times, with Ilsa as the overseer of a wealthy Sheikh\u2019s [[harem]].\n* ''[[Ilsa, the Wicked Warden]]'' (1977) - directed by [[Jes\u00fas Franco]]. ''Wicked Warden'' was not originally an official entry in the series, instead being an unrelated European film starring Dyanne Thorne as a similar warden character named \u2018Wanda\u2019. When released in North America, the rights were purchased by the official Ilsa rights holders, who redubbed the film to rename the main character Ilsa and incorporate it as an official entry in the series. It is the only entry in the series to be produced in Germany.\n* ''[[Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia]]'' (also 1977) - directed by Jean LaFleur. It is the fourth and final entry, and the only entry to be shot on-location in [[Canada]]. It is unique among the series for its \u201ctwo-act\u201d structure, the first half depicting Ilsa as the commandant of a Siberian [[gulag]] in the [[Soviet Union]], while the second half flashes-forward 20 years later to modern-day [[Montreal]], where Ilsa is now the proprietor of a [[brothel]] on the run from Soviet authorities. This entry was produced by [[Ivan Reitman]] and [[Roger Corman]] under the shared alias \u201cJulius Parnell\u201d.\n\nDespite her character being killed off at the end of the first film, Thorne reprised her role in three follow-ups, continuing to depict Ilsa as a sadomasochistic authority figure with an exaggerated German accent. None of these sequels have any story continuity with one another, depicting Ilsa in wildly differing locations and time period and often ending in her death or incapacitation.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In [[J\u00f6rg Buttgereit]]'s 1989 horror film ''[[Der Todesking]]'', a character rents a Nazisploitation movie called ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' (Vera, the Death-Angel of the [[Gestapo]]), which depicts a concentration camp prisoner being castrated by an Ilsa-like prison guard.\n* The 2007 film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' features a faux-trailer for a film called ''Werewolf Women of the S.S.'' by [[Rob Zombie]], whose characters have been referred to as resembling Ilsa. The lead female officer, Eva Krupp (played by Zombie's wife, [[Sheri Moon Zombie|Sheri Moon]]), can also be seen as an Ilsa-like character.<ref name=\"evers\" /><!--\nwho?\n* The American speed metal band At War recorded the song \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\", based on both the film and Ilse Koch.<ref name=\"metal\" /> \n-->\n*The New York hardcore band [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]] wrote the song \"Ilsa\" which was inspired by the movie.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"av1\">{{cite news\n| url = https://www.avclub.com/read-this-the-ongoing-controversy-of-ilsa-she-wolf-of-1798404855 \n| title = Read This: The ongoing controversy of Ilsa: She Wolf Of The SS \n| last = Colburn | first = Randall \n| website = The A.V.
