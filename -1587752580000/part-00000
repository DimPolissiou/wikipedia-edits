The 1st Battalion was headquartered in [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] with individual companies located in [[Amherst, Nova Scotia|Amherst]], [[Pictou]], [[New Glasgow, Nova Scotia|New Glasgow]], [[Springhill, Nova Scotia|Springhill]], and Truro.

There was a strong movement within the unit by the majority of the troops to replace the beret with the balmoral once again as it marked out the highland unit as distinctive and showed the ties with the unit's heritage that contributed to its ''\u00e9sprit de corps''. As of January 1, 2011, the balmoral once again became the official headdress of the 1st Battalion as well.

The 2nd Battalion was headquartered in [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], and in 2011 it was renamed back to its pre-1954 designation, the [[Cape Breton Highlanders]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?cat=00&id=3701 |title=Minister of National Defence Peter Mackay Announces the Return of the Cape Breton Highlanders |author=Ministry of National Defence |date=January 16, 2011 |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706182238/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?cat=00&id=3701 |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Cape Breton Highlanders on parade Saturday for first time in more than 50 years |author=Ken MacLeod |url=http://www.capebretonpost.com/News/Local/2011-09-08/article-2743608/Cape-Breton-Highlanders-on-parade-Saturday-for-first-time-in-nearly-30-years/1 |newspaper=Cape Breton Post |date=September 8, 2011 |accessdate=September 11, 2011}}</ref> This leaves The Nova Scotia Highlanders as a one-battalion regiment.\n\n== Headdress ==\nAlthough the 2nd Battalion continued the proud tradition of wearing [[balmoral bonnet|balmorals]], the traditional headdress of the regiment, the 1st Battalion did not. There was a strong movement within the unit by the majority of the troops to replace the beret with the balmoral once again as it marked out the highland unit as distinctive and showed the ties with the unit's heritage that contributed to its ''\u00e9sprit de corps''. As of January 1, 2011, the balmoral once again became the official headdress of the 1st Battalion as well.

[[John Williams]] described him as \"one of the great American masters of light orchestral music.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leroyanderson.com/accolades.php|title=Quotations about Leroy Anderson|website=leroyanderson.com}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Swedish parents, Anderson was given his first piano lessons by his mother, who was a church organist. He continued studying piano at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]]. In 1925 Anderson entered Harvard College, where he studied musical harmony with Walter Spalding, counterpoint with [[Edward Ballantine]], canon and fugue with [[William Clifford Heilman|William C. Heilman]], orchestration with [[Edward Burlingame Hill|Edward B. Hill]] and [[Walter Piston]], composition, also with Piston, and double bass with [[Gaston Dufresne]]. He also studied organ with Henry Gideon. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, [[Latin honors|magna cum laude]] in 1929 and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">\"Syncopated Clock, Indeed\"; Janet Frank, The American Scholar, Summer 2008, Phi Beta Kappa Society</ref> In Harvard University Graduate School, he studied composition with Walter Piston and [[George Enescu]] and received a Master of Arts in Music in 1930.<ref name=\"leroyanderson1\">{{cite web |first=Eleanor |last=Anderson |author2=Rolf Anderson |url=http://www.leroyanderson.com/biography.php |title=Official Biography &gt; American Composer and Conductor of Light Concert Music |publisher=Leroy Anderson |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAnderson continued studying at Harvard, working towards a PhD in German and Scandinavian languages; Anderson spoke English and Swedish during his youth, and eventually became fluent in Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, German, French, Italian, and Portuguese.\n\nAt the time he was working as organist and choir director at the East Milton [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]], leading the Harvard University Band, and conducting and arranging for dance bands around Boston. In 1936 his arrangements came to the attention of [[Arthur Fiedler]], who asked to see any original compositions that he could use in his concerts as the 18th conductor of the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] at [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Biography/Bio.htm |title=Leroy Anderson biographical material |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Anderson's first work was the 1938 ''Jazz Pizzicato'', but at just over ninety seconds the piece was too short for a three-minute 78 rpm single of the period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_JPizzicato.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Jazz Pizzicato |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Fiedler suggested writing a companion piece, and Anderson wrote ''Jazz Legato'' later that same year. The combined recording went on to become one of Anderson's signature compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_JLegato.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Jazz Legato |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1942 Anderson joined the United States Army, and was assigned in Iceland with the [[Counterintelligence Corps|U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps]] as a translator and interpreter;<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> in 1945 he was reassigned to [[the Pentagon]] as Chief of the Scandinavian Desk of Military Intelligence. His duties did not, however, prevent him from composing, and in 1945 he wrote \"[[The Syncopated Clock]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_SClock.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 The Syncopated Clock |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> and \"Promenade\". Anderson became a reserve officer and was recalled to active duty for the Korean War. He wrote his first hit, \"[[Blue Tango]]\", In 1951, earning a Golden Disc and the No. 1 spot on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].\n\nHis pieces and his recordings during the 1950s conducting a studio orchestra were immense commercial successes. \"Blue Tango\" was the first instrumental recording ever to sell one million copies. His most famous pieces are probably \"[[Sleigh Ride]]\" and \"The Syncopated Clock\". In February 1951, [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City selected \"The Syncopated Clock\" as the theme song for ''The Late Show'', the WCBS late-night movie, using [[Percy Faith]]'s recording. [[Mitchell Parish]] added words to \"The Syncopated Clock\", and later wrote lyrics for other Anderson tunes, including \"Sleigh Ride\", which was not written as a Christmas piece, but as a work that describes a winter event. Anderson started the work during a heat wave in August 1946. The Boston Pops' recording of it was the first pure orchestral piece to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Music chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_SRide.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Sleigh Ride |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> From 1952 to 1961, Anderson's composition \"Plink, Plank, Plunk!\" was used as the theme for the CBS panel show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.\n\nAnderson's musical style employs creative instrumental effects and occasionally makes use of sound-generating items such as typewriters and sandpaper.\n\nAnderson wrote his Piano Concerto in C in 1953 but withdrew it, feeling that it had weak spots. The Anderson family decided to publish the work in 1988. [[Erich Kunzel]] and the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]] released the first recording of this work; four other recordings, including one for piano and organ, have since been released.\n\nIn 1958, Anderson composed the music for the Broadway show ''[[Goldilocks (musical)|Goldilocks]]'' with orchestrations by [[Philip J. Lang]]. Even though it earned two Tony awards, ''Goldilocks'' did not achieve commercial success. Anderson never wrote another musical, preferring instead to continue writing orchestral miniatures. His pieces, including \"[[The Typewriter]]\", \"Bugler's Holiday\", and \"[[A Trumpeter's Lullaby]]\" are performed by orchestras and bands ranging from school groups to professional organizations.\n\nAnderson would occasionally appear on the Boston Pops regular concerts on PBS to conduct his own music while Fiedler would sit on the sidelines. For \"The Typewriter\" Fiedler would don a green eyeshade, roll up his sleeves, and mime working on an old typewriter while the orchestra played.\n\nAnderson was initiated as an honorary member of the Gamma Omega chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] at Indiana State University in 1969.\n\n==Death==\nIn 1975, Anderson died of cancer in Woodbury, Connecticut<ref name=\"leroyanderson1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/061/000109731/ |title=Leroy Anderson |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> and was buried there.<ref>{{Find a Grave |grid=1807 |name=Leroy Anderson |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nFor his contribution to the recording industry, Leroy Anderson has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1620 Vine Street.

Previously, Los Angeles station [[KABC-TV]] used the song as its sign-off theme at the end of broadcast days in the 1980s, and [[Mantovani]]'s recording of the song had been the closing theme for WABC-TV's ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' for much of the 1970s. \"Forgotten Dreams\" was used as a recurring theme in the French film ''[[Populaire (film)|Populaire]]'' (2012).\n\n''The Typewriter'' was used as the theme song for ''Esto no tiene nombre'', a Puerto Rican television comedy program \u2013 loosely based on the TV series ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' \u2013 produced by [[Tommy Mu\u00f1iz]] between the late 1960s and late 1970s.

[[John Williams]] described him as \"one of the great American masters of light orchestral music.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leroyanderson.com/accolades.php|title=Quotations about Leroy Anderson|website=leroyanderson.com}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Swedish parents, Anderson was given his first piano lessons by his mother, who was a church organist. He continued studying piano at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]]. In 1925 Anderson entered Harvard College, where he studied musical harmony with Walter Spalding, counterpoint with [[Edward Ballantine]], canon and fugue with [[William Clifford Heilman|William C. Heilman]], orchestration with [[Edward Burlingame Hill|Edward B. Hill]] and [[Walter Piston]], composition, also with Piston, and double bass with [[Gaston Dufresne]]. He also studied organ with Henry Gideon. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, [[Latin honors|magna cum laude]] in 1929 and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">\"Syncopated Clock, Indeed\"; Janet Frank, The American Scholar, Summer 2008, Phi Beta Kappa Society</ref> In Harvard University Graduate School, he studied composition with Walter Piston and [[George Enescu]] and received a Master of Arts in Music in 1930.<ref name=\"leroyanderson1\">{{cite web |first=Eleanor |last=Anderson |author2=Rolf Anderson |url=http://www.leroyanderson.com/biography.php |title=Official Biography &gt; American Composer and Conductor of Light Concert Music |publisher=Leroy Anderson |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAnderson continued studying at Harvard, working towards a PhD in German and Scandinavian languages; Anderson spoke English and Swedish during his youth, and eventually became fluent in Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, German, French, Italian, and Portuguese.\n\nAt the time he was working as organist and choir director at the East Milton [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]], leading the Harvard University Band, and conducting and arranging for dance bands around Boston. In 1936 his arrangements came to the attention of [[Arthur Fiedler]], who asked to see any original compositions that he could use in his concerts as the 18th conductor of the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] at [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Biography/Bio.htm |title=Leroy Anderson biographical material |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Anderson's first work was the 1938 ''Jazz Pizzicato'', but at just over ninety seconds the piece was too short for a three-minute 78 rpm single of the period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_JPizzicato.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Jazz Pizzicato |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Fiedler suggested writing a companion piece, and Anderson wrote ''Jazz Legato'' later that same year. The combined recording went on to become one of Anderson's signature compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_JLegato.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Jazz Legato |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1942 Anderson joined the United States Army, and was assigned in Iceland with the [[Counterintelligence Corps|U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps]] as a translator and interpreter;<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> in 1945 he was reassigned to [[the Pentagon]] as Chief of the Scandinavian Desk of Military Intelligence. His duties did not, however, prevent him from composing, and in 1945 he wrote \"[[The Syncopated Clock]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_SClock.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 The Syncopated Clock |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> and \"Promenade\". Anderson became a reserve officer and was recalled to active duty for the Korean War. He wrote his first hit, \"[[Blue Tango]]\", In 1951, earning a Golden Disc and the No. 1 spot on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].\n\nHis pieces and his recordings during the 1950s conducting a studio orchestra were immense commercial successes. \"Blue Tango\" was the first instrumental recording ever to sell one million copies. His most famous pieces are probably \"[[Sleigh Ride]]\" and \"The Syncopated Clock\". In February 1951, [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City selected \"The Syncopated Clock\" as the theme song for ''The Late Show'', the WCBS late-night movie, using [[Percy Faith]]'s recording. [[Mitchell Parish]] added words to \"The Syncopated Clock\", and later wrote lyrics for other Anderson tunes, including \"Sleigh Ride\", which was not written as a Christmas piece, but as a work that describes a winter event. Anderson started the work during a heat wave in August 1946. The Boston Pops' recording of it was the first pure orchestral piece to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Music chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_SRide.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Sleigh Ride |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> From 1952 to 1961, Anderson's composition \"Plink, Plank, Plunk!\" was used as the theme for the CBS panel show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.\n\nAnderson's musical style employs creative instrumental effects and occasionally makes use of sound-generating items such as typewriters and sandpaper.\n\nAnderson wrote his Piano Concerto in C in 1953 but withdrew it, feeling that it had weak spots. The Anderson family decided to publish the work in 1988. [[Erich Kunzel]] and the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]] released the first recording of this work; four other recordings, including one for piano and organ, have since been released.\n\nIn 1958, Anderson composed the music for the Broadway show ''[[Goldilocks (musical)|Goldilocks]]'' with orchestrations by [[Philip J. Lang]]. Even though it earned two Tony awards, ''Goldilocks'' did not achieve commercial success. Anderson never wrote another musical, preferring instead to continue writing orchestral miniatures. His pieces, including \"[[The Typewriter]]\", \"Bugler's Holiday\", and \"[[A Trumpeter's Lullaby]]\" are performed by orchestras and bands ranging from school groups to professional organizations.\n\nAnderson would occasionally appear on the Boston Pops regular concerts on PBS to conduct his own music while Fiedler would sit on the sidelines. For \"The Typewriter\" Fiedler would don a green eyeshade, roll up his sleeves, and mime working on an old typewriter while the orchestra played.\n\nAnderson was initiated as an honorary member of the Gamma Omega chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] at Indiana State University in 1969.\n\n==Death==\nIn 1975, Anderson died of cancer in Woodbury, Connecticut<ref name=\"leroyanderson1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/061/000109731/ |title=Leroy Anderson |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> and was buried there.<ref>{{Find a Grave |grid=1807 |name=Leroy Anderson |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nFor his contribution to the recording industry, Leroy Anderson has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1620 Vine Street. He was posthumously inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1988, and his music continues to be a staple of \"pops\" orchestra repertoire. In 1995 the new headquarters of the Harvard University Band was named the Anderson Band Center in honor of Leroy Anderson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leroyandersonfoundation.org/cambridge.php |title=Leroy Anderson Foundation, Cambridge Massachusetts, Birthplace of Leroy Anderson [1908\u20131975&#93; |publisher=Leroyandersonfoundation.org |date= |access-date=2012-05-01}}</ref> The Leroy Anderson House in Woodbury, Connecticut has been placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>\"Leroy Anderson house, Woodbury\", Connecticut Preservation News, May/June 2013, Volume XXXVI, No. 3, page 9, CT Trust for Historic Preservation.</ref>\n\nIn 2006, one of his piano works, \"Forgotten Dreams\", written in 1954, became the background for a British TV advertisement for mobile phone company \"3\".

A collection of tents was erected to serve travelers with food, drink and lodging.\n\nIn 1925, entrepreneur Bob Eichmann began construction of the hotel at Stovepipe Wells, along with a scenic toll road through Death Valley. This marked the beginning of the transition from mining community to tourist destination.\n\nThe settlement is now registered as [[California Historical Landmark]] #826.<ref name=CHL>{{cite ohp|826|Stovepipe Wells|2012-10-07}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nStovepipe Wells Village is home to the [http://deathvalleyhotels.com Stovepipe Wells Hotel], a full-service hotel with swimming pool. The General Store offers sundries and food, and is adjacent to a gas station. Stovepipe Wells Village also houses the Badwater Saloon and Toll Road restaurant, The Nugget Gift Shop and a ranger station.\n\nThe default format for wired telephone numbers in the community is in the [[Telephone exchange|Death Valley exchange]]: (760) 786-xxxx. The community had manual telephone service until the late 1980s.\n\nThe community is contained within the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District.\n\n==Nearby features==\n* Close to town are some fairly large and accessible stationary sand dunes on the floor of Death Valley. The dunes are roughly {{convert|7|mi|km}} long in the east\u2013west axis.

{"title_page": "Life insurance", "text_new": "'''Life insurance''' (or '''life assurance''', especially in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]) is a contract between an [[insurance policy]] holder and an [[insurance|insurer or assurer]], where the insurer promises to pay a designated [[beneficiary]] a sum of money (the benefit) in exchange for a premium, upon the death of an insured person (often the policy holder). Depending on the contract, other events such as [[terminal illness]] or [[critical illness]] can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses, such as funeral expenses, can also be included in the benefits. \n\nLife policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; common examples are claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion.\n\nModern life insurance bears some similarity to the [[asset management]] industry<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/features/industryhandbook/insurance.asp|title=The Industry Handbook: The Insurance Industry|date=2004-01-07|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907000042/https://www.investopedia.com/features/industryhandbook/insurance.asp|archive-date=2018-09-07|url-status=live|language=en-US}}</ref> and life insurers have diversified their products into retirement products such as [[Annuity (American)|annuities]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Industries/Industry_Overview__Life_Insurance.aspx#.W_4wr5NKiAx|title=Industry Overview: Life Insurance|website=www.valueline.com|publisher=[[ValueLine]]|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> \n\n<u>Life-based contracts tend to fall into two major categories:</u>\n\n* Protection policies: designed to provide a benefit, typically a lump sum payment, in the event of a specified occurrence.

The [[Presbyterianism in the United States|Presbyterian]] Synods in [[Synod of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and [[Synod of New York|New York City]] created the Corporation for Relief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in 1759; [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] priests organized a similar fund in 1769. Between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started, but fewer than half a dozen survived. In the 1870s, military officers banded together to found both the Army ([[AAFMAA]]) and the [[Navy Mutual Aid Association]] (Navy Mutual), inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the West after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Little Big Horn]], and of the families of U.S. sailors who died at sea.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Parties to contract===\nThe person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner, while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit. The owner and insured may or may not be the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and they will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.\n\n[[File:Chart of a life insurance.jpg|thumb|Chart of a life insurance]]\n\nThe beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured person's death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiary.\n\nIn cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the ''celui qui vit'' or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an [[insurable interest]] in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the [[wrongful death]] of the victim (''Liberty National Life v. Weldon'', 267 Ala.171 (1957)).\n\n===Contract terms===\nSpecial exclusions may apply, such as suicide clauses, whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured dies by [[suicide]] within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification. Most US states specify a maximum contestability period, often no more than two years. Only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claim.\n\nThe face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy [[Maturity (finance)|matures]], although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).\n\n===Costs, insurability, and underwriting===\nThe insurance company calculates the policy prices (premiums) at a level sufficient to fund claims, cover administrative costs, and provide a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by [[actuary|actuaries]]. Mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages. Put simply, people are more likely to die as they get older and the mortality tables enable the insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|title=IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Revenue Ruling 2002-62|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808064248/http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|archivedate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|title=IRS Bulletin No. 2002\u201342|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502202442/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select & Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently.

At the end of 10 years, the mortality of that 25-year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25-year-old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year \u00d7 $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy.) Other costs, such as administrative and sales expenses, also need to be considered when setting the premiums. A 10-year policy for a 25-year-old non-smoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.\n\nMost of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums, but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies. [[Group Insurance]] policies are an exception to this.\n\nIn the United States, life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, with the exception of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine insurability, and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.\n\nMany companies separate applicants into four general categories. These categories are ''preferred best'', ''preferred'', ''standard'', and ''tobacco''. Preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population. This may mean, that the proposed insured has no adverse medical history, is not under medication, and has no family history of early-onset [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], or other conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=How do Insurance Rating Classifications Work?|url=http://seniorlifepolicies.com/how-do-insurance-rating-classifications-work/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Preferred means that the proposed insured is currently under medication and has a family history of particular illnesses.

If the insured's death is suspicious and the policy amount is large, the insurer may investigate the circumstances surrounding the death before deciding whether it has an obligation to pay the claim.\n\nPayment from the policy may be as a lump sum or as an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]], which is paid in regular installments for either a specified period or [[Life annuity|for the beneficiary's lifetime]].<ref name=\"OECD2016\">{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Life Annuity Products and Their Guarantees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_GmDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|date=5 December 2016|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-26531-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance vs assurance===\nThe specific uses of the terms \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201cassurance\u201d are sometimes confused. In general, in jurisdictions where both terms are used, \u201cinsurance\u201d refers to providing coverage for an event that ''might'' happen (fire, theft, flood, etc.), while \u201cassurance\u201d is the provision of coverage for an event that is ''certain'' to happen. In the United States, both forms of coverage are called \u201cinsurance\u201d for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} By some definitions, \u201cinsurance\u201d is any coverage that determines benefits based on actual losses whereas \u201cassurance\u201d is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurred.\n\nLife insurance may be divided into two basic classes: temporary and permanent; or the following subclasses: term, universal, [[Whole life insurance|whole life]], and endowment life insurance.\n\n===Term insurance===\n{{Main|Term life insurance}}\n\n[[Term assurance]] provides life insurance coverage for a specified term. The policy does not accumulate cash value. Term insurance is significantly less expensive than an equivalent permanent policy but will become higher with age. Policy holders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs (by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needs).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Black |first1=Kenneth, Jr. |last2=Skipper |first2=Harold D., Jr. |title=Life Insurance |edition=4th |year=1994 |page=94 |isbn=0135329957}}</ref>\n\n''[[Mortgage life insurance]]'' insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments. The face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid.\n\n==== Group life insurance ====\n''Group life insurance'' (also known as ''wholesale life insurance'' or ''institutional life insurance'') is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or [[superannuation]] fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of [[adverse selection]]. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage. The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.\n\n===Permanent life insurance===\n''Permanent life insurance'' is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a [[cash value]] up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.\n\nThe three basic types of permanent insurance are ''whole life'', ''universal life'', and ''endowment''.\n\n====Whole life====\n{{Main|Whole life insurance}}\nWhole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount (see main article for a full explanation of the many variations and options).\n\n====Universal life coverage====\n[[Universal life insurance]] (ULl) is a relatively new insurance product, intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments, along with the potential for greater growth of cash values. There are several types of universal life insurance policies, including ''interest-sensitive'' (also known as \u201ctraditional fixed universal life insurance\u201d), ''variable universal life (VUL)'', ''guaranteed death benefit'', and has ''equity-indexed universal life insurance''.\n\nUniversal life insurance policies have cash values. Paid-in premiums increase their cash values; administrative and other costs reduce their cash values.\n\nUniversal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life\u2014namely that premiums and death benefits are fixed. With universal life, both the premiums and death benefit are flexible. With the exception of guaranteed-death-benefit universal life policies, universal life policies trade their greater flexibility off for fewer guarantees.\n\n\u201cFlexible death benefit\u201d means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit. The death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a \"level death benefit\"; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy's cash value\u2014i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.\n\n====Endowments====\n{{main|Endowment policy}}\nThe endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness.\n\nPolicies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds).\n\nEndowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.\n\n====Accidental death====\nAccidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as the result of an accident. \u201cAccidents\u201d run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from non-accident-related health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policies.\n\nSuch insurance can also be ''[[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]]'' or ''AD&D''. In an AD&D policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearing.\n\nAccidental death and AD&D policies ''very rarely pay'' a benefit, either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident, by which time the premiums have gone unpaid. To know what coverage they have, insureds should always review their policies. Risky activities such as parachuting, flying, professional sports, or military service are often omitted from coverage.\n\nAccidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a [[rider (contract)|rider]]. If a rider is purchased, the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident. This was once called ''[[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] insurance''. In some cases, triple indemnity coverage may be available.\n\n==== Senior and pre-need products ====\nInsurance companies have in recent years developed products for niche markets, most notably targeting seniors in an ageing population. These are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies, allowing senior citizens to purchase affordable insurance later in life. This may also be marketed as ''final expense insurance'' and usually have death benefits between $2,000 and $40,000. One reason for their popularity is that they only require answers to simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, while most policies require a medical exam to qualify. As with other policy types, the range of premiums can vary widely and should be scrutinized prior to purchase, as should the reliability of the companies.\n\nHealth questions can vary substantially between exam and no-exam policies. It may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Because seniors sometimes are not fully aware of the policy provisions it is important to make sure that policies last for a lifetime and that premiums do not increase every 5 years as is common in some circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''Pre-need life insurance policies'' are limited premium payment, whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants, though they are available to everyone. This type of insurance is designed to cover specific [[funeral]] expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a [[funeral home]]. The policy's death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the time of prearrangement, and it then typically grows as interest is credited. In exchange for the policy owner's designation, the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral, no matter when death occurs. Excess proceeds may go either to the insured's estate, a designated beneficiary, or the funeral home as set forth in the contract. Purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement, but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years.\n\n==Related products==\n''Riders'' are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner. A common rider is ''accidental death'' (see above). Another common rider is a ''premium waiver'', which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.\n\n''Joint life insurance'' is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons, with proceeds payable on the death of ''either''.\n\n===Unit Linked Insurance Plans===\n{{Main|Unit-linked insurance plan}}\nThese are unique insurance plans which are basically a mutual fund and term insurance plan rolled into one. The investor doesn't participate in the profits of the plan per se, but gets returns based on the returns on the funds he or she had chosen.\n\nSee the main article for a full explanation of the various features and variations.\n\n===With-profits policies===\n{{Main|With-profits policy}}\nSome policies afford the policyholder a share of the profits of the insurance company\u2014these are termed [[with-profits policy|with-profits policies]]. Other policies provide no rights to a share of the profits of the company\u2014these are ''non-profit'' policies.\n\nWith-profits policies are used as a form of [[collective investment scheme]] to achieve capital growth. Other policies offer a guaranteed return not dependent on the company's underlying investment performance; these are often referred to as ''without-profit'' policies, which may be construed as a misnomer.\n\n==Taxation==\n\n=== India ===\nAccording to the section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (of Indian penal code) premiums paid towards a valid life insurance policy can be exempted from the taxable income. Along with life insurance premium, section 80C allows exemption for other financial instruments such as Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), health insurance premium are some of them. The total amount that can be exempted from the taxable income for section 80C is capped at a maximum of INR 150,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section - 80C, Income-tax Act, 1961-2018:B.\u2014Deductions in respect of certain payments |url=https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/acts/income-tax-act.aspx |website=Income Tax India |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> The exemptions are eligible for individuals (Indian citizens) or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).\n\n===Australia===\nWhere the life insurance is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held outside of the superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see \u201cunder what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the definition of substantially self-employed?\u201d. The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |title=ITAA 1936, Section 279 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093936/http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |archivedate=2011-08-28 }}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nPremiums paid by a [[policyholder]] are not deductible from taxable income, although premiums paid via an approved [[pension fund]] registered in terms of the Income Tax Act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax (whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee). The benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries (again in the case of approved benefits, these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]]). Investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of the policyholder (whether natural person, company-owned, untaxed or a retirement fund).\n\n===United States===\nPremiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state [[income tax]] purposes, and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes.<ref>Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 101(a)(1)</ref> However, if the proceeds are included in the \"estate\" of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state [[Estate tax (United States)|estate and inheritance tax]].\n\nCash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate [[tax shelter]] wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. In flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a ''modified endowment contract'' by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premium.\n\nThe tax ramifications of life insurance are complex. The policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them. As always, both the [[United States Congress]] and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time.\n\nIn 2018, a [[fiduciary]] standard rule on retirement products by the [[United States Department of Labor]] posed a possible risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-industry-outlook.html|title=2018 Insurance Industry Outlook {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nPremiums are not usually deductible against income tax or [[corporation tax]], however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR ([[Life Assurance Premium Relief]]) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).\n\nNon-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or [[capital gains tax]] on a claim. If the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.\n\nQualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10+ years) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher-rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called [[top-slicing]] based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes ([[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s and [[Open-ended investment company|OEICs]]). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the \u201c5% cumulative allowance\u201d\u2014the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the [[HMRC]] (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful [[tax planning]] tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.\n\nThe proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for [[death duty]] (in the UK, [[inheritance tax]]) purposes. Policies written in [[Trust law|trust]] may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an [[independent financial adviser]] and/or a [[solicitor]].\n\n====Pension term assurance====\nAlthough available before April 2006, from this date [[pension term assurance]] became widely available in the UK. Most UK insurers adopted the name \"life insurance with tax relief\" for the product. Pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid at a net of basic rate tax at 22%, and higher-rate tax payers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006.\n\n==Stranger originated==\n''Stranger-originated life insurance'' or [[Stranger-originated life insurance|STOLI]] is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person. Generally, the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured person's death. STOLI has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone (usually an elderly person) to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy. This undermines the primary purpose of life insurance, as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die. In some jurisdictions, there are laws to discourage or prevent STOLI.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nAlthough some aspects of the application process (such as [[underwriting]] and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and [[ fraud]]. In the case of life insurance, there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then [[murder]] the insured. Usually, the larger the claim and/or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation by police and insurer investigators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|title=Fraud: why should you worry?|first=dennis jay, jim quiggle, howard goldblatt, kendra smith, jennifer|last=tchinnosian|website=www.insurancefraud.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113034803/http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|archivedate=13 November 2012}}</ref> The [[television series]] ''[[Forensic Files]]'' has included episodes that feature this scenario.

After the contestability period ended on the policies, the women are alleged to have had the men killed via [[hit-and-run]] vehicular homicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two Elderly Women Indicted on Fraud Charges in Deaths of LA Hit-Run |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=June 1, 2006 |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104095818/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRecently, [[viatical settlement]]s have created problems for life insurance providers. A viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder. The policy holder sells the policy (including the right to name the beneficiary) to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value. The seller has cash in hand, and the purchaser will realize a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser. In the meantime, the purchaser continues to pay the premiums. Although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement, insurers are troubled by this trend. Insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death. They also expect that a certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies. However, viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out. Some purchasers, in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits, have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients, and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased. These policies are guaranteed losses from the insurers' perspective.\n\nOn April 17, 2016, a report by [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' claimed that life insurance companies do not pay significant numbers of beneficiaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|title=Life insurance industry under investigation|website=cbsnews.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208180314/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|archivedate=8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Corporate-owned life insurance]]\n* [[Critical illness insurance]]\n* [[Economic capital]]\n* [[Estate planning]]\n* [[False insurance claims]]\n* [[General insurance]]\n* [[Internal Revenue Code section 79]]\n* [[Life expectancy]]\n* [[Pet insurance]]\n* [[Retirement plan]]ning\n* [[Return of premium life insurance]]\n* [[Segregated fund]]s\n* [[Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance]]\n* [[Term life insurance]]\n* [[Tontine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Specific references===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n* {{cite book|author=Kutty, Shashidharan|title=Managing Life Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU58gTDHwoMC&pg=PT545 |date=12 August 2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Depending on the contract, other events such as [[terminal illness]] or [[critical illness]] can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses, such as funeral expenses, can also be included in the benefits. \n\nLife policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events.

The [[Presbyterianism in the United States|Presbyterian]] Synods in [[Synod of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and [[Synod of New York|New York City]] created the Corporation for Relief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in 1759; [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] priests organized a similar fund in 1769. Between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started, but fewer than half a dozen survived. In the 1870s, military officers banded together to found both the Army ([[AAFMAA]]) and the [[Navy Mutual Aid Association]] (Navy Mutual), inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the West after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Little Big Horn]], and of the families of U.S. sailors who died at sea.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Parties to contract===\nThe person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner, while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit. The owner and insured may or may not be the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and they will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.\n\n[[File:Chart of a life insurance.jpg|thumb|Chart of a life insurance]]\n\nThe beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured person's death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiary.\n\nIn cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the ''celui qui vit'' or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an [[insurable interest]] in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the [[wrongful death]] of the victim (''Liberty National Life v. Weldon'', 267 Ala.171 (1957)).\n\n===Contract terms===\nSpecial exclusions may apply, such as suicide clauses, whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured dies by [[suicide]] within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification. Most US states specify a maximum contestability period, often no more than two years. Only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claim.\n\nThe face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy [[Maturity (finance)|matures]], although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).\n\n===Costs, insurability, and underwriting===\nThe insurance company calculates the policy prices (premiums) at a level sufficient to fund claims, cover administrative costs, and provide a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by [[actuary|actuaries]]. Mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages. Put simply, people are more likely to die as they get older and the mortality tables enable the insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|title=IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Revenue Ruling 2002-62|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808064248/http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|archivedate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|title=IRS Bulletin No. 2002\u201342|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502202442/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select & Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently.

At the end of 10 years, the mortality of that 25-year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25-year-old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year \u00d7 $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy.) Other costs, such as administrative and sales expenses, also need to be considered when setting the premiums. A 10-year policy for a 25-year-old non-smoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.\n\nMost of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums, but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies. [[Group Insurance]] policies are an exception to this.\n\nIn the United States, life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, with the exception of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine insurability, and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.\n\nMany companies separate applicants into four general categories. These categories are ''preferred best'', ''preferred'', ''standard'', and ''tobacco''. Preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population. This may mean, that the proposed insured has no adverse medical history, is not under medication, and has no family history of early-onset [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], or other conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=How do Insurance Rating Classifications Work?|url=http://seniorlifepolicies.com/how-do-insurance-rating-classifications-work/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Preferred means that the proposed insured is currently under medication and has a family history of particular illnesses. Most people are in the standard category.\n\nPeople in the tobacco category typically have to pay higher premiums due to the higher mortality.

In general, in jurisdictions where both terms are used, \u201cinsurance\u201d refers to providing coverage for an event that ''might'' happen (fire, theft, flood, etc.), while \u201cassurance\u201d is the provision of coverage for an event that is ''certain'' to happen. In the United States, both forms of coverage are called \u201cinsurance\u201d for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} By some definitions, \u201cinsurance\u201d is any coverage that determines benefits based on actual losses whereas \u201cassurance\u201d is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurred.\n\nLife insurance may be divided into two basic classes: temporary and permanent; or the following subclasses: term, universal, [[Whole life insurance|whole life]], and endowment life insurance.\n\n===Term insurance===\n{{Main|Term life insurance}}\n\n[[Term assurance]] provides life insurance coverage for a specified term. The policy does not accumulate cash value. Term insurance is significantly less expensive than an equivalent permanent policy but will become higher with age. Policy holders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs (by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needs).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Black |first1=Kenneth, Jr. |last2=Skipper |first2=Harold D., Jr. |title=Life Insurance |edition=4th |year=1994 |page=94 |isbn=0135329957}}</ref>\n\n''[[Mortgage life insurance]]'' insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments. The face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid.\n\n==== Group life insurance ====\n''Group life insurance'' (also known as ''wholesale life insurance'' or ''institutional life insurance'') is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or [[superannuation]] fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of [[adverse selection]]. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage. The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.\n\n===Permanent life insurance===\n''Permanent life insurance'' is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a [[cash value]] up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.\n\nThe three basic types of permanent insurance are ''whole life'', ''universal life'', and ''endowment''.\n\n====Whole life====\n{{Main|Whole life insurance}}\nWhole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount (see main article for a full explanation of the many variations and options).\n\n====Universal life coverage====\n[[Universal life insurance]] (ULl) is a relatively new insurance product, intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments, along with the potential for greater growth of cash values. There are several types of universal life insurance policies, including ''interest-sensitive'' (also known as \u201ctraditional fixed universal life insurance\u201d), ''variable universal life (VUL)'', ''guaranteed death benefit'', and has ''equity-indexed universal life insurance''.\n\nUniversal life insurance policies have cash values. Paid-in premiums increase their cash values; administrative and other costs reduce their cash values.\n\nUniversal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life\u2014namely that premiums and death benefits are fixed. With universal life, both the premiums and death benefit are flexible. With the exception of guaranteed-death-benefit universal life policies, universal life policies trade their greater flexibility off for fewer guarantees.\n\n\u201cFlexible death benefit\u201d means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit. The death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a \"level death benefit\"; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy's cash value\u2014i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.\n\n====Endowments====\n{{main|Endowment policy}}\nThe endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness.\n\nPolicies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds).\n\nEndowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.\n\n====Accidental death====\nAccidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as the result of an accident. \u201cAccidents\u201d run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from non-accident-related health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policies.\n\nSuch insurance can also be ''[[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]]'' or ''AD&D''. In an AD&D policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearing.\n\nAccidental death and AD&D policies ''very rarely pay'' a benefit, either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident, by which time the premiums have gone unpaid. To know what coverage they have, insureds should always review their policies. Risky activities such as parachuting, flying, professional sports, or military service are often omitted from coverage.\n\nAccidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a [[rider (contract)|rider]]. If a rider is purchased, the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident. This was once called ''[[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] insurance''. In some cases, triple indemnity coverage may be available.\n\n==== Senior and pre-need products ====\nInsurance companies have in recent years developed products for niche markets, most notably targeting seniors in an ageing population. These are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies, allowing senior citizens to purchase affordable insurance later in life. This may also be marketed as ''final expense insurance'' and usually have death benefits between $2,000 and $40,000. One reason for their popularity is that they only require answers to simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, while most policies require a medical exam to qualify. As with other policy types, the range of premiums can vary widely and should be scrutinized prior to purchase, as should the reliability of the companies.\n\nHealth questions can vary substantially between exam and no-exam policies. It may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Because seniors sometimes are not fully aware of the policy provisions it is important to make sure that policies last for a lifetime and that premiums do not increase every 5 years as is common in some circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''Pre-need life insurance policies'' are limited premium payment, whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants, though they are available to everyone. This type of insurance is designed to cover specific [[funeral]] expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a [[funeral home]]. The policy's death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the time of prearrangement, and it then typically grows as interest is credited. In exchange for the policy owner's designation, the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral, no matter when death occurs. Excess proceeds may go either to the insured's estate, a designated beneficiary, or the funeral home as set forth in the contract. Purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement, but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years.\n\n==Related products==\n''Riders'' are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner. A common rider is ''accidental death'' (see above). Another common rider is a ''premium waiver'', which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.\n\n''Joint life insurance'' is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons, with proceeds payable on the death of ''either''.\n\n===Unit Linked Insurance Plans===\n{{Main|Unit-linked insurance plan}}\nThese are unique insurance plans which are basically a mutual fund and term insurance plan rolled into one. The investor doesn't participate in the profits of the plan per se, but gets returns based on the returns on the funds he or she had chosen.\n\nSee the main article for a full explanation of the various features and variations.\n\n===With-profits policies===\n{{Main|With-profits policy}}\nSome policies afford the policyholder a share of the profits of the insurance company\u2014these are termed [[with-profits policy|with-profits policies]]. Other policies provide no rights to a share of the profits of the company\u2014these are ''non-profit'' policies.\n\nWith-profits policies are used as a form of [[collective investment scheme]] to achieve capital growth. Other policies offer a guaranteed return not dependent on the company's underlying investment performance; these are often referred to as ''without-profit'' policies, which may be construed as a misnomer.\n\n==Taxation==\n\n=== India ===\nAccording to the section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (of Indian penal code) premiums paid towards a valid life insurance policy can be exempted from the taxable income. Along with life insurance premium, section 80C allows exemption for other financial instruments such as Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), health insurance premium are some of them. The total amount that can be exempted from the taxable income for section 80C is capped at a maximum of INR 150,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section - 80C, Income-tax Act, 1961-2018:B.\u2014Deductions in respect of certain payments |url=https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/acts/income-tax-act.aspx |website=Income Tax India |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> The exemptions are eligible for individuals (Indian citizens) or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).\n\n===Australia===\nWhere the life insurance is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held outside of the superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see \u201cunder what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the definition of substantially self-employed?\u201d. The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |title=ITAA 1936, Section 279 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093936/http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |archivedate=2011-08-28 }}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nPremiums paid by a [[policyholder]] are not deductible from taxable income, although premiums paid via an approved [[pension fund]] registered in terms of the Income Tax Act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax (whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee). The benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries (again in the case of approved benefits, these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]]). Investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of the policyholder (whether natural person, company-owned, untaxed or a retirement fund).\n\n===United States===\nPremiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state [[income tax]] purposes, and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes.<ref>Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 101(a)(1)</ref> However, if the proceeds are included in the \"estate\" of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state [[Estate tax (United States)|estate and inheritance tax]].\n\nCash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate [[tax shelter]] wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. In flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a ''modified endowment contract'' by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premium.\n\nThe tax ramifications of life insurance are complex. The policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them. As always, both the [[United States Congress]] and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time.\n\nIn 2018, a [[fiduciary]] standard rule on retirement products by the [[United States Department of Labor]] posed a possible risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-industry-outlook.html|title=2018 Insurance Industry Outlook {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nPremiums are not usually deductible against income tax or [[corporation tax]], however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR ([[Life Assurance Premium Relief]]) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).\n\nNon-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or [[capital gains tax]] on a claim. If the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.\n\nQualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10+ years) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher-rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called [[top-slicing]] based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes ([[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s and [[Open-ended investment company|OEICs]]). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the \u201c5% cumulative allowance\u201d\u2014the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the [[HMRC]] (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful [[tax planning]] tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.\n\nThe proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for [[death duty]] (in the UK, [[inheritance tax]]) purposes. Policies written in [[Trust law|trust]] may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an [[independent financial adviser]] and/or a [[solicitor]].\n\n====Pension term assurance====\nAlthough available before April 2006, from this date [[pension term assurance]] became widely available in the UK. Most UK insurers adopted the name \"life insurance with tax relief\" for the product. Pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid at a net of basic rate tax at 22%, and higher-rate tax payers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006.\n\n==Stranger originated==\n''Stranger-originated life insurance'' or [[Stranger-originated life insurance|STOLI]] is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person. Generally, the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured person's death. STOLI has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone (usually an elderly person) to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy. This undermines the primary purpose of life insurance, as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die. In some jurisdictions, there are laws to discourage or prevent STOLI.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nAlthough some aspects of the application process (such as [[underwriting]] and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and [[ fraud]]. In the case of life insurance, there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then [[murder]] the insured. Usually, the larger the claim and/or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation by police and insurer investigators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|title=Fraud: why should you worry?|first=dennis jay, jim quiggle, howard goldblatt, kendra smith, jennifer|last=tchinnosian|website=www.insurancefraud.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113034803/http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|archivedate=13 November 2012}}</ref> The [[television series]] ''[[Forensic Files]]'' has included episodes that feature this scenario. There was also a documented case in Los Angeles in 2006 where two elderly women were accused of taking in homeless men and assisting them. As part of their assistance, they took out life insurance for the men. After the contestability period ended on the policies, the women are alleged to have had the men killed via [[hit-and-run]] vehicular homicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two Elderly Women Indicted on Fraud Charges in Deaths of LA Hit-Run |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=June 1, 2006 |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104095818/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRecently, [[viatical settlement]]s have created problems for life insurance providers. A viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder. The policy holder sells the policy (including the right to name the beneficiary) to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value. The seller has cash in hand, and the purchaser will realize a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser. In the meantime, the purchaser continues to pay the premiums. Although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement, insurers are troubled by this trend. Insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death. They also expect that a certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies. However, viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out. Some purchasers, in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits, have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients, and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased. These policies are guaranteed losses from the insurers' perspective.\n\nOn April 17, 2016, a report by [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' claimed that life insurance companies do not pay significant numbers of beneficiaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|title=Life insurance industry under investigation|website=cbsnews.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208180314/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|archivedate=8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Corporate-owned life insurance]]\n* [[Critical illness insurance]]\n* [[Economic capital]]\n* [[Estate planning]]\n* [[False insurance claims]]\n* [[General insurance]]\n* [[Internal Revenue Code section 79]]\n* [[Life expectancy]]\n* [[Pet insurance]]\n* [[Retirement plan]]ning\n* [[Return of premium life insurance]]\n* [[Segregated fund]]s\n* [[Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance]]\n* [[Term life insurance]]\n* [[Tontine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Specific references===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n* {{cite book|author=Kutty, Shashidharan|title=Managing Life Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU58gTDHwoMC&pg=PT545 |date=12 August 2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

The film stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Virginie Ledoyen]], [[Guillaume Canet]], and [[Robert Carlyle]]. It was filmed on the [[Thailand|Thai]] island of [[Ko Phi Phi Le]].\n\nThe film was a moderate box office success but received mostly negative reviews. DiCaprio was nominated for the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor]] (lost to [[John Travolta]] as Terl from the [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] film ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]'' and as Russ Richards in the [[Paramount Pictures]] film ''[[Lucky Numbers]]''). In spite of that, [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]]'s song \"[[Pure Shores]]\" topped the UK charts.\n\n==Plot==\nRichard, a young American seeking adventure in [[Bangkok]], stays in a drab travelers' hotel in [[Khao San Road]] where he meets a young French couple, Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne, and he immediately becomes attracted to Fran\u00e7oise. He also meets the Daffy, who tells him of a pristine, uninhabited and restricted island in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] with a beautiful hidden beach and lagoon. Daffy explains that he and other travelers settled there in secret several years earlier, but difficulties arose and he chose to leave. Daffy commits suicide, leaving Richard a map to the island. Richard convinces Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne to accompany him to the island, and the three travel to [[Ko Samui]]. After getting locked out of his bungalow during a thunderstorm, Richard meets two American surfers who have heard rumors of the island, including huge amounts of [[cannabis]] supposedly growing there. Before departing, Richard leaves them a copy of the map.\n\nEn route to the island, Richard becomes infatuated with Fran\u00e7oise. After swimming to the island from a neighboring one, they find a large cannabis plantation guarded by armed Thai farmers. Avoiding detection, they make their way across the island and meet English cricket fan Keatey, who brings them to a fully functioning community of travelers living on the island, totally in secret. Sal, the community's English leader, explains that the farmers allow them to stay so long as they keep to themselves and do not allow any more travelers to come to the island. Richard lies that they have not shown the map to anyone else, which satisfies Sal. The trio become integrated into the largely self-sufficient and leisurely community. \n\nOne night, Fran\u00e7oise privately invites Richard to the beach where she tells him that she is falling in love with him and they make love. Despite hoping to keep it secret, the community finds out. While angry, \u00c9tienne says he will not stand in their way if Fran\u00e7oise is happier with Richard. Tensions rise between Richard and Sal's South African boyfriend Bugs; when Richard gains popularity by killing a shark, Bugs mocks him over the shark's small size but Richard mocks him back for his jealousy.\n\nWhen Sal selects Richard to accompany her on a supply run to [[Ko Pha Ngan]], Bugs warns him to keep his hands off her. While there they encounter the American surfers Richard met in Ko Samui, who are preparing to search for the island and mention Richard's map. Richard lies to Sal that he did not give them a copy, and she coaxes him into having sex with her in exchange for her secrecy despite the two having their respective partners. On their return to the island, Richard lies to Fran\u00e7oise about having sex with Sal and continues his relationship with her. Things return to normal until a shark attack kills one of the community's fishermen, Sten, and leaves another, Christo, severely injured. Sal refuses to compromise the community by bringing medical help, and Christo is too traumatized to travel to the mainland by sea. His worsening condition affects the group's morale, so they isolate him in a tent despite \u00c9tienne's objections.\n\nWhen the surfers from Ko Pha Ngan turn up on the neighboring island, Sal furiously orders Richard to observe them until they cross over, then send them away and destroy their map. She also tells everyone that she and Richard had sex, which leaves Fran\u00e7oise angry and heartbroken causing her to return to \u00c9tienne. Isolated from the group, Richard begins to lose his sanity, stalking the [[cannabis]] [[farmers]], stealing some of their personal items while they sleep, and imagining that he is conversing with the deceased Daffy. The surfers reach the island but are discovered and killed by the farmers. Shocked at witnessing their deaths, Richard tries to gather Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne to leave the island. \u00c9tienne refuses to leave Christo, whose leg has become [[gangrene|gangrenous]], so Richard euthanizes Christo by suffocation.\n\nRichard is captured by the farmers and brought before the community, along with Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne. The farmers are furious with the community for breaking their deal to not allow any more newcomers. The lead farmer gives Sal a gun loaded with a single bullet and orders her to make a choice: kill Richard and the group will be allowed to stay, or else they must all leave immediately.

The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed.<ref>Vidal, John.

In 2006, Thailand's Supreme Court upheld an appellate court ruling that the filming had harmed the environment and ordered that damage assessments be made.

[[CNN]]'s [[Paul Clinton]] said \"Leonardo DiCaprio's main fan base of screaming adolescent girls won't be disappointed with ''The Beach''.

The film stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Virginie Ledoyen]], [[Guillaume Canet]], and [[Robert Carlyle]]. It was filmed on the [[Thailand|Thai]] island of [[Ko Phi Phi Le]].\n\nThe film was a moderate box office success but received mostly negative reviews. DiCaprio was nominated for the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor]] (lost to [[John Travolta]] as Terl from the [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] film ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]'' and as Russ Richards in the [[Paramount Pictures]] film ''[[Lucky Numbers]]''). In spite of that, [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]]'s song \"[[Pure Shores]]\" topped the UK charts.\n\n==Plot==\nRichard, a young American seeking adventure in [[Bangkok]], stays in a drab travelers' hotel in [[Khao San Road]] where he meets a young French couple, Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne, and he immediately becomes attracted to Fran\u00e7oise. He also meets the Daffy, who tells him of a pristine, uninhabited and restricted island in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] with a beautiful hidden beach and lagoon. Daffy explains that he and other travelers settled there in secret several years earlier, but difficulties arose and he chose to leave. Daffy commits suicide, leaving Richard a map to the island. Richard convinces Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne to accompany him to the island, and the three travel to [[Ko Samui]]. After getting locked out of his bungalow during a thunderstorm, Richard meets two American surfers who have heard rumors of the island, including huge amounts of [[cannabis]] supposedly growing there. Before departing, Richard leaves them a copy of the map.\n\nEn route to the island, Richard becomes infatuated with Fran\u00e7oise. After swimming to the island from a neighboring one, they find a large cannabis plantation guarded by armed Thai farmers. Avoiding detection, they make their way across the island and meet English cricket fan Keatey, who brings them to a fully functioning community of travelers living on the island, totally in secret. Sal, the community's English leader, explains that the farmers allow them to stay so long as they keep to themselves and do not allow any more travelers to come to the island. Richard lies that they have not shown the map to anyone else, which satisfies Sal. The trio become integrated into the largely self-sufficient and leisurely community. \n\nOne night, Fran\u00e7oise privately invites Richard to the beach where she tells him that she is falling in love with him and they make love. Despite hoping to keep it secret, the community finds out. While angry, \u00c9tienne says he will not stand in their way if Fran\u00e7oise is happier with Richard. Tensions rise between Richard and Sal's South African boyfriend Bugs; when Richard gains popularity by killing a shark, Bugs mocks him over the shark's small size but Richard mocks him back for his jealousy.\n\nWhen Sal selects Richard to accompany her on a supply run to [[Ko Pha Ngan]], Bugs warns him to keep his hands off her. While there they encounter the American surfers Richard met in Ko Samui, who are preparing to search for the island and mention Richard's map. Richard lies to Sal that he did not give them a copy, and she coaxes him into having sex with her in exchange for her secrecy despite the two having their respective partners. On their return to the island, Richard lies to Fran\u00e7oise about having sex with Sal and continues his relationship with her. Things return to normal until a shark attack kills one of the community's fishermen, Sten, and leaves another, Christo, severely injured. Sal refuses to compromise the community by bringing medical help, and Christo is too traumatized to travel to the mainland by sea. His worsening condition affects the group's morale, so they isolate him in a tent despite \u00c9tienne's objections.\n\nWhen the surfers from Ko Pha Ngan turn up on the neighboring island, Sal furiously orders Richard to observe them until they cross over, then send them away and destroy their map. She also tells everyone that she and Richard had sex, which leaves Fran\u00e7oise angry and heartbroken causing her to return to \u00c9tienne. Isolated from the group, Richard begins to lose his sanity, stalking the [[cannabis]] [[farmers]], stealing some of their personal items while they sleep, and imagining that he is conversing with the deceased Daffy. The surfers reach the island but are discovered and killed by the farmers. Shocked at witnessing their deaths, Richard tries to gather Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne to leave the island. \u00c9tienne refuses to leave Christo, whose leg has become [[gangrene|gangrenous]], so Richard euthanizes Christo by suffocation.\n\nRichard is captured by the farmers and brought before the community, along with Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne. The farmers are furious with the community for breaking their deal to not allow any more newcomers. The lead farmer gives Sal a gun loaded with a single bullet and orders her to make a choice: kill Richard and the group will be allowed to stay, or else they must all leave immediately. Sal pulls the trigger, but the chamber is empty. Shocked by her willingness to commit murder, the community abandons Sal, leave the island, and go their separate ways.\n\nLater, back in the United States, Richard receives an email at an Internet cafe from Fran\u00e7oise with a group photograph of the beach community in happier times. The purpose of the email does not suggest Fran\u00e7oise is trying to resurrect her relationship with Richard but rather to suggest nostalgia.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Virginie Ledoyen Cannes 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Virginie Ledoyen]]]]\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Richard, a freelance traveler who is the film's main character\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Sal, the leader of the beach community\n* [[Virginie Ledoyen]] as Fran\u00e7oise, the girlfriend of \u00c9tienne, and Richard's love interest\n* [[Guillaume Canet]] as \u00c9tienne, the boyfriend of Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as Daffy, the eccentric former member of the beach community\n* [[Paterson Joseph]] as Keaty, a member of the beach community who loves [[cricket]]\n* [[Lars Arentz-Hansen (actor)|Lars Arentz-Hansen]] as Bugs, Sal's boyfriend and the beach community's carpenter\n* [[Daniel Caltagirone]] as Unhygienix, the beach community's chef \n* [[Staffan Kihlbom]], [[Jukka Hiltunen]], and Magnus Lindgren as Christo, Karl, and Sten, the beach community's Swedish fishermen\n* [[Victoria Smurfit]] as Weathergirl, a member of the beach community\n* Zelda Tinska and Lidija Zovkic as Sonja and Mirjana, two beach community members who come from Sarajevo\n* Samuel Gough as Guitarman, the beach community's residential guitarist\n* [[Peter Youngblood Hills]] and Jerry Swindall as Zeph and Sammy, two Americans whom Richard meets in Ko Samui\n* Saskia Mulder and Simone Huber as Hilda and Eva, two women who accompany Zeph and Sammy to the island and are killed by the farmers\n* Peter Gevisser as Gregorio, an Italian member of the beach community\n* Abhijati 'Meuk' Jusakul as the leader of the cannabis farmers\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Maya Bay Thailand.jpg|thumb|right|The paradise location, Maya bay in [[Ko Phi Phi Lee]].]]\n[[Image:Ko Phi Phi Lee.jpg|thumb|right|Ko Phi Phi Leh]]\n\n[[Ewan McGregor]] was cast as the main character before leaving due to disputes with the director.

There is a gap between mountains on the actual beach in Thailand. The special effects crew digitally added some of the surrounding mountains during the post-production phase. The actual beach was also transformed from its natural look. It is reported that crew members flattened the beach with a tractor, much to the locals' dismay. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami of 2004]], however, has reshaped the beach to its natural look.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nBoyle has been cited saying that the look of the jungle scenes in the film was inspired by the [[Nintendo]] game ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe waterfall scene, where DiCaprio and others jump from a high cliff to the water below, was filmed in [[Khao Yai National Park]] in central [[Thailand]], at the Haew Suwat Waterfall.\n\nThe map in the film was illustrated by the author of the book that ''The Beach'' was based upon, [[Alex Garland]]. He received credit for this as the cartographer.\n\n===Controversies===\n\n====Damage to filming location====\nControversy arose during the making of the film due to 20th Century Fox's bulldozing and landscaping of the natural beach setting of [[Ko Phi Phi Leh]] to make it more \"paradise-like\". The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed.<ref>Vidal, John.

[https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/oct/29/news.johnvidal DiCaprio film-makers face storm over paradise lost], ''The Guardian'', retrieved on November 03, 2017</ref>  Following shooting of the film, there was a clear flat area at one end of the beach that was created artificially with an odd layout of trees which was never rectified, and the entire area remained damaged from the original state until the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami of 2004]].\n\nThe lawsuits dragged on for years. In 2006, Thailand's Supreme Court upheld an appellate court ruling that the filming had harmed the environment and ordered that damage assessments be made. Defendants in the case included [[20th Century Fox]] and some Thai government officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/12/01/national/national_30020443.php |title=Filming 'damaged beach' |accessdate=2015-06-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016192325/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/12/01/national/national_30020443.php |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe large increase in tourist traffic to the beach as a result of the film resulted in environmental damage to the bay and the nearby coral reefs, prompting the Thai authorities to close the beach until 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/thailand-maya-bay-reopening-date/index.html|title=Thailand bay made popular by 'The Beach' to remain closed for two more years|author1=Karla Cripps |author2=Kocha Olarn|website=CNN|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\n====Portrayal of Thailand====\nAfter the film premiered in Thailand in 2000, some Thai politicians were upset at the way Thailand was depicted in the film and called for it to be banned.

[[CNN]]'s [[Paul Clinton]] said \"Leonardo DiCaprio's main fan base of screaming adolescent girls won't be disappointed with ''The Beach''. The majority of the film displays the titanic-sized young heartthrob sans his shirt in this story about the pseudo-angst and alienation of a young man from the United States escaping civilization and his computer-obsessed generation.\" He agreed with most others that ''The Beach'' was \"nothing to write home about\". DiCaprio was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Razzie Award for Worst Actor]] for his work on the film.\n\nThe budget of the film was US$50 million.

The race was the nineteenth and penultimate round of the [[2017 FIA Formula One World Championship]] and marked the forty-sixth running of the [[Brazilian Grand Prix]], the forty-fifth time that the race had been run as a World Championship event since the inaugural season in {{F1|1950}}, and the thirty-fourth World Championship event to be held at Interlagos.\n\nMercedes driver [[Valtteri Bottas]] started from pole position with Ferrari's [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] behind, after World Champion [[Lewis Hamilton]] crashed out of qualifying early and started from the pit lane. Vettel overtook Bottas on the first corner, after which he set the pace through most of the race. Vettel won the Grand Prix, followed by Bottas and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen.

[[Felipe Massa]] and [[Fernando Alonso]] were notably strong in these sessions. In the third session, the order was similar. However, [[Valtteri Bottas]] pipped Hamilton's best time by three thousands of a second; and neither [[Max Verstappen]] nor Massa put in a strong lap. In the final practice round, less than a tenth of a second separated the two Mercedes and two Ferraris.\n\nThe first practice session saw [[George Russell (racing driver)|George Russell]]'s Formula One debut appearance. There was also an unusual appearance of a test driver ([[Antonio Giovinazzi]]) in the second practice session (usually, any test drivers that participate in a racing weekend, do so in the first practice session).\n\n===Qualifying===\nQualifying began in a dramatic fashion as World Champion Hamilton lost the back end of the car with over-steer, seemingly due to a driver error, crashing to retire from Q1 without setting a lap time. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was fastest in Q1 and Vettel in Q2. In the final qualifying session, however, Bottas took pole position. Vettel qualified a close second, followed by R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Verstappen and [[Daniel Ricciardo]]. Ricciardo took a 10-place grid penalty for exceeding his quota of power unit components and started 14th on the grid. Hamilton elected to change his gearbox and power unit, so started the race from the pit lane.\n\n===Race===\nVettel achieved a good start during the second phase of clutch control to overtake Bottas on the first corner. There were numerous retirements due to collisions on the first lap. [[Romain Grosjean]] lost the back end, clipping [[Esteban Ocon]] off the track. Ocon's resultant retirement ended his record streak of [[List of Formula One driver records#Other driver records|27 races finished]] from his Formula One debut. [[Stoffel Vandoorne]] and [[Kevin Magnussen]] also retired due to a collision on the first lap.\n\nHamilton, starting from the pit lane, implemented an inverted tyre strategy running to lap 44 on one set of soft tyres. After overtaking the back-markers and mid-field, he fell into first place as the leading cars \u2013 predominantly on one-stop strategies \u2013 pitted. Hamilton's only pit-stop positioned him fifth, after which he overtook Verstappen and was briefly able to challenge R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen for the podium,<ref name=\"auto\"/> but unable to overtake Raikkonen in third. Ricciardo also battled up to sixth after starting fifteenth on the grid and dropping to seventeenth as collateral of the Vandoorne-Magnussen collision.\n\nSetting the pace through most of the race, Vettel won the Grand Prix, followed by Bottas and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Including Hamilton, the top four finished within the space of 5.5 seconds, with the two Red Bulls more than 30 seconds behind. The following three positions also carried a race-long battle to the finish line, finishing within 1 second of each other. Initially overtaking on lap 5 (as the safety car was pulling into pitlane), Massa held off Alonso who remained close throughout the race.<ref>{{cite web

'''2017 Brazilian Grand Prix''' (formally known as the '''Formula 1 Grande Pr\u00eamio Heineken do Brasil 2017''') was a [[Formula One]] motor race held on 12 November 2017 at the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace]] in the [[Interlagos]] neighborhood of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The race was the nineteenth and penultimate round of the [[2017 FIA Formula One World Championship]] and marked the forty-sixth running of the [[Brazilian Grand Prix]], the forty-fifth time that the race had been run as a World Championship event since the inaugural season in {{F1|1950}}, and the thirty-fourth World Championship event to be held at Interlagos.\n\nMercedes driver [[Valtteri Bottas]] started from pole position with Ferrari's [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] behind, after World Champion [[Lewis Hamilton]] crashed out of qualifying early and started from the pit lane. Vettel overtook Bottas on the first corner, after which he set the pace through most of the race. Vettel won the Grand Prix, followed by Bottas and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Hamilton eventually climbed to fourth, closing to less than one second of a podium finish.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/12/sebastian-vettel-f1-brazilian-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton-race-report|title=Sebastian Vettel wins Brazilian Grand Prix after Lewis Hamilton fightback|date=13 November 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Report==\n\n===Free practice===\nThe three free practice session demonstrated very tight competition between [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2017/11/fp3---mercedes-and-ferrari-all-but-inseparable-at-interlagos.html|work=formula1.com|title=FP3 \u2013 Mercedes and Ferrari all but inseparable at Interlagos|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> In first and second free practice, [[Lewis Hamilton]] was quickest, with both Ferraris and both [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bulls]] within one second. [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Fernando Alonso]] were notably strong in these sessions. In the third session, the order was similar. However, [[Valtteri Bottas]] pipped Hamilton's best time by three thousands of a second; and neither [[Max Verstappen]] nor Massa put in a strong lap. In the final practice round, less than a tenth of a second separated the two Mercedes and two Ferraris.\n\nThe first practice session saw [[George Russell (racing driver)|George Russell]]'s Formula One debut appearance. There was also an unusual appearance of a test driver ([[Antonio Giovinazzi]]) in the second practice session (usually, any test drivers that participate in a racing weekend, do so in the first practice session).\n\n===Qualifying===\nQualifying began in a dramatic fashion as World Champion Hamilton lost the back end of the car with over-steer, seemingly due to a driver error, crashing to retire from Q1 without setting a lap time. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was fastest in Q1 and Vettel in Q2. In the final qualifying session, however, Bottas took pole position. Vettel qualified a close second, followed by R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Verstappen and [[Daniel Ricciardo]]. Ricciardo took a 10-place grid penalty for exceeding his quota of power unit components and started 14th on the grid. Hamilton elected to change his gearbox and power unit, so started the race from the pit lane.\n\n===Race===\nVettel achieved a good start during the second phase of clutch control to overtake Bottas on the first corner. There were numerous retirements due to collisions on the first lap. [[Romain Grosjean]] lost the back end, clipping [[Esteban Ocon]] off the track. Ocon's resultant retirement ended his record streak of [[List of Formula One driver records#Other driver records|27 races finished]] from his Formula One debut. [[Stoffel Vandoorne]] and [[Kevin Magnussen]] also retired due to a collision on the first lap.\n\nHamilton, starting from the pit lane, implemented an inverted tyre strategy running to lap 44 on one set of soft tyres. After overtaking the back-markers and mid-field, he fell into first place as the leading cars \u2013 predominantly on one-stop strategies \u2013 pitted. Hamilton's only pit-stop positioned him fifth, after which he overtook Verstappen and was briefly able to challenge R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen for the podium,<ref name=\"auto\"/> but unable to overtake Raikkonen in third. Ricciardo also battled up to sixth after starting fifteenth on the grid and dropping to seventeenth as collateral of the Vandoorne-Magnussen collision.\n\nSetting the pace through most of the race, Vettel won the Grand Prix, followed by Bottas and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Including Hamilton, the top four finished within the space of 5.5 seconds, with the two Red Bulls more than 30 seconds behind. The following three positions also carried a race-long battle to the finish line, finishing within 1 second of each other. Initially overtaking on lap 5 (as the safety car was pulling into pitlane), Massa held off Alonso who remained close throughout the race.<ref>{{cite web
