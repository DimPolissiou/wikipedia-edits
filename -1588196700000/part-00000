It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. ''Save the World'' and ''Battle Royale'' were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles, while ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for all those platforms, and also for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the ''Save the World'' and ''Creative'' versions have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' in particular became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine; each has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is a player-versus-environment [[cooperative game]], with four players collaborating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[Skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a [[sandbox game]] mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, [[Platform game|platforming]] challenges, and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe. Players are encouraged to be very inventive in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although {{as of|lc=y|2019}}, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 |last1=Alwani |first1=Rishi |publisher=Gadgets360 |date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[Video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. ''Save the World'' and ''Battle Royale'' were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles, while ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for all those platforms, and also for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the ''Save the World'' and ''Creative'' versions have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' in particular became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine; each has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is a player-versus-environment [[cooperative game]], with four players collaborating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[Skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a [[sandbox game]] mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, [[Platform game|platforming]] challenges, and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe. Players are encouraged to be very inventive in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although {{as of|lc=y|2019}}, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 |last1=Alwani |first1=Rishi |publisher=Gadgets360 |date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[Video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

Further, Epic was looking to get into the [[games as a service]] model, and brought in Chinese publisher [[Tencent]] to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]], who had been a key part of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s development.

In the flower centre is a tight cluster of orange stamens, which are sensitive to the touch, and spread outwards to reveal the tall stigma in the middle. The plant is common on chalk downs, and occasional in other grasslands, always on dry, base-rich soil. The wild species has yellow flowers, but garden varieties range from white through yellow to deep red.\n\nThough the individual blooms are short-lived, the plant produces a mass of flowers through the summer. It needs a dry, sunny place, like a south-facing rockery or meadow. As the Latin name ''Helianthemum'' suggests, these are sun-flowers. This is a good nectar source for bees and there are several species of small beetle that feed on the foliage. Common rock-rose is also the food plant for the larvae of several species of moth and butterfly such as the [[Silver-studded blue|silver-studded blue (''Plebejus argus).'']]\n\nIt flowers from May until July.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Subspecies===\nThere are eight [[subspecies]]:\n*''Helianthemum nummularium'' subsp. ''nummularium''. Widespread.\n*''Helianthemum nummularium'' subsp. ''berterianum''. Italy, southeast France.\n*''Helianthemum nummularium'' subsp. ''glabrum''.

In the flower centre is a tight cluster of orange stamens, which are sensitive to the touch, and spread outwards to reveal the tall stigma in the middle. The plant is common on chalk downs, and occasional in other grasslands, always on dry, base-rich soil. The wild species has yellow flowers, but garden varieties range from white through yellow to deep red.\n\nThough the individual blooms are short-lived, the plant produces a mass of flowers through the summer. It needs a dry, sunny place, like a south-facing rockery or meadow. As the Latin name ''Helianthemum'' suggests, these are sun-flowers. This is a good nectar source for bees and there are several species of small beetle that feed on the foliage. Common rock-rose is also the food plant for the larvae of several species of moth and butterfly such as the [[Silver-studded blue|silver-studded blue (''Plebejus argus).'']]\n\nIt flowers from May until July.\n\n==Subspecies==\n\nThere are eight [[subspecies]]:\n*''Helianthemum nummularium'' subsp. ''nummularium''. Widespread.\n*''Helianthemum nummularium'' subsp. ''berterianum''. Italy, southeast France.\n*''Helianthemum nummularium'' subsp. ''glabrum''.
