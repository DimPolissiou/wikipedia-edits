It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]]. Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|former Series 4 winner]] and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which features professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]]. Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|former Series 4 winner]] and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which features professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

As the numbers in the school grew, larger premises were needed leading to the decision in October 1897 to build a new boarding school in Sevenoaks. Land was acquired from [[William Amherst, 3rd Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]]'s [[Montreal Park]] estate at Cross Keys, and construction of '''The New Beacon''' began in February 1899.

The exterior of the building changed little over the century, but the addition of a chapel in 1912 meant that the children no longer had to walk to [[Kippington]]. By 1913 the school had grown to 62 pupils and the fees were \u00a3120 per year for boarding and tuition, plus \u00a31 11s 6d for medical attendance. Other facilities included swimming baths, a miniature rifle range, a playground and two sports fields. During the First World War, staffing was depleted and the school's grounds and gardens had to be tended by staff and pupils. Thirty-seven former pupils were killed during the war, and another 75 Beaconians fell in the Second World War.

Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\".

In ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', [[Greg Tate]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a triumph of marketing and musicality, spectacle and song, vision and collaboration, [[Assimilation (Star Trek)|Borg-like assimilation]], and \u2014 as of 2013 \u2014 the element of surprise\". Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\". Sheffield writes \"''Lemonade'' is her most emotionally extreme music, but also her most sonically adventurous... Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey\u2019s voice\", which is described as \"her wildest, rawest vocals ever\". Sheffield also compares ''Lemonade'' to [[Aretha Franklin]]\u2019s ''[[Spirit in the Dark]]'' and [[Nina Simone]]\u2019s ''[[Silk & Soul|Silk and Soul]]'' in the way that the album \"reach[es] out historically, connecting her personal pain to the trauma of American blackness\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/beyonce-lemonade-20160425|title=Lemonade|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Rob|last=Sheffield|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|date=April 25, 2016|accessdate=April 26, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531061410/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/beyonce-lemonade-20160425|archivedate=May 31, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Ray Rahman for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' agrees, writing that ''Lemonade'' is \"a raw and intensely personal plunge into the heart of marital darkness\" as well as \"a feminist blueprint, a tribute to women, African-Americans, and, especially, African-American women\".

It is a [[bicameral]] body composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Alabama Senate|Senate]].  It is one of the few state legislatures in which members of both chambers serve four-year terms and in which all are elected in the same cycle.  The most recent election was on November 6, 2018.  The new legislature assumes office immediately following the certification of the election results by the Alabama Secretary of State which occurs within a few days following the election. \n\nThe Legislature meets in the [[Alabama State House]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The [[Alabama State Capitol|original capitol building]], located nearby, has not been used by the Legislature on a regular basis since 1985, when it closed for renovations. In the 21st century, it serves as the seat of the executive branch as well as a museum.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1861 Davis Inaugural.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jefferson Davis]] being sworn in as [[President of the Confederate States of America]] on February 18, 1861, on the steps of the [[Alabama State Capitol]].]]\n\n===Establishment===\nThe Alabama Legislature was founded in 1818 as a territorial legislature for the [[Alabama Territory]]. Following the federal [[Alabama Enabling Act of 1819]] and the successful passage of the first [[Alabama Constitution]] in the same year, the Alabama General Assembly became a fully fledged [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] upon the territory's admission as a state. The term of state representatives is two years and the term of state senators is four years.\n\nThe General Assembly was one of the 11 state legislatures of the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Following the state's secession from the Union in January 1861, delegates from across the [[Southern United States|South]] met at the state capital of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] to create the Confederate government. Between February and May 1861, Montgomery served as the Confederacy's capital, where Alabama state officials let members of the new Southern federal government make use of its offices. The [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] met for three months inside the General Assembly's chambers at the [[Alabama State Capitol]]. [[Jefferson Davis]] was inaugurated as the Confederacy's first and only [[President of the Confederate States of America|president]] on the steps of the capitol.\n\nHowever, following complaints from Southerners over Montgomery's uncomfortable conditions and, more importantly, following [[Virginia]]'s entry into the Confederacy, the Confederate government moved to [[Richmond, VA|Richmond]] in May 1861.\n\n===Reconstruction era===\nFollowing the Confederacy's defeat in 1865, the [[Government of Alabama|state government]] underwent a transformation following emancipation of enslaved African Americans, and constitutional amendments to grant them citizenship and voting rights. Congress dominated the next period of Reconstruction, which some historians attribute to [[Radical Republicans]]. For the first time, blacks could vote and were elected to the legislature. Republicans were elected to the state governorship and dominated the General Assembly; more than eighty percent of the members were white. \n\nIn 1867, a state constitutional convention was called, and a biracial group of delegates worked on a new constitution. The biracial legislature passed a new constitution in 1868, establishing public education for the first time, as well as institutions such as orphanages and hospitals to care for all the citizens of the state. This constitution, which affirmed the franchise for freedmen, enabled Alabama to be readmitted into the [[United States]] in 1868.  \n\nAs in other states during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], former Confederate and insurgent \"redeemer\" forces from the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] gradually overturned the Republicans by force and fraud. Elections were surrounded by violence as [[paramilitary]] groups aligned with the Democrats worked to suppress black Republican voting. By the 1874 state general elections, the General Assembly was dominated by white [[Bourbon Democrats]] from the elite planter class.\n\nBoth the resulting 1875 and [[Alabama Constitution|1901 constitutions]] [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised blacks]], and the 1901 also adversely affected thousands of poor whites, by erecting barriers to voter registration. Late in the 19th century, a Populist-Republican coalition had gained three congressional seats from Alabama and some influence in the state legislature. After suppressing this movement, Democrats returned to power, gathering support under slogans of white supremacy. They passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites, excluding them from the political system for decades into the late 20th century. The Democratic-dominated legislature passed [[Jim Crow laws]] creating legal segregation and second-class status for African Americans. The 1901 Constitution changed the name of the General Assembly to the Alabama Legislature. (Amendment 427 to the [[Alabama Constitution]] designated the State House as the official site of the legislature.) \n\n===Civil Rights era===\nFollowing World War II, the state capital was a site of important [[Civil Rights Movement]] activities. In December 1955 [[Rosa Parks]] refused to give up her seat for a white passenger on a segregated city bus. She and other African-American residents conducted the more than year-long [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] to end discriminatory practices on the buses, 80% of whose passengers were African Americans. Both Parks and Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], a new pastor in the city who led the movement, gained national and international prominence from these events.\n\nThroughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the Alabama Legislature and a series of succeeding segregationist governors [[Massive resistance|massively resisted]] school integration and demands of social justice by Civil Rights protesters. \n\nDuring this period, the Legislature passed a law authorizing the [[Alabama State Sovereignty Commission]]. Mirroring [[Mississippi]]'s [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission|similarly named authority]], the commission used taxpayer dollars to function as a state intelligence agency: it spied on Alabama residents suspected of sympathizing with the Civil Rights Movement (and classified large groups of people, such as teachers, as potential threats). It kept lists of suspected African-American activists and participated in economic boycotts against them, such as getting suspects fired from jobs and evicted from rentals, disrupting their lives and causing financial distress. It also passed on the names of suspected activists to local governments and citizens' groups such as the [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Council]], which also followed tactics to penalize activists and enforce segregation.\n\nFollowing a federal constitutional amendment banning use of poll taxes in federal elections, the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] authorizing federal oversight and enforcement of fair registration and elections, and the 1966 US Supreme Court ruling that poll taxes at any level were unconstitutional, African Americans began to register and vote again in numbers proportional to their population. They were elected again to the state legislature and county and city offices for the first time since the late 19th century.\n\nFederal court cases increased political representation for all residents of the state in a different way. Although required by its state constitution to redistrict after each decennial census, the Alabama legislature had not done so from the turn of the century to 1960. In addition, state senators were elected from geographic counties. As a result, representation in the legislature did not reflect the state's changes in population, and was biased toward rural interests. It had not kept up with the development of major urban, industrialized cities such as [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and Tuscaloosa. Their residents paid much more in taxes and revenues to the state government than they received in services. Services and investment to support major cities had lagged due to under-representation in the legislature.\n\nUnder the principle of [[one man, one vote]], the United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964) that both houses of any state legislature need to be based on population, with apportionment of seats redistricted as needed according to the decennial census.<ref name=\"reynolds\">[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=377&invol=533 ''REYNOLDS v. SIMS,'' 377 U.S. 533 (1964)], FindLaw, accessed 12 March 2015</ref> This was a challenge brought by citizens of Birmingham. When this ruling was finally implemented in Alabama by court order in 1972, it resulted in the districts including major industrial cities gaining more seats in the legislature.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn May 2007, the Alabama Legislature officially apologized for [[slavery]], making it the fourth [[Deep South]] state to do so.\n\n==Constitutions==\nAlabama has had a total of six different [[Constitution of Alabama|state constitutions]], passed in 1819, 1861, 1865, 1868, 1875, and 1901. The current constitution (1901) has had so many amendments, most related to decisions on county-level issues, that it is the longest written constitution in both the [[United States]] and the world. Because the Alabama legislature has kept control of most counties, authorizing home rule for only a few, it passes numerous laws and amendments that deal only with county-level issues.\n\nDue to the suppression of black voters after Reconstruction, and especially after passage of the 1901 [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising constitution]], most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites were excluded from voting for decades.<ref>J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974</ref><ref name=\"Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135\u2013136\">Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref>  After Reconstruction ended no blacks served in the Alabama Legislature until 1974 when two black majority districts in the House elected Thomas Reed and [[Fred Gray (attorney)|Fred Gray]].  As of the 2018 election, the Alabama House of Representatives has 27 African-American members and the Alabama State Senate has 7 African-American members.\n\nMost blacks did not regain the power to vote until after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Before that, many left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to northern and midwestern cities. Since the late 20th century, the white majority in the state has voted increasingly Republican. In the 2010 elections, for the first time in 136 years, both houses of the state legislature were dominated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s.   Republicans have maintained their majority status in the succeeding elections in 2014 and 2018.\n\n==Organization==\nThe Alabama Legislature convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except during the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March. In the last year of a four-year term, the legislative session begins on the second Tuesday in January. The length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Session weeks consist of meetings of the full chamber and committee meetings.\n\nThe [[Governor of Alabama]] can call, by proclamation, special sessions of the Alabama Legislature and must list the subjects to be considered. Special sessions are limited to 12 legislative days within a 30 calendar day span. In a regular session, bills may be enacted on any subject. In a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the governor announces on their proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\n==Legislative process==\n{{main|State legislature (United States)#Lawmaking process}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n===Notice and introduction of bills===\nPrior to the introduction of bills that apply to specific, named localities, the [[Alabama Constitution]] requires publication of the proposal in a newspaper in the counties to be affected. The proposal must be published for four consecutive weeks and documentation must be provided to show that the notice was posted. The process is known as \"notice and proof.\"\n\nArticle 4, Section 45 of the state constitution mandates that each bill may only pertain to one subject, clearly stated in the bill title, \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".\n\n===Committees===\nAs with other legislative bodies throughout the world, the Alabama legislature operates mainly through committees when considering proposed bills. The Constitution of Alabama states that no bill may be enacted into law until it has been referred to, acted upon by, and returned from, a standing committee in each house. Reference to committee immediately follows the first reading of the bill. Bills are referred to committees by the presiding officer.\n\nThe state constitution authorizes each house to determine the number of committees, which varies from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session. Each committee is set up to consider bills relating to a particular subject.\n\n====Legislative Council====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session.\n\n===Committee reports===\nAfter a committee completes work on a bill, it reports the bill to the appropriate house during the \"reports of committees\" in the daily order of business. Reported bills are immediately given a second reading. The houses do not vote on a bill at the time it is reported; however, reported bills are placed on the calendar for the next legislative day. The second reading is made by title only. Local bills concerning environmental issues affecting more than one political subdivision of the state are given a second reading when reported from the local legislation committee and re-referred to a standing committee where they are then considered as a general bill. Bills concerning gambling are also re-referred when reported from the local legislation committee but they continue to be treated as local bills. When reported from the second committee, these bills are referred to the calendar and do not require another second reading.\n\nThe regular calendar is a list of bills that have been favorably reported from committee and are ready for consideration by the membership of the entire house.\n\nBills are listed on the calendar by number, sponsor, and title, in the order in which they are reported from committee. They must be considered for a third reading in that order unless action is taken to consider a bill out of order. Important bills are brought to the top of the calendar by special orders or by suspending the rules. To become effective, the resolution setting special orders must be adopted by a majority vote of the house. These special orders are recommended by the Rules Committee of each house. The Rules Committee is not restricted to making its report during the Call of Committees, and can report at any time. This enables the committee to determine the order of business for the house. This power makes the Rules Committee one of the most influential of the legislative committees.\n\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a fiscal note. Fiscal notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n===Third reading===\nA bill is placed on the calendar for adoption for its third reading. It is at this third reading of the bill that the whole house gives consideration to its passage. At this time, the bill may be studied in detail, debated, amended, and read at length before final passage.\n\nOnce the bill is discussed, each member casts his or her vote, and their name is called alphabetically to record their vote. Since the state's Senate has only 35 members, voting may be done effectively in that house by a roll call of the members. The membership of the House is three times larger, with 105 members; since individual roll-call voice votes are time consuming, an electronic voting machine is used in the House of Representatives. The House members vote by pushing buttons on their desks, and their votes are indicated by colored lights which flash on a board in the front of the chamber. The board lists each member name and shows how each member voted.  The votes are electronically recorded in both houses.\n\nIf a majority of the members who are present and voting in each house vote against a bill, it fails passage. If the majority vote in favor of the bill, its approval is recorded as passing. If amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n===Transmission to second house===\nA bill that is passed in one house is transmitted, along with a formal message, to the other house. Such messages are always in order and are read (in the second house) at any suitable pause in business. After the message is read, the bill receives its first reading, by title only, and is referred to committee. In the second house, a bill must pass successfully through the same steps of procedure as in the first house. If the second house passes the bill without amendment, the bill is sent back to the house of origin and is ready for enrollment, which is the preparation of the bill in its final form for transmittal to the governor.  However, the second house may amend the bill and pass it as amended. Since a bill must pass both houses in the same form, the bill with amendment is sent back to the house of origin for consideration of the amendment.  If the bill is not reported from committee or is not considered by the full house, the bill is defeated.\n\nThe house of origin, upon return of its amended bill, may take any one of several courses of action. It may concur in the amendment by the adoption of a motion to that effect; then the bill, having been passed by both houses in identical form, is ready for enrollment. Another possibility is that the house of origin may adopt a motion to non-concur in the amendment, at which point the bill dies. Finally, the house of origin may refuse to accept the amendment but request that a conference committee be appointed. The other house usually agrees to the request, and the presiding officer of each house appoints members to the conference committee.\n\n===Conference committees===\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and assigned members try to reach an agreement on the content so that the bill can be passed by both houses. If an agreement is reached and if both houses adopt the conference committee's report, the bill is passed. If either house refuses to adopt the report of the conference committee, a motion may be made for further conference. If a conference committee is unable to reach an agreement, it may be discharged, and a new conference committee may be appointed. Highly controversial bills may be referred to several different conference committees. If an agreement is never reached in conference prior to the end of the legislative session, the bill is lost.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. Once a bill has been enrolled, it is sent back to the house of origin, where it must be read again (unless this reading is dispensed with by a two-thirds vote), and signed by the presiding officer in the presence of the members. The bill is then sent to the other house where the presiding officer in the presence of all the members of that house also signs it. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the governor.\n\n===Presentation to the governor===\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law. From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision. If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it. Vetoed bills return to the house in which they originated, with a message explaining the governor's objections and suggesting amendments that might remove those objections. The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the governor, as he revised it, for his signature.  The governor is also permitted the [[line-item veto]] on appropriations bills.\n\nIn contrast to the practice of most states and the federal government (which require a supermajority, usually 2/3, to override a veto), a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.\n\nIf the governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature. This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\". This is the most conclusive form of veto, since state lawmakers have no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\n===Constitutional amendments===\nLegislation that would change the state constitution takes the form of a constitutional amendment. A constitutional amendment is introduced and takes the same course as a bills or resolution, except it must be read at length on three different days in each house, must pass each house by a three-fifths vote of the membership, and it does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Alabama Secretary of State. It is then submitted to voters at an election held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which state lawmakers proposed the amendment. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the [[Alabama Constitution]]. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n==Notable members==\n* [[Spencer Bachus]], U. S.

It is a [[bicameral]] body composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Alabama Senate|Senate]].  It is one of the few state legislatures in which members of both chambers serve four-year terms and in which all are elected in the same cycle.  The most recent election was on November 6, 2018.  The new legislature assumes office immediately following the certification of the election results by the Alabama Secretary of State which occurs within a few days following the election. \n\nThe Legislature meets in the [[Alabama State House]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The [[Alabama State Capitol|original capitol building]], located nearby, has not been used by the Legislature on a regular basis since 1985, when it closed for renovations. In the 21st century, it serves as the seat of the executive branch as well as a museum.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1861 Davis Inaugural.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jefferson Davis]] being sworn in as [[President of the Confederate States of America]] on February 18, 1861, on the steps of the [[Alabama State Capitol]].]]\n\n===Establishment===\nThe Alabama Legislature was founded in 1818 as a territorial legislature for the [[Alabama Territory]]. Following the federal [[Alabama Enabling Act of 1819]] and the successful passage of the first [[Alabama Constitution]] in the same year, the Alabama General Assembly became a fully fledged [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] upon the territory's admission as a state. The term of state representatives is two years and the term of state senators is four years.\n\nThe General Assembly was one of the 11 state legislatures of the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Following the state's secession from the Union in January 1861, delegates from across the [[Southern United States|South]] met at the state capital of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] to create the Confederate government. Between February and May 1861, Montgomery served as the Confederacy's capital, where Alabama state officials let members of the new Southern federal government make use of its offices. The [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] met for three months inside the General Assembly's chambers at the [[Alabama State Capitol]]. [[Jefferson Davis]] was inaugurated as the Confederacy's first and only [[President of the Confederate States of America|president]] on the steps of the capitol.\n\nHowever, following complaints from Southerners over Montgomery's uncomfortable conditions and, more importantly, following [[Virginia]]'s entry into the Confederacy, the Confederate government moved to [[Richmond, VA|Richmond]] in May 1861.\n\n===Reconstruction era===\nFollowing the Confederacy's defeat in 1865, the [[Government of Alabama|state government]] underwent a transformation following emancipation of enslaved African Americans, and constitutional amendments to grant them citizenship and voting rights. Congress dominated the next period of Reconstruction, which some historians attribute to [[Radical Republicans]]. For the first time, blacks could vote and were elected to the legislature. Republicans were elected to the state governorship and dominated the General Assembly; more than eighty percent of the members were white. \n\nIn 1867, a state constitutional convention was called, and a biracial group of delegates worked on a new constitution. The biracial legislature passed a new constitution in 1868, establishing public education for the first time, as well as institutions such as orphanages and hospitals to care for all the citizens of the state. This constitution, which affirmed the franchise for freedmen, enabled Alabama to be readmitted into the [[United States]] in 1868.  \n\nAs in other states during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], former Confederate and insurgent \"redeemer\" forces from the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] gradually overturned the Republicans by force and fraud. Elections were surrounded by violence as [[paramilitary]] groups aligned with the Democrats worked to suppress black Republican voting. By the 1874 state general elections, the General Assembly was dominated by white [[Bourbon Democrats]] from the elite planter class.\n\nBoth the resulting 1875 and [[Alabama Constitution|1901 constitutions]] [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised blacks]], and the 1901 also adversely affected thousands of poor whites, by erecting barriers to voter registration. Late in the 19th century, a Populist-Republican coalition had gained three congressional seats from Alabama and some influence in the state legislature. After suppressing this movement, Democrats returned to power, gathering support under slogans of white supremacy. They passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites, excluding them from the political system for decades into the late 20th century. The Democratic-dominated legislature passed [[Jim Crow laws]] creating legal segregation and second-class status for African Americans. The 1901 Constitution changed the name of the General Assembly to the Alabama Legislature. (Amendment 427 to the [[Alabama Constitution]] designated the State House as the official site of the legislature.) \n\n===Civil Rights era===\nFollowing World War II, the state capital was a site of important [[Civil Rights Movement]] activities. In December 1955 [[Rosa Parks]] refused to give up her seat for a white passenger on a segregated city bus. She and other African-American residents conducted the more than year-long [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] to end discriminatory practices on the buses, 80% of whose passengers were African Americans. Both Parks and Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], a new pastor in the city who led the movement, gained national and international prominence from these events.\n\nThroughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the Alabama Legislature and a series of succeeding segregationist governors [[Massive resistance|massively resisted]] school integration and demands of social justice by Civil Rights protesters. \n\nDuring this period, the Legislature passed a law authorizing the [[Alabama State Sovereignty Commission]]. Mirroring [[Mississippi]]'s [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission|similarly named authority]], the commission used taxpayer dollars to function as a state intelligence agency: it spied on Alabama residents suspected of sympathizing with the Civil Rights Movement (and classified large groups of people, such as teachers, as potential threats). It kept lists of suspected African-American activists and participated in economic boycotts against them, such as getting suspects fired from jobs and evicted from rentals, disrupting their lives and causing financial distress. It also passed on the names of suspected activists to local governments and citizens' groups such as the [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Council]], which also followed tactics to penalize activists and enforce segregation.\n\nFollowing a federal constitutional amendment banning use of poll taxes in federal elections, the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] authorizing federal oversight and enforcement of fair registration and elections, and the 1966 US Supreme Court ruling that poll taxes at any level were unconstitutional, African Americans began to register and vote again in numbers proportional to their population. They were elected again to the state legislature and county and city offices for the first time since the late 19th century.\n\nFederal court cases increased political representation for all residents of the state in a different way. Although required by its state constitution to redistrict after each decennial census, the Alabama legislature had not done so from the turn of the century to 1960. In addition, state senators were elected from geographic counties. As a result, representation in the legislature did not reflect the state's changes in population, and was biased toward rural interests. It had not kept up with the development of major urban, industrialized cities such as [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and Tuscaloosa. Their residents paid much more in taxes and revenues to the state government than they received in services. Services and investment to support major cities had lagged due to under-representation in the legislature.\n\nUnder the principle of [[one man, one vote]], the United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964) that both houses of any state legislature need to be based on population, with apportionment of seats redistricted as needed according to the decennial census.<ref name=\"reynolds\">[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=377&invol=533 ''REYNOLDS v. SIMS,'' 377 U.S. 533 (1964)], FindLaw, accessed 12 March 2015</ref> This was a challenge brought by citizens of Birmingham. When this ruling was finally implemented in Alabama by court order in 1972, it resulted in the districts including major industrial cities gaining more seats in the legislature.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn May 2007, the Alabama Legislature officially apologized for [[slavery]], making it the fourth [[Deep South]] state to do so.\n\n==Constitutions==\nAlabama has had a total of six different [[Constitution of Alabama|state constitutions]], passed in 1819, 1861, 1865, 1868, 1875, and 1901. The current constitution (1901) has had so many amendments, most related to decisions on county-level issues, that it is the longest written constitution in both the [[United States]] and the world. Because the Alabama legislature has kept control of most counties, authorizing home rule for only a few, it passes numerous laws and amendments that deal only with county-level issues.\n\nDue to the suppression of black voters after Reconstruction, and especially after passage of the 1901 [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising constitution]], most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites were excluded from voting for decades.<ref>J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974</ref><ref name=\"Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135\u2013136\">Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref>  After Reconstruction ended no blacks served in the Alabama Legislature until 1974 when two black majority districts in the House elected Thomas Reed and [[Fred Gray (attorney)|Fred Gray]].  As of the 2018 election, the Alabama House of Representatives has 27 African-American members and the Alabama State Senate has 7 African-American members.\n\nMost blacks did not regain the power to vote until after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Before that, many left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to northern and midwestern cities. Since the late 20th century, the white majority in the state has voted increasingly Republican. In the 2010 elections, for the first time in 136 years, both houses of the state legislature were dominated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s.   Republicans have maintained their majority status in the succeeding elections in 2014 and 2018.\n\n==Organization==\nThe Alabama Legislature convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except during the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March. In the last year of a four-year term, the legislative session begins on the second Tuesday in January. The length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Session weeks consist of meetings of the full chamber and committee meetings.\n\nThe [[Governor of Alabama]] can call, by proclamation, special sessions of the Alabama Legislature and must list the subjects to be considered. Special sessions are limited to 12 legislative days within a 30 calendar day span. In a regular session, bills may be enacted on any subject. In a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the governor announces on their proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\n==Legislative process==\n{{main|State legislature (United States)#Lawmaking process}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n===Notice and introduction of bills===\nPrior to the introduction of bills that apply to specific, named localities, the [[Alabama Constitution]] requires publication of the proposal in a newspaper in the counties to be affected. The proposal must be published for four consecutive weeks and documentation must be provided to show that the notice was posted. The process is known as \"notice and proof.\"\n\nArticle 4, Section 45 of the state constitution mandates that each bill may only pertain to one subject, clearly stated in the bill title, \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".\n\n===Committees===\nAs with other legislative bodies throughout the world, the Alabama legislature operates mainly through committees when considering proposed bills. The Constitution of Alabama states that no bill may be enacted into law until it has been referred to, acted upon by, and returned from, a standing committee in each house. Reference to committee immediately follows the first reading of the bill. Bills are referred to committees by the presiding officer.\n\nThe state constitution authorizes each house to determine the number of committees, which varies from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session. Each committee is set up to consider bills relating to a particular subject.\n\n====Legislative Council====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session.\n\n===Committee reports===\nAfter a committee completes work on a bill, it reports the bill to the appropriate house during the \"reports of committees\" in the daily order of business. Reported bills are immediately given a second reading. The houses do not vote on a bill at the time it is reported; however, reported bills are placed on the calendar for the next legislative day. The second reading is made by title only. Local bills concerning environmental issues affecting more than one political subdivision of the state are given a second reading when reported from the local legislation committee and re-referred to a standing committee where they are then considered as a general bill. Bills concerning gambling are also re-referred when reported from the local legislation committee but they continue to be treated as local bills. When reported from the second committee, these bills are referred to the calendar and do not require another second reading.\n\nThe regular calendar is a list of bills that have been favorably reported from committee and are ready for consideration by the membership of the entire house.\n\nBills are listed on the calendar by number, sponsor, and title, in the order in which they are reported from committee. They must be considered for a third reading in that order unless action is taken to consider a bill out of order. Important bills are brought to the top of the calendar by special orders or by suspending the rules. To become effective, the resolution setting special orders must be adopted by a majority vote of the house. These special orders are recommended by the Rules Committee of each house. The Rules Committee is not restricted to making its report during the Call of Committees, and can report at any time. This enables the committee to determine the order of business for the house. This power makes the Rules Committee one of the most influential of the legislative committees.\n\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a fiscal note. Fiscal notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n===Third reading===\nA bill is placed on the calendar for adoption for its third reading. It is at this third reading of the bill that the whole house gives consideration to its passage. At this time, the bill may be studied in detail, debated, amended, and read at length before final passage.\n\nOnce the bill is discussed, each member casts his or her vote, and their name is called alphabetically to record their vote. Since the state's Senate has only 35 members, voting may be done effectively in that house by a roll call of the members. The membership of the House is three times larger, with 105 members; since individual roll-call voice votes are time consuming, an electronic voting machine is used in the House of Representatives. The House members vote by pushing buttons on their desks, and their votes are indicated by colored lights which flash on a board in the front of the chamber. The board lists each member name and shows how each member voted.  The votes are electronically recorded in both houses.\n\nIf a majority of the members who are present and voting in each house vote against a bill, it fails passage. If the majority vote in favor of the bill, its approval is recorded as passing. If amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n===Transmission to second house===\nA bill that is passed in one house is transmitted, along with a formal message, to the other house. Such messages are always in order and are read (in the second house) at any suitable pause in business. After the message is read, the bill receives its first reading, by title only, and is referred to committee. In the second house, a bill must pass successfully through the same steps of procedure as in the first house. If the second house passes the bill without amendment, the bill is sent back to the house of origin and is ready for enrollment, which is the preparation of the bill in its final form for transmittal to the governor.  However, the second house may amend the bill and pass it as amended. Since a bill must pass both houses in the same form, the bill with amendment is sent back to the house of origin for consideration of the amendment.  If the bill is not reported from committee or is not considered by the full house, the bill is defeated.\n\nThe house of origin, upon return of its amended bill, may take any one of several courses of action. It may concur in the amendment by the adoption of a motion to that effect; then the bill, having been passed by both houses in identical form, is ready for enrollment. Another possibility is that the house of origin may adopt a motion to non-concur in the amendment, at which point the bill dies. Finally, the house of origin may refuse to accept the amendment but request that a conference committee be appointed. The other house usually agrees to the request, and the presiding officer of each house appoints members to the conference committee.\n\n===Conference committees===\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and assigned members try to reach an agreement on the content so that the bill can be passed by both houses. If an agreement is reached and if both houses adopt the conference committee's report, the bill is passed. If either house refuses to adopt the report of the conference committee, a motion may be made for further conference. If a conference committee is unable to reach an agreement, it may be discharged, and a new conference committee may be appointed. Highly controversial bills may be referred to several different conference committees. If an agreement is never reached in conference prior to the end of the legislative session, the bill is lost.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. Once a bill has been enrolled, it is sent back to the house of origin, where it must be read again (unless this reading is dispensed with by a two-thirds vote), and signed by the presiding officer in the presence of the members. The bill is then sent to the other house where the presiding officer in the presence of all the members of that house also signs it. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the governor.\n\n===Presentation to the governor===\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law. From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision. If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it. Vetoed bills return to the house in which they originated, with a message explaining the governor's objections and suggesting amendments that might remove those objections. The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the governor, as he revised it, for his signature.  The governor is also permitted the [[line-item veto]] on appropriations bills.\n\nIn contrast to the practice of most states and the federal government (which require a supermajority, usually 2/3, to override a veto), a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.\n\nIf the governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature. This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\". This is the most conclusive form of veto, since state lawmakers have no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\n===Constitutional amendments===\nLegislation that would change the state constitution takes the form of a constitutional amendment. A constitutional amendment is introduced and takes the same course as a bills or resolution, except it must be read at length on three different days in each house, must pass each house by a three-fifths vote of the membership, and it does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Alabama Secretary of State. It is then submitted to voters at an election held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which state lawmakers proposed the amendment. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the [[Alabama Constitution]]. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n==Notable members==\n* [[Spencer Bachus]], U. S.
