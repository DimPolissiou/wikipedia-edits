In the same context, it was known until 1951 as '''Portuguese West Africa''' (officially the '''State of West Africa''').\n\nInitially ruling along the coast and engaging in military conflicts with the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], in the 18th century Portugal gradually managed to colonise the interior Highlands. However, full control of the entire territory was not achieved until the beginning of the 20th century, when agreements with other European powers during the [[Scramble for Africa]] fixed the colony's interior borders. On June 11, 1951 the status was upgraded to '''Overseas Province of Angola''' and finally in 1972, '''State of Angola'''. In 1975, Portuguese Angola became the independent [[People's Republic of Angola]].\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Portuguese presence on the territory of contemporary Angola lasted from the arrival of the [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] in 1484{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} until the decolonization of the territory in November 1975. During these five centuries, several entirely different situations have to be distinguished.\n\n===Colony===\n[[Image:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|left|[[Queen Nzinga]] in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in [[Luanda]], 1657]]\n{{main|Colonial history of Angola}}\nWhen [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] and other explorers reached the [[Kongo Kingdom]] at the end of the 15th century, Angola as such did not exist. Its present territory comprised a number of separate peoples, some organized as kingdoms or tribal federations of varying sizes. The Portuguese were interested in trade, principally in slaves. They therefore maintained a peaceful and mutually profitable relationship with the rulers and nobles of the Kongo Kingdom, whom they [[Christianity in Angola|Christianised]] and taught [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], allowing them a share of the benefits from the slave trade. They established small trading posts on the lower [[Congo River|Congo]], in the area of the present [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic]]. A more important trading settlement on the Atlantic coast was erected at [[Soyo]] in the territory of the Kongo Kingdom. It is now Angola's northernmost town, apart from the [[Cabinda exclave]].\n\nIn 1575, the settlement of [[Luanda]] was established on the coast south of the Kongo Kingdom, and in the 17th century the settlement of [[Benguela]], even farther to the south. From 1580 to the 1820s, well over a million people from present-day Angola were exported as slaves to the so-called [[New World]], mainly to [[Brazil]], but also to North America.<ref>[[Joseph C. Miller]], ''Way of Death: Merchant Capitalism and the Angolan Slave Trade, 1730-1830'', Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1988</ref> According to Oliver and Atmore, \"for 200 years, the colony of Angola developed essentially as a gigantic slave-trading enterprise\".<ref>Medieval Africa, 1250-1800 (pp174) By Roland Anthony Oliver, Anthony Atmore</ref> [[Kingdom of Portugal]] sailors, explorers, soldiers and merchants had a long-standing policy of conquest and establishment of military and trading outposts in Africa with [[Portuguese conquest of Ceuta|the conquest of Muslim-ruled Ceuta]] in 1415 and the establishment of bases in present-day [[Morocco]] and the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The Portuguese had [[Catholicism|Catholic]] beliefs and their military expeditions included from the very beginning the [[evangelization|conversion]] of foreign peoples.\n\nIn the 17th century, conflicting economic interests led to a military confrontation with the Kongo Kingdom. Portugal defeated the Kongo Kingdom in the [[Battle of Mbwila]] on October 29, 1665, but suffered a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Kitombo]] when they tried to invade Kongo in 1670. Control of most of the central highlands was achieved in the 18th century. Further reaching attempts at conquering the interior were undertaken in the 19th century <ref>Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9lissier, ''Les guerres grises. R\u00e9sistance et revoltes en Angola (1845-1941)'', Montamets/Orgeval: self-published, 1977</ref> However, full Portuguese administrative control of the entire territory was not achieved until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1884, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], which up to that time refused to acknowledge that Portugal possessed territorial rights north of [[Ambriz]], concluded a treaty recognising Portuguese sovereignty over both banks of the lower Congo. However, the treaty, meeting with opposition there and in [[Germany]], was not ratified. Agreements concluded with the [[Congo Free State]], the [[German Empire]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in 1885\u20131886 fixed the limits of the province, except in the south-east, where the frontier between [[Barotseland]] ([[Northern Rhodesia|north-west Rhodesia]]) and Angola was determined by an Anglo-Portuguese agreement of 1891 and the arbitration award of [[Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy|King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy]] in 1905.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nDuring the period of Portuguese colonial rule of Angola, cities, towns and trading posts were founded, railways were opened, ports were built, and a [[Westernised]] society was being gradually developed, despite the deep traditional tribal heritage in Angola which the minority European rulers were neither willing nor interested in eradicating. Since the 1920s, Portugal's administration showed an increasing interest in developing Angola's economy and social infrastructure.<ref name=\"fordn\">More Power to the People, 2006.</ref>\n\n====The beginning of the war====\n{{main|Angolan War of Independence|Portuguese Colonial War}}\nIn 1951, the Portuguese Colony of Angola became an [[overseas province]] of Portugal. In the late 1950s the [[National Front for the Liberation of Angola]] (FNLA) and the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) began to organize strategies and action plans to fight Portuguese rule and the remunerated system which affected many of the native African people from the countryside, who were relocated from their homes and made to perform compulsory work, almost always unskilled hard labour, in an environment of [[economic boom]].<ref name=\"bbc\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk.go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1839749]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, British Broadcasting Company, January 2008.BBC News{{dead link|date=February 2017}}</ref> organised [[guerrilla warfare]] began in 1961, the same year that a law was passed to improve the working conditions of the largely unskilled native workforce, which was demanding more rights. In 1961, the Portuguese Government indeed abolished a number of basic legal provisions which discriminated against black people, like the ''Estatuto do Indigenato'' (Decree-Law 43: 893 of September 6, 1961). However, the conflict, conversely known as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War or the War of Liberation]], erupted in the North of the territory when [[Uni\u00e3o dos Povos de Angola|UPA]] rebels based in [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] massacred both white and black civilians in surprise attacks in the countryside.

After these events the [[Portuguese Government]], under the [[dictatorial]] ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' regime of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and later [[Marcelo Caetano]], sent thousands of troops from Europe to perform counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations. In 1963 Holden Roberto established the [[Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile]] (Portuguese: ''Governo revolucion\u00e1rio de Angola no ex\u00edlio'', GRAE) in [[Kinshasa]] in an attempt to claim on the international scene the sole representation of forces fighting Portuguese rule in Angola. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]) also started pro-independence guerrilla operations in 1966. Despite the overall military superiority of the [[Portuguese Army]] in the Angolan theatre, the [[African independence movements|independence guerrilla movements]] were never fully defeated. However, by 1972, after the ''[[Frente Leste]]'', a successful military campaign in the East of Angola, complemented by a pragmatic hearts and minds policy, the military conflict in Angola was effectively won for the Portuguese.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, the pro-independence guerrilla movement MPLA expanded their previously-limited insurgency operations to the East of Angola. This vast countryside area was far away from the main urban centres and close to foreign countries where the guerrillas were able to take shelter. The UNITA, a smaller pro-independence guerrilla organisation established in the East, supported the MPLA. Until 1970, the combined guerrilla forces of MPLA and UNITA in the East Front were successful in pressuring [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] (FAP) in the area to the point that the guerrillas were able to cross the [[Cuanza River]] and could threaten the territory of [[Bi\u00e9 (province)|Bi\u00e9]], which included an important urban centre in the agricultural, commercial and industrial town of [[Kuito|Silva Porto]]. In 1970, the guerrilla movement decided to reinforce the Eastern Front by relocating troops and armament from the North to the East.\n\n====Campaign in the Eastern Front====\n{{main|Frente Leste}}\nIn 1971, the FAP started a successful counter-insurgency military campaign that expelled the three guerrilla movements operating in the East to beyond the frontiers of Angola. The last guerrillas lost hundreds of soldiers and left tons of equipment behind, disbanding chaotically to neighbouring countries or, in some cases, joining or surrendering to the Portuguese. In order to gain the confidence of the local rural populations, and to create conditions for their permanent and productive settlement in the region, the Portuguese authorities organised massive vaccination campaigns, medical check-ups, and water, sanitation and alimentary infrastructure as a way to better contribute to the economic and social development of the people and dissociate the population from the guerrillas and their influence. On 31 December 1972, the Development Plan of the East (''Plano de Desenvolvimento do Leste'') included in its first stage, 466 development enterprises (150 were completed and 316 were being built). Nineteen health centres had been built and 26 were being constructed. 51 new schools were operating and 82 were being constructed<ref name=\"Ant\u00f3nio Pires Nunes\">{{in lang|pt}} Ant\u00f3nio Pires Nunes, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060827103251/http://petrinus.com.sapo.pt/leste.htm Angola Vit\u00f3ria Militar no Leste]</ref><ref>Ant\u00f3nio Pires Nunes, Angola, 1966-74: vit\u00f3ria militar no leste, {{ISBN|9728563787}}, 9789728563783, Publisher: Pref\u00e1cio, 2002</ref>\n[[File:MatasdorioOnzo.jpg|thumb|left|Portuguese troops during the Colonial War]]\nHowever, the Portuguese authorities were unable to defeat the guerrillas as a whole during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], particularly in [[Portuguese Guinea]], and suffered heavy casualties in the 13 years of conflict. Throughout the war Portugal faced increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions from most of the international community. The war was becoming even more unpopular in Portuguese society due to its length and costs, the worsening of diplomatic relations with other United Nations members, and the role it played as a factor in the perpetuation of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' regime. It was this escalation that would lead directly to the mutiny of members of the FAP in the [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974 \u2013 an event that would lead to the independence of all of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa.\n\n===Federated state===\nIn June 1972, the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese National Assembly]] approved a new version of its Organic Law on Overseas Territories, in order to grant its African overseas territories a wider political autonomy and to tone down the increasing dissent both internally and abroad. It changed Angola's status from an [[overseas province]] to an \u201cautonomous state\u201d with authority over some internal affairs, while Portugal was to retain responsibility for defense and foreign relations. However, the intent was by no means to grant Angolan independence, but was instead to \"win the hearts and minds\" of the Angolans, convincing them to remain permanently a part of an intercontinental Portugal. Renaming Angola (like [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]) in 1972 \"Estado\" (state) was part of an apparent effort to give the [[Portuguese Empire]] a sort of [[Federalism|federal structure]], conferring some degree of autonomy to the \"states\". In fact, the structural changes and increase in autonomy were extremely limited. The government of the \"State of Angola\" was the same as the old provincial government, except for some cosmetic changes to personnel and titles. As in Portugal itself, the government of the \"State of Angola\" was entirely composed of people aligned with the ''Estado Novo'' regime's establishment. While these changes were taking place, a few guerrilla nuclei stayed active inside the territory, and continued to campaign outside of Angola against Portuguese rule. The idea of having the independence movements take part in the political structure of the revamped territory's organization was absolutely unthinkable (on both sides).<ref>John A.

In 1951, the Portuguese authorities changed the statute of the territory from a colony to an [[overseas province]] of Portugal. Legally, the territory was as much a part of Portugal as Lisbon but as an overseas province enjoyed special derogations to account for its distance from Europe. Most members of the government of Angola were from Portugal, but a few were Africans. Nearly all members of the bureaucracy were from Portugal, as most Africans did not have the necessary qualifications to obtain positions.\n\nThe government of Angola, as it was in Portugal, was highly centralised. Power was concentrated in the executive branch, and all elections where they occurred were carried out using indirect methods. From the Prime Minister's office in Lisbon, authority extended down to the most remote posts of Angola through a rigid chain of command. The authority of the government of Angola was residual, primarily limited to implementing policies already decided in Europe. In 1967, Angola also sent a number of delegates to the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|National Assembly]] in Lisbon.\n\nThe highest official in the province was the governor-general, appointed by the Portuguese cabinet on recommendation of the Overseas Minister. The governor-general had both executive and legislative authority. A Government Council advised the governor-general in the running of the province. The functional cabinet consisted of five secretaries appointed by the Overseas Minister on the advice of the governor. A Legislative Council had limited powers and its main activity was approving the provincial budget. Finally, an Economic and Social Council had to be consulted on all draft legislation, and the governor-general had to justify his decision to Lisbon if he ignored its advice.\n\nIn 1972, the Portuguese National Assembly changed Angola's status from an overseas province to an \u201cautonomous state\u201d with authority over some internal affairs; Portugal was to retain responsibility for defense and foreign relations. Elections were held in Angola for a legislative assembly in 1973.<ref name=\"Angola History Columbia Encyclopedia\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nPortuguese Angola was a territory covering 1,246,700&nbsp;km\u00b2, an area greater than [[France]] and [[Spain]] put together. It had 5,198&nbsp;km of terrestrial borders and a coastline with 1,600&nbsp;km. Its geography was diverse. From the coastal plain, ranging in width from 25 kilometres in the south to 100-200 kilometers in the north, the land rises in stages towards the high inland plateau covering almost two-thirds of the country, with an average altitude of between 1,200 and 1,600 metres. Angola's two highest peaks were located in these central highlands. They were [[Moco Mountain]] (2,620 m) and Meco Mountain (2,538 m).\n[[File:Kwanza_River.jpg|thumb|Kwanza River]]\nMost of Angola's rivers rose in the central mountains. Of the many rivers that drain to the Atlantic Ocean, the [[Cuanza River|Cuanza]] and [[Cunene River|Cunene]] were the most important. Other major streams included the [[Kwango River]], which drains north to the [[Congo River]] system, and the [[Kwando]] and [[Cubango River]]s, both of which drain generally southeast to the [[Okavango Delta]]. As the land drops from the plateau, many rapids and waterfalls plunge downward in the rivers. Portuguese Angola had no sizable lakes, besides those formed by dams and reservoirs built by the Portuguese administration.\n\nThe Portuguese authorities established several national parks and natural reserves across the territory: [[Bicauri National Park|Bicauri]], [[Cameia National Park|Cameia]], [[Cangandala National Park|Cangandala]], [[Iona National Park|Iona]], [[Mupa National Park|Mupa]], [[Namibie Partial Reserve|Namibe]] and [[Qui\u00e7ama National Park|Qui\u00e7ama]]. Iona was Angola's oldest and largest national park, it was proclaimed as a reserve in 1937 and upgraded to a national park in 1964.\n\nAngola was indeed a territory that underwent a great deal of progress after 1950. The Portuguese government built dams, roads, schools, etc. There was also an economic boom that led to a huge increase of the European population. The white population increased from 44,083 in 1940 to 172,529 in 1960. With around 1,000 immigrants arriving each month. On the eve of the end of the colonial period, the ethnic European residents numbered 400,000 (1974) (excluding enlisted and commissioned soldiers from the mainland) and the mixed race population was at around 100,000 (many were [[Cape Verdian]] migrants working in the territory). The total population was around 5.9 million at that time.\n\n[[Luanda]] grew from a town of 61,208 with 14.6% of those inhabitants being white in 1940, to a major cosmopolitan city of 475,328 in 1970 with 124,814 Europeans (26.3%) and around 50,000 mixed race inhabitants. Most of the other large cities in Angola had around the same ratio of Europeans at the time, with the exception of S\u00e1 da Bandeira ([[Lubango]]), Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes ([[Namibe]]) and Porto Alexandre ([[Tombua]]) in the south where the white population was more established. All of these cities had European majorities from 50% to 60%.\n\nThe capital of the territory was Luanda,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsD7bjz6ILY Angola antes da Guerra], a film of Luanda, Portuguese Angola (before 1975), [[youtube.com]]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PY1Z0_Ee8 LuandaAnosOuro.wmv], a film of Luanda, Portuguese Angola (before 1975), [[youtube.com]]</ref> officially called S\u00e3o Paulo de Luanda.

Sometime during the 1920s, it became incorporated into the larger colony (later the [[overseas province]]) of Portuguese Angola. The two colonies had initially been contiguous, but later became [[exclave|geographically separated]] by a narrow corridor of land, which Portugal ceded to Belgium, allowing the [[Belgian Congo]] access to the Atlantic Ocean. Following the [[Portuguese Colonial War|decolonisation]] of Portuguese Angola with the 1975 [[Alvor Agreement]], the short-lived [[Republic of Cabinda]] unilaterally declared its independence. However, Cabinda was soon overpowered and re-annexed by the newly proclaimed [[People's Republic of Angola]] and never achieved [[international recognition]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Agriculture in Angola|Fishing in Angola|Mining in Angola|Slavery in Angola}}\n[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers and settlers had founded trading posts and forts along the coast of [[Africa]] since the 15th century, and reached the Angolan coast in the 16th century. Portuguese explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded Luanda in 1575 as \"S\u00e3o Paulo de Loanda\", and the region developed as a [[Slavery in Angola|slave trade]] market with the help of local [[Imbangala]] and [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] peoples who were [[African slave trade|notable slave hunters]]. Trade was mostly with the Portuguese [[colony of Brazil]] in the [[New World]]. Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact more like a colony of Brazil, another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the [[Jesuits]] in religion and education.<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\">[http://www.angola.org.uk/angola/en/history_of_angola.html History of Angola] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071740/http://www.angola.org.uk/angola/en/history_of_angola.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, Republic of Angola Embassy in the United Kingdom</ref>\n[[File:Acervo_Museu_do_Senado_(20187225478).jpg|thumb|right|''Mercado de Luanda'', S\u00e9rgio Telles, 1975]]\nThe philosophy of war gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade. The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; warlike states become states ready to produce and to sell.<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\"/> In the Planalto, or high plains, the most important states were those of [[Bi\u00e9 (province)|Bi\u00e9]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, enabling Portuguese hegemony over much of the area. During the period of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580-1640), Portugal lost influence and power and made new enemies. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], a major enemy of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions, including Luanda. The Dutch ruled Luanda from 1640 to 1648 as Fort Aardenburgh. They were seeking black slaves for use in [[sugarcane]] plantations of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Olinda]] and [[Recife]]), which they had also seized from Portugal. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina|Saint George del Mina]], Saint Thomas, and Luanda on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal reestablished its authority over the lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\"/>\n\nThe Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps, and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a [[Slavery in Angola|slave-based society]] to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. [[Portuguese Brazil|Brazil]] became [[independence of Brazil|independent]] in 1822 and the slave trade was abolished in 1836. In 1844, Angola's ports were opened to legal foreign shipping. By 1850, Luanda was one of the most developed cities outside [[Mainland Portugal|Europe]] in the [[Portuguese Empire]]: it was full of trading companies, exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products. Maize, tobacco, dried meat and cassava flour also began to be produced locally. The Angolan bourgeoisie was born.<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\"/> From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers from the [[metropole]].<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\"/>\n\n[[Diamond]] mining began in 1912, when the first gems were discovered by Portuguese prospectors in a stream of the [[Lunda Norte|Lunda region]], in the northeast. In 1917 the Companhia de Diamantes de Angola ([[Diamang]]) was granted the concession for diamond mining and prospecting in Portuguese Angola. Diamang had exclusive mining and labor procurement rights in a huge concession in Angola and used this monopoly to become the colony's largest commercial operator and also its leading revenue generator. Its wealth was generated by African laborers, many of whom were forcibly recruited to work on the mines with Lunda's aggressive state-company recruitment methods (See also chivalo/shibalo).<ref name=rough>\n{{cite book\n|title=Diamonds in the Rough: Corporate Paternalism and African Professionalism on the Mines of Colonial Angola, 1917\u20131975\n|author=Todd Cleveland\n|isbn=978-0821445211\n|publisher=Ohio University Press\n|date=2015\n}}</ref> Work was done with shovels into the 1970s, and as late as 1947, the company saw no benefit to mechanizing its operations, because local labour was so inexpensive.<ref name=rough /> Even the voluntary contract workers, or contratados, were exploited and had to build their own housing and often cheated of their wages. However Diamang, which was exempt from taxes, grew affluent in the 1930s and also realized that in a remote area like Lunda, the supply of workers was not inexhaustible and so the workers there were somewhat better treated than on some of the other mines or on the sugar plantations.\n\nOn the whole African laborers performed brutal work in poor conditions for very little pay, and they were frequently cheated of that. The American sociologist Edward Ross visited rural Angola in 1924 on behalf of the Temporary Slavery Commission of the [[League of Nations]] and wrote a scathing report describing the labor system as \"virtually state serfdom\", that did not allow Africans time to produce their food. In addition, when their wages were embezzled, they had no access to the colonial judicial system.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|title=\"I escaped in a coffin\": Remembering Angolan Forced Labor from the 1940s\n|author=Jeremy Ball\n|journal=Cadernos de Estudos Africanos [Online], 9/10 \n|issue=9/10\n|pages=61\u201375\n|date=2006\n|accessdate=15 May 2016 \n|url=http://cea.revues.org/1214  \n|doi=10.4000/cea.1214\n}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-1950s until 1974, [[iron ore]] was mined in [[Malanje]], [[Bi\u00e9 (province)|Bi\u00e9]], [[Huambo]], and [[Hu\u00edla Province|Hu\u00edla]] provinces, and production reached an average of 5.7 million tons per year between 1970 and 1974. Most of the iron ore was shipped to [[Japan]], [[West Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]], and earned almost US$50 million a year in export revenue. During 1966-67 a major iron ore terminal was built by the Portuguese at Saco, the bay just 12&nbsp;km North of [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]] (Namibe).

The [[Portuguese government]] granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of [[ChevronTexaco]], in 1955. Oil production surpassed the exportation of [[coffee]] as Angola's largest export in 1973.\n\nBy the early 1970s, a variety of crops and livestock were produced in Portuguese Angola. In the north, [[cassava]], [[coffee]], and [[cotton]] were grown; in the central highlands, [[maize]] was cultivated; and in the south, where rainfall is lowest, [[cattle herding]] was prevalent. In addition, there were large plantations run by Portuguese that produced [[palm oil]], [[sugarcane]], [[banana]]s, and [[sisal]].

The commercial farmers were dominant in marketing these crops, however, and enjoyed substantial support from the overseas province's Portuguese government in the form of [[Development aid|technical assistance]], irrigation facilities, and financial credit.

In the same context, it was known until 1951 as '''Portuguese West Africa''' (officially the '''State of West Africa''').\n\nInitially ruling along the coast and engaging in military conflicts with the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], in the 18th century Portugal gradually managed to colonise the interior Highlands. However, full control of the entire territory was not achieved until the beginning of the 20th century, when agreements with other European powers during the [[Scramble for Africa]] fixed the colony's interior borders. On June 11, 1951 the status was upgraded to '''Overseas Province of Angola''' and finally in 1972, '''State of Angola'''. In 1975, Portuguese Angola became the independent [[People's Republic of Angola]].\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Portuguese presence on the territory of contemporary Angola lasted from the arrival of the [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] in 1484{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} until the decolonization of the territory in November 1975. During these five centuries, several entirely different situations have to be distinguished.\n\n===Colony===\n[[Image:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|left|[[Queen Nzinga]] in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in [[Luanda]], 1657]]\n{{main|Colonial history of Angola}}\nWhen [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] and other explorers reached the [[Kongo Kingdom]] at the end of the 15th century, Angola as such did not exist. Its present territory comprised a number of separate peoples, some organized as kingdoms or tribal federations of varying sizes. The Portuguese were interested in trade, principally in slaves. They therefore maintained a peaceful and mutually profitable relationship with the rulers and nobles of the Kongo Kingdom, whom they [[Christianity in Angola|Christianised]] and taught [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], allowing them a share of the benefits from the slave trade. They established small trading posts on the lower [[Congo River|Congo]], in the area of the present [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic]]. A more important trading settlement on the Atlantic coast was erected at [[Soyo]] in the territory of the Kongo Kingdom. It is now Angola's northernmost town, apart from the [[Cabinda exclave]].\n\nIn 1575, the settlement of [[Luanda]] was established on the coast south of the Kongo Kingdom, and in the 17th century the settlement of [[Benguela]], even farther to the south. From 1580 to the 1820s, well over a million people from present-day Angola were exported as slaves to the so-called [[New World]], mainly to [[Brazil]], but also to North America.<ref>[[Joseph C. Miller]], ''Way of Death: Merchant Capitalism and the Angolan Slave Trade, 1730-1830'', Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1988</ref> According to Oliver and Atmore, \"for 200 years, the colony of Angola developed essentially as a gigantic slave-trading enterprise\".<ref>Medieval Africa, 1250-1800 (pp174) By Roland Anthony Oliver, Anthony Atmore</ref> [[Kingdom of Portugal]] sailors, explorers, soldiers and merchants had a long-standing policy of conquest and establishment of military and trading outposts in Africa with [[Portuguese conquest of Ceuta|the conquest of Muslim-ruled Ceuta]] in 1415 and the establishment of bases in present-day [[Morocco]] and the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The Portuguese had [[Catholicism|Catholic]] beliefs and their military expeditions included from the very beginning the [[evangelization|conversion]] of foreign peoples.\n\nIn the 17th century, conflicting economic interests led to a military confrontation with the Kongo Kingdom. Portugal defeated the Kongo Kingdom in the [[Battle of Mbwila]] on October 29, 1665, but suffered a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Kitombo]] when they tried to invade Kongo in 1670. Control of most of the central highlands was achieved in the 18th century. Further reaching attempts at conquering the interior were undertaken in the 19th century <ref>Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9lissier, ''Les guerres grises. R\u00e9sistance et revoltes en Angola (1845-1941)'', Montamets/Orgeval: self-published, 1977</ref> However, full Portuguese administrative control of the entire territory was not achieved until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1884, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], which up to that time refused to acknowledge that Portugal possessed territorial rights north of [[Ambriz]], concluded a treaty recognising Portuguese sovereignty over both banks of the lower Congo. However, the treaty, meeting with opposition there and in [[Germany]], was not ratified. Agreements concluded with the [[Congo Free State]], the [[German Empire]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in 1885\u20131886 fixed the limits of the province, except in the south-east, where the frontier between [[Barotseland]] ([[Northern Rhodesia|north-west Rhodesia]]) and Angola was determined by an Anglo-Portuguese agreement of 1891 and the arbitration award of [[Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy|King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy]] in 1905.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nDuring the period of Portuguese colonial rule of Angola, cities, towns and trading posts were founded, railways were opened, ports were built, and a [[Westernised]] society was being gradually developed, despite the deep traditional tribal heritage in Angola which the minority European rulers were neither willing nor interested in eradicating. Since the 1920s, Portugal's administration showed an increasing interest in developing Angola's economy and social infrastructure.<ref name=\"fordn\">More Power to the People, 2006.</ref>\n\n====The beginning of the war====\n{{main|Angolan War of Independence|Portuguese Colonial War}}\nIn 1951, the Portuguese Colony of Angola became an [[overseas province]] of Portugal. In the late 1950s the [[National Front for the Liberation of Angola]] (FNLA) and the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) began to organize strategies and action plans to fight Portuguese rule and the remunerated system which affected many of the native African people from the countryside, who were relocated from their homes and made to perform compulsory work, almost always unskilled hard labour, in an environment of [[economic boom]].<ref name=\"bbc\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk.go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1839749]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, British Broadcasting Company, January 2008.BBC News{{dead link|date=February 2017}}</ref> organised [[guerrilla warfare]] began in 1961, the same year that a law was passed to improve the working conditions of the largely unskilled native workforce, which was demanding more rights. In 1961, the Portuguese Government indeed abolished a number of basic legal provisions which discriminated against black people, like the ''Estatuto do Indigenato'' (Decree-Law 43: 893 of September 6, 1961). However, the conflict, conversely known as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War or the War of Liberation]], erupted in the North of the territory when [[Uni\u00e3o dos Povos de Angola|UPA]] rebels based in [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] massacred both white and black civilians in surprise attacks in the countryside.

After these events the [[Portuguese Government]], under the [[dictatorial]] ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' regime of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and later [[Marcelo Caetano]], sent thousands of troops from Europe to perform counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations. In 1963 Holden Roberto established the [[Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile]] (Portuguese: ''Governo revolucion\u00e1rio de Angola no ex\u00edlio'', GRAE) in [[Kinshasa]] in an attempt to claim on the international scene the sole representation of forces fighting Portuguese rule in Angola. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]) also started pro-independence guerrilla operations in 1966. Despite the overall military superiority of the [[Portuguese Army]] in the Angolan theatre, the [[African independence movements|independence guerrilla movements]] were never fully defeated. However, by 1972, after the ''[[Frente Leste]]'', a successful military campaign in the East of Angola, complemented by a pragmatic hearts and minds policy, the military conflict in Angola was effectively won for the Portuguese.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, the pro-independence guerrilla movement MPLA expanded their previously-limited insurgency operations to the East of Angola. This vast countryside area was far away from the main urban centres and close to foreign countries where the guerrillas were able to take shelter. The UNITA, a smaller pro-independence guerrilla organisation established in the East, supported the MPLA. Until 1970, the combined guerrilla forces of MPLA and UNITA in the East Front were successful in pressuring [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] (FAP) in the area to the point that the guerrillas were able to cross the [[Cuanza River]] and could threaten the territory of [[Bi\u00e9 (province)|Bi\u00e9]], which included an important urban centre in the agricultural, commercial and industrial town of [[Kuito|Silva Porto]]. In 1970, the guerrilla movement decided to reinforce the Eastern Front by relocating troops and armament from the North to the East.\n\n====Campaign in the Eastern Front====\n{{main|Frente Leste}}\nIn 1971, the FAP started a successful counter-insurgency military campaign that expelled the three guerrilla movements operating in the East to beyond the frontiers of Angola. The last guerrillas lost hundreds of soldiers and left tons of equipment behind, disbanding chaotically to neighbouring countries or, in some cases, joining or surrendering to the Portuguese. In order to gain the confidence of the local rural populations, and to create conditions for their permanent and productive settlement in the region, the Portuguese authorities organised massive vaccination campaigns, medical check-ups, and water, sanitation and alimentary infrastructure as a way to better contribute to the economic and social development of the people and dissociate the population from the guerrillas and their influence. On 31 December 1972, the Development Plan of the East (''Plano de Desenvolvimento do Leste'') included in its first stage, 466 development enterprises (150 were completed and 316 were being built). Nineteen health centres had been built and 26 were being constructed. 51 new schools were operating and 82 were being constructed<ref name=\"Ant\u00f3nio Pires Nunes\">{{in lang|pt}} Ant\u00f3nio Pires Nunes, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060827103251/http://petrinus.com.sapo.pt/leste.htm Angola Vit\u00f3ria Militar no Leste]</ref><ref>Ant\u00f3nio Pires Nunes, Angola, 1966-74: vit\u00f3ria militar no leste, {{ISBN|9728563787}}, 9789728563783, Publisher: Pref\u00e1cio, 2002</ref>\n[[File:MatasdorioOnzo.jpg|thumb|left|Portuguese troops during the Colonial War]]\nHowever, the Portuguese authorities were unable to defeat the guerrillas as a whole during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], particularly in [[Portuguese Guinea]], and suffered heavy casualties in the 13 years of conflict. Throughout the war Portugal faced increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions from most of the international community. The war was becoming even more unpopular in Portuguese society due to its length and costs, the worsening of diplomatic relations with other United Nations members, and the role it played as a factor in the perpetuation of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' regime. It was this escalation that would lead directly to the mutiny of members of the FAP in the [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974 \u2013 an event that would lead to the independence of all of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa.\n\n===Federated state===\nIn June 1972, the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese National Assembly]] approved a new version of its Organic Law on Overseas Territories, in order to grant its African overseas territories a wider political autonomy and to tone down the increasing dissent both internally and abroad. It changed Angola's status from an [[overseas province]] to an \u201cautonomous state\u201d with authority over some internal affairs, while Portugal was to retain responsibility for defense and foreign relations. However, the intent was by no means to grant Angolan independence, but was instead to \"win the hearts and minds\" of the Angolans, convincing them to remain permanently a part of an intercontinental Portugal. Renaming Angola (like [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]) in 1972 \"Estado\" (state) was part of an apparent effort to give the [[Portuguese Empire]] a sort of [[Federalism|federal structure]], conferring some degree of autonomy to the \"states\". In fact, the structural changes and increase in autonomy were extremely limited. The government of the \"State of Angola\" was the same as the old provincial government, except for some cosmetic changes to personnel and titles. As in Portugal itself, the government of the \"State of Angola\" was entirely composed of people aligned with the ''Estado Novo'' regime's establishment. While these changes were taking place, a few guerrilla nuclei stayed active inside the territory, and continued to campaign outside of Angola against Portuguese rule.

In 1951, the Portuguese authorities changed the statute of the territory from a colony to an [[overseas province]] of Portugal. Legally, the territory was as much a part of Portugal as Lisbon but as an overseas province enjoyed special derogations to account for its distance from Europe. Most members of the government of Angola were from Portugal, but a few were Africans. Nearly all members of the bureaucracy were from Portugal, as most Africans did not have the necessary qualifications to obtain positions.\n\nThe government of Angola, as it was in Portugal, was highly centralised. Power was concentrated in the executive branch, and all elections where they occurred were carried out using indirect methods. From the Prime Minister's office in Lisbon, authority extended down to the most remote posts of Angola through a rigid chain of command. The authority of the government of Angola was residual, primarily limited to implementing policies already decided in Europe. In 1967, Angola also sent a number of delegates to the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|National Assembly]] in Lisbon.\n\nThe highest official in the province was the governor-general, appointed by the Portuguese cabinet on recommendation of the Overseas Minister. The governor-general had both executive and legislative authority. A Government Council advised the governor-general in the running of the province. The functional cabinet consisted of five secretaries appointed by the Overseas Minister on the advice of the governor. A Legislative Council had limited powers and its main activity was approving the provincial budget. Finally, an Economic and Social Council had to be consulted on all draft legislation, and the governor-general had to justify his decision to Lisbon if he ignored its advice.\n\nIn 1972, the Portuguese National Assembly changed Angola's status from an overseas province to an \u201cautonomous state\u201d with authority over some internal affairs; Portugal was to retain responsibility for defense and foreign relations. Elections were held in Angola for a legislative assembly in 1973.<ref name=\"Angola History Columbia Encyclopedia\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nPortuguese Angola was a territory covering 1,246,700&nbsp;km\u00b2, an area greater than [[France]] and [[Spain]] put together. It had 5,198&nbsp;km of terrestrial borders and a coastline with 1,600&nbsp;km. Its geography was diverse. From the coastal plain, ranging in width from 25 kilometres in the south to 100-200 kilometers in the north, the land rises in stages towards the high inland plateau covering almost two-thirds of the country, with an average altitude of between 1,200 and 1,600 metres. Angola's two highest peaks were located in these central highlands. They were [[Moco Mountain]] (2,620 m) and Meco Mountain (2,538 m).\n[[File:Kwanza_River.jpg|thumb|Kwanza River]]\nMost of Angola's rivers rose in the central mountains. Of the many rivers that drain to the Atlantic Ocean, the [[Cuanza River|Cuanza]] and [[Cunene River|Cunene]] were the most important. Other major streams included the [[Kwango River]], which drains north to the [[Congo River]] system, and the [[Kwando]] and [[Cubango River]]s, both of which drain generally southeast to the [[Okavango Delta]]. As the land drops from the plateau, many rapids and waterfalls plunge downward in the rivers. Portuguese Angola had no sizable lakes, besides those formed by dams and reservoirs built by the Portuguese administration.\n\nThe Portuguese authorities established several national parks and natural reserves across the territory: [[Bicauri National Park|Bicauri]], [[Cameia National Park|Cameia]], [[Cangandala National Park|Cangandala]], [[Iona National Park|Iona]], [[Mupa National Park|Mupa]], [[Namibie Partial Reserve|Namibe]] and [[Qui\u00e7ama National Park|Qui\u00e7ama]]. Iona was Angola's oldest and largest national park, it was proclaimed as a reserve in 1937 and upgraded to a national park in 1964.\n\nAngola was indeed a territory that underwent a great deal of progress after 1950. The Portuguese government built dams, roads, schools, etc. There was also an economic boom that led to a huge increase of the European population. The white population increased from 44,083 in 1940 to 172,529 in 1960. With around 1,000 immigrants arriving each month. On the eve of the end of the colonial period, the ethnic European residents numbered 400,000 (1974) (excluding enlisted and commissioned soldiers from the mainland) and the mixed race population was at around 100,000 (many were [[Cape Verdian]] migrants working in the territory). The total population was around 5.9 million at that time.\n\n[[Luanda]] grew from a town of 61,208 with 14.6% of those inhabitants being white in 1940, to a major cosmopolitan city of 475,328 in 1970 with 124,814 Europeans (26.3%) and around 50,000 mixed race inhabitants. Most of the other large cities in Angola had around the same ratio of Europeans at the time, with the exception of S\u00e1 da Bandeira ([[Lubango]]), Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes ([[Namibe]]) and Porto Alexandre ([[Tombua]]) in the south where the white population was more established. All of these cities had European majorities from 50% to 60%.\n\nThe capital of the territory was Luanda,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsD7bjz6ILY Angola antes da Guerra], a film of Luanda, Portuguese Angola (before 1975), [[youtube.com]]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PY1Z0_Ee8 LuandaAnosOuro.wmv], a film of Luanda, Portuguese Angola (before 1975), [[youtube.com]]</ref> officially called S\u00e3o Paulo de Luanda.

Sometime during the 1920s, it became incorporated into the larger colony (later the [[overseas province]]) of Portuguese Angola. The two colonies had initially been contiguous, but later became [[exclave|geographically separated]] by a narrow corridor of land, which Portugal ceded to Belgium, allowing the [[Belgian Congo]] access to the Atlantic Ocean. Following the [[Portuguese Colonial War|decolonisation]] of Portuguese Angola with the 1975 [[Alvor Agreement]], the short-lived [[Republic of Cabinda]] unilaterally declared its independence. However, Cabinda was soon overpowered and re-annexed by the newly proclaimed [[People's Republic of Angola]] and never achieved [[international recognition]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Agriculture in Angola|Fishing in Angola|Mining in Angola|Slavery in Angola}}\n[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers and settlers had founded trading posts and forts along the coast of [[Africa]] since the 15th century, and reached the Angolan coast in the 16th century. Portuguese explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded Luanda in 1575 as \"S\u00e3o Paulo de Loanda\", and the region developed as a [[Slavery in Angola|slave trade]] market with the help of local [[Imbangala]] and [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] peoples who were [[African slave trade|notable slave hunters]]. Trade was mostly with the Portuguese [[colony of Brazil]] in the [[New World]]. Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact more like a colony of Brazil, another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the [[Jesuits]] in religion and education.<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\">[http://www.angola.org.uk/angola/en/history_of_angola.html History of Angola] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071740/http://www.angola.org.uk/angola/en/history_of_angola.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, Republic of Angola Embassy in the United Kingdom</ref>\n[[File:Acervo_Museu_do_Senado_(20187225478).jpg|thumb|right|''Mercado de Luanda'', S\u00e9rgio Telles, 1975]]\nThe philosophy of war gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade. The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; warlike states become states ready to produce and to sell.<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\"/> In the Planalto, or high plains, the most important states were those of [[Bi\u00e9 (province)|Bi\u00e9]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, enabling Portuguese hegemony over much of the area. During the period of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580-1640), Portugal lost influence and power and made new enemies. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], a major enemy of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions, including Luanda. The Dutch ruled Luanda from 1640 to 1648 as Fort Aardenburgh. They were seeking black slaves for use in [[sugarcane]] plantations of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Olinda]] and [[Recife]]), which they had also seized from Portugal. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina|Saint George del Mina]], Saint Thomas, and Luanda on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal reestablished its authority over the lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\"/>\n[[File:Pineapple_Vendors_Huambo_Quibala.jpg|thumb|Pineapple vendors]]\nThe Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps, and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a [[Slavery in Angola|slave-based society]] to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. [[Portuguese Brazil|Brazil]] became [[independence of Brazil|independent]] in 1822 and the slave trade was abolished in 1836. In 1844, Angola's ports were opened to legal foreign shipping. By 1850, Luanda was one of the most developed cities outside [[Mainland Portugal|Europe]] in the [[Portuguese Empire]]: it was full of trading companies, exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products. Maize, tobacco, dried meat and cassava flour also began to be produced locally. The Angolan bourgeoisie was born.<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\"/> From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers from the [[metropole]].<ref name=\"History Embassy in the United Kingdom\"/>\n\n[[Diamond]] mining began in 1912, when the first gems were discovered by Portuguese prospectors in a stream of the [[Lunda Norte|Lunda region]], in the northeast. In 1917 the Companhia de Diamantes de Angola ([[Diamang]]) was granted the concession for diamond mining and prospecting in Portuguese Angola. Diamang had exclusive mining and labor procurement rights in a huge concession in Angola and used this monopoly to become the colony's largest commercial operator and also its leading revenue generator. Its wealth was generated by African laborers, many of whom were forcibly recruited to work on the mines with Lunda's aggressive state-company recruitment methods (See also chivalo/shibalo).<ref name=rough>\n{{cite book\n|title=Diamonds in the Rough: Corporate Paternalism and African Professionalism on the Mines of Colonial Angola, 1917\u20131975\n|author=Todd Cleveland\n|isbn=978-0821445211\n|publisher=Ohio University Press\n|date=2015\n}}</ref> Work was done with shovels into the 1970s, and as late as 1947, the company saw no benefit to mechanizing its operations, because local labour was so inexpensive.<ref name=rough /> Even the voluntary contract workers, or contratados, were exploited and had to build their own housing and often cheated of their wages. However Diamang, which was exempt from taxes, grew affluent in the 1930s and also realized that in a remote area like Lunda, the supply of workers was not inexhaustible and so the workers there were somewhat better treated than on some of the other mines or on the sugar plantations.\n\nOn the whole African laborers performed brutal work in poor conditions for very little pay, and they were frequently cheated of that. The American sociologist Edward Ross visited rural Angola in 1924 on behalf of the Temporary Slavery Commission of the [[League of Nations]] and wrote a scathing report describing the labor system as \"virtually state serfdom\", that did not allow Africans time to produce their food. In addition, when their wages were embezzled, they had no access to the colonial judicial system.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|title=\"I escaped in a coffin\": Remembering Angolan Forced Labor from the 1940s\n|author=Jeremy Ball\n|journal=Cadernos de Estudos Africanos [Online], 9/10 \n|issue=9/10\n|pages=61\u201375\n|date=2006\n|accessdate=15 May 2016 \n|url=http://cea.revues.org/1214  \n|doi=10.4000/cea.1214\n}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-1950s until 1974, [[iron ore]] was mined in [[Malanje]], [[Bi\u00e9 (province)|Bi\u00e9]], [[Huambo]], and [[Hu\u00edla Province|Hu\u00edla]] provinces, and production reached an average of 5.7 million tons per year between 1970 and 1974. Most of the iron ore was shipped to [[Japan]], [[West Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]], and earned almost US$50 million a year in export revenue. During 1966-67 a major iron ore terminal was built by the Portuguese at Saco, the bay just 12&nbsp;km North of [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]] (Namibe).
