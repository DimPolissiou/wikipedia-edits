''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.  \n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  The vessel was abandoned in 1931. \n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = \u201cSnake River, Washington\u201d\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref>, the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.  \n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids..<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.  There once had been steamboats operating on the upper Columbia river, but by 1883, railroad competition had been so successful that all river boats had been driven off the route.<ref name = WheatFleet>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 =  \n| title = Sternwheelers up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country\n| isbn = 0-8032-5874-7 \n| chapter = Ch. 8: The Wheat Fleet\n| lccn = 77007161 \n| location =  Lincoln NE \n| publisher = University of Nebraska \n| publication-date = 1947 \n| at = 105-106\n}}</ref>  Wheat farming became widespread in the region in the 1880s and 1890s, and the railroads could not handle the larger and larger wheat crops being produced.<ref name = WheatFleet/>  The Open River Navigation company was formed to meet the demands for transport by wheat farmers and shippers, and it built a number of steamers, including ''Relief''.<ref name = WheatFleet/>\n\n== Construction ==\n''Relief'' was rebuilt from the much smaller stern-wheel steamer ''Columbia'' (US registry 127689), which had been {{convert|77|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet long, {{convert|20.4|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} on the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], with a depth of hold of {{convert|3.6|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet.<ref name = 1903mvrList>{{cite book\n| last1 = [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Dept]], Statistics Bureau \n| title = Annual List of Merchant Vessels\n| volume = 35\n| type = [[Fiscal year|FY]] end Jun 30, 1903\n| url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc1.cu05600138\n| location = [[Washington, DC|Wash.

''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.  \n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  The vessel was abandoned in 1931. \n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = \u201cSnake River, Washington\u201d\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref>, the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.  \n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids..<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.  There once had been steamboats operating on the upper Columbia river, but by 1883, railroad competition had been so successful that all river boats had been driven off the route.<ref name = WheatFleet>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 =  \n| title = Sternwheelers up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country\n| isbn = 0-8032-5874-7 \n| chapter = Ch. 8: The Wheat Fleet\n| lccn = 77007161 \n| location =  Lincoln NE \n| publisher = University of Nebraska \n| publication-date = 1947 \n| at = 105-106\n}}</ref>  Wheat farming became widespread in the region in the 1880s and 1890s, and the railroads could not handle the larger and larger wheat crops being produced.<ref name = WheatFleet/>  The Open River Navigation company was formed to meet the demands for transport by wheat farmers and shippers, and it built a number of steamers, including ''Relief''.<ref name = WheatFleet/>\n\n== Construction ==\n''Relief'' was rebuilt from the much smaller stern-wheel steamer ''Columbia'' (US registry 127689), which had been {{convert|77|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet long, {{convert|20.4|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} on the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], with a depth of hold of {{convert|3.6|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet.<ref name = 1903mvrList>{{cite book\n| last1 = [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Dept]], Statistics Bureau \n| title = Annual List of Merchant Vessels\n| volume = 35\n| type = [[Fiscal year|FY]] end Jun 30, 1903\n| url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc1.cu05600138\n| location = [[Washington, DC|Wash.

This is not the case with the JScript .NET command-line compiler, since this next-generation version relies on the .NET [[Common Language Runtime]] (CLR) for execution, which requires that the code be compiled to [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL), formerly called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), code before it can be run. Nevertheless, JScript .NET still provides full support for interpreting code at runtime (e.g., via the <code>Function</code> constructor or the <code>[[eval#JavaScript|eval]]</code> function) and indeed the interpreter can be exposed by custom applications hosting the JScript .NET engine via the VSA{{Technical statement|reason=more on VSA interfaces|date=February 2012}} interfaces.\n\nSecondly, JScript has a strong foundation in Microsoft's [[ActiveX]]/[[Component Object Model|COM]] technologies, and relies primarily on ActiveX components to provide much of its functionality (including database access via [[ActiveX Data Objects|ADO]], file handling, etc.), whereas JScript .NET uses the [[.NET Framework]] to provide equivalent functionality. For backwards-compatibility (or for where no .NET equivalent library exists), JScript .NET still provides full access to ActiveX objects via .NET / [[COM Interop]] using both the ActiveXObject constructor and the standard methods of the .NET '''Type''' class.\n\nAlthough the .NET Framework and .NET languages such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Visual Basic .NET]] have seen widespread adoption, JScript .NET has never received much attention, by the media or by developers. It is not supported in Microsoft's premier development tool, [[Visual Studio .NET]]. However, [[ASP.NET]] supports JScript .NET.\n\n== Language differences ==\nThe following are prime examples of language differences between JScript .NET and other .NET languages, including comparisons.\n\n=== Differences with C# ===\n* JScript .NET does not require a [[Main function (programming)|main()]] [[function (programming)|function]] that the operating system must call directly when executing a JScript .NET application, as such, JScript .NET program flow can be based on global code.\n* JScript .NET, because of its very loose type checking system can be very easy to learn, since the convention of explicit type declaration is not required at all.\n* JScript .NET does not require explicit references to the .NET Framework Base Class Library, as certain functions found in earlier versions of JScript are present in JScript .NET (e.g. functions for finding the [[Trigonometric function|tangent]] of an angle for a [[right triangle]]).\n* JScript .NET is closely linked to [[C syntax]], and is thus very easy to learn for [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C++]] developers.\n* While JScript .NET can be used to create Windows Forms applications, JScript .NET will have some trouble, as delegates can only be consumed in JScript .NET and not created. Thus, custom events are hard to emulate in JScript .NET.\n\n=== Differences with C++ ===\n* JScript .NET does not require a [[Main function (programming)|main()]] [[function (programming)|function]].\n* JScript .NET does not require explicit [[type declaration]] on variables. (In [[C++]], the use of templates and generics can be compared to this, loosely emulated with template specialization, etc.)\n* JScript .NET also does not require explicit [[Type conversion|type casts]] on variable use in the program. Code used to retrieve a string of characters, but only used for integer numbers can be cast implicitly; the vice versa can be done without error at compile time, but there is a chance of loss of precision or data.\ne.g.:\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\nimport System;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, what's your name?\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Type your name: \");\n\nvar _name = Console.ReadLine();\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, \" + _name);\n</source>\n\n=== Differences with Java ===\n\n* JScript .NET syntax and [[lexical conventions]] are similar to [[Java (programming language)|Java]] in that both are derived from [[C (programming language)|C]]. JScript was originally Microsoft's implementation of [[ECMAScript]], which is more commonly known as [[JavaScript]], though it is unrelated to Java. Thus, users of Java and other C-derived languages will find JScript easier to learn.\n* JScript .NET allows developers to use [[Variable (computer science)#Typing|untyped variables]], and can sometimes infer their type from their usage to optimize the compiled code. On the other hand, Java requires all variables to be typed.\n* JScript .NET can add properties and methods to objects in [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]], while Java objects always conform to their declared interface.\n* JScript .NET supports [[global variables]], something Java does not.\n\n=== Differences with older versions of JScript ===\n* JScript .NET allows developers to declare variables and functions with type information (e.g., '''var x : String;'''), while type information for JScript's variables and functions can not be declared (e.g., '''var x;''').\n* JScript .NET scripts are not interpreted, but executed independently. When executed, a JScript .NET application will invoke the [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]]. The CLR will execute the [[Common Intermediate Language|CIL]] instructions without using an interpreter.\n* JScript .NET can be run without the presence of a browser or another [[Scripting language|scripting engine]] as the compiler can generate standalone [[executable]]s and assemblies. However these still require [[.NET Framework]] to be installed in order to run.\n* JScript .NET provides access to the .NET Framework BCL ([[Base Class Library]]), providing much more functionality.\n* JScript .NET is only available as a scripting language for [[ASP.NET]], the technology used to generate web pages; thus, JScript .NET takes a similar role to [[PHP]] and other server-side scripting languages. Internet Explorer, however, is still using only the older JScript engine, so JScript.NET cannot be used to script web pages (or HTAs or HTCs). In this regard, JScript is much more versatile than JScript .NET.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[JavaScript OSA]]&nbsp;\u2013 A system-level scripting language for the [[Apple Macintosh]]\n* [[JScript]]\n* [[ActionScript]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3bf5fs13.aspx Getting Started With JScript .NET]\n* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms974588.aspx Introducing JScript .NET]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027083329/http://geocities.com/Jeff_Louie/jscript_net_windows_form.htm  JScript.NET tutorial and form tutorial]\n\n{{Common Language Infrastructure}}\n{{ECMAScript}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jscript .Net}}\n[[Category:.NET programming languages]]\n[[Category:JavaScript programming language family]]\n[[Category:Object-based programming languages]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=November 2013}}\n{{unreferenced|date=November 2013}}\n{{update|date=June 2015}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox programming language\n| name                   = JScript .NET\n| paradigm               = [[multi-paradigm]]\n| generation             = \n| year                   = \n| designer               = \n| developer              = [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]]\n| latest release version = \n| latest release date    = \n| typing                 = [[duck typing|duck]], [[weak typing|weak]], [[dynamic typing|dynamic]]\n| implementations        = \n| dialects               = \n| influenced_by          = [[JScript]] / [[ECMAScript]]\n| influenced             = \n| platform = [[.NET Framework]]\n}}\n{{Infobox file format\n| name      = JScript .NET\n| extension = .js\n| mime      = \n}}\n'''JScript .NET''' is a [[.NET Framework|.NET]] [[programming language]] developed by [[Microsoft]].\n\nThe primary differences between [[JScript]] and JScript .NET can be summarized as follows:\n\nFirstly, JScript is a [[Script (computer programming)|script]]ing language, and as such [[computer program|programs]] (or more suggestively, [[Script (computer programming)|script]]s) can be executed without the need to compile the code first.

In this regard, JScript is much more versatile than JScript .NET.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[JavaScript OSA]]&nbsp;\u2013 A system-level scripting language for the [[Apple Macintosh]]\n* [[JScript]]\n* [[ActionScript]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3bf5fs13.aspx Getting Started With JScript .NET]\n* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms974588.aspx Introducing JScript .NET]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027083329/http://geocities.com/Jeff_Louie/jscript_net_windows_form.htm  JScript.NET tutorial and form tutorial]\n\n{{Common Language Infrastructure}}\n{{ECMAScript}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jscript .Net}}\n[[Category:.NET programming languages]]\n[[Category:JavaScript programming language family]]\n[[Category:Object-based programming languages]]\n", "name_user": "Uzume", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:COM Interop", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript_.NET"}
