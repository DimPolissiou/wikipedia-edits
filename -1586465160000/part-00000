FBI Director [[James Comey]] said the agency would review the e-mails to see if they contained classified material.

They then stopped their work and contacted the team of investigators from FBI headquarters who had handled the probe of Clinton's private email server. The investigators saw enough of the emails to decide that they seem pertinent to the Clinton server investigation and that they might be emails not seen before. Because they feel they need a warrant specific to Abedin's emails, officials have not been able to examine them further.\n\nAbedin is cooperating with the investigation, according to Justice Department and FBI officials.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Slavic people|Slavic]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] populations attracted by the coal-mining industry came to comprise one-half of the Catholic population.\n\nAlthough many of the early settlers were Catholic immigrants, the first official visit of a priest to this territory of which there is any authentic record was not until 1787. In that year (during the [[suppression of the Society of Jesus]]) the former [[Jesuit]] [[James Pellentz]] (1727\u20131800)<ref>Jakob Pellentz was a native of Messenich in the diocese of Trier in Germany.

Planned as a retreat for French nobility, the site chosen was on the banks of the Susquehanna River, opposite the present village of [[Standing Stone Township, Pennsylvania|Standing Stone]] in Bradford County. Today scarcely a trace of this unique settlement remains.\n\nThe earliest permanent Catholic settlements were at [[Friendsville, Pennsylvania|Friendsville]] and [[Silver Lake Township, Pennsylvania|Silver Lake]] in Susquehanna County. These, as well as the other Catholic settlers scattered throughout this district, were attended occasionally by priests sent from [[Philadelphia]]. In 1825 \u2013 largely due to the solicitations of Patrick Griffin, father of [[Gerald Griffin]] \u2013 [[Francis Kenrick]], Bishop of Philadelphia, sent the Rev. [[John O'Flynn]] as the first resident pastor. His work, however, was similar to that of a missionary, as his field of labor comprised thirteen counties in northeastern Pennsylvania and five counties in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.\n\nThe first church in the diocese was built in 1825 near Silver Lake. Father O'Flynn died at [[Danville, Pennsylvania|Danville]] in 1829, and was succeeded by Father Clancy. On February 1, 1836, [[Henry Fitzsimmons]] was sent to take charge of this territory and took up his residence in Carbondale, where a church had been built in 1832. In 1838 [[John Vincent O'Reilly]] was sent by Kenrick to assist in administering to the Catholics of this extensive territory. He took up his residence at Silver Lake and his charge comprised Susquehanna, Bradford, Tioga, Potter and Sullivan counties in Pennsylvania and the five adjoining counties in New York. The early history of the diocese is intimately bound to the labors of Father O'Reilly and the foundations of many present parishes were the results of his missionary zeal.\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===Bishops of Scranton===\nThe following bishops have served as the [[diocesan bishop]] of the Diocese of Scranton.\n[[File:William O'Hara 1893.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[William O'Hara]], 1893]]\n\n# [[William O'Hara]] (1868-1899)<ref>O'Hara was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal Giacomo Fransoni. {{cite book|author1=Ritzler, Remigius|author2=Pirminus Sefrin|title=Hierarchia catholica Medii et recentioris aevi...

In the autumn of 1842, he opened a college at St. Joseph's, Susquehanna County. Under his supervision, it grew and flourished and, in the 22 years of its existence, the college educated two bishops and over 20 priests. It was destroyed by fire on January 1, 1864, and was never rebuilt. St. Thomas College was established in 1888 and came under the direction of the Christian Brothers. In 1938, it was elevated to become the [[University of Scranton]]. The [[Society of Jesus]] took charge of its governance in 1942. [[Marywood University]], also in Scranton, was founded and is operated by the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. [[King's College (Pennsylvania)|King's College]] in Wilkes-Barre is operated by the Congregation of the Holy Cross. And, in [[Dallas, Pennsylvania|Dallas]], [[Misericordia University]] was founded by the [[Religious Sisters of Mercy]] in 1924.\n\nIn the 1940s, it opened the [[Roger Williams Public School No. 10|South Scranton Catholic High School]], later Bishop Klonowski High School. The school closed in 1982.<ref name=\"arch\">{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks & National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H097577_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Roger Williams Public School No. 10| accessdate = 2012-01-03| author = Cynthia A.

The final decisions, made in January 2007, resulted in the consolidation of all schools as under direct diocesan control. It created four regional systems (as shown below), and closed many individual schools.

In that year (during the [[suppression of the Society of Jesus]]) the former [[Jesuit]] [[James Pellentz]] (1727\u20131800)<ref>Jakob Pellentz was a native of Messenich in the diocese of Trier in Germany.

Planned as a retreat for French nobility, the site chosen was on the banks of the Susquehanna River, opposite the present village of [[Standing Stone Township, Pennsylvania|Standing Stone]] in Bradford County. Today scarcely a trace of this unique settlement remains.\n\nThe earliest permanent Catholic settlements were at [[Friendsville, Pennsylvania|Friendsville]] and [[Silver Lake Township, Pennsylvania|Silver Lake]] in Susquehanna County. These, as well as the other Catholic settlers scattered throughout this district, were attended occasionally by priests sent from [[Philadelphia]]. In 1825 \u2013 largely due to the solicitations of Patrick Griffin, father of [[Gerald Griffin]] \u2013 [[Francis Kenrick]], Bishop of Philadelphia, sent the Rev. [[John O'Flynn]] as the first resident pastor. His work, however, was similar to that of a missionary, as his field of labor comprised thirteen counties in northeastern Pennsylvania and five counties in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.\n\nThe first church in the diocese was built in 1825 near Silver Lake. Father O'Flynn died at [[Danville, Pennsylvania|Danville]] in 1829, and was succeeded by Father Clancy. On February 1, 1836, [[Henry Fitzsimmons]] was sent to take charge of this territory and took up his residence in Carbondale, where a church had been built in 1832. In 1838 [[John Vincent O'Reilly]] was sent by Kenrick to assist in administering to the Catholics of this extensive territory. He took up his residence at Silver Lake and his charge comprised Susquehanna, Bradford, Tioga, Potter and Sullivan counties in Pennsylvania and the five adjoining counties in New York. The early history of the diocese is intimately bound to the labors of Father O'Reilly and the foundations of many present parishes were the results of his missionary zeal.\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===Bishops of Scranton===\nThe following bishops have served as the [[diocesan bishop]] of the Diocese of Scranton.\n[[File:William O'Hara 1893.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[William O'Hara]], 1893]]\n\n# [[William O'Hara]] (1868-1899)<ref>O'Hara was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal Giacomo Fransoni. {{cite book|author1=Ritzler, Remigius|author2=Pirminus Sefrin|title=Hierarchia catholica Medii et recentioris aevi...

In the autumn of 1842, he opened a college at St. Joseph's, Susquehanna County. Under his supervision, it grew and flourished and in the 22 years of its existence, the college educated two bishops and over 20 priests. It was destroyed by fire on January 1, 1864 and was never rebuilt. St. Thomas College was established in 1888 and came under the direction of the Christian Brothers. In 1938, it was elevated to become the [[University of Scranton]]. The [[Society of Jesus]] took charge of its governance in 1942. [[Marywood University]], also in Scranton, was founded and is operated by the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. [[King's College (Pennsylvania)|King's College]] in Wilkes-Barre is operated by the Congregation of the Holy Cross. And, in [[Dallas, Pennsylvania|Dallas]], [[Misericordia University]] was founded by the [[Religious Sisters of Mercy]] in 1924.\n\nIn the 1940s, it opened the [[Roger Williams Public School No. 10|South Scranton Catholic High School]], later Bishop Klonowski High School.

The final decisions, made in January 2007, resulted in the consolidation of all schools as under direct diocesan control. It created four regional systems (as shown below), and closed many individual schools. All of the secondary education centers in Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties were closed and replaced by two regional schools: Holy Cross High School to serve Lackawanna County and Holy Redeemer High School to serve Luzerne County. The curriculum of the diocese was standardized to promote continuity and uniformity in the education of the students, and improvements have been visible in the results of college attendance and standardized test results, which consistently rank well above the area's public schools.
