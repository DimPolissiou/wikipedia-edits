The process of unifying these diverse groups into a single party was difficult, with tensions between different factions running strong.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=13}}\n\nAt the turn of the century, the radical side of New Zealand [[working class]] politics was represented by the [[New Zealand Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], founded in 1901. The more moderate leftists were generally supporters of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|pp=13f}} In 1905, a group of working class politicians who were dissatisfied with the Liberal approach established the [[Independent Political Labour League]],{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|pp=17f}} which managed to win a seat in Parliament in the {{NZ election link|1908}}.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=216}}{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=19}} This established the basic dividing line in New Zealand's left-wing politics \u2013 the Socialists tended to be revolutionary and militant, while the moderates focused instead on progressive reform.<ref name=\"McLintock1966\"/>\n\nIn 1910, the Independent Political Labour League was relaunched as an organisation called the [[New Zealand Labour Party (1910)|Labour Party]], distinct from the modern party. Soon, however, the leaders of the new organisation decided additional effort was needed to promote left-wing cooperation, and organised a \"[[Labour Unity Conferences#The 1912 conference|Unity Conference]]\". The Socialists refused to attend, but several independent labour activists agreed. The [[United Labour Party (New Zealand)|United Labour Party]] was born.<ref name=\"McLintock1966\">{{cite book |chapter-url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/political-parties/page-8 |title=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |chapter=Labour Party |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage|Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manat\u016b Taonga]] |editor-first=A.

In the strike's aftermath, there was a major drive to end the divisions in the movement and establish a united front, therefore another [[Labour Unity Conferences#The 1913 conference|Unity Conference]] was called, and this time the Socialists attended.<ref name=\"Black Tuesday\"/> The resulting group was named the [[Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)|Social Democratic Party]].\n\nNot all members of the United Labour Party accepted the new organisation, however, and some continued on under their own banner. Gradually, however, the differences between the Social Democrats and the ULP Remnant broke down, and in 1915 they formed a unified caucus both to better oppose Reform and to differentiate themselves from the Liberals.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=SUNCH19150706.2.96 |work=Sun |page=11 |title=A Separate Identity |date= 6 July 1915 |accessdate= 30 March 2016 |volume=II |issue=438}}</ref> A year later yet another gathering was held.

Labour's 'Usehold' policy on land was in essence the replacement of freehold tenure by a system of perpetual lease from the state, with all land transfer conducted through the state (the full nationalisation of farmland). This policy was unpopular with voters and was dropped by Labour, along with other more radical policies, throughout the 1920s.<ref name=\"McLintock1966\" />\n\n[[File:New Zealand Parliamentary Labour Party, 1922.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Members of the Labour parliamentary [[caucus]], 1922.

In the {{NZ election link|1925}}, it declined somewhat but had the consolation of soon overtaking the Liberals as the second-largest party. Labour leader Harry Holland became the official [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] on 16 June 1926, after the [[1926 Eden by-election|Eden by-election]] on 15 April elected [[Rex Mason]] (Labour) to replace [[James Parr (politician)|James Parr]] (Reform) who had resigned. After the {{NZ election link|1928}}, however, the party was left in an advantageous position \u2013 the Reform Party and the new [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]] (a revival of the Liberals) were tied on 27 seats each, and neither could govern without Labour support. Labour chose to back United, the party closest to its own views \u2013 this put an end to five terms of Reform Party government.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=79}}\n\nThe rigours of the [[Great Depression]] brought Labour considerable popularity, but also caused tension between Labour and the United Party. In 1931, United passed a number of economic measures which Labour deemed hostile to workers, and the agreement between the two parties collapsed. United then formed [[United\u2013Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|a coalition government]] with Reform, making Labour the Opposition. The coalition retained power in the {{NZ election link|1931}}, but gradually, the public became highly dissatisfied with its failure to resolve the country's economic problems. Harry Holland died in 1933 and was replaced by his deputy Michael Joseph Savage as party leader. In the {{NZ election link|1935}}, the Labour Party gained a significant majority, gaining 53 seats to the coalition's 19, and returned to government.\n\nSeveral of the early Labour Party stalwarts were Australian-born: [[Alfred Hindmarsh]], [[Harry Holland]], [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Bob Semple]], [[Paddy Webb]], [[Bill Parry (politician)|Bill Parry]] and later [[Jerry Skinner]], [[Mabel Howard]], [[Hugh Watt]] and [[Dorothy Jelicich]].\n\n=== First Government (1935\u20131949) and opposition ===\n{{main|First Labour Government of New Zealand}}\n[[File:Michael Joseph Savage Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Michael Joseph Savage, the first Prime Minister from the Labour Party]]\nParty leader [[Michael Joseph Savage]] became [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] on 6 December 1935, marking the beginning of Labour's first term in office.

The year after Labour's first win, the Reform Party and the United Party took their coalition to the next step, agreeing to merge with each other. The combined organisation was named the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], and would be Labour's main rival in future years.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=100}}\n\n[[File:Labour Government caucus 1935.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Members of the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] on the steps of the [[New Zealand Parliamentary Library|Parliamentary Library]] in Wellington, 1935]]\nLabour also faced opposition from within its ranks. While the Labour Party had been explicitly socialist at its inception, it had been gradually drifting away from its earlier radicalism. The death of the party's former leader, the \"doctrinaire\" Harry Holland, had marked a significant turning point in the party's history. Some within the party, however, were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably [[John A. Lee]]. Lee, whose views were a mixture of socialism and [[social credit]] theory, emerged as a vocal critic of the party's leadership, accusing it of behaving autocratically and of betraying the party's rank and file.

Fraser is best known as New Zealand's leader for most of [[World War II]]. In the [[post-war]] period, however, ongoing shortages and industrial problems cost Labour considerable popularity, and the National Party, under [[Sidney Holland]], gained ground although Labour was able to win the 1943 and 1946 elections. Eventually, in the {{NZ election link|1949}}, Labour was defeated.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=133}}\n\nFraser died shortly afterwards, and was replaced by [[Walter Nash]], the long-serving [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=136}} It was to be some time before Labour would return to power, however \u2013 Nash lacked the charisma of his predecessors, and National won considerable support for opposing the \"industrial anarchy\" of the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|1951 waterfront dispute]].

Upon coming to power, Labour decided that drastic measures were needed to address [[balance of payments]] concerns.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=152}} This resulted in the highly unpopular \"[[Black Budget (New Zealand)|Black Budget]]\" of [[Arnold Nordmeyer]], the new Minister of Finance, which raised taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, cars, and petrol.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=154}} It is widely thought to have doomed the party to defeat despite the economy having rejuvenated less than a year after the Black Budget was adopted.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=154}} In the {{NZ election link|1960}}, the National Party returned to power.\n\n[[File:Norman Kirk 1966 campaign opening.jpg|thumb|Leader [[Norman Kirk]] opening Labour's election campaign in 1966]]\nThe elderly Nash retired in 1963, suffering from ill health.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=160}} He was replaced by Nordmeyer, but the taint of the Black Budget ensured that Nordmeyer did not have any appreciable success in reversing the party's fortunes. In 1965, the leadership was assumed by the younger [[Norman Kirk]], who many believed would revitalise the party. Labour was defeated again in the next two elections, but in the {{NZ election link|1972}}, the party gained a significant majority over its rival.\n\n=== Third Government (1972\u20131975) and opposition ===\n{{main|Third Labour Government of New Zealand}}\nKirk proved to be an energetic Prime Minister, and introduced a number of new policies. His foreign policy stances included strong criticism of [[nuclear weapon]]s testing and of [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] system. Kirk's health was poor, however, and was worsened by his refusal to slow the pace of his work. In 1974, Kirk was taken ill and died. He was replaced by [[Bill Rowling]], who did not have the same appeal \u2013 in the {{NZ election link|1975}}, Labour was defeated by National, which was led by [[Robert Muldoon]].{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=184}}\n\n[[File:Labour L Logo.png|thumb|left|Party logo from the mid-1960s until the early 1990s]]\nRowling remained leader of the Labour Party for some time after his defeat.

Clark led the party in opposition to the National government for six years under the administrations of Bolger (1993\u20131997) and Shipley (1997\u20131999).

The process of unifying these diverse groups into a single party was difficult, with tensions between different factions running strong.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=13}}\n\nAt the turn of the century, the radical side of New Zealand [[working class]] politics was represented by the [[New Zealand Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], founded in 1901. The more moderate leftists were generally supporters of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|pp=13f}} In 1905, a group of working class politicians who were dissatisfied with the Liberal approach established the [[Independent Political Labour League]],{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|pp=17f}} which managed to win a seat in Parliament in the {{NZ election link|1908}}.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=216}}{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=19}} This established the basic dividing line in New Zealand's left-wing politics \u2013 the Socialists tended to be revolutionary and militant, while the moderates focused instead on progressive reform.<ref name=\"McLintock1966\"/>\n\nIn 1910, the Independent Political Labour League was relaunched as an organisation called the [[New Zealand Labour Party (1910)|Labour Party]], distinct from the modern party. Soon, however, the leaders of the new organisation decided additional effort was needed to promote left-wing cooperation, and organised a \"[[Labour Unity Conferences#The 1912 conference|Unity Conference]]\". The Socialists refused to attend, but several independent labour activists agreed. The [[United Labour Party (New Zealand)|United Labour Party]] was born.<ref name=\"McLintock1966\">{{cite book |chapter-url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/political-parties/page-8 |title=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |chapter=Labour Party |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage|Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manat\u016b Taonga]] |editor-first=A.

In the strike's aftermath, there was a major drive to end the divisions in the movement and establish a united front, therefore another [[Labour Unity Conferences#The 1913 conference|Unity Conference]] was called, and this time the Socialists attended.<ref name=\"Black Tuesday\"/> The resulting group was named the [[Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)|Social Democratic Party]].\n\nNot all members of the United Labour Party accepted the new organisation, however, and some continued on under their own banner. Gradually, however, the differences between the Social Democrats and the ULP Remnant broke down, and in 1915 they formed a unified caucus both to better oppose Reform and to differentiate themselves from the Liberals.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=SUNCH19150706.2.96 |work=Sun |page=11 |title=A Separate Identity |date= 6 July 1915 |accessdate= 30 March 2016 |volume=II |issue=438}}</ref> A year later yet another gathering was held.

Labour's 'Usehold' policy on land was in essence the replacement of freehold tenure by a system of perpetual lease from the state, with all land transfer conducted through the state (the full nationalisation of farmland). This policy was unpopular with voters and was dropped by Labour, along with other more radical policies, throughout the 1920s.<ref name=\"McLintock1966\" />\n\n[[File:New Zealand Parliamentary Labour Party, 1922.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Members of the Labour parliamentary [[caucus]], 1922.

In the {{NZ election link|1925}}, it declined somewhat but had the consolation of soon overtaking the Liberals as the second-largest party. Labour leader Harry Holland became the official [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] on 16 June 1926, after the [[1926 Eden by-election|Eden by-election]] on 15 April elected [[Rex Mason]] (Labour) to replace [[James Parr (politician)|James Parr]] (Reform) who had resigned. After the {{NZ election link|1928}}, however, the party was left in an advantageous position \u2013 the Reform Party and the new [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]] (a revival of the Liberals) were tied on 27 seats each, and neither could govern without Labour support. Labour chose to back United, the party closest to its own views \u2013 this put an end to five terms of Reform Party government.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=79}}\n\nThe rigours of the [[Great Depression]] brought Labour considerable popularity, but also caused tension between Labour and the United Party. In 1931, United passed a number of economic measures which Labour deemed hostile to workers, and the agreement between the two parties collapsed. United then formed [[United\u2013Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|a coalition government]] with Reform, making Labour the Opposition. The coalition retained power in the {{NZ election link|1931}}, but gradually, the public became highly dissatisfied with its failure to resolve the country's economic problems. Harry Holland died in 1933 and was replaced by his deputy Michael Joseph Savage as party leader. In the {{NZ election link|1935}}, the Labour Party gained a significant majority, gaining 53 seats to the coalition's 19, and returned to government.\n\nSeveral of the early Labour Party stalwarts were Australian-born: [[Alfred Hindmarsh]], [[Harry Holland]], [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Bob Semple]], [[Paddy Webb]], [[Bill Parry (politician)|Bill Parry]] and later [[Jerry Skinner]], [[Mabel Howard]], [[Hugh Watt]] and [[Dorothy Jelicich]].\n\n=== First Government (1935\u20131949) and opposition ===\n{{main|First Labour Government of New Zealand}}\n[[File:Michael Joseph Savage Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Michael Joseph Savage, the first Prime Minister from the Labour Party]]\nParty leader [[Michael Joseph Savage]] became [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] on 6 December 1935, marking the beginning of Labour's first term in office.

The year after Labour's first win, the Reform Party and the United Party took their coalition to the next step, agreeing to merge with each other. The combined organisation was named the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], and would be Labour's main rival in future years.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=100}}\n\n[[File:Labour Government caucus 1935.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Members of the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] on the steps of the [[New Zealand Parliamentary Library|Parliamentary Library]] in Wellington, 1935]]\nLabour also faced opposition from within its ranks. While the Labour Party had been explicitly socialist at its inception, it had been gradually drifting away from its earlier radicalism. The death of the party's former leader, the \"doctrinaire\" Harry Holland, had marked a significant turning point in the party's history. Some within the party, however, were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably [[John A. Lee]]. Lee, whose views were a mixture of socialism and [[social credit]] theory, emerged as a vocal critic of the party's leadership, accusing it of behaving autocratically and of betraying the party's rank and file. After a long and bitter dispute, Lee [[The Lee Affair|was expelled]] from the party, establishing his own breakaway [[Democratic Labour Party (New Zealand)|Democratic Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite web|title=John A Lee|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/john-a-lee|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSavage died in 1940, and was replaced by [[Peter Fraser]], who became Labour's longest-serving prime minister. Fraser is best known as New Zealand's leader for most of [[World War II]]. In the [[post-war]] period, however, ongoing shortages and industrial problems cost Labour considerable popularity, and the National Party, under [[Sidney Holland]], gained ground although Labour was able to win the 1943 and 1946 elections. Eventually, in the {{NZ election link|1949}}, Labour was defeated.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=133}}\n\nFraser died shortly afterwards, and was replaced by [[Walter Nash]], the long-serving [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=136}} It was to be some time before Labour would return to power, however \u2013 Nash lacked the charisma of his predecessors, and National won considerable support for opposing the \"industrial anarchy\" of the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|1951 waterfront dispute]].

Rickard''''', 572 U.S. ___ (2014), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[use of force]] by [[police officer]]s during high-speed [[car chase]]s. After first holding that it had [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case, the Court held that the conduct of the police officers involved in the case did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]].\n\nAt midnight on July 18, 2004, Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase which ended in a parking lot, where officers fired fifteen shots into Rickard's car. Rickard and his passenger both died from a combination of gunshot wounds and injuries sustained when the car eventually crashed. Rickard's daughter sued the officers who shot Rickard, arguing that they had used [[excessive force]] in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers moved for [[summary judgment]] based on [[qualified immunity]] because they believed their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the car chase. The district court denied this motion, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In a unanimous (9\u20130) decision authored by [[Justice Samuel Alito]],{{efn|name=opinionbreakdown}} the Court found that Rickard's actions posed a \"grave public safety risk\" and that the officers \"acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk\". The Court also found that the number of shots fired was also reasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\". Finally, the Court found that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the incident.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Prior case law ===\nThe [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] by the federal government, and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extends this prohibition to state governments under the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation doctrine]]. In the course of their duties, police officers must sometimes make split-second decisions in situations where they believe there is a serious threat to the lives of themselves or the public. The [[use of force]] by police officers to counter such threats constitutes a seizure in the eyes of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has previously held in such cases as ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985) and ''[[Graham v.

In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', the police officers appealed the district court's order denying [[summary judgment]] on qualified immunity. Because the officers appealed the case immediately after this order, without waiting for the case to proceed to trial, the appeal is considered \"interlocutory\".}} In general, federal law (specifically 28 U.S.C. \u00a71291) only allows courts of appeals to hear appeals from the \"final decisions\" of district courts, and Alito acknowledged that an order denying summary judgment \"is generally not a final decision within the meaning of \u00a71291 and is thus generally not immediately appealable\".<ref name=\":0\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 5.</ref> However, summary judgments based on qualified immunity are an exception to this general rule, since qualified immunity is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Alito rejected the respondent's argument that the Court's decision in ''Johnson v.

Katz]]'' (2001).<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 7.</ref> Examining the facts of the case \"from the perspective 'of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight'\", Alito concluded that the officers had acted reasonably and had not violated the Fourth Amendment.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 8\u201310.</ref> Alito wrote there was \"no basis for reach a different conclusion\" from the Court's decision in ''Scott v. Harris'', stating that \"Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 10.</ref> Furthermore, Alito rejected the respondent's argument that even if the officers were justified in using deadly force, the degree of force that the officers used when firing 15 shots into Rickard's car was unreasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\".<ref name=\":1\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 11.</ref> The presence of a passenger in Rickard's car does not affect this analysis because the question in the case is \"whether petitioners violated Rickard\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, not Allen\u2019s\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, Alito wrote that even if the officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 12.</ref>\n\n== Analysis and reception ==\n\n=== Implications ===\n\nIn a legal analysis published in ''[[Criminal Justice Review]]'', a peer-reviewed academic journal published by [[SAGE Publishing]], Darrell L.

According to Ross, \"lower courts are reminded of how to assess issues pertaining to qualified immunity, particularly in use of force cases\".<ref name=\":3\">Ross p. 254</ref> Specifically, the \"correct standard, as reiterated by the Court\u2014which was never discussed by the Sixth Circuit\u2014is whether the right was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood what he or she is doing violates that right.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, Ross wrote that police are also reminded of the Court's principles regarding the use of deadly force in accordance with ''Graham'', especially as it pertains to fleeing motorists. Specifically, Ross wrote, \"Whether force appears reasonable is measured from the perspective of the officer at the moment the officer decided to use it.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Ross also emphasized the implications of the Court's analysis over the number of rounds fired. Ross commented that police officers \"are not trained or required to shoot to wound, nor are they trained to shoot warning shots prior to responding with deadly force.\"<ref name=\":4\">Ross, p. 255</ref> According to Ross, \"Justice Alito confirmed the fact officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is stopped ...\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Finally, Ross wrote, \"Police administrators are encouraged to review and revise their current use of force and pursuit policies consistent with this decision.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Ross recommended that \"administrators should provide training to their officers on use of force legal issues and principles that emerge from ''Rickard'', ''Graham'', ''Scott'', and ''Brosseau''\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Reactions and criticism ===\n\n[[Erwin Chemerinsky]], the dean of the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]], wrote an opinion piece published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which he described the Court's decision as \"deeply disturbing\", arguing that there are alternatives to shooting at vehicles involves in high-speed car chases and that the Court has \"weakened accountability by ruling that a local government can be held liable only if it is proved that the city\u2019s or county\u2019s own policy violated the Constitution\".<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |last1=Chemerinsky |first1=Erwin |title=Opinion {{!}} How the Supreme Court Protects Bad Cops |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/opinion/how-the-supreme-court-protects-bad-cops.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 August 2014 |page=A23}}</ref> In the article, Chemerinsky also opposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, arguing that it poses an unreasonable burden for individuals alleging violations of constitutional rights.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In a blog post published in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Jonathan R.

For example, in ''Scott'', the police used a maneuver that caused the driver to spin out of control, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', the police used their firearms.

Rickard''''', 572 U.S. ___ (2014), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[use of force]] by [[police officer]]s during high-speed [[car chase]]s. After first holding that it had [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case, the Court held that the conduct of the police officers involved in the case did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]].\n\nAt midnight on July 18, 2004, Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase which ended in a parking lot, where officers fired fifteen shots into Rickard's car. Rickard and his passenger both died from a combination of gunshot wounds and injuries sustained when the car eventually crashed. Rickard's daughter sued the officers who shot Rickard, arguing that they had used [[excessive force]] in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity because they believed their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the car chase. The district court denied this motion, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In a unanimous (9\u20130) decision authored by [[Justice Samuel Alito]],{{efn|name=opinionbreakdown}} the Court found that Rickard's actions posed a \"grave public safety risk\" and that the officers \"acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk\". The Court also found that the number of shots fired was also reasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\". Finally, the Court found that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the incident.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Prior case law ===\nThe [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] by the federal government, and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extends this prohibition to state governments under the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation doctrine]]. In the course of their duties, police officers must sometimes make split-second decisions in situations where they believe there is a serious threat to the lives of themselves or the public. The [[use of force]] by police officers to counter such threats constitutes a seizure in the eyes of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has previously held in such cases as ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985) and ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989) that the use of force, including deadly force, by a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment if it is \"objectively reasonable\" in light of the circumstances confronting them.<ref>Ross, p. 246</ref>\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has also examined the use of force against fleeing motorists specifically.

Because the officers appealed the case immediately after this order, without waiting for the case to proceed to trial, the appeal is considered \"interlocutory\".}} In general, federal law (specifically 28 U.S.C. \u00a71291) only allows courts of appeals to hear appeals from the \"final decisions\" of district courts, and Alito acknowledged that an order denying summary judgment \"is generally not a final decision within the meaning of \u00a71291 and is thus generally not immediately appealable\".<ref name=\":0\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 5.</ref> However, summary judgments based on qualified immunity are an exception to this general rule, since qualified immunity is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Alito rejected the respondent's argument that the Court's decision in ''Johnson v. Jones'' prevents Court from having jurisdiction in this case, stating that in ''Johnson'', the summary judgment order was not appealable because \"it merely decided 'a question of evidence sufficiency', ''i.e.'' which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6.</ref> In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Jones'', however, the officers raised legal issues, and Alito stated that \"deciding legal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate courts\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMoving onto the legal questions, Alito first explained why he was beginning his analysis of whether the officers' violated \"clearly established law\" by first answering whether the officers' actually violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures, citing the Court's decision in ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]'' (2001).<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 7.</ref> Examining the facts of the case \"from the perspective 'of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight'\", Alito concluded that the officers had acted reasonably and had not violated the Fourth Amendment.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 8\u201310.</ref> Alito wrote there was \"no basis for reach a different conclusion\" from the Court's decision in ''Scott v. Harris'', stating that \"Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 10.</ref> Furthermore, Alito rejected the respondent's argument that even if the officers were justified in using deadly force, the degree of force that the officers used when firing 15 shots into Rickard's car was unreasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\".<ref name=\":1\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 11.</ref> The presence of a passenger in Rickard's car does not affect this analysis because the question in the case is \"whether petitioners violated Rickard\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, not Allen\u2019s\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, Alito wrote that even if the officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 12.</ref>\n\n== Analysis and reception ==\n\n=== Implications ===\n\nIn a legal analysis published in ''[[Criminal Justice Review]]'', a peer-reviewed academic journal published by [[SAGE Publishing]], Darrell L. Ross of [[Valdosta State University]] discussed the legal and practical implications of ''Plumhoff''. According to Ross, \"lower courts are reminded of how to assess issues pertaining to qualified immunity, particularly in use of force cases\".<ref name=\":3\">Ross p. 254</ref> Specifically, the \"correct standard, as reiterated by the Court\u2014which was never discussed by the Sixth Circuit\u2014is whether the right was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood what he or she is doing violates that right.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, Ross wrote that police are also reminded of the Court's principles regarding the use of deadly force in accordance with ''Graham'', especially as it pertains to fleeing motorists. Specifically, Ross wrote, \"Whether force appears reasonable is measured from the perspective of the officer at the moment the officer decided to use it.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Ross also emphasized the implications of the Court's analysis over the number of rounds fired. Ross commented that police officers \"are not trained or required to shoot to wound, nor are they trained to shoot warning shots prior to responding with deadly force.\"<ref name=\":4\">Ross, p. 255</ref> According to Ross, \"Justice Alito confirmed the fact officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is stopped ...\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Finally, Ross wrote, \"Police administrators are encouraged to review and revise their current use of force and pursuit policies consistent with this decision.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Ross recommended that \"administrators should provide training to their officers on use of force legal issues and principles that emerge from ''Rickard'', ''Graham'', ''Scott'', and ''Brosseau''\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Reactions and criticism ===\n\n[[Erwin Chemerinsky]], the dean of the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]], wrote an opinion piece published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which he described the Court's decision as \"deeply disturbing\", arguing that there are alternatives to shooting at vehicles involves in high-speed car chases and that the Court has \"weakened accountability by ruling that a local government can be held liable only if it is proved that the city\u2019s or county\u2019s own policy violated the Constitution\".<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |last1=Chemerinsky |first1=Erwin |title=Opinion {{!}} How the Supreme Court Protects Bad Cops |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/opinion/how-the-supreme-court-protects-bad-cops.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 August 2014 |page=A23}}</ref> In the article, Chemerinsky also opposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, arguing that it poses an unreasonable burden for individuals alleging violations of constitutional rights.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In a blog post published in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Jonathan R. Nash, a professor of law at [[Emory University School of Law]], argued that the Court's decision in ''Plumhoff'' was inconsistent with the precedent it set in ''Scott'', commenting that the Court \"jettisoned ''Scott''<nowiki/>'s careful balancing in favor of an approach designed to give the police substantial leeway in terminating chases\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|title=High-speed police pursuits and deadly force|last=Nash|first=Jonathan R.|date=August 19, 2014|website=The Hill|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414175726/https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|archive-date=April 14, 2018|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> Nash stated there were differences between the facts in ''Plumhoff'' versus the facts in ''Scott'', which he felt should have compelled the Court to a different conclusion. For example, in ''Scott'', the police used a maneuver that caused the driver to spin out of control, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', the police used their firearms. Additionally, in ''Scott'', the driver was the only one in the fleeing car, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', Rickard had a passenger.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n; Sources\n* ''Plumhoff v.

[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won a unique [[treble (association football)|treble]] of the league title, the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. They secured their fifth league championship in seven seasons after losing just three league games all season.\n\nThe season was also the 100th season of top flight football in England, not counting years lost to the two World Wars. Of the original clubs in the [[1888\u201389 Football League|first Football League season]], only [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] were present for this season. \n\nArsenal failed to retain their title, despite having the same points tally as last season 78 points, but had at one point looked as though they were on the brink of winning the title, after beating fellow rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], while Manchester United had drawn against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], 2\u20132. However, Manchester United pushed on and took advantage of Arsenal's 1\u20130 defeat at Leeds United in the penultimate match of the season and despite going 1\u20130 down against Tottenham on the final day, came back to win 2\u20131 and clinch the title. Should they have failed to win, Arsenal would have been crowned champions once more.\n\nTo achieve their success, the Manchester United playing squad had been altered substantially during the close season. A total of more than \u00a328&nbsp;million had been spent on [[Dwight Yorke]], [[Jaap Stam]] and [[Jesper Blomqvist]], while several older players left the club; [[Gary Pallister]] returned to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] after nine years for \u00a32.5&nbsp;million, while [[Brian McClair]] returned to [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] on a free transfer. In December, however, McClair was back in the Premier League as [[Brian Kidd]]'s assistant at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].\n\n==Season summary==\nAt the end of 1998\u201399, the Premiership would have three Champions League places. Manchester United as well as runners-up [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and third placed [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] would be playing in the following season's [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. There would only be one automatic [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] place from the league \u2013 taken by fourth-placed [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Fifth-placed [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] qualified for the UEFA Cup via the [[1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] after achieving their highest league finish for thirteen years as they continued to make progress under [[Harry Redknapp]], outperforming several \"bigger\" clubs with greater resources. Also qualifying were [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] via the [[1998\u201399 FA Cup]] [[1998 FA Cup Final|final]], and [[Tottenham Hotspur]] via the [[1998\u201399 Football League Cup|League Cup]].\n\nBottom of the Premiership in the final table came [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who suffered their third relegation in seven seasons. One notable low for Forest this season was an 8\u20131 drubbing at home, by Manchester United. Second from bottom came Blackburn Rovers, who just four seasons earlier had been Premiership champions. The final relegation place went to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], who went down at the end of their first spell in the top flight for nine seasons. The only newly promoted club to survive was Middlesbrough, who finished in a respectable ninth place.\n\nNone of the teams relegated from the Premiership the previous season regained their top division status in 1999, although [[Football League First Division|First Division]] champions [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] regained their Premiership place after a two-year exile. The other two relegation places went to long-term absentees from the top division. Playoff winners [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] regained their top division place after an absence of 11 years, but runners-up [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford]] had been outside of the top division for 77 years. These two promotion winners surprised the observers more than any other Division One side during 1998\u201399.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1997\u201398 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] (both teams sealing an immediate return to the top flight) and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] (playing in the top flight after an eight-year absence). This was also Charlton Athletic's first season in the Premier League.

[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won a unique [[treble (association football)|treble]] of the league title, the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. They secured their fifth league championship in seven seasons after losing just three league games all season.\n\nThe season was also the 100th season of top flight football in England, not counting years lost to the two World Wars. Of the original clubs in the [[1888\u201389 Football League|first Football League season]], only [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] were present for this season. \n\nArsenal failed to retain their title, despite having the same points tally as last season 78 points, but had at one point looked as though they were on the brink of winning the title, after beating fellow rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], while Manchester United had drawn against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], 2\u20132. However, Manchester United pushed on and took advantage of Arsenal's 1\u20130 defeat at Leeds United in the penultimate match of the season and despite going 1\u20130 down against Tottenham on the final day, came back to win 2\u20131 and clinch the title. Should they have failed to win, Arsenal would have been crowned champions once more.\n\nTo achieve their success, the Manchester United playing squad had been altered substantially during the close season. A total of more than \u00a328&nbsp;million had been spent on [[Dwight Yorke]], [[Jaap Stam]] and [[Jesper Blomqvist]], while several older players left the club; [[Gary Pallister]] returned to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] after nine years for \u00a32.5&nbsp;million, while [[Brian McClair]] returned to [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] on a free transfer. In December, however, McClair was back in the Premier League as [[Brian Kidd]]'s assistant at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].\n\n==Season summary==\nAt the end of 1998\u201399, the Premiership would have three Champions League places. Manchester United as well as runners-up [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and third placed [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] would be playing in the following season's [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. There would only be one automatic [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] place from the league \u2013 taken by fourth-placed [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Fifth-placed [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] qualified for the UEFA Cup via the [[1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] after achieving their highest league finish for thirteen years as they continued to make progress under [[Harry Redknapp]], outperforming several \"bigger\" clubs with greater resources. Also qualifying were [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] via the [[1998\u201399 FA Cup]] [[1998 FA Cup Final|final]], and [[Tottenham Hotspur]] via the [[1998\u201399 Football League Cup|League Cup]].\n\nBottom of the Premiership in the final table came [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who suffered their third relegation in seven seasons. One notable low for Forest this season was an 8\u20131 drubbing at home, by Manchester United. Second from bottom came Blackburn Rovers, who just four seasons earlier had been Premiership champions. The final relegation place went to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], who went down at the end of their first spell in the top flight for nine seasons. The only newly promoted club to survive was Middlesbrough, who finished in a respectable ninth place.\n\nNone of the teams relegated from the Premiership the previous season regained their top division status in 1999, although [[Football League First Division|First Division]] champions [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] regained their Premiership place after a two-year exile. The other two relegation places went to long-term absentees from the top division. Playoff winners [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] regained their top division place after an absence of 11 years, but runners-up [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford]] had been outside of the top division for 77 years. These two promotion winners surprised the observers more than any other Division One side during 1998\u201399.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1997\u201398 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] (both teams sealing an immediate return to the top flight) and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] (playing in the top flight after an eight-year absence). This was also Charlton Athletic's first season in the Premier League.

It was one of the first 22 channels to be launched on Astro in 1996. Astro Ria offers a variety of shows including news, Indonesian drama Malaysia, movies, reality shows, sports, talk shows, cartoons, concerts, sitcoms, documentaries, cooking shows, quizzes and more.\n\nAstro Ria is a 24-hour Bahasa Malaysia television channel operating on Astro network satellite service (formerly Channel 4). Channels that have started since Astro was launched on June 1, 1996, can be followed on channel 104 (formerly channel 1 and then channel 3) and on [[Kristal-Astro]] for [[Brunei]] broadcast. Channel changes were made from October 1, 2007, after Astro introduced a 3-digit channel.

The song was written by [[Jim Jonsin]], [[Rico Love]], Daniel Morris and [[Lil Wayne]], with Jonsin producing the song and Lil Wayne having featured vocals. The [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] slow-jam serves as the [[lead single]] from ''Here I Am'' and was released from April 8, 2011. Upon release, \"Motivation\" received favorable reviews from critics generally praising the sexiness of the song. Official remixes were produced for the song, including a [[dubstep]]-inspired [[electronic music|electronic]] mix by [[Diplo (producer)|Diplo]] and a rap remix by [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Trey Songz]] and [[Fabolous]].\n\nIn the United States, the song has peaked at number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart where it stayed seven weeks in a row, and number seventeen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Rowland's second US top 20 hit (fourth top 30 overall) and her second highest performing single to date as a solo artist, behind \"[[Dilemma (song)|Dilemma]]\". It was certified [[double platinum]] by the [[RIAA]] in May 2013.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Sarah Chatfield, the director behind Rowland's previous video \"[[Forever and a Day (Kelly Rowland song)|Forever and a Day]]\" (2010). It follows a number of sultry scenes where Rowland dances seductively amongst partially dressed dancers in a dimly-lit warehouse, with the entire video tinged in blue light. \"Motivation\" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]].

The film was originally released in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''''Lupin III'''''|\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16|Rupan Sansei}} but was later retitled to {{Nihongo|'''''Lupin III: Lupin vs. the Clone'''''|\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16 \u30eb\u30d1\u30f3VS<ruby><rb>\u8907\u88fd\u4eba\u9593</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>|Rupan Sansei: Rupan tai Kur\u014dn}} to differentiate it from other elements of the franchise. Directed by [[S\u014dji Yoshikawa]] from a screenplay by Yoshikawa and cult [[pink film]] [[screenwriter]] [[Atsushi Yamatoya]], the film was produced by animation studio [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] and distributed by [[Toho]]. The film's plot follows master thief [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]], who attempts to foil Mamo - a wealthy and powerful recluse seeking [[immortality]] - while trying to win the affections of his rival and would-be lover, [[Fujiko Mine]].\n\nSince its original Japanese release, the film has been licensed to several companies for release in North America and Europe, with four different English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of the film being produced in that time. In 2013, North American distributor [[Discotek Media]] released the film on a DVD containing all four English dubs, as well as extensive [[liner notes]] and essays about the film and its production.\n\nFinancially successful upon release, ''The Mystery of Mamo'' has continued to polarize critics and fans of the ''Lupin'' franchise, especially in English-speaking markets. Praise for the film tends to be aimed at its originality and faithfulness to the manga, and criticism usually focuses on the execution of the [[third act]]. The English dubs, though varying widely in terms of their production quality, [[Editing of anime in distribution|interpretation of the dialogue]] and [[voice acting]], have frequently been singled out for praise.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\n[[Koichi Zenigata|Inspector Zenigata]] travels to [[Castle Dracula]] to confirm the [[hanging|execution]] of his longtime nemesis [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]]; the body he finds is a decoy that is being used by the real Lupin to flee from the castle. Zenigata travels to [[Egypt]], believing that Lupin will raid the [[Giza Necropolis]] based on prior thefts of [[immortality]]-granting objects. His prediction proves accurate, but Lupin and his colleagues [[Daisuke Jigen]] and [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]] flee with the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. The Stone was requested by Lupin's would-be lover, [[Fujiko Mine]], who, having agreed to obtain the Stone for a mysterious client, steals it from Lupin in [[Paris]]. The benefactor, who calls himself Mamo, discovers that the Stone is a fake made by Lupin.\n\nIn response, Lupin's gang is attacked by Mamo's forces before finding their hideout destroyed by his henchman, Flinch. Jigen and Goemon blame the hideout's destruction on Fujiko, before quarrelling between themselves; Lupin calms the others by promising to abandon his desires for Fujiko. With nowhere else to go, they travel toward the [[Atlantic Ocean|ocean]] before finding a house with food and water. A wounded Fujiko comes for Lupin, forcing him to go against his promise and causing Jigen and Goemon to abandon them. Fujiko drugs Lupin before Flinch arrives to take them to Mamo. Jigen later returns to find Flinch's plane taking off, but retrieves a clue to its destination. He and Goemon are later interrogated about Mamo by [[Federal government of the United States|American]] [[Special agent|agents]], but are released when they are unable to answer their questions. During the inquiry, they decipher Fujiko's clue, leading them to Mamo's [[Caribbean]] island.\n\nMamo, a mysterious billionaire officially known as Howard Lockewood, tells Lupin that he manipulated him into stealing the Stone as a test, as he is considering granting him and Fujiko immortality in admiration of his skills and her beauty. Lupin, however, is more interested in the Stone, and searches Mamo's island for it. After retrieving the Stone, he and Fujiko are chased by Mamo's henchmen until they stumble across Mamo's lair. Mamo deems Lupin unworthy of eternal life and attempts to visualize his perverted nature to Fujiko, but she refuses to abandon him. The [[United States Air Force|USAF]] attacks the base, having tracked Jigen and Goemon to the island. Jigen rescues Lupin and Fujiko and seemingly kills Mamo in a shootout, while Goemon duels with Flinch. The altercation damages Goemon's sword, the ''Zantetsuken'', causing him to leave for training purposes.\n\nLupin, Fujiko and Jigen travel to [[Colombia]], where Lupin theorizes that Mamo may have gained eternal life by continuously [[cloning]] himself. They are thrust into a vision by Mamo, who reveals that his cloning technique has kept him alive for ten thousand years, and that he is responsible for virtually every major event in [[human history]]. Mamo also explains that he cloned Lupin. He then appears in person to reclaim Fujiko, and a distraught Lupin challenges him to perform a [[miracle]]. Mamo responds by setting off an [[earthquake]] through the destruction of a [[nuclear power station]].\n\nInside a temple, Mamo explains to Fujiko that his cloning technique has never been perfected, and that he has degenerated from his original form as a result. He decides that he and Fujiko must repopulate the Earth, and convinces her to push a button to launch [[nuclear missiles]] to [[genocide|achieve this end]]. Lupin arrives, and reveals that he rigged the missiles to explode before they could launch. Frustrated, Mamo takes Fujiko with him to a [[launching pad]] and fends Lupin off with lasers. Lupin uses the tip of Goemon's sword (given to him by Jigen earlier) to deflect the lasers, incinerating Mamo.\n\nA [[Spacecraft|rocketship]] emerges, containing a giant brain that reveals itself to be the original Mamo. Lupin realizes that Mamo had controlled his clones resembling his body just as the rocket launches into space. Lupin and Fujiko escape the rocket's trajectory, but not before Lupin plants an explosive on it. The glass shatters, and Mamo's brain drifts toward the [[sun]]. Lupin finds Fujiko in the rubble, where he is captured by Zenigata. Fujiko offers to help Lupin, but the Americans launch a missile attack on Mamo's base. Fujiko is rescued by Jigen, while Lupin and Zenigata, handcuffed together, escape on foot.\n\n==Full cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character name\n! Japanese voice actor\n!

Due to an increased popularity of [[Lupin The Third Part I|the first series]], staff who had worked on that series were assembled to make the film. [[Yasuo Otsuka]], who was animation director and character designer on that series, supervised the film's production. [[S\u014dji Yoshikawa]], who storyboarded the first and last episodes of the first series, acted as director and co-writer of the screenplay. [[Atsushi Yamatoya]], a writer and director of [[pink film]]s who had written two episodes of the first series (and later the third animated ''Lupin'' film, ''[[Legend of the Gold of Babylon]]''), also contributed to the script.<ref>{{cite AV Media |title=Lupin The 3rd: The Complete First TV Series (Disc 1) |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |people=Reed Nelson |medium=DVD|at= Episode 2 Liner notes}}</ref> Yuzo Aoki, a key animator for episodes 11 and 23 of the first series, was responsible for the angular, Monkey Punch-esque character designs seen in the film (he would later become noted for such work on [[List of Lupin III Part III episodes|''Lupin III Part III'']] and ''Legend of the Gold of Babylon'').<ref>{{cite AV Media |title=Lupin The 3rd: The Complete First TV Series (Disc 2) |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |people=Reed Nelson |medium=DVD|at= Episode 11 Liner notes}}</ref> [[Tsutomu Shibayama]], who was the character designer for the [[Lupin the Third: Pilot Film|1969 ''Pilot Film'']] that had preceded the original series, was responsible for the layout. A relative newcomer in the film's production team was composer [[Yuji Ohno]], who had provided the score for the second series. The main cast of the second series also resprised their roles for the film.<ref name=\"program\">{{cite AV media |work=The Mystery of Mamo | title=Original Movie Program Translation |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |year=2012 }}</ref>\n\n''Mamo'' was [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]]'s first full-length feature production. The movie was given a budget of 500 million yen, comparable to major live action films at the time and unheard of for an animated production. Production lasted for 15 months and involved 1,315 members of staff. The storyboard was 575 pages. 62,000 cel sheets were used in the animation, compared to 5,000 cels used in an average half-hour TV animation. Oversized cels were used and filmed in a modified [[VistaVision]] process known as \"Anime Vision\", which allowed for a brighter and sharper picture for projection in theaters compared to a TV production. 18,000 reference images were used for background and mechanical research, and 196 individual character drawings were created.<ref name=\"program\"/>\n\nMamo's name is taken from the villain Kyousuke Mamo who had appeared in the manga and first TV series. His physical design was inspired by Swan, [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]' character in the 1974 musical horror film ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'', and represents a monster who is both a boy and an old man at the same time. Similarly, the characters of [[Special Assistant to the President|Special Presidential Aide]] Stuckey and Special Agent Gordon are parodies of [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[G. Gordon Liddy]] respectively.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Mystery of Mamo |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |year=2012 |type=Liner Notes |last=Nelson |first=Reed}}</ref><ref name=\"mamo\">{{cite AV media |work=The Mystery of Mamo | title=Why Mamo Matters by Mike Toole |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |year=2012 |last=Toole |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Mystery of Mamo'' was originally released in Japan on December 16, 1978 as ''Lupin III''.<ref name=animehistorydates>{{cite book |title=\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u5168\u6b74\u53f2\u5b8c\u5168\u7248 |publisher=[[Futabasha]] |isbn=978-4-575-30406-0 |date=April 1, 2012|page=288}}</ref> The film was a financial success, earning 950 million yen and making it the ninth-highest grossing Japanese film of the 1979 film season.<ref>{{cite book |title=\u30ad\u30cd\u30de\u65ec\u5831\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30c6\u30f3\u5168\u53f21946-1996 |publisher=[[Kinema Junpo]] |date=1997|page=224}}</ref> Footage from the film, along with scenes from ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', was used [[Stern (game company)|Stern Electronics]] (under license from TMS) to make the ''[[Dragon's Lair]]''-style [[laserdisc video game]] ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx|title=The Castle of Cagliostro- Hayao Miyazaki's First (And Most Enjoyable) Movie|last=Surat|first=Daryl|publisher=Otaku USA|accessdate=June 1, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018154933/http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx|archivedate=October 18, 2014}}</ref> By the mid-1980s, TMS re-titled the film in Japan as ''Lupin III: Lupin vs. the Clone'', while English-speaking fans had begun referring to the film as ''The Mystery of Mamo'', to distinguish it from the two TV series and ''The Castle of Cagliostro''.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nA TV broadcast of the film on March 28, 2014 on [[Nippon Television|NTV]] attained an audience share of 11.2% in the [[Kant\u014d region]] of Japan.

It was once speculated that actors from the English adaptation of ''[[Speed Racer]]'', including [[Peter Fernandez]], [[Corinne Orr]], [[Earl Hammond]] and [[Jack Grimes (actor)|Jack Grimes]], were involved in this dub, but their involvement in its production has since been deemed impossible, given the manner in which the dub was produced.<ref name=\"history\"/> Despite being largely faithful to the original Japanese script, most of the names of the main characters were changed to Western-sounding alternatives.

He attributes this to being more familiar with the characters through other entries in the ''Lupin III'' franchise. However, he criticised the final third of the movie for its science fiction elements, which he felt were inferior to the action and [[Character arc|character-driven]] elements of the first two thirds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/lupin-3rd-movie-secret-mamo_article_75273.html |title=Lupin the 3rd The Movie : Secret of Mamo |publisher=Mania.com |last=Beveridge |first=Chris |date=July 20, 2003 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016052115/http://www.mania.com/lupin-3rd-movie-secret-mamo_article_75273.html |archivedate=October 16, 2014 }}</ref> This criticism was shared in another review for ''Mania.com'' by John Erini, except that he believed that the film became unwatchable due to the development of the Mamo character.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/lupin-3rd-secret-mamo_article_78794.html |title=Lupin the 3rd: Secret of Mamo |last=Erini |first=John |publisher=Mania.com |date=September 7, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420022455/http://www.mania.com/lupin-3rd-secret-mamo_article_78794.html | archivedate=2014-04-20 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRob Lineberger, writing for ''[[DVD Verdict]]'', also agrees with the criticism of the final third, and despite repeated viewings, felt no closer to understanding the events. Additionally, he criticised the \"lack of cohesion\" and \"unbroken string of [[jump cut]]s and [[deux ex machina]]s\" throughout the film. Reflecting on the positives of the film, Lineberger highlights the characters of Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko as being more interesting than either Lupin or Mamo. He also credits the movie for tackling interesting concepts such as [[cloning]], [[personal identity]], [[love]] and [[honour]], despite the way they are presented. In summary, he suggests that ''Lupin'' fans will find a more ambitious story in this film than the television episodes if they can accept some flaws. He recommends people who are not ''Lupin'' fans to watch ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/lupin3secretmamo.php |title=Lupin III: The Secret Of Mamo |last=Lineberger |first=Rob |publisher=[[DVD Verdict]] |date=January 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419233220/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/lupin3secretmamo.php |archivedate=April 19, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nDarius Washington of ''The Fandom Post'' reviewed the Discotek edition of ''Mamo''. He described the structure of the film's story as \"haphazard\" and \"a bit hard to get into\", while praising the collection of \"educational\" extras and different English dubs on Discotek's release. In conclusion, Washington felt that \"the film itself is decent\", but is more suited for learning about anime history than for entertainment value.

Praising Discotek Media's \"fancy\" DVD release, he described the film as \"often held up as ''the'' example of how to write a ''Lupin'' story - it has unfolding drama within the core cast, a truly threatening villain, and an unusual dedication to mature storytelling.

Toole particularly lauded S\u014dji Yoshikawa's direction (likening the director's affinity for bizarre images and situations to the works of [[Werner Herzog]]), as well as the film's cartoonish but detailed animation and design work, characterization and humour. He also gave praise to all four English language tracks of the film, particularly the Toho dub, and noted the film's relevance to real-world events of the time (including the [[Cold War]], the [[Watergate Scandal]], the publication of [[David Rorvik]]'s novel ''In his Image: The Cloning of a Man'' and the birth of [[Louise Brown]]). Toole concludes his essay by stating that \"[m]ore than 30 years after its debut, [''The Mystery of Mamo''], with its heady mix of globe-trotting action, raciness, wild comedy, and hot jazz-funk music, is the original ''Lupin'', the real deal.

Directed by [[S\u014dji Yoshikawa]] from a screenplay by Yoshikawa and cult [[pink film]] [[screenwriter]] [[Atsushi Yamatoya]], the film was produced by animation studio [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] and distributed by [[Toho]]. The film's plot follows master thief [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]], who attempts to foil Mamo - a wealthy and powerful recluse seeking [[immortality]] - while trying to win the affections of his rival and would-be lover, [[Fujiko Mine]].\n\nSince its original Japanese release, the film has been licensed to several companies for release in North America and Europe, with four different English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of the film being produced in that time. In 2013, North American distributor [[Discotek Media]] released the film on a DVD containing all four English dubs, as well as extensive [[liner notes]] and essays about the film and its production.\n\nFinancially successful upon release, ''The Mystery of Mamo'' has continued to polarize critics and fans of the ''Lupin'' franchise, especially in English-speaking markets. Praise for the film tends to be aimed at its originality and faithfulness to the manga, and criticism usually focuses on the execution of the [[third act]]. The English dubs, though varying widely in terms of their production quality, [[Editing of anime in distribution|interpretation of the dialogue]] and [[voice acting]], have frequently been singled out for praise.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\n[[Koichi Zenigata|Inspector Zenigata]] travels to [[Castle Dracula]] to confirm the [[hanging|execution]] of his longtime nemesis [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]]; the body he finds is a decoy that is being used by the real Lupin to flee from the castle. Zenigata travels to [[Egypt]], believing that Lupin will raid the [[Giza Necropolis]] based on prior thefts of [[immortality]]-granting objects. His prediction proves accurate, but Lupin and his colleagues [[Daisuke Jigen]] and [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]] flee with the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. The Stone was requested by Lupin's would-be lover, [[Fujiko Mine]], who, having agreed to obtain the Stone for a mysterious client, steals it from Lupin in [[Paris]]. The benefactor, who calls himself Mamo, discovers that the Stone is a fake made by Lupin.\n\nIn response, Lupin's gang is attacked by Mamo's forces before finding their hideout destroyed by his henchman, Flinch. Jigen and Goemon blame the hideout's destruction on Fujiko, before quarrelling between themselves; Lupin calms the others by promising to abandon his desires for Fujiko. With nowhere else to go, they travel toward the [[Atlantic Ocean|ocean]] before finding a house with food and water. A wounded Fujiko comes for Lupin, forcing him to go against his promise and causing Jigen and Goemon to abandon them. Fujiko drugs Lupin before Flinch arrives to take them to Mamo. Jigen later returns to find Flinch's plane taking off, but retrieves a clue to its destination. He and Goemon are later interrogated about Mamo by [[Federal government of the United States|American]] [[Special agent|agents]], but are released when they are unable to answer their questions. During the inquiry, they decipher Fujiko's clue, leading them to Mamo's [[Caribbean]] island.\n\nMamo, a mysterious billionaire officially known as Howard Lockewood, tells Lupin that he manipulated him into stealing the Stone as a test, as he is considering granting him and Fujiko immortality in admiration of his skills and her beauty. Lupin, however, is more interested in the Stone, and searches Mamo's island for it. After retrieving the Stone, he and Fujiko are chased by Mamo's henchmen until they stumble across Mamo's lair. Mamo deems Lupin unworthy of eternal life and attempts to visualize his perverted nature to Fujiko, but she refuses to abandon him. The [[United States Air Force|USAF]] attacks the base, having tracked Jigen and Goemon to the island. Jigen rescues Lupin and Fujiko and seemingly kills Mamo in a shootout, while Goemon duels with Flinch. The altercation damages Goemon's sword, the ''Zantetsuken'', causing him to leave for training purposes.\n\nLupin, Fujiko and Jigen travel to [[Colombia]], where Lupin theorizes that Mamo may have gained eternal life by continuously [[cloning]] himself. They are thrust into a vision by Mamo, who reveals that his cloning technique has kept him alive for ten thousand years, and that he is responsible for virtually every major event in [[human history]]. Mamo also explains that he cloned Lupin. He then appears in person to reclaim Fujiko, and a distraught Lupin challenges him to perform a [[miracle]]. Mamo responds by setting off an [[earthquake]] through the destruction of a [[nuclear power station]].\n\nInside a temple, Mamo explains to Fujiko that his cloning technique has never been perfected, and that he has degenerated from his original form as a result. He decides that he and Fujiko must repopulate the Earth, and convinces her to push a button to launch [[nuclear missiles]] to [[genocide|achieve this end]]. Lupin arrives, and reveals that he rigged the missiles to explode before they could launch. Frustrated, Mamo takes Fujiko with him to a [[launching pad]] and fends Lupin off with lasers. Lupin uses the tip of Goemon's sword (given to him by Jigen earlier) to deflect the lasers, incinerating Mamo.\n\nA [[Spacecraft|rocketship]] emerges, containing a giant brain that reveals itself to be the original Mamo. Lupin realizes that Mamo had controlled his clones resembling his body just as the rocket launches into space. Lupin and Fujiko escape the rocket's trajectory, but not before Lupin plants an explosive on it. The glass shatters, and Mamo's brain drifts toward the [[sun]]. Lupin finds Fujiko in the rubble, where he is captured by Zenigata. Fujiko offers to help Lupin, but the Americans launch a missile attack on Mamo's base. Fujiko is rescued by Jigen, while Lupin and Zenigata, handcuffed together, escape on foot.\n\n==Full cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character name\n! Japanese voice actor\n!

Due to an increased popularity of [[Lupin The Third Part I|the first series]], staff who had worked on that series were assembled to make the film. [[Yasuo Otsuka]], who was animation director and character designer on that series, supervised the film's production. [[S\u014dji Yoshikawa]], who storyboarded the first and last episodes of the first series, acted as director and co-writer of the screenplay. [[Atsushi Yamatoya]], a writer and director of [[pink film]]s who had written two episodes of the first series (and later the third animated ''Lupin'' film, ''[[Legend of the Gold of Babylon]]''), also contributed to the script.<ref>{{cite AV Media |title=Lupin The 3rd: The Complete First TV Series (Disc 1) |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |people=Reed Nelson |medium=DVD|at= Episode 2 Liner notes}}</ref> Yuzo Aoki, a key animator for episodes 11 and 23 of the first series, was responsible for the angular, Monkey Punch-esque character designs seen in the film (he would later become noted for such work on [[List of Lupin III Part III episodes|''Lupin III Part III'']] and ''Legend of the Gold of Babylon'').<ref>{{cite AV Media |title=Lupin The 3rd: The Complete First TV Series (Disc 2) |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |people=Reed Nelson |medium=DVD|at= Episode 11 Liner notes}}</ref> [[Tsutomu Shibayama]], who was the character designer for the [[Lupin the Third: Pilot Film|1969 ''Pilot Film'']] that had preceded the original series, was responsible for the layout. A relative newcomer in the film's production team was composer [[Yuji Ohno]], who had provided the score for the second series. The main cast of the second series also resprised their roles for the film.<ref name=\"program\">{{cite AV media |work=The Mystery of Mamo | title=Original Movie Program Translation |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |year=2012 }}</ref>\n\n''Mamo'' was [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]]'s first full-length feature production. The movie was given a budget of 500 million yen, comparable to major live action films at the time and unheard of for an animated production. Production lasted for 15 months and involved 1,315 members of staff. The storyboard was 575 pages. 62,000 cel sheets were used in the animation, compared to 5,000 cels used in an average half-hour TV animation. Oversized cels were used and filmed in a modified [[VistaVision]] process known as \"Anime Vision\", which allowed for a brighter and sharper picture for projection in theaters compared to a TV production. 18,000 reference images were used for background and mechanical research, and 196 individual character drawings were created.<ref name=\"program\"/>\n\nMamo's name is taken from the villain Kyousuke Mamo who had appeared in the manga and first TV series. His physical design was inspired by Swan, [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]' character in the 1974 musical horror film ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'', and represents a monster who is both a boy and an old man at the same time. Similarly, the characters of [[Special Assistant to the President|Special Presidential Aide]] Stuckey and Special Agent Gordon are parodies of [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[G. Gordon Liddy]] respectively.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Mystery of Mamo |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |year=2012 |type=Liner Notes |last=Nelson |first=Reed}}</ref><ref name=\"mamo\">{{cite AV media |work=The Mystery of Mamo | title=Why Mamo Matters by Mike Toole |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |year=2012 |last=Toole |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Mystery of Mamo'' was originally released in Japan on December 16, 1978 as ''Lupin III''.<ref name=animehistorydates>{{cite book |title=\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u5168\u6b74\u53f2\u5b8c\u5168\u7248 |publisher=[[Futabasha]] |isbn=978-4-575-30406-0 |date=April 1, 2012|page=288}}</ref> The film was a financial success, earning 950 million yen and making it the ninth-highest grossing Japanese film of the 1979 film season.<ref>{{cite book |title=\u30ad\u30cd\u30de\u65ec\u5831\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30c6\u30f3\u5168\u53f21946-1996 |publisher=[[Kinema Junpo]] |date=1997|page=224}}</ref> Footage from the film, along with scenes from ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', was used [[Stern (game company)|Stern Electronics]] (under license from TMS) to make the ''[[Dragon's Lair]]''-style [[laserdisc video game]] ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx|title=The Castle of Cagliostro- Hayao Miyazaki's First (And Most Enjoyable) Movie|last=Surat|first=Daryl|publisher=Otaku USA|accessdate=June 1, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018154933/http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx|archivedate=October 18, 2014}}</ref> By the mid-1980s, TMS re-titled the film in Japan as ''Lupin III: Lupin vs. the Clone'', while English-speaking fans had begun referring to the film as ''The Mystery of Mamo'', to distinguish it from the two TV series and ''The Castle of Cagliostro''.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nA TV broadcast of the film on March 28, 2014 on [[Nippon Television|NTV]] attained an audience share of 11.2% in the [[Kant\u014d region]] of Japan.

Additionally, he criticised the \"lack of cohesion\" and \"unbroken string of [[jump cut]]s and [[deux ex machina]]s\" throughout the film. Reflecting on the positives of the film, Lineberger highlights the characters of Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko as being more interesting than either Lupin or Mamo. He also credits the movie for tackling interesting concepts such as [[cloning]], [[personal identity]], [[love]] and [[honour]], despite the way they are presented. In summary, he suggests that ''Lupin'' fans will find a more ambitious story in this film than the television episodes if they can accept some flaws. He recommends people who are not ''Lupin'' fans to watch ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/lupin3secretmamo.php |title=Lupin III: The Secret Of Mamo |last=Lineberger |first=Rob |publisher=[[DVD Verdict]] |date=January 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419233220/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/lupin3secretmamo.php |archivedate=April 19, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nDarius Washington of ''The Fandom Post'' reviewed the Discotek edition of ''Mamo''.

Praising Discotek Media's \"fancy\" DVD release, he described the film as \"often held up as ''the'' example of how to write a ''Lupin'' story - it has unfolding drama within the core cast, a truly threatening villain, and an unusual dedication to mature storytelling.

Toole particularly lauded S\u014dji Yoshikawa's direction (likening the director's affinity for bizarre images and situations to the works of [[Werner Herzog]]), as well as the film's cartoonish but detailed animation and design work, characterization and humour. He also gave praise to all four English language tracks of the film, particularly the Toho dub, and noted the film's relevance to real-world events of the time (including the [[Cold War]], the [[Watergate Scandal]], the publication of [[David Rorvik]]'s novel ''In his Image: The Cloning of a Man'' and the birth of [[Louise Brown]]). Toole concludes his essay by stating that \"[m]ore than 30 years after its debut, [''The Mystery of Mamo''], with its heady mix of globe-trotting action, raciness, wild comedy, and hot jazz-funk music, is the original ''Lupin'', the real deal.
