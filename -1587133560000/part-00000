Further, recognizing the challenge of putting three meals on the table per day by the constituents, Mushimba started a farmer input support program that in its first year supported local farmers with farming inputs from fertilizers to seeds totaling k130,000 ($13,000); all these programs were funded from personal funds from Mushimba himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/5391|title=Brian  Mushimba  {{!}} National Assembly of Zambia|website=www.parliament.gov.zm|accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMushimba was born in [[Mufulira, Zambia]] on 7 November 1974. Being one of the best student at primary and junior secondary schools in [[mufulira]], he was admitted and completed his secondary education, 'O' levels and 'A' levels, at the prestigious [[Mpelembe Secondary School]], a boarding school that boasted as the best high school in Zambia in 1993 and 1996 respectively. Continuing his academic brilliance and upon successful completion of his 'A' levels (Form Six), he proceeded on the academic scholarship by the Zambian Government to the [[University of Arizona]] in the [[United States]] where he earned an undergraduate degree in engineering. He subsequently received graduate degrees in business administration while in USA before returning to his home country. In [[Zambia]], he completed his [[PhD]] in [[Environmental Engineering]] from the [[University of Zambia]]. His doctoral dissertation was on \" Viability of carbon-neutral energy sources in pyroprocesses; waste to energy conversion.\"\n\n==Career==\nUpon graduating from the [[University of Arizona]], Mushimba joined [[Siemens]] Power Generation in [[Atlanta, Georgia, USA]] as an electrical controls engineer. He subsequently worked for [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] in Atlanta before being transferred to Zambia. Between 2012 and 2013, he would work for [[Pratt & Whitney]] Power Systems in [[East Hartford, Connecticut]] as their Product Line Manager for the [[Aeroderivative]] [[Gas Turbine]] Business line. He then joined [[Eskom]], the state electricity utility of [[South Africa]], as their Technical Director and worked there up to 2016 before [[Statkraft]], the state electricity utility of [[Norway]], operating as [[SN Power]], hired him as their Regional Executive for the African market. He would only stay in this role for a few months as he transitioned into public office by standing and winning a parliamentary seat for his childhood community of [[Kankoyo (constituency)|Kankoyo]] in the 2016 general elections. He subsequently was appointed into [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]].\n\n==Personal life==\nMushimba is of the Christian faith.

Further, recognizing the challenge of putting three meals on the table per day by the constituents, Mushimba started a farmer input support program that in its first year supported local farmers with farming inputs from fertilizers to seeds totaling k130,000 ($13,000); all these programs were funded from personal funds from Mushimba himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/5391|title=Brian  Mushimba  {{!}} National Assembly of Zambia|website=www.parliament.gov.zm|accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMushimba was born in [[Mufulira, Zambia]] on 7 November 1974. Being one of the best student at primary and junior secondary schools in [[mufulira]], he was admitted and completed his secondary education, 'O' levels and 'A' levels, at the prestigious [[Mpelembe Secondary School]], a boarding school that boasted as the best high school in Zambia in 1993 and 1996 respectively. Continuing his academic brilliance and upon successful completion of his 'A' levels (Form Six), he proceeded on the academic scholarship by the Zambian Government to the [[University of Arizona]] in the [[United States]] where he earned an undergraduate degree in engineering. He subsequently received graduate degrees in business administration while in USA before returning to his home country. In [[Zambia]], he completed his [[PhD]] in [[Environmental Engineering]] from the [[University of Zambia]]. His doctoral dissertation was on \" Viability of carbon-neutral energy sources in pyroprocesses; waste to energy conversion.\"\n\n==Career==\nUpon graduating from the [[University of Arizona]], Mushimba joined [[Siemens]] Power Generation in [[Atlanta, Georgia, USA]] as an electrical controls engineer. He subsequently worked for [[Lafarge]] in Atlanta before being transferred to Zambia. Between 2012 and 2013, he would work for [[Pratt & Whitney]] Power Systems in [[East Hartford, Connecticut]] as their Product Line Manager for the [[Aeroderivative]] [[Gas Turbine]] Business line. He then joined [[Eskom]], the state electricity utility of [[South Africa]], as their Technical Director and worked there up to 2016 before [[Statkraft]], the state electricity utility of [[Norway]], operating as [[SN Power]], hired him as their Regional Executive for the African market. He would only stay in this role for a few months as he transitioned into public office by standing and winning a parliamentary seat for his childhood community of [[Kankoyo (constituency)|Kankoyo]] in the 2016 general elections. He subsequently was appointed into [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]].\n\n==Personal life==\nMushimba is of the Christian faith. He is married to Brenda Mushimba and they have two young sons.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Lungu Cabinet Navbox 2016}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mushimba, Brian}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Assembly (Zambia)]]\n[[Category:1974 births]]\n[[Category:Transport ministers of Zambia]]\n[[Category:Zambian engineers]]\n[[Category:People from Mufulira]]\n[[Category:University of Zambia alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Arizona alumni]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toLafarge(link changed toLafarge (company)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Mushimba"}

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded.

The party hoped that the majority of Zagreb voters would turn away from Bandi\u0107.

Bandi\u0107's statement was corroborated by several of his nearby colleagues; other journalists at the rear of the bus did not hear anything said by Bandi\u0107, due to noise inside the vehicle.

A court-appointed expert allowed the exchange at a price of 1,300 kuna per square meter (\u20ac185) for the Sesvete lot (located in the suburbs, outside the [[Zagreb bypass]]) and 2,300 kuna (\u20ac321) for the Maksimirska lot (located in the [[Maksimir]] district, several hundred meters from downtown). New experts considered the lot on Maksimirska Street to be more valuable than the lot in Sesvetski Kraljevec. Thus, a USKOK source testified that Bandi\u0107 made a deal damaging to the city budget.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded.

Bandi\u0107's statement was corroborated by several of his nearby colleagues; other journalists at the rear of the bus did not hear anything said by Bandi\u0107, due to noise inside the vehicle.

A court-appointed expert allowed the exchange at a price of 1,300 kuna per square meter (\u20ac185) for the Sesvete lot (located in the suburbs, outside the [[Zagreb bypass]]) and 2,300 kuna (\u20ac321) for the Maksimirska lot (located in the [[Maksimir]] district, several hundred meters from downtown). New experts considered the lot on Maksimirska Street to be more valuable than the lot in Sesvetski Kraljevec. Thus, a USKOK source testified that Bandi\u0107 made a deal damaging to the city budget.

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite in a different key and tempo than the first. It contains elements of [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would explore on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where his career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite in a different key and tempo than the first. It contains elements of [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would explore on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where his career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} According to Emily Barker of ''[[NME]]'', Bowie \"starved his body of all nutrients (besides [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]])\" during the song's recording.<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, saying \"I have only flashes of making it.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} Author David Buckley states that Bowie's only memory of the sessions was \"standing with [lead guitarist] [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]] riff in the same key throughout the opening of 'Station to Station'.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to enter, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is, according to [[Peter Doggett]], a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}}<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into what Alan Light of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calls a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\", which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song contains elements of [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before fading out using [[feedback]], which Doggett likens to \"disappearing into a tunnel\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years (1977\u20131979); Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the series of 14 images depicting [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]], each symbolising a stopping-point for [[prayer]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependent on cocaine, Page had become dependent on [[heroin]], which Pegg considered \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages and direct references, including to the 13th century Jewish mystical system known as the [[Kabbalah]] and [[gnosticism]].<ref name=\"Q97X\">{{cite book| last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> Bowie would later claim in 1997: \"All the references within [\"Station to Station\"] have to do with the Kabbalah.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Author [[Peter Doggett]] believes the main themes of the track are magic, the arts of legendary musicians, both real and fictitious, the Kabbalah's mythical account of progress from [[Keter|Kether]] to [[Malkuth]], love and cocaine.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett further argues: \"just as [the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' track] \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" offered a catalogue of avenues open to the inquisitive imagination of David Bowie circa 1971, so \"Station to Station\" present a more confused medley of the themes that were haunting his nightmares in the final weeks of 1975.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\nThe Duke introduces himself by saying \"the return of the Thin White Duke/throwing darts in lovers' eyes.\"<ref name=\"Needham Guardian\" /> Darts, or arrows, are interpreted to be a symbol of direction revealing the dynamic of the True Will.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett argues that other than the Thin White Duke, another duke was at the heart of the action: [[Prospero]], the Duke of [[Milan]] and protagonist of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} He writes that Prospero, like the Thin White Duke, is a \"master of magic\", who can control elements while \"lost in my [magic] circle\", as well as cast spells over \"lovers' eyes\" (mirroring throwing darts), as Prospero does with his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] and her lover [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] over the course of the play.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=285\u2013286}} Fixation with the English [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] is evident in such phrases as \"[[White Stains|white stains]]\", the name of a book of poetry by Crowley,{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=7}} who was previously mentioned by Bowie on \"Quicksand\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Once the song changes into the prog-disco section, the lyrics become brighter.

The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link].

Roosevelt's themes|other uses|Four Freedoms (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:FDR Memorial wall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Engraving of the Four Freedoms at the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nThe '''Four Freedoms''' were goals articulated by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on Monday, January 6, 1941.  In an address known as the [[s:The Four Freedoms speech|Four Freedoms speech]] (technically the '''1941 State of the Union address'''), he proposed four fundamental freedoms that people \"everywhere in the world\" ought to enjoy:\n\n# [[Freedom of speech]]\n# [[Freedom of worship]]\n# [[Freedom from want]]\n# [[Freedom from fear]]\n\nRoosevelt delivered his speech 11 months before the surprise Japanese attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|U.S. forces in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]] that caused the United States to declare war on Japan, December 8, 1941. The State of the Union speech before Congress was largely about the [[national security of the United States]] and the threat to other democracies from [[World War II|world war]] that was being waged across the continents in the eastern hemisphere. In the speech, he made a break with the tradition of [[United States non-interventionism]] that had long been held in the United States. He outlined the U.S. role in helping allies already engaged in warfare.\n\nIn that context, he summarized the values of democracy behind the bipartisan consensus on international involvement that existed at the time. A famous quote from the speech prefaces those values: \"As men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone.\" In the second half of the speech, he lists the benefits of democracy, which include economic opportunity, employment, social security, and the promise of \"adequate health care\". The first two freedoms, of speech and [[Freedom of religion|religion]], are protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] in the [[United States Constitution]]. His inclusion of the latter two freedoms went beyond the traditional Constitutional values protected by the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. Roosevelt endorsed a broader human [[Rights|right]] to [[Right to an adequate standard of living|economic security]] and anticipated what would become known decades later as the \"[[human security]]\" [[paradigm]] in [[social science]] and [[economic development]]. He also included the \"[[freedom from fear]]\" against national aggression and took it to the new [[United Nations]] he was setting up.\n\n==Historical context==\nIn the 1930s many Americans, arguing that the involvement in a World War I had been a mistake, were adamantly against continued intervention in European affairs.<ref name=\"Bodnar, John 2010\">Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 11</ref> With the Neutrality Acts established after 1935, U.S. law banned the sale of armaments to countries that were at war and placed restrictions on travel with belligerent vessels.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929\u20131945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 393\u201394</ref>\n\nWhen [[World War II]] began in September 1939, the neutrality laws were still in effect and ensured that no substantial support could be given to Britain and France. With the revision of the Neutrality Act in 1939, Roosevelt adopted a \"methods-short-of-war policy\" whereby supplies and armaments could be given to European Allies, provided no declaration of war could be made and no troops committed.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929\u20131945 (1999) 427\u2013434</ref> By December 1940, Europe was largely at the mercy of Adolf Hitler and Germany's Nazi regime. With Germany's defeat of France in June 1940, Britain and its overseas Empire stood alone against the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister of Britain, called for Roosevelt and the United States to supply them with armaments in order to continue with the war effort.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe [[1939 New York World's Fair]] had celebrated Four Freedoms - religion, speech, press, and assembly - and commissioned [[Leo Friedlander]] to create sculptures representing them. [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Fiorello La Guardia]] described the resulting statues as the \"heart of the fair\". Later Roosevelt would declare his own \"Four Essential Freedoms\" and call on [[Walter Russell]] to create a ''[[Four Freedoms Monument]]'' that was eventually dedicated at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7FD0Qfub9MC&pg=PP71&dq=%22norman+rockwell%22+%22freedom+of+speech%22+%22four+freedoms%22+%22Saturday+Evening+Post%22#v=onepage&q=%22norman%20rockwell%22%20%22freedom%20of%20speech%22%20%22four%20freedoms%22%20%22Saturday%20Evening%20Post%22&f=false|title=Liberty's Refuge: The Forgotten Freedom of Assembly|author=Inazu, John D.|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0300173154|pages=|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nThey also appeared on the reverse of the [[AM-lira]], the Allied Military Currency note issue that was issued in Italy during WWII, by the Americans, that was in effect occupation currency, guaranteed by the American dollar.\n\n==Declarations==\n{{listen\n|title=State of the Union (Four Freedoms) (January 6, 1941)\n|filename=FDR's 1941 State of the Union (Four Freedoms speech) Edit 1.ogg\n|description =[[Franklin D.

Roosevelt's hope was to provide a rationale for why the United States should abandon the isolationist policies that emerged from World War I.  In the address, Roosevelt critiqued Isolationism, saying: \"No realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion\u2013or even good business. Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. \"Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"<ref name=\"speech\">{{cite web|url=http://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/fdr-the-four-freedoms-speech-text/ |title=FDR, \"The Four Freedoms,\" Speech Text &#124; |publisher=Voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu |date=January 6, 1941 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe speech coincided with the introduction of the Lend-Lease Act, which promoted Roosevelt's plan to become the \"arsenal of democracy\"<ref>The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt (New York: Random House and Harper and Brothers, 1940) 633\u201344</ref>  and support the Allies (mainly the British) with much-needed supplies.<ref>, Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929\u20131945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 469</ref> Furthermore, the speech established what would become the ideological basis for America's involvement in World War II,  all framed in terms of individual rights and liberties that are the hallmark of American politics.<ref name=\"Bodnar, John 2010\"/>\n\nThe speech delivered by President Roosevelt incorporated the following text, known as the \"Four Freedoms\":<ref name=\"speech\"/>\n\n{{quote|\nIn the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.\n\nThe first is freedom of speech and expression\u2014everywhere in the world.\n\nThe second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way\u2014everywhere in the world.\n\nThe third is freedom from want\u2014which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants\u2014everywhere in the world.\n\nThe fourth is freedom from fear\u2014which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor\u2014anywhere in the world.\n\nThat is no vision of a distant millennium.\n\nIt is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation.\n\nThat kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.\n|Franklin D. Roosevelt, excerpted from the State of the Union Address to the Congress, January 6, 1941\n}}\n[[File:Four Freedoms Flag or United Nations Honour Flag ca 1943-1948.svg|thumb|220px|The four freedoms flag or \"[[United Nations Honor Flag]]\" ca. 1943\u20131948]]\n\nThe declaration of the Four Freedoms as a justification for war would resonate through the remainder of the war, and for decades longer as a frame of remembrance.<ref name=\"Bodnar, John 2010\"/> The Freedoms became the staple of America's war aims and the center of all attempts to rally public support for the war. With the creation of the Office of War Information (1942), as well as the famous paintings by Norman Rockwell, the Freedoms were advertised as values central to American life and examples of American exceptionalism.<ref>Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 12</ref>\n\n==Opposition==\n\nThe Four Freedoms Speech was popular, and the goals were influential in postwar politics. However, in 1941 the speech received heavy criticism from anti-war elements.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929-1945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 470\u201376</ref> Critics argued that the Four Freedoms were simply a charter for Roosevelt's [[New Deal]], social reforms that had already created sharp divisions within Congress. Conservatives who opposed social programs and increased government intervention argued against Roosevelt's attempt to justify and depict the war as necessary for the defense of lofty goals.<ref>Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 14\u201315</ref>\n\nWhile the Freedoms did become a forceful aspect of American thought on the war, they were never the exclusive justification for the war. Polls and surveys conducted by the [[United States Office of War Information]] (OWI) revealed that \"self-defense\", and vengeance for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] were still the most prevalent reasons for war.<ref>Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 14</ref>\n\n==Limitations==\n\nIn a 1942 radio address, President Roosevelt declared the Four Freedoms embodied \"rights of men of every creed and every race, wherever they live.\"<ref>Foner, Eric, The Story of American Freedom. (New York: W.W. Norton, 1998) 223</ref>\n\nOn February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt authorized [[Japanese American internment]] and [[internment of Italian Americans]] with [[Executive Order 9066]], which allowed local military commanders to designate \"military areas\" as \"exclusion zones,\" from which \"any or all persons may be excluded.\" This power was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the entire Pacific coast, including all of California and much of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, except for those in internment camps.<ref name=korematsu_roberts>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=323&page=214 ''Korematsu v. the United States''] dissent by Justice [[Owen Josephus Roberts]], reproduced at findlaw.com.

(Social Service Review 82.3, 2008) 448</ref>\n\n==United Nations==\nThe concept of the Four Freedoms became part of the personal mission undertaken by [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] regarding her inspiration behind the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], General Assembly Resolution 217A. Indeed, these Four Freedoms were explicitly incorporated into the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which reads, \"''Whereas'' disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy the freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed the highest aspiration of the common people....\"<ref>{{cite book|authors=White, E.B. & Lerner, Max & Cowley, Malcolm & Niebuhr, Reinhold |title= The United Nations Fight for the Four Freedoms|url=https://archive.org/details/TheUnitedNationsFightForTheFourFreedoms_728 |asin=B003HKRK80|location = Washington, D.C.|publisher= Government Printing Office|date= 1942 }}</ref>\n\n==Disarmament==\nFDR called for \"a world-wide reduction of armaments\" as a goal for \"the future days, which we seek to make secure\" but one that was \"attainable in our own time and generation.\" More immediately, though, he called for a massive build-up of U.S. arms production:\n\n{{quote|Every realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment being directly assailed in every part of the world... The need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily\u2014almost exclusively\u2014to meeting this foreign peril. ...[T]he immediate need is a swift and driving increase in our armament production. ...I also ask this Congress for authority and for funds sufficient to manufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds, to be turned over to those nations which are now in actual war with aggressor nations. ...Let us say to the democracies...\n|Franklin D.

Roosevelt]] on Monday, January 6, 1941.  In an address known as the [[s:The Four Freedoms speech|Four Freedoms speech]] (technically the '''1941 State of the Union address'''), he proposed four fundamental freedoms that people \"everywhere in the world\" ought to enjoy:\n\n# [[Freedom of speech]]\n# [[Freedom of worship]]\n# [[Freedom from want]]\n# [[Freedom from fear]]\n\nRoosevelt delivered his speech 11 months before the surprise Japanese attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|U.S. forces in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]] that caused the United States to declare war on Japan, December 8, 1941. The State of the Union speech before Congress was largely about the [[national security of the United States]] and the threat to other democracies from [[World War II|world war]] that was being waged across the continents in the eastern hemisphere. In the speech, he made a break with the tradition of [[United States non-interventionism]] that had long been held in the United States. He outlined the U.S. role in helping allies already engaged in warfare.\n\nIn that context, he summarized the values of democracy behind the bipartisan consensus on international involvement that existed at the time. A famous quote from the speech prefaces those values: \"As men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone.\" In the second half of the speech, he lists the benefits of democracy, which include economic opportunity, employment, social security, and the promise of \"adequate health care\". The first two freedoms, of speech and [[Freedom of religion|religion]], are protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] in the [[United States Constitution]]. His inclusion of the latter two freedoms went beyond the traditional Constitutional values protected by the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. Roosevelt endorsed a broader human [[Rights|right]] to [[Right to an adequate standard of living|economic security]] and anticipated what would become known decades later as the \"[[human security]]\" [[paradigm]] in [[social science]] and [[economic development]]. He also included the \"[[freedom from fear]]\" against national aggression and took it to the new [[United Nations]] he was setting up.\n\n==Historical context==\nIn the 1930s many Americans, arguing that the involvement in World War I had been a mistake, were adamantly against continued intervention in European affairs.<ref name=\"Bodnar, John 2010\">Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 11</ref> With the Neutrality Acts established after 1935, U.S. law banned the sale of armaments to countries that were at war and placed restrictions on travel with belligerent vessels.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929\u20131945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 393\u201394</ref>\n\nWhen [[World War II]] began in September 1939, the neutrality laws were still in effect, and ensured that no substantial support could be given to Britain and France. With the revision of the Neutrality Act in 1939, Roosevelt adopted a \"methods-short-of-war policy\" whereby supplies and armaments could be given to European Allies, provided no declaration of war could be made and no troops committed.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929\u20131945 (1999) 427\u2013434</ref> By December 1940, Europe was largely at the mercy of Adolf Hitler and Germany's Nazi regime. With Germany's defeat of France in June 1940, Britain and its overseas Empire stood alone against the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister of Britain, called for Roosevelt and the United States to supply them with armaments in order to continue with the war effort.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe [[1939 New York World's Fair]] had celebrated Four Freedoms - religion, speech, press and assembly - and commissioned [[Leo Friedlander]] to create sculptures representing them. [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Fiorello La Guardia]] described the resulting statues as the \"heart of the fair\". Later Roosevelt would declare his own \"Four Essential Freedoms\" and call on [[Walter Russell]] to create a ''[[Four Freedoms Monument]]'' that was eventually dedicated at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7FD0Qfub9MC&pg=PP71&dq=%22norman+rockwell%22+%22freedom+of+speech%22+%22four+freedoms%22+%22Saturday+Evening+Post%22#v=onepage&q=%22norman%20rockwell%22%20%22freedom%20of%20speech%22%20%22four%20freedoms%22%20%22Saturday%20Evening%20Post%22&f=false|title=Liberty's Refuge: The Forgotten Freedom of Assembly|author=Inazu, John D.|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0300173154|pages=|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nThey also appeared on the reverse of the [[AM-lira]], the Allied Military Currency note issue that was issued in Italy during WWII, by the Americans, that was in effect occupation currency, guaranteed by the American dollar.\n\n==Declarations==\n{{listen\n|title=State of the Union (Four Freedoms) (January 6, 1941)\n|filename=FDR's 1941 State of the Union (Four Freedoms speech) Edit 1.ogg\n|description =[[Franklin D.

Roosevelt's hope was to provide a rationale for why the United States should abandon the isolationist policies that emerged from World War I.  In the address, Roosevelt critiqued Isolationism, saying: \"No realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion\u2013or even good business. Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. \"Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"<ref name=\"speech\">{{cite web|url=http://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/fdr-the-four-freedoms-speech-text/ |title=FDR, \"The Four Freedoms,\" Speech Text &#124; |publisher=Voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu |date=January 6, 1941 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe speech coincided with the introduction of the Lend-Lease Act, which promoted Roosevelt's plan to become the \"arsenal of democracy\"<ref>The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt (New York: Random House and Harper and Brothers, 1940) 633\u201344</ref>  and support the Allies (mainly the British) with much-needed supplies.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929\u20131945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 469</ref> Furthermore, the speech established what would become the ideological basis for America's involvement in World War II,  all framed in terms of individual rights and liberties that are the hallmark of American politics.<ref name=\"Bodnar, John 2010\"/>\n\nThe speech delivered by President Roosevelt incorporated the following text, known as the \"Four Freedoms\":<ref name=\"speech\"/>\n\n{{quote|\nIn the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.\n\nThe first is freedom of speech and expression\u2014everywhere in the world.\n\nThe second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way\u2014everywhere in the world.\n\nThe third is freedom from want\u2014which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants\u2014everywhere in the world.\n\nThe fourth is freedom from fear\u2014which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor\u2014anywhere in the world.\n\nThat is no vision of a distant millennium.\n\nIt is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation.\n\nThat kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.\n|Franklin D. Roosevelt, excerpted from the State of the Union Address to the Congress, January 6, 1941\n}}\n[[File:Four Freedoms Flag or United Nations Honour Flag ca 1943-1948.svg|thumb|220px|The four freedoms flag or \"[[United Nations Honor Flag]]\" ca. 1943\u20131948]]\n\nThe declaration of the Four Freedoms as a justification for war would resonate through the remainder of the war, and for decades longer as a frame of remembrance.<ref name=\"Bodnar, John 2010\"/> The Freedoms became the staple of America's war aims, and the center of all attempts to rally public support for the war. With the creation of the Office of War Information (1942), as well as the famous paintings by Norman Rockwell, the Freedoms were advertised as values central to American life and examples of American exceptionalism.<ref>Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 12</ref>\n\n==Opposition==\n\nThe Four Freedoms Speech was popular, and the goals were influential in the postwar politics. However, in 1941 the speech received heavy criticism from anti-war elements.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929-1945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 470\u201376</ref> Critics argued that the Four Freedoms were simply a charter for Roosevelt's [[New Deal]], social reforms that had already created sharp divisions within Congress. Conservatives who opposed social programs and increased government intervention argued against Roosevelt's attempt to justify and depict the war as necessary for the defense of lofty goals.<ref>Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 14\u201315</ref>\n\nWhile the Freedoms did become a forceful aspect of American thought on the war, they were never the exclusive justification for the war. Polls and surveys conducted by the [[United States Office of War Information]] (OWI) revealed that \"self-defense\", and vengeance for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] were still the most prevalent reasons for war.<ref>Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 14</ref>\n\n==Limitations==\n\nIn a 1942 radio address, President Roosevelt declared the Four Freedoms embodied \"rights of men of every creed and every race, wherever they live.\"<ref>Foner, Eric, The Story of American Freedom. (New York: W.W. Norton, 1998) 223</ref>\n\nOn February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt authorized [[Japanese American internment]] and [[internment of Italian Americans]] with [[Executive Order 9066]], which allowed local military commanders to designate \"military areas\" as \"exclusion zones,\" from which \"any or all persons may be excluded.\" This power was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the entire Pacific coast, including all of California and much of Oregon, Washington and Arizona, except for those in internment camps.<ref name=korematsu_roberts>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=323&page=214 ''Korematsu v.
