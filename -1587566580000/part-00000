There, he faced Russian fighter Yurik Davtyan and won by decision. Later on, he entered the 2015 THAI FIGHT 72.5kg tournament. In the tournament semifinals, Boughanem defeated Rungrawee P.K. Saenchaimuaythaigym at THAI FIGHT RPCA on November 21, 2015. On December 31, 2015, he defeated [[Sudsakorn Sor Klinmee]] at THAI FIGHT Count Down to win the 2015 THAI FIGHT 72.5kg tournament and capture his first THAI FIGHT title. \n\nOn June 24, 2016, Youssef Boughanem defeated [[Armen Petrosyan]] via three-decision in [[Monte Carlo]] to win the [[World Association of Kickboxing Organizations|WAKO]] Pro 71.8kg Championship.\n\nOn August 31, 2016, he defeated Kompetch Lookprabat by fourth-round knockout to capture the [[Rajadamnern Stadium]] middleweight championship.

Arlington College was established as a private school for primary through secondary level students, equivalent to the modern 1st to 10th grades. At the time, the public school system in the city of Arlington was underfunded and understaffed.<ref name=\"DenmanJoyner\">Clarence P.

In the first few years, between 75 and 150 students were enrolled in the college. The public school began to rent space at Arlington College, and was eventually sold to the city in 1900. The public school building became so unsafe that all of the space in Arlington College was rented for the 1901\u20131902 school year until the creation of the Arlington Independent School District in 1902. Although the public education system was set to improve, Arlington College was closed and the property was sold to James McCoy Carlisle.\n\n[[File:Carlisle Military Academy, 1911.jpg|thumb|Bird's-eye painting of Carlisle Military Academy, 1911]]\nCarlisle was already established as a respected educator in the North Texas region, and he opened the '''Carlisle Military Academy''' in the fall of 1902. His program consisted of a balance between course work and military training. Enrollment increased to 150 students by 1905, and he began a large expansion of the campus. Baseball, football, basketball, and track teams were begun between 1904 and 1908. Around the same time, new barracks, a track, a gymnasium, and an indoor pool were built. The academy became known as one of the best at its level in the country.<ref name=\"Saxon\"/> Unfortunately, enrollment did not continue to increase with the expansion in facilities and Carlisle ran into serious financial problems.\n\nLawsuits for the mortgages on the property were filed in 1911, and Carlisle Military Academy was closed in 1913. In the fall of 1913, [[Henry Kirby Taylor]] moved from Missouri, where he was president of the Northwest State Teachers' College, to set up another military academy called '''Arlington Training School'''.<ref name=\"AJ1\">Arlington Journal, May May 16, 23, and August 1, 1913.</ref> He also was required to manage the finances and campus for the property owners. By the 1914\u20131915 school year, the campus contained 11 buildings on {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of land with 95 students enrolled.<ref name=\"ACatalog\">Arlington Training School Catalog, 1914\u20131915.</ref> The school was incorporated in 1915 in order to raise funds to make improvements to the existing buildings, but more financial problems arose and another series of lawsuits were filed. Taylor left Arlington, and the property owners hired John B. Dodson to establish a third military academy for the 1916\u20131917 school year called '''Arlington Military Academy'''. Enrollment was apparently very low,<ref name=\"Saxon\"/> and Arlington Military Academy closed after one year.[[File:1941 NTAC Science Building (Preston Hall).jpg|thumb|left|The Science Building at the North Texas Agricultural College in 1941.

After several years of efforts by President Frank Harrison to give students an opportunity to pick another theme, the UT System abolished rebels.<ref name=\"rebels\">Rebel Theme Controversy Collection, Box 1, Folders 3\u20136.</ref> The Maverick theme was adopted after a student vote in 1971.\n\n[[Wendell Nedderman]] served as acting president from 1972 to 1974 and president from 1974 to 1992. His tenure was characterized by increased growth and aspirations. In these years, the graduate student population increased from 936 to 4,200 and the overall university enrollment reached 25,135 students. Faculty research and publishing was emphasized along with the addition of doctoral programs in science, engineering, business, social work, and public and urban administration.<ref name=\"Saxon\"/> The Texas Select Committee on Higher Education recognized UT Arlington as an emerging research institution in 1987.<ref name=\"researchinst\">''The Shorthorn'', February 19, 1987.</ref>\nThe university experienced significant enrollment gains and rapid acceleration in research under the leadership of former presidents [[James D. Spaniolo]] and [[Vistasp Karbhari]]. The physical campus became much more residential in character and numerous major academic and student life buildings were added.\n\n==Campuses==\n===Main Campus surroundings===\nThe 420 acre main campus is at the southern edge of downtown [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], which also includes the largest branch of the public library, [[Seat of local government|City Hall]], [[Theatre Arlington]], Levitt Pavilion, [[Arlington Museum of Art]], churches, and numerous types of businesses just south of the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] line, around which the city was established.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=hja13|name=Arlington, Texas}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Barnett Shale]] formation sits below the campus and has earned the university millions of dollars from natural gas production since 2008. These funds are used for scholarships, faculty recruitment, and campus infrastructure upgrades.<ref>[https://www.uta.edu/ucomm/mediarelations/press/2009/01/Gas-check-received.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108094221/https://www.uta.edu/ucomm/mediarelations/press/2009/01/Gas-check-received.php |date=November 8, 2017 }} UT Arlington Receives First Natural Gas Royalty Check 2009-01-23, retrieved January 30, 2009</ref>\n\nAn unnamed branch of [[Johnson Creek (Texas)|Johnson Creek]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], runs along the southern portion of the campus. Cooper Street (which forms a part of [[Farm to Market Road 157]]) runs through the campus and provides access to Interstates [[Interstate 20 in Texas|20]] and [[Interstate 30]]. [[AT&T Stadium]], [[Globe Life Park]], Texas Live!, [[Six Flags Over Texas]], and [[International Bowling Museum]] are two miles to the northeast.\n\n===Main Campus architecture===\n[[File:UTAWaterfall.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A fountain on campus]]\nThe campus is organized on the city's former street grid. The topography generally slopes to the south and east to landscaped creeks. Decades of prodigious tree-planting and deliberate attention to landscape design have resulted in a shaded campus that is a pleasing pedestrian experience. Most streets in the campus core are closed and converted into pedestrian malls. The predominant east-west walk is the Second Street Mall, and the most important north-south passageway is Arlington Walk, extending from the Engineering Research Building on the north to the Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building on the south.\n\nThe oldest buildings on campus, Ransom Hall, Preston Hall, and College Hall are on the Second Street Mall and date to 1919.<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester. ''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 27.</ref> The architecture of these pre-World War II buildings is traditional. Later buildings from the 1960s, '70s, and '80s are typical of much campus construction of the period: modern, functional, and not especially noteworthy.<ref>Hamilton, Todd. \"Reimagined Introvert\". ''Texas Architect'', May/June 2008, page 60.</ref> An exception is the Architecture Building (designed by the respected Dallas firm, Pratt, Box, and Henderson)<ref>Pratt, James. \"Pratt and Box:  Brief History of a Firm\". ''Texas Architect'', July/Aug 2011, page 12.</ref> which forms an intimate and visit-worthy courtyard; the Nursing Building is noted for its unusual triangular shape. [[Texas Hall]] (George Dahl, architect) is a contributing building with its front portico, and [[Nedderman Hall]] is a contributing structure with its large atrium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.uta.edu/digitalgallery/items/show/23329|title=[Untitled] \u00b7 UTA Libraries|website=library.uta.edu|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}</ref> An admirable feature of the campus is the aesthetic consistency of limestone and UTA-blend brick. Metal panels have appeared in construction since the late 1990s.<ref>Hightower, J. Brantley. \"Quiet Standout\". ''Texas Architect'', Jan/Feb 2008, page 47.</ref>\n\nThe Central Library, designed by prominent 20th-century architect [[George Dahl]] (well known contributions include [[Art Deco]] buildings at [[Fair Park|Dallas Fair Park]]), forms one side of a Library Quad which may be regarded as the heart of campus.<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester. ''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 63.</ref> The Central Library and Texas Hall are examples of Mid-century Modern design. Attention to building design and the definition of outdoor spaces is evident with the [[postmodern]] additions of the Chemistry & Physics Building ([[Perkins + Will]]), Maverick Activities Center (Hughes Group with Page), Engineering Research Building ([[ZGF Architects]] with Page), [[College Park Center]] ([[HKS, Inc.]]), and Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building (ZGF with Page). The Chemistry & Physics Building contains one of the largest and most advanced [[planetarium]]s in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlington.org/listings/the-planetarium-at-ut-arlington/75/|title=The Planetarium at UT Arlington|website=www.arlington.org|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:CPC Dist.jpg|thumb|180px|College Park Center District]]\n\nThe north and east sides of campus have defined edges, being bounded by UTA Boulevard and Center Street, respectively. The south and west sides tend to blend more irregularly into the city. Cooper Street is a major artery that runs through campus and is partially depressed and spanned by three pedestrian bridges. Academic buildings erected over recent decades are on the east side of Cooper Street (defined by signage as \"east campus\").\n\nSurface parking is pushed to the outer edges of campus, particularly south of the academic core, resulting in students getting more exercise than they may want during peak periods. The West Campus Parking Garage and the College Park parking garages on the northwest and northeast campus corners, respectively, provide some relief and advance the master plan goal of reducing surface parking. Green spaces, or outdoor rooms, have increased in the 2000s most notably with the creation of the Greene Research Quad, the Green at College Park, a sunken courtyard at Davis Hall, Brazos Park, and the Davis Street west campus edge.

Arlington College was established as a private school for primary through secondary level students, equivalent to the modern 1st to 10th grades. At the time, the public school system in the city of Arlington was underfunded and understaffed.<ref name=\"DenmanJoyner\">Clarence P. Denman Collection, Box 1, Files 1\u201415, Special Collections Division, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries; Arista Joyner Papers, GA 149, Folder 6, Special Collections Division, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries.</ref> Local merchant Edward Emmett Rankin organized fellow citizens of the city to donate materials and land to build a schoolhouse where the modern campus is now located.<ref name=\"Saxon\">Saxon, G.D., \u201cTransitions: A Centennial History of the University of Texas at Arlington,\u201d The UTA Press, Arlington, Texas, 1995.</ref>\n\nRankin also convinced the two co-principals of the public school in Arlington, Lee Morgan Hammond and William Marshall Trimble, to invest in and hold the same positions at Arlington College. In the first few years, between 75 and 150 students were enrolled in the college. The public school began to rent space at Arlington College, and was eventually sold to the city in 1900. The public school building became so unsafe that all of the space in Arlington College was rented for the 1901\u20131902 school year until the creation of the Arlington Independent School District in 1902. Although the public education system was set to improve, Arlington College was closed and the property was sold to James McCoy Carlisle.\n\n[[File:Carlisle Military Academy, 1911.jpg|thumb|Bird's-eye painting of Carlisle Military Academy, 1911]]\nCarlisle was already established as a respected educator in the North Texas region, and he opened the '''Carlisle Military Academy''' in the fall of 1902. His program consisted of a balance between course work and military training. Enrollment increased to 150 students by 1905, and he began a large expansion of the campus. Baseball, football, basketball, and track teams were begun between 1904 and 1908. Around the same time, new barracks, a track, a gymnasium, and an indoor pool were built. The academy became known as one of the best at its level in the country.<ref name=\"Saxon\"/> Unfortunately, enrollment did not continue to increase with the expansion in facilities and Carlisle ran into serious financial problems.\n\nLawsuits for the mortgages on the property were filed in 1911, and Carlisle Military Academy was closed in 1913. In the fall of 1913, [[Henry Kirby Taylor]] moved from Missouri, where he was president of the Northwest State Teachers' College, to set up another military academy called '''Arlington Training School'''.<ref name=\"AJ1\">Arlington Journal, May May 16, 23, and August 1, 1913.</ref> He also was required to manage the finances and campus for the property owners. By the 1914\u20131915 school year, the campus contained 11 buildings on {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of land with 95 students enrolled.<ref name=\"ACatalog\">Arlington Training School Catalog, 1914\u20131915.</ref> The school was incorporated in 1915 in order to raise funds to make improvements to the existing buildings, but more financial problems arose and another series of lawsuits were filed. Taylor left Arlington, and the property owners hired John B. Dodson to establish a third military academy for the 1916\u20131917 school year called '''Arlington Military Academy'''. Enrollment was apparently very low,<ref name=\"Saxon\"/> and Arlington Military Academy closed after one year.[[File:1941 NTAC Science Building (Preston Hall).jpg|thumb|left|The Science Building at the North Texas Agricultural College in 1941.

By 1917, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in College Station was overcrowded and had only one branch campus, Prairie View A&M.

After several years of efforts by President Frank Harrison to give students an opportunity to pick another theme, the UT System abolished rebels.<ref name=\"rebels\">Rebel Theme Controversy Collection, Box 1, Folders 3\u20136.</ref> The Maverick theme was adopted after a student vote in 1971.\n\n[[Wendell Nedderman]] served as acting president from 1972 to 1974 and president from 1974 to 1992. His tenure was characterized by increased growth and aspirations. In these years, the graduate student population increased from 936 to 4,200 and the overall university enrollment reached 25,135 students. Faculty research and publishing was emphasized along with the addition of doctoral programs in science, engineering, business, social work, and public and urban administration.<ref name=\"Saxon\"/> The Texas Select Committee on Higher Education recognized UT Arlington as an emerging research institution in 1987.<ref name=\"researchinst\">''The Shorthorn'', February 19, 1987.</ref>\nThe university experienced significant enrollment gains and rapid acceleration in research under the leadership of former presidents [[James D. Spaniolo]] and [[Vistasp Karbhari]]. The physical campus became much more residential in character and numerous major academic and student life buildings were added.\n\n==Campuses==\n===Main Campus surroundings===\nThe 420 acre main campus is at the southern edge of downtown [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], which also includes the largest branch of the public library, [[Seat of local government|City Hall]], [[Theatre Arlington]], Levitt Pavilion, [[Arlington Museum of Art]], churches, and numerous types of businesses just south of the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] line, around which the city was established.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=hja13|name=Arlington, Texas}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Barnett Shale]] formation sits below the campus and has earned the university millions of dollars from natural gas production since 2008.

Cooper Street (which forms a part of [[Farm to Market Road 157]]) runs through the campus and provides access to Interstates [[Interstate 20 in Texas|20]] and [[Interstate 30]]. [[AT&T Stadium]], [[Globe Life Park]], Texas Live!, [[Six Flags Over Texas]], and [[International Bowling Museum]] are two miles to the northeast.\n\n===Main Campus architecture===\n[[File:UTAWaterfall.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A fountain on campus]]\nThe campus is organized on the city's former street grid. The topography generally slopes to the south and east to landscaped creeks. Decades of prodigious tree-planting and deliberate attention to landscape design have resulted in a shaded campus that is a pleasing pedestrian experience. Most streets in the campus core are closed and converted into pedestrian malls. The predominant east-west walk is the Second Street Mall, and the most important north-south passageway is Arlington Walk, extending from the Engineering Research Building on the north to the Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building on the south.\n\nThe oldest buildings on campus, Ransom Hall, Preston Hall, and College Hall are on the Second Street Mall and date to 1919.<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester. ''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 27.</ref> The architecture of these pre-World War II buildings is traditional. Later buildings from the 1960s, '70s, and '80s are typical of much campus construction of the period: modern, functional, and not especially noteworthy.<ref>Hamilton, Todd. \"Reimagined Introvert\". ''Texas Architect'', May/June 2008, page 60.</ref> An exception is the Architecture Building (designed by the respected Dallas firm, Pratt, Box, and Henderson)<ref>Pratt, James. \"Pratt and Box:  Brief History of a Firm\". ''Texas Architect'', July/Aug 2011, page 12.</ref> which forms an intimate and visit-worthy courtyard; the Nursing Building is noted for its unusual triangular shape. [[Texas Hall]] (George Dahl, architect) is a contributing building with its front portico, and [[Nedderman Hall]] is a contributing structure with its large atrium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.uta.edu/digitalgallery/items/show/23329|title=[Untitled] \u00b7 UTA Libraries|website=library.uta.edu|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}</ref> An admirable feature of the campus is the aesthetic consistency of limestone and UTA-blend brick. Metal panels have appeared in construction since the late 1990s.<ref>Hightower, J. Brantley. \"Quiet Standout\". ''Texas Architect'', Jan/Feb 2008, page 47.</ref>\n\nThe Central Library, designed by prominent 20th-century architect [[George Dahl]] (well known contributions include [[Art Deco]] buildings at [[Fair Park|Dallas Fair Park]]), forms one side of a Library Quad which may be regarded as the heart of campus.<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester. ''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 63.</ref> The Central Library and Texas Hall are examples of Mid-century Modern design. Attention to building design and the definition of outdoor spaces is evident with the [[postmodern]] additions of the Chemistry & Physics Building ([[Perkins + Will]]), Maverick Activities Center (Hughes Group with Page), Engineering Research Building ([[ZGF Architects]] with Page), [[College Park Center]] ([[HKS, Inc.]]), and Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building (ZGF with Page). The Chemistry & Physics Building contains one of the largest and most advanced [[planetarium]]s in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlington.org/listings/the-planetarium-at-ut-arlington/75/|title=The Planetarium at UT Arlington|website=www.arlington.org|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:CPC Dist.jpg|thumb|180px|College Park Center District]]\n\nThe north and east sides of campus have defined edges, being bounded by UTA Boulevard and Center Street, respectively. The south and west sides tend to blend more irregularly into the city. Cooper Street is a major artery that runs through campus and is partially depressed and spanned by three pedestrian bridges. Academic buildings erected over recent decades are on the east side of Cooper Street (defined by signage as \"east campus\").\n\nSurface parking is pushed to the outer edges of campus, particularly south of the academic core, resulting in students getting more exercise than they may want during peak periods. The West Campus Parking Garage and the College Park parking garages on the northwest and northeast campus corners, respectively, provide some relief and advance the master plan goal of reducing surface parking. Green spaces, or outdoor rooms, have increased in the 2000s most notably with the creation of the Greene Research Quad, the Green at College Park, a sunken courtyard at Davis Hall, Brazos Park, and the Davis Street west campus edge.

The name ''Aestia'' was a combination of the Latin ''Aesti'' and the locative suffix ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ia#Latin -ia]'', meaning \"Land of the Aesti\", who were most likely later [[Old Prussians]] or other [[Balts|Proto-Baltic]] people in and east of later [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]. The name drifted to denote people north of Old Prussians (i.e. \"east\" along the Baltic Sea shore), eventually settling down to denote only the modern (Finnic, i.e. non-Baltic) Estonian territory in the 12th and 13th century, as fixed by [[Henry of Livonia]].\n\n:The [[Vistula Lagoon]] was named ''Estmere'' in Old English, deriving from the Old Prussian ''A\u012bstinmari'' (\"Sea/Lagoon/Bay of the Aesti\") and is still called ''Aistmar\u0117s'' in Lithuanian.\n\n:The name ''Aesti'' possibly derives from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/austr%C4%85 *austr\u0105]'' (\"East\") as Proto-Balts lived east of Proto-Germanic people.

A similar name is used in [[Livonian language]] as ''\u0112stim\u014d''. The name variant ''Eest-'' was a development of [[Baltic German]] through the influence of [[Low German language|Low German]] ''Eestland''. The endonym ''Eesti'' was popularized during the [[Estonian National Awakening]], with great influence from the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Perno Postimees, Nr 1.png cover of the first issue] of the first Estonian daily newspaper ''[[P\u00e4rnu Postimees|Perno Postimees]]'' in 1857.\n\n::The older Estonian endonym ''Maavald'' is a combination of the words ''maa'' (\"land\", \"country\" or alternatively \"soil\") and ''vald'' (\"parish\"), meaning \"Land/Country Parish\".

This \"Greek\" word is assumed to be a cognate of Latin {{lang|la|vitulus}} (\"calf\"), although the different [[vowel length|length]] of the ''i'' is a problem. The Latin {{lang|la|vitulus}} is presumably derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*wet-'' meaning \"year\" (hence, a \"yearling\": a \"one-year-old calf\"), although the change of ''e'' to ''i'' is unexplained. The \"Greek\" word, however, is glossed as \"bull\", not \"calf\".

The land was known by its people the Nepa or Nepar, Newar, Newa, Newal etc., who still inhabit the area i.e. the valley of Kathmandu and its surroundings. The Newa people use \"Ra\" and \"La\" or \"Wa\" and \"Pa\" interchangeably, hence the different names mentioned above.\n:Some say it derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''n\u012bp\u0101laya'' (Sanskrit: \u0928\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0932\u092f), which means \"abode at the foot of mountain', referring to its proximity to the [[Himalayas]].

Austria itself has a ''Nieder\u00f6sterreich'' region ([[Lower Austria]]) that is quite mountainous, but derives its name from its downriver location.</ref> ''Neder'' or ''nether'' may simply have denoted the geographical characteristics of the land, both flat and down river. This may have applied to the singular form ''Nederland'', or ''Niderland''. It was a geographical description of low regions in the Germanic lands.

This \"Greek\" word is assumed to be a cognate of Latin {{lang|la|vitulus}} (\"calf\"), although the different [[vowel length|length]] of the ''i'' is a problem. The Latin {{lang|la|vitulus}} is presumably derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*wet-'' meaning \"year\" (hence, a \"yearling\": a \"one-year-old calf\"), although the change of ''e'' to ''i'' is unexplained. The \"Greek\" word, however, is glossed as \"bull\", not \"calf\".

{"title_page": "History of the Netherlands", "text_new": "{{short description|Dutch history}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{History of the Netherlands}}\n\nThe '''History of the grass\n''' is a history of seafaring people thriving on a lowland [[river delta]] on the [[North Sea]] in northwestern Europe. Records begin with the four centuries during which the region formed a militarized border zone of the [[Romans in the Netherlands|Roman]] Empire. This came under increasing pressure from [[Germanic peoples]] moving westwards. As Roman power collapsed and the [[Middle Ages]] began, three dominant [[Germanic peoples]] coalesced in the area, [[Frisians]] in the north and coastal areas, [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxons]] in the northeast, and the [[Franks]] in the south.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the descendants of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty came to dominate the area and then extended their rule to a large part of Western Europe. The region of the [[Netherlands]] therefore became part of [[Lower Lotharingia]] within the Frankish [[Holy Roman Empire]]. For several centuries, lordships such as [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[Zeeland]], [[Friesland]], [[Guelders]] and others held a changing patchwork of territories. There was no unified equivalent of the modern Netherlands.\n\nBy 1433, the [[Philip the Good|Duke of Burgundy]] had assumed control over most of the lowlands territories in Lower Lotharingia; he created the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] which included modern Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and a part of France.\n\nThe Catholic kings of Spain took strong measures against Protestantism, which polarised the peoples of present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The subsequent [[Dutch revolt]] led to splitting the Burgundian Netherlands into a Catholic French and Dutch-speaking \"[[Spanish Netherlands]]\" (approximately corresponding to modern Belgium and Luxembourg), and a northern \"[[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]\", which spoke Dutch and were predominantly Protestant with a Catholic minority. It became the modern Netherlands.\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], which had its zenith around 1667, there was a flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the [[List of people from the Dutch Golden Age#Science|sciences]]. A rich worldwide [[Dutch empire]] developed and the [[Dutch East India Company]] became one of the earliest and most important of national mercantile companies based on entrepreneurship and trade.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, the power, wealth and influence of the Netherlands declined. A series of wars with the more powerful [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|British]] and [[Franco-Dutch War|French]] neighbours weakened it. The UK seized the North American colony of [[New Amsterdam]], and renamed it \"New York\". There was growing unrest and [[Second Stadtholderless Period#Crisis and the Orangist revolution of 1747|conflict]] between the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangists]] and the [[Patriottentijd|Patriots]]. The French Revolution spilled over after 1789, and a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] was established in 1795\u20131806. Napoleon made it a satellite state, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1806\u20131810), and later simply a French imperial province.\n\nAfter the collapse of Napoleon in 1813\u201315, an expanded \"[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]\" was created with the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]] as monarchs, also ruling Belgium and Luxembourg. The King imposed unpopular Protestant reforms on Belgium, [[Belgian Revolution|which revolted in 1830]] and became independent in 1839. After an initially conservative period, following the introduction of the 1848 constitution; the country became a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[constitutional monarch]]. Modern-day Luxembourg became officially independent from the Netherlands in 1839, but a personal union remained until 1890. Since 1890, it is ruled by another branch of the House of Nassau.\n\nThe Netherlands was neutral during the [[First World War]], but during the [[Second World War]], it was invaded and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazis, including many collaborators, rounded up and killed almost all of the country's Jewish population. When the Dutch resistance increased, the Nazis cut off food supplies to much of the country, causing severe starvation in 1944\u201345. In 1942, the Dutch East Indies were conquered by Japan, but prior to this the Dutch destroyed the oil wells for which Japan was desperate. [[Indonesia]] proclaimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1945, followed by [[Suriname]] in 1975. The post-war years saw rapid economic recovery (helped by the American [[Marshall Plan]]), followed by the introduction of a [[welfare state]] during an era of peace and prosperity. The Netherlands formed a new economic alliance with Belgium and Luxembourg, the [[Benelux]], and all three became founding members of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In recent decades, the Dutch economy has been closely linked to that of Germany and is highly prosperous. The four countries adopted the Euro on 1 January 2002, along with eight other EU member states.\n\n{{History Benelux states}}\n\n== Prehistory (before 800 BC) ==\n\n===Historical changes to the landscape===\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by its constantly shifting, low-lying geography.\n{|cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"background: white\"\n|-\n|[[File:5500vc ex leg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 5500 BC]]\n|[[File:3850vc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 3850 BC]]\n|[[File:2750vc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 2750 BC]]\n|-\n|[[File:500vc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 500 BC]]\n|[[File:50nc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in AD 50]]\n|{{legend|#fff15d|beach ridges and dunes}}\n{{legend|#d2d500|tidal sand flats, tidal [[mudflat]]s, [[salt marsh]]es}}\n{{legend|#b56c03|peat marshes and [[floodplain]] silt areas<br>(including old river courses and riverbank breaches which have filled up with [[silt]] or [[peat]])}}\n{{legend|#a1aa95|Valleys of the major rivers (not covered with peat)}}\n{{legend|#fec901|River dunes ([[Pleistocene]] dunes)}}\n{{legend|#e3f4fc|open water (sea, lagoons, rivers)}}\n{{legend|#f1f6e2|Pleistocene landscape (> \u22126 m compared to [[Normaal Amsterdams Peil|NAP]])}}\n{{legend|#fffdee|Pleistocene landscape (\u22126 to 0 m; \u201320 to 0 ft)}}\n{{legend|#fff9c2|Pleistocene landscape (0\u201310 m; 0\u201333 ft)}}\n{{legend|#ffeba6|Pleistocene landscape (10\u201320 m; 33\u201366 ft)}}\n{{legend|#fec901|Pleistocene landscape (20\u201350 m; 66\u2013164 ft)}}\n{{legend|#e7a300|Pleistocene landscape (50\u2013100 m; 164\u2013328 ft)}}\n{{legend|#da600d|Pleistocene landscape (100\u2013200 m; 328\u2013656 ft)}}\n|}\n\n===Earliest groups of hunter-gatherers (before 5000 BC)===\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|180px|An oak figurine found in Willemstad, the Netherlands, dating from around 4500 BC.

To the west, the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game, including seals.\n\n===The arrival of farming (around 5000\u20134000 BC)===\nAgriculture arrived in the Netherlands somewhere around 5000 BC with the [[Linear Pottery culture]], who were probably central European farmers. Agriculture was practiced only on the [[loess]] [[plateau]] in the very south (southern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]), but even there it was not established permanently. Farms did not develop in the rest of the Netherlands.\n\nThere is also some evidence of small settlements in the rest of the country. These people made the switch to [[animal husbandry]] sometime between 4800 BC and 4500 BC. Dutch archaeologist Leendert Louwe Kooijmans wrote, \"It is becoming increasingly clear that the agricultural transformation of prehistoric communities was a purely indigenous process that took place very gradually.\"<ref name=\"Kooijmans1998\"/> This transformation took place as early as 4300 BC\u20134000 BC<ref>Volkskrant 24 August 2007 \n\"[http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/article455140.ece/Prehistorische_akker_gevonden_bij_Swifterbant Prehistoric agricultural field found in Swifterbant, 4300\u20134000 BC]\"</ref> and featured the introduction of grains in small quantities into a traditional broad-spectrum economy.<ref name=Raemakers>Raemakers, Daan. \"[http://redes.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2006/d.raemaekers/Raemaekers.pdf De spiegel van Swifterbant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410084410/http://redes.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2006/d.raemaekers/Raemaekers.pdf |date=10 April 2008 }}\", University of Groningen, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Funnelbeaker and other cultures (around 4000\u20133000 BC)===\n[[File:Grootste hunebed van Nederl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hunebed]] D27, the largest dolmen in the Netherlands, located near [[Borger, Netherlands|Borger]] in Drenthe.]]\n\nThe [[Funnelbeaker culture]] was a farming culture extending from Denmark through northern Germany into the northern Netherlands. In this period of Dutch prehistory, the first notable remains were erected: the [[dolmens]], large stone grave monuments. They are found in [[Drenthe]], and were probably built between 4100 BC and 3200 BC.\n\nTo the west, the [[Vlaardingen culture]] (around 2600 BC), an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the [[Neolithic]] period.\n\n===Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures (around 3000\u20132000 BC)===\nAround 2950 BCE there was a transition from the [[Funnelbeaker]] farming culture to the [[Corded Ware]] pastoralist culture, a large archeological horizon appearing in western and central Europe, that is associated with the advance of Indo-European languages. This transition was probably caused by developments{{clarify|date=April 2016}} in eastern Germany, and it occurred within two generations.<ref name=Bloemers>{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}, in J.H.F.

Adams (Eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures were not indigenous to the Netherlands but were pan-European in nature, extending across much of northern and central Europe.\n\nThe first evidence of the use of the wheel dates from this period, about 2400 BC. This culture also experimented with working with copper. Evidence of this, including stone anvils, copper knives, and a copper spearhead, was found on the [[Veluwe]]. Copper finds show that there was trade with other areas in Europe, as natural copper is not found in Dutch soil.\n\n===Bronze Age (around 2000\u2013800 BC)===\n[[File:Zwaard van Jutphaas.jpg|thumb|right|80px|A bronze ceremonial object (not a sword, but called the \"Sword of Jutphaas\"), dating from 1800 to 1500 BC and found south of [[Utrecht]].]]\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] probably started somewhere around 2000 BC and lasted until around 800 BC. The earliest [[bronze]] tools have been found in the grave of a Bronze Age individual called \"the smith of [[Wageningen]]\". More Bronze Age objects from later periods have been found in [[Epe, Netherlands|Epe]], [[Drouwen]] and elsewhere. Broken bronze objects found in [[Voorschoten]] were apparently destined for recycling. This indicates how valuable bronze was considered in the Bronze Age. Typical bronze objects from this period included knives, swords, axes, [[fibulae]] and bracelets.\n\n[[File:BronzAgeElp.png|thumb|left|Location of the [[Elp culture|Elp]] and [[Hilversum culture]]s in the Bronze Age.]]\nMost of the Bronze Age objects found in the Netherlands have been found in [[Drenthe]]. One item shows that trading networks during this period extended a far distance. Large bronze ''situlae'' (buckets) found in Drenthe were manufactured somewhere in eastern France or in [[Switzerland]]. They were used for mixing wine with water (a Roman/Greek custom). The many finds in Drenthe of rare and valuable objects, such as tin-bead necklaces, suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Netherlands in the Bronze Age.\n\nThe [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker cultures]] (2700\u20132100) locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100\u20131800). In the second millennium BC, the region was the boundary between the [[Atlantic Bronze Age|Atlantic]] and [[Nordic Bronze Age|Nordic]] horizons and was split into a northern and a southern region, roughly divided by the course of the [[Rhine]].\n\nIn the north, the [[Elp culture]] (c. 1800 to 800 BC)<ref>According to \"Het Archeologisch Basisregister\" (ABR), version 1.0 November 1992, [http://www.racm.nl/content/documenten%5Cabr%20website.pdf], ''Elp K\u00fcmmerkeramik'' is dated BRONSMA (early MBA) to BRONSL (LBA) and this has been standardized by \"De Rijksdienst voor Archeologie, Cultuurlandschap en Monumenten\" (RACM) as being at the period starting at 1800 BC and ending at 800 BC.{{Failed verification|date=October 2011}} {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> was a Bronze Age archaeological culture having [[earthenware]] pottery of low quality known as \"''K\u00fcmmerkeramik''\" (or \"''Grobkeramik''\") as a marker. The initial phase was characterized by [[tumulus|tumuli]] (1800\u20131200 BC) that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia, and were apparently related to the [[Tumulus culture]] (1600\u20131200 BC) in central Europe. This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring [[Urnfield]] ([[cremation]]) burial customs (1200\u2013800 BC). The southern region became dominated by the [[Hilversum culture]] (1800\u2013800), which apparently inherited the cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.\n\n== The pre-Roman period (800 BC \u2013 58 BC) ==\n\n===Iron Age===\n[[File:Boerderij IJzertijd Reijntjesveld.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of an [[Iron Age]] dwelling on the Reijntjesveld near [[Orvelte]] in [[Drenthe]].]]\n[[File:Verbogen Keltische zwaard.jpg|thumb|The original curved iron sword from the [[Vorstengraf (Oss)]], [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]].]]\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] brought a measure of prosperity to the people living in the area of the present-day Netherlands. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including [[bog iron]] extracted from the [[ore]] in [[peat bogs]] (''moeras ijzererts'') in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the [[Veluwe]] and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. [[Blacksmith|Smiths]] travelled from small settlement to settlement with [[bronze]] and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including axes, knives, pins, arrowheads and swords. Some evidence even suggests the making of [[Damascus steel]] swords using an advanced method of [[forging]] that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel.\n\nIn [[Oss]], a grave dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound 52 metres wide (and thus the largest of its kind in western Europe). Dubbed the \"king's grave\" (''[[Vorstengraf (Oss)]]''), it contained extraordinary objects, including an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.\n\nIn the centuries just before the arrival of the Romans, northern areas formerly occupied by the Elp culture emerged as the probably Germanic Harpstedt culture<ref name=Mallory>Mallory, J.P., ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology and Myth'', London: Thames & Hudson, 1989, p. 87.</ref> while the southern parts were influenced by the [[Hallstatt culture]] and assimilated into the Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]].

One of the most important is Caesar's own ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''. Two main tribes he described as living in what is now the Netherlands were the [[Menapii]], and the [[Eburones]], both in the south, which is where Caesar was active. He established the principle that the Rhine defined a natural boundary between [[Gaul]] and [[Germania magna]]. But the Rhine was not a strong border, and he made it clear that there was a part of Belgic Gaul where many of the local tribes (including the Eburones) were \"[[Germani cisrhenani]]\", or in other cases, of mixed origin.\n\nThe Menapii stretched from the south of Zeeland, through [[North Brabant]] (and possibly [[South Holland]]), into the southeast of [[Gelderland]]. In later Roman times their territory seems to have been divided or reduced, so that it became mainly contained in what is now western Belgium.\n\nThe [[Eburones]], the largest of the ''Germani Cisrhenani'' group, covered a large area including at least part of modern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]], stretching east to the [[Rhine]] in Germany, and also northwest to the delta, giving them a border with the Menapii. Their territory may have stretched into Gelderland.\n\nIn the delta itself, Caesar makes a passing comment about the ''Insula Batavorum'' (\"Island of the Batavi\") in the [[Rhine river]], without discussing who lived there. Later, in imperial times, a tribe called the Batavi became very important in this region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=4:chapter=10&highlight=batavi|title=C.

Very often this involved large-scale conflict with the free Germanic tribes over the Rhine.\n\nOther tribes who eventually inhabited the islands in the delta during Roman times are mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] are the [[Cananefates]] in South Holland; the [[Frisii]], covering most of the modern Netherlands north of the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude Rijn]]; the [[Frisiabones]], who apparently stretched from the delta into the North of North Brabant; the [[Marsacii]], who stretched from the Flemish coast, into the delta; and the [[Sturii]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=4:chapter=29 Plin. Nat. 4.29]</ref>\n\nCaesar reported that he eliminated the name of the Eburones but in their place the [[Texuandri]] inhabited most of North Brabant, and the modern province of Limburg, with the Maas running through it, appears to have been inhabited in imperial times by (from north to south) the [[Baetasii]], the [[Catualinum|Catualini]], the [[Sunuci]] and the [[Tungri]]. (Tacitus reported that the Tungri was a new name for the earlier ''Germani cisrhenani''.)\n\nNorth of the Old Rhine, apart from the Frisii, Pliny reports some [[Chauci]] reached into the delta, and two other tribes known from the eastern Netherlands were the [[Tuihanti]] (or Tubantes) from [[Twenthe]] in Overijssel, and the [[Chamavi]], from [[Hamaland]] in northern Gelderland, who became one of the first tribes to be named as [[Franks|Frankish]] (see below). The [[Salians]], also Franks, probably originated in [[Salland]] in Overijssel, before they moved into the empire, forced by Saxons in the 4th century, first into Batavia, and then into Toxandria.\n\n===Roman settlements in the Netherlands===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=350|caption_align=center\n| title = Roman settlements\n| image1 = Ruitermasker matilo.jpg|caption1=Mask of a Roman horseman, discovered near [[Leiden]].\n| image2 = Germania 70.svg|caption2=Rhine Frontier of the [[Roman Empire]] around 70 CE. \n}}\nStarting about 15 BC, the [[Rhine]], in the Netherlands came to be defended by the Lower [[Limes Germanicus]]. After a series of military actions, the Rhine became fixed around 12 AD as Rome's northern frontier on the European mainland. A number of towns and developments would arise along this line. The area to the south would be integrated into the [[Roman Empire]]. At first part of [[Gallia Belgica]], this area became part of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Germania Inferior]]. The tribes already within, or relocated to, this area became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the [[Frisii]] and the [[Chauci]], remained outside Roman rule but not its presence and control.\n\nRomans built military forts along the [[Limes Germanicus]] and a number of towns and smaller settlements in the Netherlands. The more notable Roman towns were at [[Nijmegen]] ([[:nl:Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum|Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum]]) and at [[Voorburg]] ([[Forum Hadriani]]).\n\nPerhaps the most evocative Roman ruin is the mysterious [[Brittenburg]], which emerged from the sand at the beach in Katwijk several centuries ago, only to be buried again.

In the first centuries after Rome's conquest of Gaul, trade flourished. And Roman, Gaulish and Germanic material culture are found combined in the region.\n\nHowever, the Batavians rose against the Romans in the [[Batavian rebellion]] of 69 AD. The leader of this [[Revolt of the Batavi|revolt]] was Batavian [[Gaius Julius Civilis]]. One of the causes of the rebellion was that the Romans had taken young Batavians as [[Slavery|slaves]]. A number of Roman ''castella'' were attacked and burnt. Other Roman soldiers in [[Xanten]] and elsewhere and auxiliary troops of Batavians and [[Canninefates|Canninefatae]] in the legions of [[Vitellius]]) joined the revolt, thus splitting the northern part of the Roman army. In April 70 AD, a few legions sent by [[Vespasianus]] and commanded by [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] eventually defeated the Batavians and negotiated surrender with [[Gaius Julius Civilis]] somewhere between the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the [[Meuse River|Maas]] near Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]]), which was probably called \"Batavodurum\" by the Batavians.<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.html ''Historiae''], Tacitus, 109 AD, Translated by Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb.</ref> The Batavians later merged with other tribes and became part of the [[Salian Franks]].\n\nDutch writers in the 17th and 18th centuries saw the rebellion of the independent and freedom-loving Batavians as mirroring the Dutch revolt against Spain and other forms of tyranny. According to this nationalist view, the [[Batavians]] were the \"true\" forefathers of the Dutch, which explains the recurring use of the name over the centuries. [[Jakarta]] was named \"Batavia\" by the Dutch in 1619. The Dutch republic created in 1795 on the basis of French revolutionary principles was called the [[Batavian Republic]].

This is known as the \"[[Migration Period]]\" (''Volksverhuizingen''). The northern Netherlands received an influx of new migrants and settlers, mostly [[Saxons]], but also [[Angles]] and [[Jutes]]. Many of these migrants did not stay in the northern Netherlands but moved on to England and are known today as the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. The newcomers who stayed in the northern Netherlands would eventually be referred to as \"Frisians\", although they were not descended from the ancient [[Frisii]]. These new Frisians settled in the northern Netherlands and would become the ancestors of the modern [[Frisians]].<ref>{{Citation\n |last              = Bazelmans\n |first             = Jos\n |year              = 2009\n |editor1-last      = Derks\n |editor1-first     = Ton\n |editor2-last      = Roymans\n |editor2-first     = Nico\n |contribution      = The early-medieval use of ethnic names from classical antiquity: The case of the Frisians\n |contribution-url  = https://books.google.com/books?id=fM_cmuhmSbIC&pg=PA321\n |title             = Ethnic Constructs in Antiquity: The Role of Power and Tradition\n |publisher         = Amsterdam University\n |publication-date  = 2009\n |location = Amsterdam\n |pages             = 321\u201337\n |isbn              = 978-90-8964-078-9\n |url               = http://s393993344.online.de/ssoar/handle/document/27183\n |access-date       = 30 August 2017\n |archive-url       = https://web.archive.org/web/20170830194912/http://s393993344.online.de/ssoar/handle/document/27183\n |archive-date      = 30 August 2017\n |url-status          = dead\n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bertsgeschiedenissite.nl/ijzertijd/eeuw1ac/frisii.html Frisii en Frisiaevones, 25\u201308\u201302 (Dutch)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003101550/http://www.bertsgeschiedenissite.nl/ijzertijd/eeuw1ac/frisii.html |date=3 October 2011 }}, Bertsgeschiedenissite.nl.

By the end of the 6th century, the Frisian territory in the northern Netherlands had expanded west to the [[North Sea]] coast and, by the 7th century, south to [[Dorestad]]. During this period most of the northern Netherlands was known as [[Frisia]]. This extended Frisian territory is sometimes referred to as ''[[Frisian Kingdom|Frisia Magna]]'' (or [[Greater Frisia]]).\n\n[[File:Dorestad and trade routes.jpg|thumb|[[Dorestad]] and main traderoutes.]]\nIn the 7th and 8th centuries, the [[Franks|Frankish]] chronologies mention this area as the [[Frisian Kingdom|kingdom of the Frisians]]. This kingdom comprised the coastal provinces of the [[Netherlands]] and the German [[North Sea]] coast. During this time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. The 7th-century [[Frisian Kingdom]] (650\u2013734) under King [[Aldegisel]] and King [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Redbad]], had its centre of power in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].\n\n[[Dorestad]] was the largest settlement ([[Emporia (early medieval)|emporia]]) in northwestern Europe. It had grown around a former Roman fortress. It was a large, flourishing trading place, three kilometers long and situated where the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Lek river|Lek]] diverge southeast of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] near the modern town of [[Wijk bij Duurstede]].<ref>Willemsen, A.

By the 490s, [[Clovis I]] had conquered and united all the Frankish territories to the west of the [[Meuse]], including those in the southern Netherlands. He continued his conquests into [[Gaul]].\n\nAfter the death of [[Clovis I]] in 511, his four sons partitioned his kingdom amongst themselves, with [[Theuderic I of Austrasia|Theuderic I]] receiving the lands that were to become Austrasia (including the southern Netherlands). A line of kings descended from Theuderic ruled [[Austrasia]] until 555, when it was united with the other Frankish kingdoms of [[Chlothar I]], who inherited all the Frankish realms by 558. He redivided the Frankish territory amongst his four sons, but the four kingdoms coalesced into three on the death of [[Charibert I]] in 567. Austrasia (including the southern Netherlands) was given to [[Sigebert I]]. The southern Netherlands remained the northern part of [[Austrasia]] until the rise of the [[Carolingians]].\n\nThe Franks who expanded south into [[Gaul]] settled there and eventually adopted the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the local population.<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/> However, a Germanic language was spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western [[Austrasia]] and [[Neustria]] as late as the 850s.

Some went further by ascribing certain attributes, values and strengths to these various groups and proposing that they reflected 19th-century nationalist and religious views. In particular, it was believed that this theory explained why Belgium and the southern Netherlands (i.e. the Franks) had become Catholic and the northern Netherlands (Frisians and Saxons) had become Protestant. The success of this theory was partly due to anthropological theories based on a tribal paradigm. Being politically and geographically inclusive, and yet accounting for diversity, this theory was in accordance with the need for nation-building and integration during the 1890\u20131914 period. The theory was taught in Dutch schools.\n\nHowever, the disadvantages of this historical interpretation became apparent. This tribal-based theory suggested that external borders were weak or non-existent and that there were clear-cut internal borders. This origins myth provided an historical premise, especially during the Second World War, for regional separatism and annexation to Germany. After 1945 the tribal paradigm lost its appeal for anthropological scholars and historians. When the accuracy of the three-tribe theme was fundamentally questioned, the theory fell out of favour.<ref name=\"Marnix Beyen 1850\"/>\n\nDue to the scarcity of written sources, knowledge of this period depends to a large degree on the interpretation of archaeological data. The traditional view of a clear-cut division between [[Frisians]] in the north and coast, [[Franks]] in the south and [[Saxons]] in the east has proven historically problematic.<ref>Blok, D.P. (1974), ''De Franken in Nederland'', Bussum: Unieboek, 1974, pp. 36\u201338 on the uncertain identity of the Frisians in early Frankish sources; pp. 54\u201355 on the problems concerning \"Saxon\" as a tribal name.</ref><ref>van Eijnatten, J. and F. van Lieburg, ''Nederlandse religiegeschiedenis'' (Hilversum, 2006), pp. 42\u201343, on the uncertain identity of the \"Frisians\" in early Frankish sources.</ref><ref>de Nijs, T, E.

(2003), pp. 30\u201333</ref>\n\n===The emergence of the Dutch language===\n{{Main|Old Dutch|Old Frisian|Dutch Low Saxon}}\nThe language from which [[Old Dutch]] (also sometimes called [[Old West Low Franconian]], [[Old Low Franconian]] or [[Old Frankish]]) arose is not known with certainty, but it is thought to be the language spoken by the [[Salian Franks]]. Even though the Franks are traditionally categorized as [[Weser-Rhine Germanic]], Dutch has a number of [[Ingvaeonic]] characteristics and is classified by modern linguists as an [[Ingvaeonic]] language. Dutch also has a number of [[Old Saxon]] characteristics. There was a close relationship between [[Old Dutch]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old English]] and [[Old Frisian]]. Because texts written in the language spoken by the Franks are almost non-existent, and [[Old Dutch]] texts scarce and fragmentary, not much is known about the development of [[Old Dutch]]. [[Old Dutch]] made the transition to [[Middle Dutch]] around 1150.<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/>\n\n===Christianization===\nThe Christianity that arrived in the Netherlands with the Romans appears not to have died out completely (in [[Maastricht]], at least) after the withdrawal of the Romans in about 411.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/>\n\nThe [[Franks]] became Christians after their king [[Clovis I]] converted to Catholicism, an event which is traditionally set in 496. Christianity was introduced in the north after the conquest of [[Friesland]] by the [[Franks]]. The [[Saxons]] in the east were converted before the conquest of [[Saxony]], and became Frankish allies.\n\n[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]] and [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missionaries, particularly [[Willibrord]], [[Wulfram of Sens|Wulfram]] and [[Boniface]], played an important role in converting the Frankish and Frisian peoples to Christianity by the 8th century. Boniface was martyred by the [[Frisians]] in [[Dokkum]] (754).\n\n===Frankish dominance and incorporation into the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Frisian-Frankish Wars}}\n[[File:Radboud doopvont.jpg|thumb|left|An early 16th-century tapestry depicting the near baptism of [[Redbad, King of the Frisians]], who died in 719 CE.]]\n\nIn the early 8th century the Frisians came increasingly into conflict with the [[Franks]] to the south, resulting in a [[Frisian\u2013Frankish wars|series of wars]] in which the [[Frankish Empire]] eventually subjugated Frisia. In 734, at the [[Battle of the Boarn]], the Frisians in the Netherlands were defeated by the [[Franks]], who thereby conquered the area west of the [[Lauwers]]. The Franks then conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785 when [[Charlemagne]] defeated [[Widukind]].\n\nThe linguistic descendants of the Franks, the modern [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Dutch language|-speakers]] of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], seem to have broken with the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] \"Frank\" around the 9th century. By this time Frankish identity had changed from an ethnic identity to a national identity, becoming localized and confined to the modern ''[[Franconia]]'' and principally to the French province of ''[[\u00cele-de-France]]''.<ref>van der Wal, M., ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlands'', 1992 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the people no longer referred to themselves as \"Franks\", the Netherlands was still part of the [[Frankish empire]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Indeed, because of the Austrasian origins of the Carolingians in the area between the Rhine and the Maas, the cities of Aachen, Maastricht, Li\u00e8ge and Nijmegen were at the heart of Carolingian culture.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/> Charlemagne maintained his ''palatium''<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlemagne: Court and administration|encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne/256621/Court-and-administration}} (\"Charlemagne relied on his palatium, a shifting assemblage of family members, trusted lay and ecclesiastical companions, and assorted hangers-on, which constituted an itinerant court following the king as he carried out his military campaigns and sought to take advantage of the income from widely scattered royal estates.\")</ref> in [[Nijmegen]] at least four times.\n\nThe [[Carolingian empire]] would eventually include France, Germany, northern Italy and much of Western Europe. In 843, the Frankish empire was divided into three parts, giving rise to [[West Francia]] in the west, [[East Francia]] in the east, and [[Middle Francia]] in the centre. Most of what is today the Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]]; Flanders became part of [[West Francia]]. This division was an important factor in the historical distinction between Flanders and the other Dutch-speaking areas.\n\n[[Middle Francia]] ({{lang-la|Francia media}}) was an ephemeral [[Francia|Frankish]] kingdom that had no historical or ethnic identity to bind its varied peoples. It was created by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, which divided the [[Carolingian Empire]] among the sons of [[Louis the Pious]]. Situated between the realms of [[East Francia|East]] and [[West Francia]], Middle Francia comprised the Frankish territory between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Scheldt]], the [[Frisia]]n coast of the [[North Sea]], the former [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] (except for a western portion, later known as [[Duchy of Burgundy|''Bourgogne'']]), [[Provence]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nMiddle Francia fell to [[Lothair I]], the eldest son and successor of [[Louis the Pious]], after an intermittent civil war with his younger brothers [[Louis the German]] and [[Charles the Bald]]. In acknowledgement of Lothair's [[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial]] title, Middle Francia contained the imperial cities of [[Aachen]], the residence of [[Charlemagne]], as well as Rome. In 855, on his deathbed at [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]], Emperor Lothair I again partitioned his realm amongst his sons. Most of the lands north of the [[Alps]], including the Netherlands, passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and consecutively were named [[Lotharingia]]. After Lothair II died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned by his uncles Louis the German and Charles the Bald in the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] in 870. Although some of the Netherlands had come under Viking control, in 870 it technically became part of [[East Francia]], which became the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 962.\n\n===Viking raids===\n[[File:Rorik by H. W. Koekkoek.jpg|thumb|[[Rorik of Dorestad]], [[Viking]] conqueror and ruler of [[Friesland]], a romantic 1912 depiction by [[Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek|Johannes H. Koekkoek]].]]\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, the Vikings raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the coast and along the rivers of the [[Low Countries]]. Although Vikings never settled in large numbers in those areas, they did set up long-term bases and were even acknowledged as lords in a few cases. In Dutch and Frisian historical tradition, the trading centre of [[Dorestad]] declined after Viking raids from 834 to 863; however, since no convincing Viking archaeological evidence has been found at the site (as of 2007), doubts about this have grown in recent years.<ref>More info about Viking raids can be found online at L. van der Tuuk, [http://home.tiscali.nl/gjallar/index.html Gjallar. Noormannen in de Lage Landen]</ref>\n\nOne of the most important Viking families in the Low Countries was that of [[Rorik of Dorestad]] (based in [[Wieringen]]) and his brother the \"younger Harald\" (based in [[Walcheren]]), both thought to be nephews of [[Harald Klak]].<ref>Baldwin, Stephen, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> Around 850, [[Lothair I]] acknowledged Rorik as ruler of most of Friesland. And again in 870, Rorik was received by [[Charles the Bald]] in [[Nijmegen]], to whom he became a vassal. Viking raids continued during that period. Harald's son Rodulf and his men were killed by the people of [[Oostergo]] in 873. Rorik died sometime before 882.\n\nBuried Viking treasures consisting mainly of silver have been found in the Low Countries. Two such treasures have been found in Wieringen. A large treasure found in Wieringen in 1996 dates from around 850 and is thought perhaps to have been connected to Rorik. The burial of such a valuable treasure is seen as an indication that there was a permanent settlement in Wieringen.<ref>\"[http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html Vikingschat van Wieringen\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718064223/http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html |date=18 July 2011 }}, Museumkennis.nl. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref>\n\nAround 879, Godfrid arrived in Frisian lands as the head of a large force that terrorised the Low Countries. Using [[Ghent]] as his base, they ravaged Ghent, [[Maastricht]], [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Stavelot]], [[Pr\u00fcm]], [[Cologne]], and [[Koblenz]]. Controlling most of Frisia between 882 and his death in 885, Godfrid became known to history as [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. His lordship over Frisia was acknowledged by [[Charles the Fat]], to whom he became a vassal. Godfried was assassinated in 885, after which [[Gerolf of Holland]] assumed lordship and Viking rule of Frisia came to an end.\n\nViking raids of the Low Countries continued for over a century. Remains of Viking attacks dating from 880 to 890 have been found in [[Zutphen]] and [[Deventer]]. In 920, King [[Henry I of Germany|Henry]] of Germany liberated [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. According to a number of chronicles, the last attacks took place in the first decade of the 11th century and were directed at [[Tiel]] and/or [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].<ref>Jesch, Judith, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RkNY2KrdvscC&pg=PA82 Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse]'', Boydell & Brewer, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-85115-826-6}}. p. 82.</ref>\n\nThese Viking raids occurred about the same time that French and German lords were fighting for supremacy over the middle empire that included the Netherlands, so their sway over this area was weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result.\n\n==High and Late Middle Ages (1000\u20131432)==\n\n===Part of the Holy Roman Empire===\nThe German kings and emperors ruled the Netherlands in the 10th and 11th century. Germany was called the Holy Roman Empire after the coronation of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto the Great]] as emperor. The Dutch city of [[Nijmegen]] used to be the spot of an important domain of the German emperors. Several German emperors were born and died there, including for example [[Byzantine]] empress [[Theophanu]], who died in Nijmegen. Utrecht was also an important city and trading port at the time.\n\n===Political disunity===\n[[File:Valkhofkapel.JPG|thumb|Chapel of St Nicholas ({{Interlanguage link multi|Sint-Nicolaaskapel|nl}} or Valkhofkapel) in [[Nijmegen]], one of the oldest buildings in the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was not able to maintain political unity. In addition to the growing independence of the towns, local rulers turned their counties and duchies into private kingdoms and felt little sense of obligation to the emperor who reigned over large parts of the nation in name only. Large parts of what now comprise the Netherlands were governed by the Count of Holland, the Duke of [[Gelre]], the Duke of Brabant and the Bishop of Utrecht. [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] in the north maintained their independence and were governed by the lower nobility.\n\nThe various feudal states were in a state of almost continual war. [[Gelre]] and Holland fought for control of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Utrecht, whose bishop had in 1000 ruled over half of what is today the Netherlands, was marginalised as it experienced continuing difficulty in electing new bishops. At the same time, the dynasties of neighbouring states were more stable. [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]] and most of Gelre, which used to be part of Utrecht, became independent. Brabant tried to conquer its neighbours, but was not successful.  Holland also tried to assert itself in Zeeland and Friesland, but its attempts failed.\n\n===The Frisians===\nThe language and culture of most of the people who lived in the area that is now Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. The sparsely populated area was known as \"West Friesland\" (''Westfriesland''). As Frankish settlement progressed, the Frisians migrated away or were absorbed and the area quickly became [[Old Dutch|Dutch]].  (The part of North Holland situated north of [[Alkmaar]] is still colloquially known as West Friesland).\n\nThe rest of [[Friesland]] in the north continued to maintain its independence during this time. It had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\") and resented the imposition of the feudal system and the patriciate found in other European towns. They regarded themselves as allies of Switzerland. The Frisian battle cry was \"better dead than a slave\". They later lost their independence when they were defeated in 1498 by the German [[Landsknecht]] mercenaries of [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Duke Albrecht of Saxony-Meissen]].\n\n===The rise of Holland===\n[[File:Rochussen Egmond.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirk VI, Count of Holland]], 1114\u20131157, and his mother Petronella visiting the work on the [[Egmond Abbey]], Charles Rochussen, 1881.

Originally granted as a fief to the Danish chieftain [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]] in return for loyalty to the emperor in 862, the region of [[Kennemerland|Kennemara]] (the region around modern [[Haarlem]]) rapidly grew under Rorik's descendants in size and importance. By the early 11th century, [[Dirk III, Count of Holland]] was levying tolls on the Meuse estuary and was able to resist military intervention from his overlord, the Duke of Lower Lorraine.\n\nIn 1083, the name \"Holland\" first appears in a deed referring to a region corresponding more or less to the current province of South Holland and the southern half of what is now North Holland. Holland's influence continued to grow over the next two centuries. The [[counts of Holland]] conquered most of [[Zeeland]] but it was not until 1289 that Count [[Floris V]] was able to subjugate the Frisians in West Friesland (that is, the northern half of North Holland).\n\n===Expansion and growth===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Dutch Low Countries}}\n\nAround 1000 AD there were several agricultural developments (described sometimes as an agricultural revolution) that resulted in an increase in production, especially food production. The economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMuch of the western Netherlands was barely inhabited between the end of the Roman period until around 1100 AD, when farmers from [[Flanders]] and [[Utrecht]] began purchasing the swampy land, draining it and cultivating it. This process happened quickly and the uninhabited territory was settled in a few generations. They built independent farms that were not part of villages, something unique in Europe at the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Guilds]] were established and markets developed as production exceeded local needs. Also, the introduction of currency made trading a much easier affair than it had been before. Existing towns grew and new towns sprang into existence around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas. Commerce and town development increased as the population grew.\n\nThe [[Crusade]]s were popular in the Low Countries and drew many to fight in the [[Holy Land]]. At home, there was relative peace. Viking pillaging had stopped. Both the Crusades and the relative peace at home contributed to trade and the growth in commerce.\n\nCities arose and flourished, especially in [[Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. As the cities grew in wealth and power, they started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]], including [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]], the right to self-government and the right to pass laws. In practice, this meant that the wealthiest cities became quasi-independent republics in their own right. Two of the most important cities were [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] (in [[Flanders]]) which would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\n===Hook and Cod Wars===\n{{Main|Hook and Cod wars}}\n[[File:Jacoba van Beieren (1401-1436), gravin van Holland en Zeeland.jpg|thumb|[[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]], 1401\u20131436, known to the Dutch as \"Jacoba of Bavaria\".]]\nThe [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) were a series of wars and battles in the [[County of Holland]] between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over the title of [[count of Holland]], but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the [[bourgeois]] in the cities against the ruling nobility.\n\nThe Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of [[Holland]].  The Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen. Some of the main figures in this multi-generational conflict were [[William IV, Count of Holland|William IV]], [[Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut|Margaret]], [[William V, Count of Hainaut|William V]], [[William VI, Count of Holland]] and Hainaut, [[John, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing|John]] and [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]]. But perhaps the most well known is [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]].\n\nThe conquest of the county of Holland by the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy was an odd affair. Leading noblemen in Holland invited the duke to conquer Holland, even though he had no historical claim to it. Some historians{{Who|date=February 2010}} say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the [[Flanders|Flemish]] economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions. Europe had been wracked by many civil wars in the 14th and 15th centuries, while Flanders had grown rich and enjoyed peace.\n\n== Burgundian and Habsburg period (1433\u20131567) ==\n[[File:Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|thumb|left|The Low Countries in the late 14th century CE.]]\n\n===Burgundian period===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands}}\nMost of what is now the Netherlands and Belgium was eventually united by the Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in 1433. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in, their local duchy or county or as subjects of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Burgundian period is when the Dutch began the road to nationhood.\n\nHolland's trade developed rapidly, especially in the areas of shipping and transport. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of Holland defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital to the people of Holland, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\n===Habsburg rule from Spain===\n{{Main|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Hadrian VI.jpg|thumb|Influential [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] theologian Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens, 1459\u20131523, was an advisor to Charles; in the last year of his life he became pope as [[Pope Adrian VI]] (1522\u201323).]]\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500\u201358) was born and raised in the [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Ghent]]; he spoke French.  Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournai]], Artois, [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret]] acted as regent until 1515. France relinquished its ancient claim on [[Flanders]] in 1528.<ref>{{cite book|author=James D.

[[Gelre]] attempted to build up its own state in northeast Netherlands and northwest Germany. Lacking funds in the 16th century, Gelre had its soldiers provide for themselves by pillaging enemy terrain. These soldiers were a great menace to the Burgundian Netherlands, as when they pillaged [[The Hague]].\n\nThe dukes of Burgundy over the years through astute marriages, purchases and wars, had taken control of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] that made up the Low Countries. They are now the Netherlands in the north, the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now Belgium) in the south, and Luxemburg in the southeast. Known as the \"Burgundian Circle,\" these lands came under the control of the Habsburg family. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] (1500\u201358) became the owner in 1506, but in 1515 he left to become king of Spain and later became the Holy Roman Emperor. Charles turned over control to regents (his close relatives), and in practice rule was exercised by Spaniards he controlled. The provinces each had their own governments and courts, controlled by the local nobility, and their own traditions and rights (\"liberties\") dating back centuries. Likewise the numerous cities had their own legal rights and local governments, usually controlled by the merchants, On top of this the Spanish had imposed an overall government, the Estates General of the Netherlands, with its own officials and courts.<ref>H.G. Koenigsberger, \"The Beginnings of the States General of the Netherlands,\" ''Parliaments, Estates and Representation'' (1988) 8#2 pp 101\u201314.</ref> The Spanish officials sent by Charles ignored traditions and the Dutch nobility as well as local officials, inciting an anti-Spanish sense of nationalism, and leading to the [[Dutch Revolt]]. With the emergence of the Protestant Reformation, Charles\u2014now the Emperor\u2014was determined to crush Protestantism and never compromise with it. Unrest began in the south, centered in the large rich metropolis of Antwerp. The Netherlands was an especially rich unit of the Spanish realm, especially after the [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]] of 1559; it ended four decades of warfare between France and Spain and allowed Spain to reposition its army.<ref name=\"Albert Guerard 1959 pp. 134\">Albert Guerard, ''France, A Modern History'', (1959), pp. 134\u201336.</ref>\n\nIn 1548, Charles granted the Netherlands status as an entity in which many of the laws of the Holy Roman Empire became obsolete.

Po-chia Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006) pp. 118\u201334</ref> Dutch [[Protestants]], after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities.

Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 104</ref> In a society dependent on trade, freedom and tolerance were considered essential. Nevertheless, the Catholic rulers Charles V, and later [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], made it their mission to defeat Protestantism, which was considered a heresy by the Catholic Church and a threat to the stability of the whole hierarchical political system. On the other hand, the intensely moralistic Dutch Protestants insisted their Biblical theology, sincere piety and humble lifestyle was morally superior to the luxurious habits and superficial religiosity of the ecclesiastical nobility.<ref>Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006) pp. 3\u201336</ref> The rulers' harsh punitive measures led to increasing grievances in the Netherlands, where the local governments had embarked on a course of peaceful coexistence. In the second half of the century, the situation escalated. Philip sent troops to crush the rebellion and make the Netherlands once more a Catholic region.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 155</ref>\n\nIn the first wave of the Reformation, [[Lutheranism]] won over the elites in Antwerp and the South.  The Spanish successfully suppressed it there, and Lutheranism only flourished in east Friesland.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 374\u201375</ref>\n\nThe second wave of the Reformation, came in the form of [[Anabaptism]], that was popular among ordinary farmers in [[Holland]] and [[Friesland]]. Anabaptists were socially very radical and equalitarian; they believed that the apocalypse was very near. They refused to live the old way, and began new communities, creating considerable chaos. A prominent Dutch Anabaptist was [[Menno Simons]], who initiated the [[Mennonite]] church. The movement was allowed in the north, but never grew to a large scale.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 86\u201391</ref>\n\nThe third wave of the Reformation, that ultimately proved to be permanent, was [[Calvinism]]. It arrived in the Netherlands in the 1540s, attracting both the elite and the common population, especially in [[Flanders]]. The Catholic Spanish responded with harsh persecution and introduced the [[Inquisition of the Netherlands]]. Calvinists rebelled. First there was the [[Beeldenstorm|iconoclasm]] in 1566, which was the systematic destruction of statues of saints and other Catholic devotional depictions in churches. In 1566, [[William the Silent]], a Calvinist, started the [[Eighty Years' War]] to liberate all Dutch of whatever religion from Catholic Spain. Blum says, \"His patience, tolerance, determination, concern for his people, and belief in government by consent held the Dutch together and kept alive their spirit of revolt.\"<ref>Jerome Blum et al, ''The European World: A History'' (1970) pp 160\u201361</ref>  The provinces of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]], being mainly Calvinist by 1572, submitted to the rule of William.

This treaty ended a forty-year period of warfare between France and Spain conducted in Italy from 1521 to 1559.<ref name=\"Albert Guerard 1959 pp. 134\"/> The Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis was somewhat of a watershed\u2014not only for the battleground that Italy had been, but also for northern Europe. Spain had been keeping troops in the Netherlands to be ready to attack France from the north as well as from the south.\n\nWith the settlement of so many major issues between France and Spain by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, there was no longer any reason to keep Spanish troops in the Netherlands.  Thus, the people of the Netherlands could get on with their peacetime pursuits.  As they did so they found that there was a great deal of demand for their products.  Fishing had long been an important part of the economy of the Netherlands.  However, now the fishing of herring alone came to occupy 2,000 boats operating out of Dutch ports. Spain, still the Dutch trader's best customer, was buying fifty large ships full of furniture and household utensils from Flanders merchants. Additionally, Dutch woolen goods were desired everywhere.  The Netherlands bought and processed enough Spanish wool to sell four million florins of wool products through merchants in Bruges. So strong was the Dutch appetite for raw wool at this time that they bought nearly as much English wool as they did Spanish wool.  Total commerce with England alone amounted to 24 million florins.  Much of the export going to England resulted in pure profit to the Dutch because the exported items were of their own manufacture. The Netherlands was just starting to enter its \"Golden Age.\" Brabant and Flanders were the richest and most flourishing parts of the Dutch Republic at the time.<ref name=\"Claflin\">Claflin, W. Harold, ed. ''History of Nations: Holland and Belgium'', (New York: P.F. Collier & Son, 1907), pp. 72\u201374, 103\u201305</ref> The Netherlands was one of the richest places in the world. The population reached 3 million in 1560, with 25 cities of 10,000 people or more, by far the largest urban presence in Europe; with the trading and financial center of Antwerp being especially important (population 100,000). Spain could not afford to lose this rich land, nor allow it to fall from Catholic control. Thus came 80 years of warfare.\n\nA devout Catholic, Philip was appalled by the success of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the [[Low Countries]], which had led to an increasing number of [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. His attempts to enforce religious persecution of the Protestants, and his centralization of government, law enforcement, and taxes, made him unpopular and led to a [[revolt]]. [[Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba]], was sent with a Spanish Army to punish the unruly Dutch in 1567.<ref name=\"Motley\">John Lathrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' (Harper & Bros.: New York, 1855) pp. 106\u201315, 121, 122, 207, 213</ref>\n\nThe only opposition the Duke of Alba faced in his march across the Netherlands were the nobles, [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]]; [[Philippe de Montmorency, Count of Horn]] and others. With the approach of Alba and the Spanish army, [[William the Silent]] of Orange fled to Germany with his three brothers and his whole family on 11 April 1567. The Duke of Alba sought to meet and negotiate with the nobles that now faced him with armies.  However, when the nobles arrived in Brussels they were all arrested and Egmont and Horn were executed.<ref name=\"Motley\"/> Alba then revoked all the prior treaties that Margaret, the [[Duchess of Parma]] had signed with the Protestants of the Netherlands and instituted the Inquisition to enforce the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].\n\n==The Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648)==\n{{Main|Eighty Years' War|Dutch Revolt}}\n[[File:Slag bij Nieuwpoort.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurits]] at the [[Battle of Nieuwpoort]], 1600 CE, by Paulus van Hillegaert.]]\n[[File:Leo belgicus.png|thumb|[[Leo Belgicus]], a map of the [[low countries]] drawn in the shape of a lion, by [[Claes Jansz. Visscher]] (II), 1609 CE.]]\nThe Dutch War for Independence from Spain is frequently called the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648).  The first fifty years (1568 through 1618) were uniquely a war between Spain and the Netherlands.  During the last thirty years (1618\u20131648) the conflict between Spain and the Netherlands was submerged in the general European War that became known as the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, ed. ''The Thirty Years' War'', New York: Routledge Press, 1987, p. 2.</ref>  The seven rebellious provinces of the Netherlands were eventually united by the [[Union of Utrecht]] in 1579 and formed the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] (also known as the \"United Provinces\"). The [[Act of Abjuration]] or ''Plakkaat van Verlatinghe'' was signed on 26 July 1581, and was the formal [[declaration of independence]] of the northern [[Low Countries]] from the Spanish king.\n\n[[William the Silent|William of Orange]] (Slot Dillenburg, 24 April 1533 \u2013 Delft, 10 July 1584), the founder of the Dutch royal family, led the Dutch during the first part of the war, following the death of Egmont and Horn in 1568. The very first years were a success for the Spanish troops. However, the Dutch countered subsequent sieges in [[Holland]]. In November and December 1572, all the citizens of [[Zutphen]] and [[Naarden]] were slaughtered by the Spanish. From 11 December that year the city of [[Haarlem]] was besieged, holding out for seven months until 13 July 1573. [[Oudewater]] was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed. [[Maastricht]] was besieged, sacked and destroyed twice in succession (in 1576 and 1579) by the Spanish.\n\nIn a war composed mostly of sieges rather than battles, [[Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma|Governor-General Alexander Farnese]] proved his mettle. His strategy was to offer generous terms for the surrender of a city: there would be no more massacres or looting; historic urban privileges were retained; there was a full pardon and amnesty; return to the Catholic Church would be gradual. The conservative Catholics in the south and east supported the Spanish. Farnese recaptured [[Antwerp]] and nearly all of what became Belgium.<ref>Violet Soen, \"Reconquista and Reconciliation in the Dutch Revolt: The Campaign of Governor-General Alexander Farnese (1578\u20131592),\" ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (2012) 16#1 pp. 1\u201322.</ref> Most of the Dutch-speaking territory in the Netherlands was taken from Spain, but not in [[Flanders]], which to this day remains part of Belgium. Flanders was the most radical anti-Spanish territory. Many Flemish fled to Holland, among them half of the population of Antwerp, 3/4 of Bruges and Ghent and the entire population of Nieuwpoort, Dunkerque and countryside.<ref>Bart de Groof, \"Alexander Farnese and the Origins of Modern Belgium,\" ''Bulletin de l'Institut Historique Belge de Rome'' (1993) Vol. 63, pp. 195\u2013219.</ref> His successful campaign gave the Catholics control of the lower half of the Low Countries, and was part of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]].\n\nThe war dragged on for another half century, but the main fighting was over. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], signed in 1648, confirmed the independence of the United Provinces from Spain. The Dutch people started to develop a national identity since the 15th century, but they officially remained a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until 1648. National identity was mainly formed by the province people came from. Holland was the most important province by far. The republic of the Seven Provinces came to be known as '''Holland''' across Europe.\n\nThe Catholics in the Netherlands were an outlawed minority that had been suppressed by the Calvinists. After 1572, however, they made a striking comeback (also as part of the Catholic Counter-Reformation), setting up seminaries, reforming their Church, and sending missionaries into Protestant districts. Laity often took the lead; the Calvinist government often arrested or harassed priests who seemed too effective. Catholic numbers stabilized at about a third of the population in the Netherlands; they were strongest in the southeast.<ref>see [http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/kuyper.html religion map]</ref><ref>Charles H.

During the Golden Age, there was a great flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the sciences in the Netherlands. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch were arguably the most economically wealthy and scientifically advanced of all European nations. This new, officially Calvinist nation flourished culturally and economically, creating what historian [[Simon Schama]] has called an \"embarrassment of riches\".<ref name=\"Schama\">Schama, Simon, ''The Embarrassment of Riches'', Bath: William Collins & Sons, 1987.

In 1640 by the [[Dutch East India Company]] began a trade monopoly with Japan through the trading post on [[Dejima]].\n\nThe Dutch also dominated trade between European countries. The Low Countries were favorably positioned on a crossing of east-west and north-south trade routes and connected to a large German hinterland through the [[Rhine]] river. Dutch traders shipped wine from France and Portugal to the [[Baltic region|Baltic lands]] and returned with grain destined for countries around the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Overall, levels of tolerance were sufficiently high to attract religious refugees from other countries, notably Jewish merchants from [[Portugal]] who brought much wealth with them. The revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France in 1685 resulted in the immigration of many French [[Huguenots]], many of whom were shopkeepers or scientists. Still tolerance had its limits, as philosopher [[Baruch de Spinoza]] (1632\u20131677) would find out. Due to its climate of intellectual tolerance the Dutch Republic attracted scientists and other thinkers from all over Europe. Especially the renowned [[University of Leiden]] (established in 1575 by the Dutch [[stadtholder]], [[William the Silent|William of Oranje]], as a token of gratitude for Leiden's fierce resistance against Spain during the Eighty Years' War) became a gathering place for these people. For instance French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] lived in Leiden from 1628 until 1649.\n\nDutch lawyers were famous for their knowledge of international [[Admiralty law|law of the sea]] and [[commercial law]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583\u20131645) played a leading part in the foundation of [[international law]]. Again due to the Dutch climate of tolerance, book publishers flourished. Many books about religion, philosophy and science that might have been deemed controversial abroad were printed in the Netherlands and secretly exported to other countries. Thus during the 17th century the Dutch Republic became more and more Europe's publishing house.\n\n[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Johannes Vermeer]]'s ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'']]\n\n[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) was a famous [[astronomer]], [[physicist]] and mathematician. He invented the [[pendulum clock]], which was a major step forward towards exact timekeeping. He contributed to the fields of [[optics]]. The most famous Dutch scientist in the area of optics is certainly [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], who invented or greatly improved the [[microscope]] (opinions differ) and was the first to methodically study microscopic life, thus laying the foundations for the field of [[microbiology]]. Famous Dutch hydraulic engineer [[Jan Leeghwater]] (1575\u20131650) gained important victories in The Netherlands's eternal battle against the sea. Leeghwater added a considerable amount of land to the republic by converting several large lakes into [[polder]]s, pumping all water out with windmills.\n\nPainting was the dominant art form in 17th-century Holland. [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] followed many of the tendencies that dominated [[Baroque art]] in other parts of Europe, as with the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], but was the leader in developing the subjects of [[still life]], [[landscape painting|landscape]], and [[genre painting]]. [[Portrait]]ure were also popular, but [[history painting]] \u2013 traditionally the [[hierarchy of genres|most-elevated genre]] struggled to find buyers.  Church art was virtually non-existent, and little sculpture of any kind produced. While art collecting and painting for the open market was also common elsewhere, art historians point to the growing number of wealthy Dutch middle-class and successful mercantile patrons as driving forces in the popularity of certain pictorial subjects.<ref name=\"gardner\">Gardner, Helen, Fred S.

Some notable artistic styles and trends include Haarlem [[Mannerism]], [[Utrecht Caravaggism]], the [[Delft School (painting)|School of Delft]], the Leiden [[fijnschilder]]s, and Dutch [[classicism]].\n\n[[File:Den Haag, Mauritshuis vanaf Hofvijver 2006-05-29 16.12.JPG|thumb|The [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Classicist]] [[Mauritshuis]], named after [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|Prince Johan Maurits]] and built 1636\u20131641, was designed by [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]].]]\nDue to the thriving economy, cities expanded greatly. New town halls, weighhouses and storehouses were built. Merchants that had gained a fortune ordered a new house built along one of the many new canals that were dug out in and around many cities (for defence and transport purposes), a house with an ornamented fa\u00e7ade that befitted their new status. In the countryside, many new castles and stately homes were built. Most of them have not survived. Starting at 1595 Reformed churches were commissioned, many of which are still landmarks today. The most famous Dutch architects of the 17th century were [[Jacob van Campen]], [[Pieter Post]], Pieter Vingbooms, [[Lieven de Key]], [[Hendrick de Keyser]]. Overall, Dutch architecture, which generally combined traditional building styles with some foreign elements, did not develop to the level of painting.\n\nThe Golden Age was also an important time for developments in literature. Some of the major figures of this period were [[Gerbrand Adriaenszoon Bredero]], [[Jacob Cats]], [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]] and [[Joost van den Vondel]]. Since Latin was the lingua franca of education, relatively few men could speak, write, and read Dutch all at the same time.\n\nMusic did not develop very much in the Netherlands since the Calvinists considered it an unnecessary extravagance, and organ music was forbidden in Reformed Church services, although it remained common at secular functions.\n\n==Dutch Empire==\n\n=== The Dutch in the Americas ===\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|New Amsterdam in 1664 CE.]]\n{{main|Dutch West India Company|New Netherland|New Amsterdam}}\n\nThe Dutch West India Company was a [[chartered company]] (known as the \"GWC\") of Dutch merchants. On 2 June 1621, it was granted a [[:wikisource:Charter of the Dutch West India Company|charter]] for a trade monopoly in the [[West Indies]] (meaning the Caribbean) by the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] and given jurisdiction over the [[African slave trade]], Brazil, the [[Caribbean]], and North America. Its area of operations stretched from West Africa to the Americas, and the Pacific islands. The company became instrumental in the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas]]. The first forts and settlements in [[Guyana]] and on the [[Amazon River]] date from the 1590s. Actual colonization, with Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with England and France. Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of that century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of [[Suriname]] and a number of Dutch Caribbean islands.\n\n[[File:Peter Stuyvesant.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Peter Stuyvesant]], Director-General of [[New Netherland]] (New York). His provincial capital, [[New Amsterdam]], was located at the southern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]].]]\nThe colony was a private business venture to exploit the [[fur trade]] in beaver pelts. New Netherland was slowly settled during its first decades, partially as a result of policy mismanagement by the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC), and conflicts with Native Americans. During the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the [[Atlantic World]], tolerating a highly diverse ethnic mix. The surrender of [[Fort Amsterdam]] to the British control in 1664 was formalized in 1667, contributing to the [[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]].

The marooned crew, the first Europeans to attempt settlement in the area, built a [[fort]] and stayed for a year until they were rescued. Shortly thereafter, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (in the Dutch of the day: ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', or VOC) decided to establish a permanent settlement. The VOC, one of the major European trading houses sailing the [[Spice trade|spice route]] to East Asia, had no intention of colonizing the area, instead wanting only to establish a secure base camp where passing ships could shelter, and where hungry sailors could stock up on fresh supplies of meat, fruit, and vegetables. To this end, a small VOC expedition under the command of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] reached [[Table Bay]] on 6 April 1652.<ref name=\"Noble-141\">{{Cite book|last=Noble|first=John|title=Illustrated Official Handbook of the Cape and South Africa; A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the history, conditions, populations, productions and resources of the several colonies, states, and territories|publisher=J.C.

This arrangement proved highly successful, producing abundant supplies of fruit, vegetables, wheat, and wine; they also later raised livestock. The small initial group of \"free burghers\", as these farmers were known, steadily increased in number and began to expand their farms further north and east.\n\nThe majority of burghers had [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch ancestry]] and belonged to the [[Calvinist Reformed Church of the Netherlands]], but there were also numerous Germans as well as some Scandinavians. In 1688 the Dutch and the Germans were joined by French [[Huguenots]], also Calvinists, who were fleeing religious persecution in France under [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. The [[Huguenots in South Africa]] were absorbed into the Dutch population but they played a prominent role in South Africa's history.\n\nFrom the beginning, the VOC used the cape as a place to supply ships travelling between the Netherlands and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. There was a close association between the cape and these Dutch possessions in the far east. Van Riebeeck and the VOC began to import large numbers of slaves, primarily from [[Madagascar]] and [[Indonesia]]. These slaves often married Dutch settlers, and their descendants became known as the [[Cape Coloureds]] and the [[Cape Malays]].\n\n[[File:Aernout Smit Table Bay, 1683 William Fehr Collection Cape Town.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Table Bay|De Tafelbaai]] by Aernout Smit, 1683.]]\nDuring the 18th century, the Dutch settlement in the area of the cape grew and prospered.

Its strategic position meant that almost every ship sailing between Europe and Asia stopped off at the colony's capital [[Cape Town]]. The supplying of these ships with fresh provisions, fruit, and [[South African wine|wine]] provided a very large market for the surplus produce of the colony.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nSome free burghers continued to expand into the rugged hinterlands of the north and east, many began to take up a semi-nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] lifestyle, in some ways not far removed from that of the [[Khoikhoi]] they had displaced. In addition to its herds, a family might have a [[wagon]], a [[tent]], a Bible, and a few guns. As they became more settled, they would build a [[mud]]-walled [[cottage]], frequently located, by choice, days of travel from the nearest European settlement. These were the first of the [[Trekboer]]s (Wandering Farmers, later shortened to [[Boer]]s), completely independent of official controls, extraordinarily self-sufficient, and isolated from the government and the main settlement in [[Cape Town]].\n\n[[File:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An account of the first [[trekboer]]s.]]\n[[Dutch language|Dutch]] was the official language, but a dialect had formed that was quite distinct from Dutch.

They seized the Cape Colony in 1795 to prevent it from falling into French hands, then briefly relinquished it back to the Dutch (1803), before definitively conquering it in 1806. British [[sovereignty]] of the area was recognised at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. By the time the Dutch colony was seized by the British in 1806, it had grown into an established settlement with 25,000 slaves, 20,000 white colonists, 15,000 [[Khoisan]], and 1,000 freed black slaves. Outside Cape Town and the immediate hinterland, isolated black and white [[pastoralists]] populated the country.\n\nDutch interest in South Africa was mainly as a strategically located VOC port. Yet in the 17th and 18th centuries the Dutch created the foundation of the modern state of South Africa. The Dutch legacy in South Africa is evident everywhere, but particularly in the [[Afrikaner]] people and the [[Afrikaans]] language.\n\n==Dutch Republic: Regents and Stadholders (1649\u20131784)==\n{{main|Dutch Republic}}\n[[File:Hendrick Avercamp - A Scene on the Ice - WGA01076.jpg|thumb|''Skating fun'', a traditional rural scene by 17th-century Dutch painter [[Hendrick Avercamp]].]]\n\nThe Netherlands gained independence from Spain as a result of the [[Eighty Years' War]], during which the Dutch Republic was founded. As the Netherlands was a republic, it was largely governed by an aristocracy of city-merchants called the [[Regenten|regents]], rather than by a king. Every city and province had its own government and laws, and a large degree of autonomy. After attempts to find a competent sovereign proved unsuccessful, it was decided that [[sovereignty]] would be vested in the various provincial Estates, the governing bodies of the provinces. The [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], with its representatives from all the provinces, would decide on matters important to the Republic as a whole. However, at the head of each province was the [[stadtholder]] of that province, a position held by a descendant of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]]. Usually the stadtholdership of several provinces was held by a single man.\n\nAfter having gained its independence in 1648, the Netherlands tried in various coalitions to help to contain France, which had replaced Spain as the strongest nation of Europe. The end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1713) marked the end of the Dutch Republic as a major player. In the 18th century, it just tried to maintain its independence and stuck to a policy of neutrality.\n\nThe economy, based on Amsterdam's role as the center of world trade, remained robust. In 1670 the Dutch merchant marine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping\u2014about half the European total.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tim William Blanning|title=The Pursuit of Glory: Europe, 1648\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmkcaEfwcsQC&pg=PA96|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|page=96|isbn=9780670063208}}</ref> The province of Holland was highly commercial and dominated the country.  Its nobility was small and closed and had little influence, for it was numerically small, politically weak, and formed a strictly closed caste. Most land in the province of Holland was commercialized for cash crops and was owned by urban capitalists, not nobles; there were few links between Holland's nobility and the merchants. By 1650 the burgher families which had grown wealthy through commerce and become influential in government controlled the province of Holland, and to a large extent shaped national policies. The other six provinces were more rural and traditional in life style, had an active nobility, and played a small role in commerce and national politics.  Instead they concentrated on their flood protections and land reclamation projects.<ref>{{cite book|author=E.H. Kossmann, \"The Dutch Republic,\" in F. L.

Many immigrants came to the cities of Holland in the 17th and 18th century from the Protestant parts of Germany and elsewhere. The amount of first generation immigrants from outside the Netherlands in Amsterdam was nearly 50% in the 17th and 18th centuries. Indeed, Amsterdam's population consisted primarily of immigrants, if one includes second and third generation immigrants and migrants from the Dutch countryside. People in most parts of Europe were poor and many were unemployed. But in Amsterdam there was always work. Tolerance was important, because a continuous influx of immigrants was necessary for the economy. Travellers visiting Amsterdam reported their surprise at the lack of control over the influx.\n\n===Economic growth===\n{{main|Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)}}\nThe era of explosive economic growth is roughly coterminous with the period of social and cultural bloom that has been called the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and that actually formed the material basis for that cultural era.  Amsterdam became the hub of world trade, the center into which staples and luxuries flowed for sorting, processing, and distribution, and then reexported around Europe and the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joost Jonker|title=Merchants, bankers, middlemen: the Amsterdam money market during the first half of the 19th century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xwWAQAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=NEHA|page=32|isbn=9789057420016}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1585 through 1622 there was the rapid accumulation of trade capital, often brought in by refugee merchantes from Antwerp and other ports.  The money was typically invested in high-risk ventures like pioneering expeditions to the [[East Indies]] to engage in the [[spice trade]]. These ventures were soon consolidated in the [[Dutch East India Company]] ('''VOC'''). There were similar ventures in different fields however, like the trade on Russia and the [[Levant]]. The profits of these ventures were ploughed back in the financing of new trade, which led to its exponential growth.<ref>Charles R. Boxer, ''The Dutch Seaborne Empire 1600\u20131800'' (1965)</ref>\n\nRapid industrialization led to the rapid growth of the nonagricultural labor force and the increase in real wages during the same time. In the half-century between 1570 and 1620 this labor supply increased 3 percent per annum, a truly phenomenal growth. Despite this, nominal wages were repeatedly increased, outstripping price increases. In consequence, real wages for unskilled laborers were 62 percent higher in 1615\u20131619 than in 1575\u20131579.<ref>Jan de Vries and A. van der Woude, ''The First Modern Economy.

The city contributed the largest quota in taxes to the States of Holland which in turn contributed over half the quota to the States General. Amsterdam was also one of the most reliable in settling tax demands and therefore was able to use the threat to withhold such payments to good effect.<ref>Regin, Deric, ''Traders, Artists, Burghers: A Cultural History of Amsterdam in the 17th century'' Van Gorcum, 1976, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmsterdam was governed by a body of regents, a large, but closed, oligarchy with control over all aspects of the city's life, and a dominant voice in the foreign affairs of Holland. Only men with sufficient wealth and a long enough residence within the city could join the ruling class. The first step for an ambitious and wealthy merchant family was to arrange a marriage with a long-established regent family. In the 1670s one such union, that of the Trip family (the Amsterdam branch of the Swedish arms makers) with the son of Burgomaster Valckenier, extended the influence and patronage available to the latter and strengthened his dominance of the council. The oligarchy in Amsterdam thus gained strength from its breadth and openness. In the smaller towns family interest could unite members on policy decisions but contraction through intermarriage could lead to the degeneration of the quality of the members.\n\nIn Amsterdam the network was so large that members of the same family could be related to opposing factions and pursue widely separated interests.  The young men who had risen to positions of authority in the 1670s and 1680s consolidated their hold on office well into the 1690s and even the new century.<ref>Edwards, Elizabeth, \"Amsterdam and William III,\" ''History Today,'' (Dec 1993), Vol. 43, Issue 12 pp. 25\u201331</ref>\n\nAmsterdam's regents provided good services to residents.

The regents seized the opportunity: there would be no new stadtholder in Holland for 22 years. [[Johan de Witt]], a brilliant politician and diplomat, emerged as the dominant figure.  Princes of Orange became the stadtholder and an almost hereditary ruler in 1672 and 1748. The Dutch Republic of the United Provinces was a true republic from 1650 to 1672 and 1702\u20131748. These periods are called the [[First Stadtholderless Period]] and [[Second Stadtholderless Period]].\n\n===Anglo-Dutch wars===\n[[File:Vonstetinaseconddayof4daybattleof1666.jpg|thumb|\"The Second Day of the Four Day Battle of 1666\"]]\n{{main|Anglo-Dutch wars}}\nThe Republic and England were major rivals in world trade and naval power. Halfway through the 17th century the Republic's [[Royal Netherlands Navy|navy]] was the rival of Britain's Royal Navy as the most powerful navy in the world.

An incident at sea concerning the Act resulted in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], which lasted from 1652 to 1654, ending in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)]], which left the Navigation Act in effect.\n\nAfter the [[English Restoration]] in 1660, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] tried to serve his dynastic interests by attempting to make [[William III of England|Prince William III of Orange]], his nephew, [[stadtholder]] of the Republic, using some military pressure. King Charles thought a naval war would weaken the Dutch traders and strengthen the English economy and empire, so the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] was launched in 1665. At first many Dutch ships were captured and the English scored great victories.  However, the [[Raid on the Medway]], in June 1667, ended the war with a Dutch victory. The Dutch recovered their trade, while the English economy was seriously hurt and its treasury nearly bankrupt.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, \"Prizes and Profits: Dutch Maritime Trade during the Second Anglo-Dutch War,\" ''International Journal of Maritime History'' (2007) 19#2 pp 139\u201359.</ref> The greatly expanded Dutch navy was for years after the world's strongest.

England declared war on the Republic, (the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]), followed by France, [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Cologne]], which had all signed alliances against the Republic. France, Cologne and M\u00fcnster invaded the Republic. Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis, who had accomplished a diplomatic balancing act for a long time, were now the obvious scapegoats. They were lynched, and a new [[stadtholder]], William III, was appointed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johan-De-Witt|title=Johan De Witt|date=20 September 2018|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nAn Anglo-French attempt to land on the Dutch shore was barely repelled in three desperate naval battles under command of [[Admiral (Netherlands)|Admiral]] [[Michiel de Ruyter]]. The advance of French troops from the south was halted by a costly inundation of its own heartland, by breaching river dikes. With the aid of friendly German princes, the Dutch succeeded in fighting back [[Cologne]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], after which the peace was signed with both of them, although some territory in the east was lost forever. Peace was signed with England as well, in 1674 ([[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Second Treaty of Westminster]]). In 1678, peace was made with France at the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]], although France's Spanish and German allies felt betrayed by this.\n\nIn 1688, the relations with England reached crisis level once again. Stadtholder [[William III of England|William III]] decided he had to take a huge gamble when he was invited to invade England by Protestant British nobles feuding with William's father-in-law the Catholic [[James II of England]]. This led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] and cemented the principle of parliamentary rule and Protestant ascendency in England.  James fled to France, and William ascended to the English throne as co-monarch with his wife Mary, James' eldest daughter.  This manoeuvre secured England as a critical ally of the United Provinces in its ongoing wars with [[Louis XIV of France]].  William was the commander of the Dutch and English armies and fleets until his death in 1702.  During William's reign as King of England, his primary focus was leveraging British manpower and finances to aid the Dutch against the French.  The combination continued after his death as the combined Dutch, British, and mercenary army conquered Flanders and Brabant, and invaded French territory before the alliance collapsed in 1713 due to British political infighting.\n\n===Second Stadtholderless Period (1702\u20131747)===\n{{main| Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:Cornelis Troost02.jpg|thumb|The Inspectors of the Collegium Medicum in Amsterdam, by [[Cornelis Troost]], 1724. This period is known as the \"Periwig Era\".]]\n\nThe ''Second Stadtholderless Period'' ({{lang-nl|Tweede Stadhouderloze Tijdperk}}) is the designation in Dutch [[historiography]] of the period between the death of [[stadtholder]] [[William III of England|William III]] on 19 March<ref>This is the date from the [[Gregorian calendar]] that was followed at the time in the Dutch Republic; according to the [[Julian calendar]], still used in England at the time, the date of death was 8 March.</ref> 1702 and the appointment of [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] as stadtholder and captain general in all provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]] on 2 May 1747. During this period the office of stadtholder was left vacant in the provinces of [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], though in other provinces that office was filled by members of the House of Nassau-Dietz (later called Orange-Nassau) during various periods.\n\nDuring the period, the Republic lost its Great-Power status and its primacy in world trade, processes that went hand-in-hand, the latter causing the former. Though the economy declined considerably, causing deindustralization and deurbanization in the maritime provinces, a ''rentier''-class kept accumulating a large capital fund that formed the basis for the leading position the Republic achieved in the international capital market. A military crisis at the end of the period caused the fall of the [[Dutch States Party|States-Party regime]] and the restoration of the Stadtholderate in all provinces. However, though the new stadtholder acquired near-dictatorial powers, this did not improve the situation.\n\n===Economic decline after 1730===\nThe slow economic decline after 1730 was relative: other countries grew faster, eroding the Dutch lead and surpassing it. Wilson identifies three causes. Holland lost its world dominance in trade as competitors emerged and copied its practices, built their own ships and ports, and traded on their own account directly without going through Dutch intermediaries. Second, there was no growth in manufacturing, due perhaps to a weaker sense of industrial entrepreneurship and to the high wage scale. Third the wealthy turned their investments to foreign loans. This helped jump-start other nations and provided the Dutch with a steady income from collecting interest, but leaving them with few domestic sectors with a potential for rapid growth.<ref>C. H. Wilson, \"The Economic Decline of the Netherlands,\" ''Economic History Review'' (1939) 9#2 pp. 111\u2013127, esp. p. 113  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2590218 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic'', pp. 999\u20131018</ref>\n\nAfter the Dutch fleet declined, merchant interests became dependent on the goodwill of Britain. The main focus of Dutch leaders was reducing the country's considerable budget deficits. Dutch trade and shipping remained at a fairly steady level through the 18th century, but no longer had a near monopoly and also could not match growing English and French competition. The Netherlands lost its position as the trading centre of Northern Europe to London.\n\nAlthough the Netherlands remained wealthy, investors for the nation's money became more difficult to find. Some investment went into purchases of land for estates, but most went to foreign bonds and Amsterdam remained one of Europe's banking capitals.\n\n===Culture and society===\nDutch culture also declined both in the arts and sciences. Literature for example largely imitated English and French styles with little in the way of innovation or originality.  The most influential intellectual was [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647\u20131706), a Protestant refugee from France who settled in Rotterdam where he wrote the massive [[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]] (''Historical and Critical Dictionary'', 1696). It had a major impact on the thinking of [[The Enlightenment]] across Europe, giving an arsenal of weapons to critics who wanted to attack religion. It was an encyclopaedia of ideas that argued that most \"truths\" were merely opinions, and that gullibility and stubbornness were prevalent.<ref>Thomas M. Lennon and Michael Hickson, \"Pierre Bayle,\" ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (2012) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ online]</ref>\n\nLife for the average Dutchman became slower and more relaxed than in the 18th century. The upper and middle classes continued to enjoy prosperity and high living standards. The drive to succeed seemed less urgent. Unskilled laborers remained locked in poverty and hardship. The large underclass of unemployed beggars and riffraff required government and private charity to survive.\n\nReligious life became more relaxed as well. Catholics grew from 18% to 23% of the population during the 18th century and enjoyed greater tolerance, even as they continued to be outside the political system. They became divided by the feud between moralistic Jansenists (who denied free will) and orthodox believers. One group of Jansenists formed a splinter sect, the [[Old Catholic Church]] in 1723. The upper classes willingly embraced the ideas of the Enlightenment, tempered by the tolerance that meant less hostility to organized religion compared to France.<ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic'', pp. 1021, 1033\u201336</ref>\n\n===The Orangist revolution (1747\u20131751)===\n{{Main|Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:StadhouderWillemIV(4).jpg|thumb|left|[[William IV, Prince of Orange]], stadholder from 1747 to 1751 CE.]]\n[[File:Willem v (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Willem V of Orange]], stadholder from 1751 to 1806, and [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina of Prussia]] with three of their five children. From left to right: the future [[William I of the Netherlands]], Frederick, and Frederica Louise Wilhelmina.]]\n\nDuring the term of [[Anthonie van der Heim]] as [[Grand Pensionary]] from 1737 to 1746, the Republic slowly drifted into the [[War of Austrian Succession]]. This started as a Prusso-Austrian conflict, but eventually all the neighbours of the [[Dutch Republic]] became involved. On one side were Prussia, France and their allies and on the other Austria, Britain (after 1744) and their allies. At first the Republic strove to remain neutral in this European conflict, but it maintained garrisons in a number of fortresses in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. French grievances and threats spurred the Republic into bring its army up to European standards (84,000 men in 1743).<ref name=\"Israel\">Israel, Jonathan ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (\"Oxford\" Oxford U.P. 1998)  pp. 996\u201397, 1069\u201387</ref>\n\nIn 1744 and 1745 the French attacked Dutch fortresses at [[Menen]] and [[Tournai]]. This prompted the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1745 to join the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]], but this alliance was severely defeated at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in May 1745. In 1746 the French occupied most of the large cities in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Then, in April 1747, apparently as an exercise in armed diplomacy, a relatively small French military force occupied [[Zeelandic Flanders]], part of the Dutch Republic.<ref name=\"Israel\"/>\n\nThis relatively innocuous invasion fully exposed the rot underlying the Dutch defences.  The consequences were spectacular.  Still mindful of the French invasion in the [[Rampjaar|\"Disaster Year\" of 1672]], many fearful people clamored for the restoration of the stadtholderate.<ref name=Israel/> [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], had been waiting impatiently in the wings since acquiring his princely title in 1732.  Over the next year he and his supporters engaged in a number of political battles in various provinces and towns in the Netherlands to wrest control from the [[regenten|regents]]. The aim was for William IV to obtain a firm grip on government patronage and place loyal officials in all strategic government positions. Eventually he managed to achieve this aim in all provinces.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n[[Willem Bentinck van Rhoon]] was a prominent Orangist. People like Bentinck hoped that gathering the reins of power in the hands of a single \"eminent head\" would soon help restore the state of the Dutch economy and finances. The regents they opposed included the Grand Pensionary [[Jacob Gilles]] and Adriaen van der Hoop. This popular revolt had religious, anti-Catholic and democratic overtones and sometimes involved mob violence. It eventually involved political agitation by [[Daniel Raap]], [[Jean Rousset de Missy]] and the [[Doelisten]], attacks on [[Tax farming|tax farmers]] ([[pachtersoproer]]), religious agitation for enforcement of the Sabbath laws and preference for followers of [[Gisbertus Voetius]] and various demands by the civil militia.<ref name=Israel/>\n\nThe war against the French was itself brought to a not-too-devastating end for the [[Dutch Republic]] with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]]. The French retreated of their own accord from the Dutch frontier. William IV died unexpectedly, at the age of 40, on 22 October 1751.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n===Regency and indolent rule (1752\u20131779)===\nHis son, [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], was 3 years old when his father died, and a long regency characterised by corruption and misrule began. His mother delegated most of the powers of the regency to Bentinck and her favorite, [[Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]. All power was concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few, including the Frisian nobleman [[Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins]].<ref name=Israel/> Still a teenager, William V assumed the position of [[stadtholder]] in 1766, the last to hold that office. In 1767, he married [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia]], the daughter of [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William of Prussia]], niece of [[Frederick the Great]].\n\nThe position of the Dutch during the [[American War of Independence]] was one of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. William V, leading the pro-British faction within the government, blocked attempts by pro-independence, and later pro-French, elements to drag the government to war. However, things came to a head with the Dutch attempt to join the Russian-led [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]], leading to the outbreak of the disastrous [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1780. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], the impoverished nation grew restless under William's rule.\n\nAn English historian summed him up uncharitably as \"a Prince of the profoundest lethargy and most abysmal stupidity.\"<ref>Fulford, Roger ''Royal Dukes'' William Collins and Son London 1933</ref> And yet he would guide his family through the difficult French-Batavian period and his son would be crowned king.\n\n===Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780\u20131784)===\n{{Main|Fourth Anglo-Dutch War}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Dogger Bank 5 August 1781.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)]] by [[Thomas Luny]].]]\nThe [[Fourth Anglo\u2013Dutch War]] (1780\u20131784) was a conflict between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]]. The war, tangentially related to the [[American Revolutionary War]], broke out over British and Dutch disagreements on the legality and conduct of Dutch trade with Britain's enemies in that war.\n\nAlthough the Dutch Republic did not enter into a formal alliance with the United States and their allies, U.S. ambassador (and future President) [[John Adams]] managed to establish diplomatic relations with the Dutch Republic, making it the second European country to diplomatically recognize the [[Continental Congress]] in April 1782. In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce was concluded as well.\n\nMost of the war consisted of a series of largely successful British operations against Dutch colonial economic interests, although British and Dutch naval forces also [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)|met once off the Dutch coast]].  The war ended disastrously for the Dutch and exposed the weakness of the political and economic foundations of the country.<ref>Edler, Friedrich, ''The Dutch Republic and The American Revolution'' (1911, reprinted 2001) Honolulu, Hawaii: University Press of the Pacific, p. 88</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1784)]], according to [[Fernand Braudel]], \"sounded the knell of Dutch greatness.\"<ref>[[Fernand Braudel|Braudel, Fernand]], ''The Perspective of the World'' vol.

The [[French Revolution]] resulted first in the establishment of a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] (1795\u20131806), then the creation of the [[Kingdom of Holland]], ruled by a member of the [[House of Bonaparte]] (1806\u20131810), and finally annexation by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1810\u20131813).\n\n===Patriot rebellion and its suppression (1785\u20131795)===\n{{main|Batavian Revolution}}\n[[File:Jonas Zeuner - Vuurgevecht aan de Vaartse Rijn.jpg|thumb|Firefight on the [[Vaartse Rijn]] at [[Jutphaas]] on 9 May 1787. The pro-revolutionary Utrecht [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] are on the right; the troops of [[stadholder]] [[William V, Prince of Orange]] on the left. (Painted by Jonas Zeuner, 1787)]]\n\nInfluenced by the [[American Revolution]], the [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] sought a more democratic form of government. The opening shot of this revolution is often considered to be the 1781 publication of a manifesto called ''[[Aan het Volk van Nederland]]'' (\"To the People of the Netherlands\") by [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], who would become an influential leader of the Patriot movement. Their aim was to reduce corruption and the power held by the [[stadtholder]], [[William V, Prince of Orange]].\n\nSupport for the Patriots came mostly from the middle class. They formed [[militia]]s called ''[[exercitiegenootschap]]pen''. In 1785, there was an open Patriot rebellion, which took the form of an armed insurrection by local militias in certain Dutch towns, ''Freedom'' being the rallying cry. [[Herman Willem Daendels]] attempted to organise an overthrow of various municipal governments ([[vroedschap]]). The goal was to oust government officials and force new elections. \"Seen as a whole this revolution was a string of violent and confused events, accidents, speeches, rumours, bitter enmities and armed confrontations\", wrote French historian [[Fernand Braudel]], who saw it as a forerunner of the [[French Revolution]].\n\nIn 1785 [[William V, Prince of Orange|the stadholder]] left The Hague and moved his court to [[Nijmegen]] in [[Guelders]], a city remote from the heart of Dutch political life. In June 1787, his energetic wife [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina]] (the sister of [[Frederick William II of Prussia]]) tried to travel to [[The Hague]]. Outside [[Schoonhoven]], she was stopped by Patriot militiamen and taken to a farm near [[Goejanverwellesluis]]. Within two days she was forced to return to Nijmegen, an insult not unnoticed in Prussia.\n\nThe House of Orange reacted with severity, relying on [[Prussia]]n troops led by [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick]] and a small contingent of British troops to [[Prussian invasion of Holland|suppress the rebellion]]. Dutch banks at this time still held much of the world's [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Government-sponsored banks owned up to 40% of Great Britain's [[national debt]] and there were close connections to the [[House of Stuart]]. The stadholder had supported British policies after the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThis severe military response overwhelmed the Patriots and put the stadholder firmly back in control. A small unpaid Prussian army was billeted in the Netherlands and supported themselves by looting and extortion. The exercitiegenootschappen continued urging citizens to resist the government. They distributed pamphlets, formed \"Patriot Clubs\" and held public [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s. The government responded by pillaging those towns where opposition continued. Five leaders were sentenced to death (but fled first). Lynchings also occurred. For a while, no one dared appear in public without an orange cockade to show their support for [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangism]]. Many Patriots, perhaps around 40,000 in all, fled to Brabant, France (especially [[Dunkirk]] and [[Saint-Omer|St. Omer]]) and elsewhere. However, before long the French became involved in Dutch politics and the tide turned.\n\n===Batavian Republic (1795\u20131806)===\n{{Main|Batavian Republic}}\n[[File:Vrijheidsboom.jpg|left|thumb|Liberty tree erected in Dam Square in Amsterdam, 1795 by H. Numan.]]\nThe [[French Revolution]] was popular, and numerous underground clubs were promoting it when in January 1795 the [[Flanders Campaign|French army invaded]]. The underground rose up, overthrew the municipal and provincial governments, and proclaimed the [[Batavian Republic]] ({{lang-nl|Bataafse Republiek}}) [[Batavian Revolution in Amsterdam|in Amsterdam]]. Stadtholder William V fled to England and the States General dissolved itself. The new government was virtually a puppet of France.<ref>C. Cook & J. Stevenson, ''The routledge companion to European history since 1763'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2005), p. 66; J. Dunn, ''Democracy: A history'' (NY: Atlantic Books, 2005), p. 86.</ref>  The Batavian Republic enjoyed widespread support and sent soldiers to fight in the French armies. The 1799 [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] was repulsed by Batavian\u2013French forces. Nevertheless, Napoleon replaced it because the regime of [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]] (1805\u201306) was insufficiently docile.<ref>[[R.R. Palmer|Palmer, R.R.]] \"Much in Little: The Dutch Revolution of 1795,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (1954) 26#1 pp. 15\u201335 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874870 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state.  The 1798 constitution had a genuinely democratic character, though a coup d'\u00e9tat of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power. Ministerial government was introduced for the first time in Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.  Meanwhile, the exiled stadholder [[Kew Letters|handed over the Dutch colonies]] in \"safekeeping\" to Great Britain and ordered the colonial governors to comply.  This permanently ended the colonial empire in Guyana, Ceylon and the Cape Colony. The Dutch East Indies was returned to the Netherlands under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].\n\n===Kingdom of Holland to William I (1806\u20131815)===\n[[File:France L-2 (1812)-fr.svg|thumb|Administrative divisions of the [[First French Empire]] in 1812, illustrating the incorporation of the Netherlands and its internal reorganisation.]]\n{{Main|Kingdom of Holland}}\n\nIn 1806 Napoleon restyled the Netherlands (along with a small part of what is now Germany) into the [[Kingdom of Holland]], putting his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), on the throne. The new king was unpopular, but he was willing to cross his brother for the benefit of his new kingdom. Napoleon forced his abdication in 1810 and incorporated the Netherlands directly into the [[First French Empire|French empire]], imposing economic controls and conscription of all young men as soldiers. When the French retreated from the northern provinces in 1813, a [[Driemanschap|Triumvirate]] took over at the helm of a [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|provisional government]].  Although most members of the provisional government had been among the men who had driven out William V 18 years earlier, the leaders of the provisional government knew that any new regime would have to be headed by his son, William Frederick.  They also knew that it would be better in the long term if the Dutch people themselves installed the prince, rather than have him imposed on the country by the anti-French alliance.  Accordingly, the Triumvirate called William Frederick back on 30 November and offered him the crown.  He refused, but instead proclaimed himself \"[[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|hereditary sovereign prince]]\" on 6 December.\n\nThe [[Great Powers]] had [[Eight Articles of London|secretly agreed]] to merge the northern Netherlands with the more populated [[Austrian Netherlands]] and the smaller [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] into a single constitutional monarchy.  Having a stronger country on France's northern border was considered (especially by [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander]]) to be an important part of the strategy to keep France's power in check.  In 1814, William Frederick gained sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands and Li\u00e8ge as well. Thus, William Frederick had fulfilled his family's three-century quest to unite the Low Countries under a single rule.\n\nOn 15 March 1815; with the encouragement of the powers gathered at the [[Congress of Vienna]], William Frederick raised the Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]].  This was made official later in 1815, when the Low Countries were formally recognized as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The crown was made a hereditary office of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].\n\n==United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131839)==\n{{Main|United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy}}\n[[File:LandingWillemI.jpg|thumb|left|''Landing of the future king [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] at Scheveningen on 30 November 1813'' by Johan Willem Heyting (1915\u20131995).]]\n[[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] became king and also became the hereditary [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], that was part of the Netherlands but at the same time part of the German Confederation. The newly created country had two capitals: [[Amsterdam]] and [[Brussels]]. The new nation had two equal parts. The north (Netherlands proper) had 2 million people. They spoke chiefly Dutch but were divided religiously between a Protestant majority and a large Catholic minority. The south (which would be known as \"Belgium\" after 1830) had a population of 3.4&nbsp;million people. Nearly all were Catholic, but it was divided between French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemings. The upper and middle classes in the south were mostly French-speaking. About 60,000 Belgians were eligible to vote, compared to about 80,000 Dutchmen.  Officially Amsterdam was the capital, but in a compromise the government met alternately in Brussels and The Hague.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 112\u201333</ref>\n\n[[Adolphe Quetelet]] (1796\u20131874), the great Belgian statistician, calculated that the new nation was significantly better off than other states. Mortality was low, the food supply was good, education was good, public awareness was high and the charity rate was the highest in the world. The best years were in the mid-1820s.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 115\u201316</ref>\n\nThe quality of schooling was dismal, however. According to Schama, about 1800 the local school teacher was the \"humble auxiliary of the local priest. Despised by his co-villagers and forced to subsist on the gleanings of the peasants, he combined drumming the catechism into the heads of his unruly charges with the duties of winding the town clock, ringing the church bells or digging its graves. His principal use to the community was to keep its boys out of mischief when there was no labour for them in the fields, or setting the destitute orphans of the town to the 'useful arts' of picking tow or spinning crude flax. As one would expect, standards in such an occupation were dismal.\"<ref>Simon Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" ''History of Education'' (1972) 1:1, pp. 81\u201389 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0046760720010106 link]</ref> But in 1806 the Dutch, led by Adriaan van den Ende, energetically set out to modernise education, focusing on a new system for advanced training of teachers with an elaborate system of inspectors, training courses, teacher examinations and teaching societies.  By 1826, although much smaller than France, the Dutch national government was spending 12 times more than Paris on education.<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\n===Constitutional monarchy===\n[[File:Vereinigteskoenigreich.png|thumb|left|'''The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)|Limburg]] in 1839'''<br>'''1''', '''2''' and '''3''' United Kingdom of the Netherlands (until 1830)<br>'''1''' and '''2''' [[Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (after 1830)<br>'''2''' [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)]] (in the German Confederacy after 1839 as compensation for Waals-Luxemburg)<br>'''3''' and '''4''' [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] (after 1839)<br>'''4''' and '''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (borders until 1839) <br>'''4''' [[Luxembourg (province)|Province of Luxembourg]] (Waals-Luxemburg, to Belgium in 1839)<br>'''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (German Luxemburg; borders after 1839)<br>In blue, the borders of the [[German Confederation]].]]\n\nWilliam I, who reigned from 1815 to 1840, had great constitutional power. An [[enlightened despot]], he accepted the modernizing transformations of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] as a political class and elevated a large number of people to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house. The old provinces were reestablished in name only. The government was now fundamentally unitary, and all authority flowed from the center.\n\nWilliam I was a Calvinist and unsympathetic to the religious culture and practices of the Catholic majority.  He promulgated the \"Fundamental Law of Holland\", with some modifications. This entirely overthrew the old order of things in the southern Netherlands: it abolished the privileges of the Catholic Church, and guaranteed equal protection to every religious creed and the enjoyment of the same civil and political rights to every subject of the king. It reflected the spirit of the French Revolution and in so doing did not please the Catholic bishops in the south, who had detested the Revolution.<ref>Godefroid Kurth, \"Belgium\" in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02395a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907) online]</ref>\n\nWilliam I actively promoted economic modernization. The first 15 years of the Kingdom showed progress and prosperity, as industrialization proceeded rapidly in the south, where the [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed entrepreneurs and labor to combine in a new textile industry, powered by local coal mines. There was little industry in the northern provinces, but most overseas colonies were restored, and highly profitable trade resumed after a 25-year hiatus. Economic liberalism combined with moderate monarchical authoritarianism to accelerate the adaptation of the Netherlands to the new conditions of the 19th century. The country prospered until a crisis arose in relations with the southern provinces.\n\n===Belgium breaks away===\n{{main|Belgian Revolution}}\nWilliam was determined to create a united people, even though the north and south had drifted far apart in the past three centuries. Protestants were the largest denomination in the North (population 2 million), but formed a quarter of the population in the overwhelmingly Catholic South (population 3.5&nbsp;million). Nevertheless, Protestants dominated William's government and army. The Catholics did not consider themselves an integral part of the United Netherlands, preferring instead to identify with mediaeval Dutch culture. Other factors that contributed to this feeling were economic (the South was industrialising, the North had always been a merchants' nation) and linguistic (French was spoken in [[Wallonia]] and a large part of the bourgeoisie in Flemish cities).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAfter having been dominant for centuries, the French-speaking elite in the Southern Netherlands now felt like second-class citizens.\nIn the Catholic South,<ref>see [http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/lowcountries/neth18151830.html online maps 1830, 1839]</ref> William's policies were unpopular. The French-speaking Walloons strenuously rejected his attempt to make Dutch the universal language of government, while the population of [[Flanders]] was divided. Flemings in the south spoke a Dutch dialect (\"Flemish\") and welcomed the encouragement of Dutch with a revival of literature and popular culture. Other Flemings, notably the educated bourgeoisie, preferred to speak French. Although Catholics possessed legal equality, they resented their subordination to a government that was fundamentally Protestant in spirit and membership after having been the state church for centuries in the south. Few Catholics held high office in state or army. Furthermore, political liberals in the south complained about the king's authoritarian methods. All southerners complained of underrepresentation in the national legislature. Although the south was industrializing and was more prosperous than the north the accumulated grievances allowed the multiple opposition forces to coalesce. \n[[File:R\u00e9volution belge de 1830 - La rue de Flandre le jeudi 23 septembre 1830.jpg|thumb|Fighting between Belgian rebels and the Dutch military expedition in [[Brussels]] in September 1830]]\nThe outbreak of [[July Revolution|revolution in France]] in 1830 was a signal for action, at first on behalf of autonomy for Belgium, as the southern provinces were now called, and later on behalf of total independence. William dithered and his half-hearted efforts to reconquer Belgium were thwarted both by the efforts of the Belgians themselves and by the diplomatic opposition of the great powers.\n\nAt the [[London Conference of 1830]], the chief powers of Europe ordered (in November 1830) an armistice between the Dutch and the Belgians. The first draft for a treaty of separation of Belgium and the Netherlands was rejected by the Belgians. A second draft (June 1831) was rejected by William I, who resumed hostilities. Franco-British intervention forced William to withdraw Dutch forces from Belgium late in 1831, and in 1833 an armistice of indefinite duration was concluded. Belgium was effectively independent but William's attempts to recover Luxembourg and Limburg led to renewed tension. The London Conference of 1838\u201339 prepared the final Dutch-Belgian [[Treaty of London (1839)|separation treaty of 1839]]. It divided Luxembourg and Limburg between the Dutch and Belgian crowns. The Kingdom of the Netherlands thereafter was made up of the 11 northern provinces.<ref>{{cite book|first = J. C.

Griffiths argues that certain government policies facilitated the emergence of a national economy in the 19th century. They included the abolition of internal tariffs and guilds, a unified coinage system, modern methods of tax collection, standardized weights and measures, and the building of many roads, canals, and railroads.  However, compared to Belgium, which was leading in industrialization on the Continent, the Netherlands moved slowly. Possible explanations for this difference are the higher costs due to geography and high wages, and the emphasis of entrepreneurs on trade rather than industry.<ref>Richard T. Griffiths, ''Industrial Retardation in the Netherlands, 1830\u20131850'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1979).</ref>\nFor example, in the Dutch coastal provinces agricultural productivity was relatively high. Hence, industrial growth arrived relatively late \u2013 after 1860 \u2013 because incentives to move to labour-intensive industry were quite weak.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The number of people employed in agriculture decreased, while the country made a strong effort to revive its stake in the highly competitive shipping and trade business. The Netherlands lagged behind Belgium until the late 19th century in industrialization, and caught up around 1920. Major industries included textiles and (later) the great Philips industrial conglomerate. Rotterdam became a major shipping and manufacturing center.<ref>{{cite book|author=Loyen, Reginald|title=Struggling for Leadership: Antwerp-Rotterdam Port.

Born in [[Zundert|Groot-Zundert]], van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on [[20th-century art]].]]\n\nIn 1840 William I abdicated in favor of his son, [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]], who attempted to carry on the policies of his father in the face of a powerful liberal movement. In 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|unrest broke out all over Europe]]. Although there were no major events in the Netherlands, these foreign developments persuaded King [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] to agree to liberal and democratic reform. That same year [[Johan Rudolf Thorbecke]], a prominent liberal, was asked by the king to draft a constitution that would turn the Netherlands into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The new constitution was proclaimed on 3 November 1848. It severely limited the king's powers (making the government accountable only to an elected parliament), and it protected [[civil liberties]]. The new liberal constitution, which put the government under the control of the States General, was accepted by the legislature in 1848.  The relationship between monarch, government and parliament has remained essentially unchanged ever since.\n\nWilliam II was succeeded by [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] in 1849. The new king reluctantly chose Thorbecke to head the new government, which introduced several liberal measures, notably the extension of suffrage. However, Thorbecke's government soon fell, when Protestants rioted against the Vatican's reestablishment of the Catholic episcopate, in abeyance since the 16th century. A conservative government was formed, but it did not undo the liberal measures, and the Catholics were finally given equality after two centuries of subordination. Dutch political history from the middle of the 19th century until the [[First World War]] was fundamentally one of the extension of liberal reforms in government, the reorganization and modernization of the Dutch economy, and the rise of trade unionism and socialism as working-class movements independent of traditional liberalism.  The growth in prosperity was enormous, as real per capita GNP soared from 106 guilders in 1804 to 403 in 1913.<ref>E. H. Kossmann, ''The Low Countries 1780\u20131940'' (1978) ch 5</ref>\n\n===Religion and pillarisation===\n[[File:Nederlandgodsdienst1849.PNG|thumb|Religion in the Netherlands in 1849.\n{{legend|#008000|[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|[[Protestantism]] ([[Calvinism|Calvinist]])}}]]\nReligion was a contentious issue with repeated struggles over the relations of church and state in the field of education. In 1816, the government took full control of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (''Nederlands Hervormde Kerk''). In 1857, all religious instruction was ended in public schools, but the various churches set up their own schools, and even universities. Dissident members broke away from the Dutch Reformed Church in the Secession of 1834. They were harassed by the government under an onerous Napoleonic law prohibiting gatherings of more than 20 members without a permit. After the harassment ended in the 1850s, a number of these dissidents eventually created the Christian Reformed Church in 1869; thousands migrated to Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa in the United States. By 1900, the dissidents represented about 10% of the population, compared to 45% of the population who were in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], which continued to be the only church to receive state money.<ref>Corwin, \"Holland\" [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc05.h.ix.html  ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,'' (1914) 5:319\u201322]</ref>\n\nAt mid-century, most Dutch belonged either to the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] or dissenter groups that separated from it (around 55%), or the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (35% to 40%), together with smaller [[Protestant]] (for example, [[Lutheran]]) and Jewish groups. A large and powerful sector of nominal Protestants were in fact secular liberals seeking to minimize religious influence. In reaction a novel alliance developed with Catholics and devout Calvinists joining against secular liberals. The Catholics, who had been loosely allied with the liberals in earlier decades, turned against them on the issue of state support, which the liberals insisted should be granted only to public schools, and joined with Protestant political parties in demanding equal state support to schools maintained by religious groups.<ref>J. C. H. Blom and E. Lamberts, eds. ''History of the Low Countries'' (1999) pp. 387\u2013403</ref>\n\nThe Netherlands remained one of the most tolerant countries in Europe towards religious belief, although conservative Protestants objected to the liberalization of the Dutch Reformed Church during the 19th century and faced opposition from the government when they tried to establish separate communities (Catholics and other non-Protestants were left unmolested by Dutch authorities). Some moved to the United States as a consequence, but as the century drew to a close, religious persecution had totally ceased.\n\n[[File:Old-Amsterdam 1891-street-1.jpg|thumb|Street in Amsterdam in 1891 ({{Interlanguage link multi|Vijzelstraat|nl}} looking towards Muntplein).]]\nDutch social and political life became divided by fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society pillarized into three separate parts based on religion.  The economy was not affected. One of the people most responsible for designing pillarization was [[Abraham Kuyper]] (1837\u20131920), a leading politician, [[neo-Calvinist]] theologian, and journalist. Kuyper established orthodox Calvinist organizations, and also provided a theoretical framework by developing such concepts as \"sphere-sovereignty\" that celebrated Dutch society as a society of organized minorities. ''Verzuiling'' (\"pillarization\" or \"pluralism\") after 1850 became the solution to the danger of internal conflict. Everyone was part of one (and only one) pillar (''zuil'') based chiefly on religion (Protestant, Catholic, secular). The secular pillar eventually split into a socialist/working class pillar and a liberal (pro-business) secular pillar. Each pillar built a full set of its own social organizations, including churches (for the religious pillars), political parties, schools, universities,<ref>The oldest universities, in Leiden, Utrecht, and Groningen, had a secular-liberal character. In 1880 Kuyper opened a Protestant university in Amsterdam and in 1923 a Catholic one opened in Nijmegen. The Amsterdam municipal university, which opened in 1877, leaned toward secular-socialism, but was formally neutral.</ref> labor unions, sport clubs, boy scout unions and other youth clubs, and newspapers. The members of different ''zuilen'' lived in close proximity in cities and villages, spoke the same language, and did business with one another, but seldom interacted informally and rarely intermarried.<ref>A Dutch rhyme forbade intermarriage thus: ''Twee geloven op \u00e9\u00e9n kussen, daar slaapt de Duivel tussen'' [Two religions on one pillow, there the Devil sleeps in between.] On the decline of intermarriage see Erik Beekink, et al. \"Changes in Choice of Spouse as an Indicator of a Society in a State of Transition: Woerden, 1830\u20131930.\" ''Historical Social Research'' 1998 23(1\u20132): 231\u201353. {{ISSN|0172-6404}}</ref> In politics Kuyper formed the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) in 1879, and headed it until 1905.\n\nPillarization was officially recognized in the [[Pacification of 1917]], whereby socialists and liberals achieved their goal of universal male suffrage and the religious parties were guaranteed equal funding of all schools.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' pp-57</ref> In 1930 radio was organized so that each pillar had full control of its own network. When television began in the late 1940s the pillars divided up time equally on the one station.

The [[Hague School]] brought a revival of realist painting, 1860\u20131890.

''The Age of Van Gogh: Dutch Painting 1880\u20131895'' (1997)</ref>  Literature, music, architecture and science also flourished. A representative leader of science was [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]] (1837\u20131923), a working class youth who taught himself physics, earned a PhD at the nation's leading school Leiden University, and in 1910 won the Nobel Prize for his discoveries in thermodynamics. [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1853\u20131928) and his student [[Pieter Zeeman]] (1865\u20131943) shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in physics.

She would rule the Netherlands for 58 years. On her accession to the throne, the [[personal union]] between the Netherlands and Luxembourg ended because Luxembourg law excluded women from rule. Her remote cousin [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] became the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nThis was a time of further growth and colonial development, but it was marked by the difficulties of the [[World War I]] (in which the Netherlands was neutral) \nand the [[Great Depression]]. The Dutch population grew rapidly in the 20th century, as death rates fell, more lands were opened up, and industrialisation created urban jobs.<ref>Michael Wintle, ''An Economic and Social History of the Netherlands, 1800\u20131920: Demographic, Economic, and Social Transition'' (2000) p. 342</ref> Between 1900 and 1950 the population doubled from 5.1 to 10 million people.<ref name=\"CBS Statline - Population; history\">[http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLEN&PA=37556ENG&D1=0-44,53-60&D2=1,11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91,101&LA=EN&VW=T CBS Statline \u2013 Population; history].

It was smaller in 1945 than in 1815 because the Netherlands was the only colonial power that did not expand into Africa or anywhere else.  The empire was run from Batavia (in Java), where the governor and his technical experts had almost complete authority with little oversight from the Hague. Successive governors improved their bureaucratic and military controls, and allowed very little voice to the locals until the 1920s.<ref>Jean Gelman Taylor, ''The Social World of Batavia: Europeans and Eurasians in Colonial Indonesia'' (1983)</ref>\n\nThe colony brought economic opportunity to the mother country and there was little concern at the time about it. One exception came in 1860 when Eduard Dekker, under the pen name \"[[Multatuli]]\" wrote the novel ''[[Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company]]'', one of the most notable books in the history of [[Dutch literature]]. He criticized the exploitation of the colony and as well had harsh words about the indigenous princes who collaborated with the governor. The book helped inspire the Indonesian independence movement in the mid-20th century as well as the \"[[Fair trade]]\" movement for coffee at the end of the century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Antony Wild|title=Coffee: A Dark History|url=https://archive.org/details/coffeedarkhistor0000wild|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=W.

As the map shows, the Dutch slowly expanded their holdings from their base in Java to include all of modern Indonesia by 1920. Most islands were not a problem but there was a long, costly campaign against the [[Aceh Sultanate|Achin (Aceh)]] state in northern Sumatra.\n\nThe Netherlands had not fought a major military campaign since the 1760s, and the strength of its armed forces had gradually dwindled. The Dutch decided not to ally themselves with anyone, and kept out of all European wars especially the First World War that swirled about it.<ref name = \"hvhqei\">Maartje M.

It supplied many essential raw materials to Germany such as rubber, tin, quinine, oil and food. The British used its blockade to limit supplies that the Dutch could pass on.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> There were other factors that made it expedient for both the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Central Powers]] for the Netherlands to remain neutral. The Netherlands controlled the mouths of the [[Scheldt]], the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse River]]s. Germany had an interest in the Rhine since it ran through the industrial areas of the [[Ruhr]] and connected it with the Dutch port of Rotterdam. Britain had an interest in the Scheldt River and the Meuse flowed from France. All countries had an interest in keeping the others out of the Netherlands so that no one's interests could be taken away or be changed. If one country were to have invaded the Netherlands, another would certainly have counterattacked to defend their own interest in the rivers. It was too big a risk for any of the belligerent nations and none wanted to risk fighting on another front.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/>\n\n[[File:Afsluitdijk 01.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Afsluitdijk]], the dike closing off the [[Zuiderzee]], was constructed between 1927 and 1933.

In 1918, mutinies broke out in the military. Food shortages were extensive, due to the control the belligerents exercised over the Dutch. Each wanted their share of Dutch produce. As a result, the price of potatoes rose sharply because Britain had demanded so much from the Dutch. Food riots even broke out in the country.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> A big problem was smuggling. When Germany had conquered Belgium, the Allies saw it as enemy territory and stopped exporting to Belgium. Food became scarce for the Belgian people, since the Germans seized all food. This gave the Dutch the opportunity to start to smuggle. This, however, caused great problems in the Netherlands, including inflation and further food shortages. The Allies demanded that the Dutch stop the smuggling, and the government took measures to remain neutral. The government placed many cities under 'state of siege'. On 8 January 1916, a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=on}} zone was created by the government along the border. In that zone, goods could be moved on main roads with a permit.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> German authorities in Belgium had an electrified fence erected all along the Belgian\u2013Dutch border that caused many refugees from Belgium to lose their lives.

In 1919, women also obtained the right to vote for the first time in history.\n\nThe worldwide [[Great Depression]] which began after the tumultuous events of [[Black Tuesday]] in 1929, that continued into the early-1930s had crippling effects on the Dutch economy; lasting longer than in most other European countries. The long duration of the Great Depression in the Netherlands is often explained by the very strict fiscal policy of the Dutch government at the time, and its decision to adhere to the [[gold standard]] for much longer than most of its trading partners. The Great Depression led to high unemployment and widespread poverty, as well as increasing social unrest.\n\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany did not go unnoticed in the Netherlands, and there was growing concern at the possibility of armed conflict, but most Dutch people expected that Germany would again respect Dutch neutrality.\n\nThere were separate fascist and Nazi movements in the 1930s. Dutch Fascists admired Mussolini's Italy and called for a traditional corporate ideology. The membership was small, elitist and ineffective. The pro-Nazi movement, however, won support from [[Berlin]] and attempted to build a mass base by 1935. It failed because most Dutch rejected its racial ideology and calls for violence.<ref>Erik Hansen, \"Fascism and Nazism in the Netherlands 1929\u201339,\" ''European Studies Review'' (1981) 11#3 pp. 355\u201385.

The budget was further increased in 1938 (after the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] and occupation of the Czech [[Sudetenland]]). The colonial government also increased its military budget because of increasing tensions with Japan. The Dutch did not mobilise their armed forces until shortly before France and the UK declared war on Germany in September 1939 after the invasion of Poland. Neutrality was still the official policy, but the Dutch government tried to buy new arms for their badly equipped forces; however, a considerable share of ordered weapons never arrived.\n\n==The Second World War (1939\u20131945)==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)}}\n\n===Nazi invasion and occupation===\n{{Main|Battle of the Netherlands|Rotterdam Blitz|Dutch resistance}}\n[[File:Rotterdam, Laurenskerk, na bombardement van mei 1940.jpg|thumb|Rotterdam was destroyed by German bombers on 14 May 1940. 814 people died in the [[Rotterdam Blitz]].]]\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Netherlands once again declared its [[neutral country|neutrality]]. However, on 10 May 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] launched an attack on the Netherlands and Belgium and quickly overran most of the two countries. Fighting against the Dutch army proved to be more of a burden than foreseen; the northern attack was stopped dead, the one in the middle came to a grinding halt near the Grebbeberg and many airborne assault troops were killed and taken prisoner in the west of the country.\nOnly in the south were defences broken, but the one passage over the River Maas at Rotterdam was held by the Dutch. By 14 May, fighting in many locations had ceased and the German army could make little or no headway, so the [[Luftwaffe]] bombed [[Rotterdam]], the second-largest city of the Netherlands, killing about 900 people, destroying most of the inner city and leaving 78,000 people homeless.\n\nFollowing the bombing and German threats of the same treatment for [[Utrecht]], the Netherlands capitulated on 15 May, except for the province of [[Zeeland]] where French and French-Moroccan troops stood side-by-side with the Dutch army. Still, the Dutch Royal Family along with some armed forces fled to the United Kingdom. Some members of the Dutch Royal Family eventually moved to [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada until the Netherlands was liberated five years later.  [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands|Princess Margriet]] was born in Canada, during the period the family spent in exile.\n\nResentment of the Germans grew as the occupation became more harsh, prompting many Dutch in the latter years of the war to join the [[Dutch resistance|resistance]]. But collaboration was not uncommon either; many thousands of young Dutch males volunteered for combat service on the Russian Front with the [[Waffen-SS]] and many companies worked for the German occupiers.\n\n===Holocaust in the Netherlands===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Exhibit of the Anne Frank Zentrum.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Yellow [[Star of David]] with ''Jood'', the Dutch word for \"[[Jew]]\".\n| image2 = WWII netherlands persoonsbewijs.jpg\n| width2 = 165\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Identification papers]] issued to Dutch people during the war.\n| footer = \n}}\nAbout 140,000 Jews lived in the Netherlands at the beginning of the war. Persecution of [[Dutch Jews]] started shortly after the occupation. At the end of the war, 40,000 Jews were still alive. Of the 100,000 Jews who did not go into hiding, about 1,000 survived the war.\n\nOne famous victim of the Holocaust was [[Anne Frank]], who gained worldwide fame when her diary, written in the ''achterhuis'' ('backhouse') while hiding from the Nazis, was found and published posthumously by her father, Otto Frank; who was the only member of the family to survive the Holocaust.\n\n===The war in the Dutch East Indies===\n{{Main|Dutch East Indies campaign}}\nOn 8 December 1941, the day after the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], the Netherlands declared war on Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1941/411208c.html |title=THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS DECLARES WAR WITH JAPAN |publisher=ibiblio |accessdate=5 October 2009}}</ref> The Dutch government-in-exile in London had for long been working with the UK & US governments to cut off oil supplies to Japan. Japanese forces [[Netherlands East Indies campaign|invaded the Dutch East Indies]] on 11 January 1942. The Dutch surrendered on 8 March after Japanese troops landed on [[Java island|Java]]. Dutch citizens and everybody with Dutch ancestry, the so-called \"[[Indo people|Indo's]]\" were captured and put to work in labour camps or interned. As in the Netherlands, many Dutch ships, planes and military personnel managed to reach safety, in this case Australia; from where they were able to fight again.\n\n===False hopes, the Hunger Winter and Liberation===\nIn Europe, after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] landed in [[Normandy]] in June 1944, progress was slow until the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] ended in August 1944. German resistance collapsed in Western Europe and the allied armies advanced quickly towards the Dutch border. The [[First Canadian Army]] and the Second British Army conducted operations on Dutch soil from September onwards. On 17 September, a daring operation, [[Operation Market Garden]]; was executed with the goal of capturing bridges across three major rivers in the southern Netherlands. Despite desperate fighting by American, British and Polish forces, the bridge at [[Arnhem]], across the Neder Rijn, could not be captured.\n\nAreas south of the Rhine river were liberated in the period September\u2013December 1944, including the province of Zeeland, which was liberated in October and November in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]]. This opened [[Antwerp]] to allied shipping. The [[First Canadian Army]] held a static line along the [[river Meuse]] (Maas) from December 1944 through February 1945.\n\nThe rest of the country remained occupied until the spring of 1945. In the face of Dutch defiance, the Nazis deliberately cut off food supplies resulting in near-starvation in the cities during the ''[[Hongerwinter]]'' ([[Hunger winter]]) of 1944\u201345. Soup kitchens were set up but many vulnerable people died.<ref>William I.

In the final weeks of the war in Europe, the First Canadian Army was charged with clearing the [[Netherlands]] of German forces.\n\nThe [[Liberation of Arnhem]] began on 12 April 1945 and proceeded to plan, as the three infantry brigades of the 49th Division leapfrogged each other through the city. Within four days Arnhem, now a ruined city, was totally under Allied control.<ref>Waddy, John A Tour of the Arnhem Battlefields (Pen & Sword Books, 2001; first published 1999) ({{ISBN|0-85052-571-3}}), p. 192</ref>\n\nThe Canadians then immediately advanced further into the country, encountering and defeating a German counterattack at [[Otterlo]] and Dutch SS resistance at [[Ede, Netherlands|Ede]]. On 27 April a temporary truce came into effect, allowing the distribution of food aid to the starving Dutch civilians in areas under German control ([[Operations Manna and Chowhound|Operation Manna]]). On 5 May 1945, Generaloberst [[Johannes Blaskowitz|Blaskowitz]] agreed to the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands, signing the surrender to Canadian general [[Charles Foulkes (Canadian general)|Charles Foulkes]] at [[Wageningen]].<ref>Stacey, Colonel Charles Perry, ''Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War'', Volume III, ''[http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/docs/Victory_e.pdf The Victory Campaign: The Operations in North-West Europe 1944\u20131945]'' (The Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery Ottawa, 1960) (Downloaded: 4 July 2009), pp. 576\u2013614</ref> (The Fifth of May is now celebrated annually in the Netherlands as [[Liberation Day]].) Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered, bringing the war in Europe to an end.\n\nAfter the euphoria and settling of scores had ended, the Dutch were a traumatised people with a ruined economy, a shattered infrastructure and several destroyed cities including [[Rotterdam]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Arnhem]] and part of [[The Hague]].\n\n===Post-war events===\n\nAfter the war, there were reprisals against those who had collaborated with the Nazis. [[Artur Seyss-Inquart]], Nazi Commissioner of the Netherlands, was tried at N\u00fcremberg.\n\nIn the early post-war years, the Netherlands made continued attempts to expand its territory by annexing neighbouring German territory. The [[Bakker-Schut Plan|larger annexation plans]] were continuously rejected by the United States, but the London conference of 1949 permitted the Netherlands to perform a smaller scale [[annexation]]. Most of the annexed territory was returned to Germany on 1 August 1963.<ref>[http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/3606801/ 'Eisch Duitschen grond!'] 3 May 2001 in Dutch.

This was followed by large-scale public works programmes, economic recovery, European integration and the gradual introduction of a welfare state.\n\nImmediately after the war, rationing was imposed on many goods, including: cigarettes, textiles, washing powder and coffee.

He led four successive cabinets [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-1|Drees I]], [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-2|Drees II]], [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-3|Drees III]] and [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-4|Drees IV]] until 1958. His tenure in office saw four major political developments: the traumas of decolonisation, [[economic reconstruction]], the establishment of the Dutch [[welfare state]], and international integration and co-operation, including the formation of [[Benelux]], the [[OEEC]], [[NATO]], the [[European Coal and Steel Community|ECSC]], and the [[EEC]].\n\n===Baby boom and economic reconstruction===\n[[File:Population of the Netherlands 1900-2000.png|thumb|left|Population growth 1900\u20132000]]\n\nDespite the socio-economic problems, this was a period of optimism for many. A baby boom followed the war, as young Dutch couples started the families they couldn't previously due to the war. They had lived through the hardships of the Great Depression and the hell of war. They wanted to start afresh and live better lives without the poverty, starvation, terror, and extreme frugality they knew so well. They had little taste for a strictly imposed rule-oriented traditional system with its rigid hierarchies, sharp pillarised boundaries and strictly orthodox religious doctrines. The translation of ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' (1946), by American pediatrician [[Benjamin Spock]] was a best-seller. His vision of family life as companionate, permissive, enjoyable and even as being fun took hold, and seemed the best way to achieve family happiness in a dawning age of freedom and prosperity.<ref name=\"Janneke Wubs 2002 pp 209\">Nelleke Bakker and Janneke Wubs, \"A Mysterious Success: Doctor Spock and the Netherlands in the 1950s\", ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2002) 38#1 pp. 209\u201326.</ref>\n\nWages were kept low and the recovery of consumption to pre-war levels was delayed to permit rapid rebuilding of the infrastructure. In the years after the war, unemployment fell and the economy grew at an astonishing pace, despite the high birth rate. The shattered infrastructure and destroyed cities were rebuilt. A key contribution to the recovery in the post-war Netherlands came from the [[Marshall Plan]], which provided the country with funds, goods, raw materials and produce.<ref>Van der Eng, Pierre (1987).

Dutch corporations, particularly [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Philips]], became internationally prominent. Businesspeople, scientists, engineers and artists from the Netherlands made important international contributions. For example, Dutch economists, especially [[Jan Tinbergen]] (1903\u20131994), [[Tjalling Koopmans]] (1910\u20131985) and [[Henri Theil]] (1924\u20132000), made major contributions to the mathematical and statistical methodology known as [[econometrics]].<ref>Andrew J.

The Netherlands also experienced years of negative growth after that. Unemployment increased steadily, causing rapid growth in social-security expenditures. Inflation reached double digits; government surpluses disappeared. On the positive side, rich natural gas resources were developed, providing a current account trade surplus during most of the period. Public deficits were high.<ref>Green-Pedersen, ''The Politics of Justification: Party Competition and Welfare-State Retrenchment in Denmark and the Netherlands from 1982\u20131998'' p. 44</ref> According to the long-term economic analysis of Horlings and Smits, the major gains in the Dutch economy were concentrated between 1870\u20131930 and between 1950\u201370.

More than 1,800 people drowned in the ensuing inundation.\n\nThe Dutch government subsequently decided on a large-scale programme of public works (the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\") to protect the country against future floods. The project took more than thirty years to complete. The Oosterscheldedam, an advanced sea storm barrier, became operational in 1986.

Its purpose was to pool the steel and coal resources of the member states, and to support the economies of the participating countries. As a side effect, the ECSC helped defuse tensions between countries which had recently been fighting each other during the war. In time, this economic merger grew, adding members and broadening in scope, to become the [[European Economic Community]], and later the [[European Union]] (EU).\n[[File:Anti kernwapendemonstratie in Den Haag ( 550 duizend deelnemers ) overzichten m, Bestanddeelnr 253-8817.jpg|thumb|Protest in The Hague against the [[nuclear arms race]] between the U.S./NATO and the Warsaw Pact, 1983]]\nThe United States started to have more influence.

Supposedly there would be a federated Indonesian state and a union with the Netherlands, but that never happened. The Indonesians wanted complete transfer of power, and the Dutch refused. By 1946, the United States was financing the Dutch in Indonesia, and was able to exert pressure on The Hague.  Increasing international pressure\u2014including American hints about cutting off military funds\u2014forced the Netherlands to withdraw.

In fact, the demand for labour was so strong that immigration was actively encouraged, first from Italy and Spain then later on, in larger numbers, from [[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]].\n\n[[Suriname]] became independent on 25 November 1975. The Dutch government supported independence because it wanted to stem the flow of immigrants from Suriname and also to end its colonial status. However, about one-third of the entire population of Suriname, fearing political unrest and economic decline, relocated to the Netherlands, creating a Surinamese community in the Netherlands that is now roughly as large as the population of Suriname itself.\n\n===Liberalisation===\nWhen the post-war baby boom children grew up, they led the revolt in the 1960s against all rigidities in Dutch life.<ref name=\"Janneke Wubs 2002 pp 209\"/> The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid de-[[pillarization]] leading to the erosion of the old divisions along class and religious lines.<ref>Christopher G.

Then, it spread to Amsterdam, Rotterdam and the other major cities in the west. Finally, the Catholic southern areas showed religious decline.

This [[purple (government)]] coalition marked the first absence of the CDA in a government for decades. During the Purple Coalition years, a period lasting until the rise of the populist politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], the government addressed issues previously viewed as taboo under the Christian-influenced cabinet. At this time, the Dutch government introduced unprecedented legislation based on a policy of official tolerance (''gedoogbeleid''). Abortion and [[euthanasia]] were decriminalised, but stricter guidelines were set for their implementation. Drug policy, especially with regard to the regulation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], was reformed. Prostitution was legalised, but confined to brothels where the health and safety of those involved could be properly monitored. With the 2001 [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Same-Sex Marriage Act]], the Netherlands became the first country in the world to legalise [[same-sex marriage]].

Both the social democratic PvdA and the conservative liberal VVD grew at the cost of their junior partner in cabinet, the progressive liberal D66. The voters rewarded the Purple Coalition for its economic performance, which had included reduction of unemployment and the budget deficit, steady growth and job creation combined with wage freezes and trimming of the welfare state, together with a policy of fiscal restraint.<ref>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2231_98.htm Netherlands: Elections held in 1998] Inter-Parliamentary Union</ref> The result was the [[Second cabinet of Wim Kok|second Kok cabinet]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aarts | first1 = Kees | last2 = Semetko | first2 = Holli A. | author-link1 = Kees Aarts (political scientist) | author-link2 = Holli Semetko | title = Representation and responsibility: the 1998 Dutch election in perspective | journal = [[Acta Politica]] | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 111\u201329 |year = 1999 | url = http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ap | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nThe power of the coalition waned with the introduction of [[Pim Fortuyn List|List Pim Fortuyn]] in the [[Dutch general election, 2002|Dutch general election of 2002]], a populist party, which ran a distinctly anti-immigration and anti-purple campaign, citing [[De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars|\"Purple Chaos\"]] (''Puinhopen van Paars'') as the source of the countries social woes.

The ensuing [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD and LPF, led by Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]].

His party won a landslide election victory, partly because of his perceived martyrdom, However, internal party squabbles and blowing up the coalition government they had helped to create, resulted in the loss of 70% of their support at early general elections in 2003.\n* Another murder that caused great upheaval took place on 2 November 2004, when film director and publicist [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] was assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan youth with [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremist]] views because of Van Gogh's alleged blasphemy. One week later, several arrests were made of several would-be Islamic terrorists, who have later been found guilty of conspiracy with terrorist intentions, this verdict was however reversed on appeal. All this sparked a debate on the position of Islamic extremism and of Islam generally in Dutch society, and on immigration and integration. The personal protection of most politicians, especially of the Islam critic [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], was stepped up to unprecedented levels.\n\n===The Netherlands today===\n[[File:Balkenende visits Bush June 2008.jpg|thumb|Dutch Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] and U.S. President [[George W.

His style no longer attracts readers, and scholars have moved away from his simplistic dichotomies of good versus evil, Dutch versus Spanish, Catholic versus Protestant, freedom versus authoritarianism. His theory of causation over-emphasized ethnicity as an unchanging characteristic, exaggerated the importance of William of Orange, and gave undue importance to the issue religious tolerance.<ref>Robert Wheaton, \"Motley and the Dutch Historians,\" ''New England Quarterly'' (1962) 35#3 pp. 318\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/363823 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe pioneering Dutch cultural historian [[Johan Huizinga]] (1872\u20131945), author of ''The Autumn of the Middle Ages'' (1919) (the English translation was called ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'') and ''Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture'' (1935), which expanded the field of cultural history and influenced the historical anthropology of younger historians of the French [[Annales School]].

Cruz (2007) explains the major debates among scholars regarding the Dutch bid for independence from Spanish rule. While agreeing that the intellectual milieus of late 19th and 20th centuries affected historians' interpretations, Cruz argues that writings about the revolt trace changing perceptions of the role played by small countries in the history of Europe.  In recent decades grand theory has fallen out of favor among most scholars, who emphasize the particular over the general. Dutch and Belgian historiography since 1945 no longer says the revolt was the culmination of an inevitable process leading to independence and freedom. Instead scholars have put the political and economic details of the towns and provinces under the microscope, while agreeing on the weaknesses of attempts at centralization by the Habsburg rulers. The most influential new studies have been rooted in demographic and economic history, though scholars continue to debate the relationship between economics and politics. The religious dimension has been viewed in terms of mentalities, exposing the minority position of Calvinism, while the international aspects have been studied more seriously by foreign historians than by the Dutch themselves.<ref>Laura Cruz, \"The 80 Years' Question: the Dutch Revolt in Historical Perspective.\"  ''History Compass'' 2007 5(3): 914\u201334.</ref>\n\n[[Pieter Geyl]] was the leading historian of the Dutch Revolt, and a highly influential professor at the University of London (1919\u20131935) and at the State University of Utrecht (1936\u201358). He wrote a six-volume history of the Dutch-speaking peoples.<ref>Three volumes appeared in English translation, ''The Revolit of the Netherlands (1555\u20131609)'' (1932); and ''The Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century'' (2 vol 1936, 1964).</ref> The Nazis imprisoned him in World War II. In his political views, Geyl adopted the views of the 17th-century Dutch Louvestein faction, led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt (1547\u20131619) and Johan de Witt (1625\u201372). It stood for liberty, toleration, and national interests in contrast to the Orange stadholders who sought to promote their own self-interest. According to Geyl, the Dutch Republic reached the peak of its powers during the 17th century. He was also a staunch nationalist and suggested that Flanders could split off from Belgium and join the Netherlands. Later he decried what he called radical nationalism and stressed more the vitality of Western Civilization. Geyl was highly critical of the [[world history]] approach of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]].<ref>Herbert H. Rowen, \"The Historical Work of Pieter Geyl.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 1965 37(1): 35\u201349. {{ISSN|0022-2801}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874563 in Jstor]</ref>\n\n[[Jan Romein]] (1893\u20131962) created a \"theoretical history\" in an attempt to reestablish the relevance of history to public life in the 1930s at a time of immense political uncertainty and cultural crisis, when Romein thought that history had become too inward-looking and isolated from other disciplines. Romein, a Marxist, wanted history to contribute to social improvement. At the same time, influenced by the successes of theoretical physics and his study of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Frederick John Teggart]], and others, he spurred on the development of theoretical history in the Netherlands, to the point where it became a subject in its own right at the university level after the war. Romein used the term integral history as a substitute for cultural history and focused his attention on the period around the turn of the century. He concluded that a serious crisis occurred in European civilization in 1900 because of the rise of anti-Semitism, extreme nationalism, discontent with the parliamentary system, depersonalization of the state, and the rejection of positivism. European civilization waned as the result of this crisis which was accompanied by the rise of the United States, the Americanization of the world, and the emergence of Asia. His interpretation is reminiscent of that of his mentor Johan Huizinga and was criticized by his colleague Pieter Geyl.<ref>A. C.

Records begin with the four centuries during which the region formed a militarized border zone of the [[Romans in the Netherlands|Roman]] Empire. This came under increasing pressure from [[Germanic peoples]] moving westwards. As Roman power collapsed and the [[Middle Ages]] began, three dominant [[Germanic peoples]] coalesced in the area, [[Frisians]] in the north and coastal areas, [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxons]] in the northeast, and the [[Franks]] in the south.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the descendants of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty came to dominate the area and then extended their rule to a large part of Western Europe. The region of the [[Netherlands]] therefore became part of [[Lower Lotharingia]] within the Frankish [[Holy Roman Empire]]. For several centuries, lordships such as [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[Zeeland]], [[Friesland]], [[Guelders]] and others held a changing patchwork of territories. There was no unified equivalent of the modern Netherlands.\n\nBy 1433, the [[Philip the Good|Duke of Burgundy]] had assumed control over most of the lowlands territories in Lower Lotharingia; he created the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] which included modern Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and a part of France.\n\nThe Catholic kings of Spain took strong measures against Protestantism, which polarised the peoples of present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The subsequent [[Dutch revolt]] led to splitting the Burgundian Netherlands into a Catholic French and Dutch-speaking \"[[Spanish Netherlands]]\" (approximately corresponding to modern Belgium and Luxembourg), and a northern \"[[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]\", which spoke Dutch and were predominantly Protestant with a Catholic minority. It became the modern Netherlands.\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], which had its zenith around 1667, there was a flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the [[List of people from the Dutch Golden Age#Science|sciences]]. A rich worldwide [[Dutch empire]] developed and the [[Dutch East India Company]] became one of the earliest and most important of national mercantile companies based on entrepreneurship and trade.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, the power, wealth and influence of the Netherlands declined. A series of wars with the more powerful [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|British]] and [[Franco-Dutch War|French]] neighbours weakened it. The UK seized the North American colony of [[New Amsterdam]], and renamed it \"New York\". There was growing unrest and [[Second Stadtholderless Period#Crisis and the Orangist revolution of 1747|conflict]] between the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangists]] and the [[Patriottentijd|Patriots]]. The French Revolution spilled over after 1789, and a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] was established in 1795\u20131806. Napoleon made it a satellite state, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1806\u20131810), and later simply a French imperial province.\n\nAfter the collapse of Napoleon in 1813\u201315, an expanded \"[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]\" was created with the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]] as monarchs, also ruling Belgium and Luxembourg. The King imposed unpopular Protestant reforms on Belgium, [[Belgian Revolution|which revolted in 1830]] and became independent in 1839. After an initially conservative period, following the introduction of the 1848 constitution; the country became a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[constitutional monarch]]. Modern-day Luxembourg became officially independent from the Netherlands in 1839, but a personal union remained until 1890. Since 1890, it is ruled by another branch of the House of Nassau.\n\nThe Netherlands was neutral during the [[First World War]], but during the [[Second World War]], it was invaded and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazis, including many collaborators, rounded up and killed almost all of the country's Jewish population. When the Dutch resistance increased, the Nazis cut off food supplies to much of the country, causing severe starvation in 1944\u201345. In 1942, the Dutch East Indies were conquered by Japan, but prior to this the Dutch destroyed the oil wells for which Japan was desperate. [[Indonesia]] proclaimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1945, followed by [[Suriname]] in 1975. The post-war years saw rapid economic recovery (helped by the American [[Marshall Plan]]), followed by the introduction of a [[welfare state]] during an era of peace and prosperity. The Netherlands formed a new economic alliance with Belgium and Luxembourg, the [[Benelux]], and all three became founding members of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In recent decades, the Dutch economy has been closely linked to that of Germany and is highly prosperous. The four countries adopted the Euro on 1 January 2002, along with eight other EU member states.\n\n{{History Benelux states}}\n\n== Prehistory (before 800 BC) ==\n\n===Historical changes to the landscape===\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by its constantly shifting, low-lying geography.\n{|cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"background: white\"\n|-\n|[[File:5500vc ex leg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 5500 BC]]\n|[[File:3850vc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 3850 BC]]\n|[[File:2750vc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 2750 BC]]\n|-\n|[[File:500vc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 500 BC]]\n|[[File:50nc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in AD 50]]\n|{{legend|#fff15d|beach ridges and dunes}}\n{{legend|#d2d500|tidal sand flats, tidal [[mudflat]]s, [[salt marsh]]es}}\n{{legend|#b56c03|peat marshes and [[floodplain]] silt areas<br>(including old river courses and riverbank breaches which have filled up with [[silt]] or [[peat]])}}\n{{legend|#a1aa95|Valleys of the major rivers (not covered with peat)}}\n{{legend|#fec901|River dunes ([[Pleistocene]] dunes)}}\n{{legend|#e3f4fc|open water (sea, lagoons, rivers)}}\n{{legend|#f1f6e2|Pleistocene landscape (> \u22126 m compared to [[Normaal Amsterdams Peil|NAP]])}}\n{{legend|#fffdee|Pleistocene landscape (\u22126 to 0 m; \u201320 to 0 ft)}}\n{{legend|#fff9c2|Pleistocene landscape (0\u201310 m; 0\u201333 ft)}}\n{{legend|#ffeba6|Pleistocene landscape (10\u201320 m; 33\u201366 ft)}}\n{{legend|#fec901|Pleistocene landscape (20\u201350 m; 66\u2013164 ft)}}\n{{legend|#e7a300|Pleistocene landscape (50\u2013100 m; 164\u2013328 ft)}}\n{{legend|#da600d|Pleistocene landscape (100\u2013200 m; 328\u2013656 ft)}}\n|}\n\n===Earliest groups of hunter-gatherers (before 5000 BC)===\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|180px|An oak figurine found in Willemstad, the Netherlands, dating from around 4500 BC.

Another group residing elsewhere is known to have made canoes.

Agriculture was practiced only on the [[loess]] [[plateau]] in the very south (southern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]), but even there it was not established permanently. Farms did not develop in the rest of the Netherlands.\n\nThere is also some evidence of small settlements in the rest of the country. These people made the switch to [[animal husbandry]] sometime between 4800 BC and 4500 BC.

In this period of Dutch prehistory, the first notable remains were erected: the [[dolmens]], large stone grave monuments. They are found in [[Drenthe]], and were probably built between 4100 BC and 3200 BC.\n\nTo the west, the [[Vlaardingen culture]] (around 2600 BC), an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the [[Neolithic]] period.\n\n===Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures (around 3000\u20132000 BC)===\nAround 2950 BCE there was a transition from the [[Funnelbeaker]] farming culture to the [[Corded Ware]] pastoralist culture, a large archeological horizon appearing in western and central Europe, that is associated with the advance of Indo-European languages.

This culture also experimented with working with copper. Evidence of this, including stone anvils, copper knives, and a copper spearhead, was found on the [[Veluwe]]. Copper finds show that there was trade with other areas in Europe, as natural copper is not found in Dutch soil.\n\n===Bronze Age (around 2000\u2013800 BC)===\n[[File:Zwaard van Jutphaas.jpg|thumb|right|80px|A bronze ceremonial object (not a sword, but called the \"Sword of Jutphaas\"), dating from 1800 to 1500 BC and found south of [[Utrecht]].]]\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] probably started somewhere around 2000 BC and lasted until around 800 BC. The earliest [[bronze]] tools have been found in the grave of a Bronze Age individual called \"the smith of [[Wageningen]]\". More Bronze Age objects from later periods have been found in [[Epe, Netherlands|Epe]], [[Drouwen]] and elsewhere. Broken bronze objects found in [[Voorschoten]] were apparently destined for recycling. This indicates how valuable bronze was considered in the Bronze Age. Typical bronze objects from this period included knives, swords, axes, [[fibulae]] and bracelets.\n\n[[File:BronzAgeElp.png|thumb|left|Location of the [[Elp culture|Elp]] and [[Hilversum culture]]s in the Bronze Age.]]\nMost of the Bronze Age objects found in the Netherlands have been found in [[Drenthe]]. One item shows that trading networks during this period extended a far distance. Large bronze ''situlae'' (buckets) found in Drenthe were manufactured somewhere in eastern France or in [[Switzerland]]. They were used for mixing wine with water (a Roman/Greek custom). The many finds in Drenthe of rare and valuable objects, such as tin-bead necklaces, suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Netherlands in the Bronze Age.\n\nThe [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker cultures]] (2700\u20132100) locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100\u20131800). In the second millennium BC, the region was the boundary between the [[Atlantic Bronze Age|Atlantic]] and [[Nordic Bronze Age|Nordic]] horizons and was split into a northern and a southern region, roughly divided by the course of the [[Rhine]].\n\nIn the north, the [[Elp culture]] (c. 1800 to 800 BC)<ref>According to \"Het Archeologisch Basisregister\" (ABR), version 1.0 November 1992, [http://www.racm.nl/content/documenten%5Cabr%20website.pdf], ''Elp K\u00fcmmerkeramik'' is dated BRONSMA (early MBA) to BRONSL (LBA) and this has been standardized by \"De Rijksdienst voor Archeologie, Cultuurlandschap en Monumenten\" (RACM) as being at the period starting at 1800 BC and ending at 800 BC.{{Failed verification|date=October 2011}} {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> was a Bronze Age archaeological culture having [[earthenware]] pottery of low quality known as \"''K\u00fcmmerkeramik''\" (or \"''Grobkeramik''\") as a marker. The initial phase was characterized by [[tumulus|tumuli]] (1800\u20131200 BC) that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia, and were apparently related to the [[Tumulus culture]] (1600\u20131200 BC) in central Europe. This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring [[Urnfield]] ([[cremation]]) burial customs (1200\u2013800 BC). The southern region became dominated by the [[Hilversum culture]] (1800\u2013800), which apparently inherited the cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.\n\n== The pre-Roman period (800 BC \u2013 58 BC) ==\n\n===Iron Age===\n[[File:Boerderij IJzertijd Reijntjesveld.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of an [[Iron Age]] dwelling on the Reijntjesveld near [[Orvelte]] in [[Drenthe]].]]\n[[File:Verbogen Keltische zwaard.jpg|thumb|The original curved iron sword from the [[Vorstengraf (Oss)]], [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]].]]\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] brought a measure of prosperity to the people living in the area of the present-day Netherlands. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including [[bog iron]] extracted from the [[ore]] in [[peat bogs]] (''moeras ijzererts'') in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the [[Veluwe]] and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. [[Blacksmith|Smiths]] travelled from small settlement to settlement with [[bronze]] and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including axes, knives, pins, arrowheads and swords. Some evidence even suggests the making of [[Damascus steel]] swords using an advanced method of [[forging]] that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel.\n\nIn [[Oss]], a grave dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound 52 metres wide (and thus the largest of its kind in western Europe). Dubbed the \"king's grave\" (''[[Vorstengraf (Oss)]]''), it contained extraordinary objects, including an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.\n\nIn the centuries just before the arrival of the Romans, northern areas formerly occupied by the Elp culture emerged as the probably Germanic Harpstedt culture<ref name=Mallory>Mallory, J.P., ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology and Myth'', London: Thames & Hudson, 1989, p. 87.</ref> while the southern parts were influenced by the [[Hallstatt culture]] and assimilated into the Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]].

One of the most important is Caesar's own ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''. Two main tribes he described as living in what is now the Netherlands were the [[Menapii]], and the [[Eburones]], both in the south, which is where Caesar was active. He established the principle that the Rhine defined a natural boundary between [[Gaul]] and [[Germania magna]]. But the Rhine was not a strong border, and he made it clear that there was a part of Belgic Gaul where many of the local tribes (including the Eburones) were \"[[Germani cisrhenani]]\", or in other cases, of mixed origin.\n\nThe Menapii stretched from the south of Zeeland, through [[North Brabant]] (and possibly [[South Holland]]), into the southeast of [[Gelderland]]. In later Roman times their territory seems to have been divided or reduced, so that it became mainly contained in what is now western Belgium.\n\nThe [[Eburones]], the largest of the ''Germani Cisrhenani'' group, covered a large area including at least part of modern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]], stretching east to the [[Rhine]] in Germany, and also northwest to the delta, giving them a border with the Menapii. Their territory may have stretched into Gelderland.\n\nIn the delta itself, Caesar makes a passing comment about the ''Insula Batavorum'' (\"Island of the Batavi\") in the [[Rhine river]], without discussing who lived there. Later, in imperial times, a tribe called the Batavi became very important in this region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=4:chapter=10&highlight=batavi|title=C.

(Tacitus reported that the Tungri was a new name for the earlier ''Germani cisrhenani''.)\n\nNorth of the Old Rhine, apart from the Frisii, Pliny reports some [[Chauci]] reached into the delta, and two other tribes known from the eastern Netherlands were the [[Tuihanti]] (or Tubantes) from [[Twenthe]] in Overijssel, and the [[Chamavi]], from [[Hamaland]] in northern Gelderland, who became one of the first tribes to be named as [[Franks|Frankish]] (see below). The [[Salians]], also Franks, probably originated in [[Salland]] in Overijssel, before they moved into the empire, forced by Saxons in the 4th century, first into Batavia, and then into Toxandria.\n\n===Roman settlements in the Netherlands===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=350|caption_align=center\n| title = Roman settlements\n| image1 = Ruitermasker matilo.jpg|caption1=Mask of a Roman horseman, discovered near [[Leiden]].\n| image2 = Germania 70.svg|caption2=Rhine Frontier of the [[Roman Empire]] around 70 CE. \n}}\nStarting about 15 BC, the [[Rhine]], in the Netherlands came to be defended by the Lower [[Limes Germanicus]]. After a series of military actions, the Rhine became fixed around 12 AD as Rome's northern frontier on the European mainland. A number of towns and developments would arise along this line. The area to the south would be integrated into the [[Roman Empire]]. At first part of [[Gallia Belgica]], this area became part of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Germania Inferior]]. The tribes already within, or relocated to, this area became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the [[Frisii]] and the [[Chauci]], remained outside Roman rule but not its presence and control.\n\nRomans built military forts along the [[Limes Germanicus]] and a number of towns and smaller settlements in the Netherlands. The more notable Roman towns were at [[Nijmegen]] ([[:nl:Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum|Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum]]) and at [[Voorburg]] ([[Forum Hadriani]]).\n\nPerhaps the most evocative Roman ruin is the mysterious [[Brittenburg]], which emerged from the sand at the beach in Katwijk several centuries ago, only to be buried again.

In the first centuries after Rome's conquest of Gaul, trade flourished.

The leader of this [[Revolt of the Batavi|revolt]] was Batavian [[Gaius Julius Civilis]]. One of the causes of the rebellion was that the Romans had taken young Batavians as [[Slavery|slaves]]. A number of Roman ''castella'' were attacked and burnt. Other Roman soldiers in [[Xanten]] and elsewhere and auxiliary troops of Batavians and [[Canninefates|Canninefatae]] in the legions of [[Vitellius]]) joined the revolt, thus splitting the northern part of the Roman army. In April 70 AD, a few legions sent by [[Vespasianus]] and commanded by [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] eventually defeated the Batavians and negotiated surrender with [[Gaius Julius Civilis]] somewhere between the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the [[Meuse River|Maas]] near Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]]), which was probably called \"Batavodurum\" by the Batavians.<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.html ''Historiae''], Tacitus, 109 AD, Translated by Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb.</ref> The Batavians later merged with other tribes and became part of the [[Salian Franks]].\n\nDutch writers in the 17th and 18th centuries saw the rebellion of the independent and freedom-loving Batavians as mirroring the Dutch revolt against Spain and other forms of tyranny. According to this nationalist view, the [[Batavians]] were the \"true\" forefathers of the Dutch, which explains the recurring use of the name over the centuries. [[Jakarta]] was named \"Batavia\" by the Dutch in 1619. The Dutch republic created in 1795 on the basis of French revolutionary principles was called the [[Batavian Republic]].

This is known as the \"[[Migration Period]]\" (''Volksverhuizingen''). The northern Netherlands received an influx of new migrants and settlers, mostly [[Saxons]], but also [[Angles]] and [[Jutes]].

The newcomers who stayed in the northern Netherlands would eventually be referred to as \"Frisians\", although they were not descended from the ancient [[Frisii]].

By the end of the 6th century, the Frisian territory in the northern Netherlands had expanded west to the [[North Sea]] coast and, by the 7th century, south to [[Dorestad]]. During this period most of the northern Netherlands was known as [[Frisia]]. This extended Frisian territory is sometimes referred to as ''[[Frisian Kingdom|Frisia Magna]]'' (or [[Greater Frisia]]).\n\n[[File:Dorestad and trade routes.jpg|thumb|[[Dorestad]] and main traderoutes.]]\nIn the 7th and 8th centuries, the [[Franks|Frankish]] chronologies mention this area as the [[Frisian Kingdom|kingdom of the Frisians]]. This kingdom comprised the coastal provinces of the [[Netherlands]] and the German [[North Sea]] coast. During this time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. The 7th-century [[Frisian Kingdom]] (650\u2013734) under King [[Aldegisel]] and King [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Redbad]], had its centre of power in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].\n\n[[Dorestad]] was the largest settlement ([[Emporia (early medieval)|emporia]]) in northwestern Europe. It had grown around a former Roman fortress.

By the 490s, [[Clovis I]] had conquered and united all the Frankish territories to the west of the [[Meuse]], including those in the southern Netherlands. He continued his conquests into [[Gaul]].\n\nAfter the death of [[Clovis I]] in 511, his four sons partitioned his kingdom amongst themselves, with [[Theuderic I of Austrasia|Theuderic I]] receiving the lands that were to become Austrasia (including the southern Netherlands). A line of kings descended from Theuderic ruled [[Austrasia]] until 555, when it was united with the other Frankish kingdoms of [[Chlothar I]], who inherited all the Frankish realms by 558. He redivided the Frankish territory amongst his four sons, but the four kingdoms coalesced into three on the death of [[Charibert I]] in 567. Austrasia (including the southern Netherlands) was given to [[Sigebert I]]. The southern Netherlands remained the northern part of [[Austrasia]] until the rise of the [[Carolingians]].\n\nThe Franks who expanded south into [[Gaul]] settled there and eventually adopted the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the local population.<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/> However, a Germanic language was spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western [[Austrasia]] and [[Neustria]] as late as the 850s.

Some went further by ascribing certain attributes, values and strengths to these various groups and proposing that they reflected 19th-century nationalist and religious views. In particular, it was believed that this theory explained why Belgium and the southern Netherlands (i.e. the Franks) had become Catholic and the northern Netherlands (Frisians and Saxons) had become Protestant. The success of this theory was partly due to anthropological theories based on a tribal paradigm. Being politically and geographically inclusive, and yet accounting for diversity, this theory was in accordance with the need for nation-building and integration during the 1890\u20131914 period. The theory was taught in Dutch schools.\n\nHowever, the disadvantages of this historical interpretation became apparent. This tribal-based theory suggested that external borders were weak or non-existent and that there were clear-cut internal borders. This origins myth provided an historical premise, especially during the Second World War, for regional separatism and annexation to Germany. After 1945 the tribal paradigm lost its appeal for anthropological scholars and historians. When the accuracy of the three-tribe theme was fundamentally questioned, the theory fell out of favour.<ref name=\"Marnix Beyen 1850\"/>\n\nDue to the scarcity of written sources, knowledge of this period depends to a large degree on the interpretation of archaeological data. The traditional view of a clear-cut division between [[Frisians]] in the north and coast, [[Franks]] in the south and [[Saxons]] in the east has proven historically problematic.<ref>Blok, D.P. (1974), ''De Franken in Nederland'', Bussum: Unieboek, 1974, pp. 36\u201338 on the uncertain identity of the Frisians in early Frankish sources; pp. 54\u201355 on the problems concerning \"Saxon\" as a tribal name.</ref><ref>van Eijnatten, J. and F. van Lieburg, ''Nederlandse religiegeschiedenis'' (Hilversum, 2006), pp. 42\u201343, on the uncertain identity of the \"Frisians\" in early Frankish sources.</ref><ref>de Nijs, T, E.

(2003), pp. 30\u201333</ref>\n\n===The emergence of the Dutch language===\n{{Main|Old Dutch|Old Frisian|Dutch Low Saxon}}\nThe language from which [[Old Dutch]] (also sometimes called [[Old West Low Franconian]], [[Old Low Franconian]] or [[Old Frankish]]) arose is not known with certainty, but it is thought to be the language spoken by the [[Salian Franks]]. Even though the Franks are traditionally categorized as [[Weser-Rhine Germanic]], Dutch has a number of [[Ingvaeonic]] characteristics and is classified by modern linguists as an [[Ingvaeonic]] language. Dutch also has a number of [[Old Saxon]] characteristics. There was a close relationship between [[Old Dutch]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old English]] and [[Old Frisian]]. Because texts written in the language spoken by the Franks are almost non-existent, and [[Old Dutch]] texts scarce and fragmentary, not much is known about the development of [[Old Dutch]]. [[Old Dutch]] made the transition to [[Middle Dutch]] around 1150.<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/>\n\n===Christianization===\nThe Christianity that arrived in the Netherlands with the Romans appears not to have died out completely (in [[Maastricht]], at least) after the withdrawal of the Romans in about 411.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/>\n\nThe [[Franks]] became Christians after their king [[Clovis I]] converted to Catholicism, an event which is traditionally set in 496. Christianity was introduced in the north after the conquest of [[Friesland]] by the [[Franks]]. The [[Saxons]] in the east were converted before the conquest of [[Saxony]], and became Frankish allies.\n\n[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]] and [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missionaries, particularly [[Willibrord]], [[Wulfram of Sens|Wulfram]] and [[Boniface]], played an important role in converting the Frankish and Frisian peoples to Christianity by the 8th century. Boniface was martyred by the [[Frisians]] in [[Dokkum]] (754).\n\n===Frankish dominance and incorporation into the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Frisian-Frankish Wars}}\n[[File:Radboud doopvont.jpg|thumb|left|An early 16th-century tapestry depicting the near baptism of [[Redbad, King of the Frisians]], who died in 719 CE.]]\n\nIn the early 8th century the Frisians came increasingly into conflict with the [[Franks]] to the south, resulting in a [[Frisian\u2013Frankish wars|series of wars]] in which the [[Frankish Empire]] eventually subjugated Frisia. In 734, at the [[Battle of the Boarn]], the Frisians in the Netherlands were defeated by the [[Franks]], who thereby conquered the area west of the [[Lauwers]]. The Franks then conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785 when [[Charlemagne]] defeated [[Widukind]].\n\nThe linguistic descendants of the Franks, the modern [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Dutch language|-speakers]] of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], seem to have broken with the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] \"Frank\" around the 9th century. By this time Frankish identity had changed from an ethnic identity to a national identity, becoming localized and confined to the modern ''[[Franconia]]'' and principally to the French province of ''[[\u00cele-de-France]]''.<ref>van der Wal, M., ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlands'', 1992 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the people no longer referred to themselves as \"Franks\", the Netherlands was still part of the [[Frankish empire]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Indeed, because of the Austrasian origins of the Carolingians in the area between the Rhine and the Maas, the cities of Aachen, Maastricht, Li\u00e8ge and Nijmegen were at the heart of Carolingian culture.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/> Charlemagne maintained his ''palatium''<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlemagne: Court and administration|encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne/256621/Court-and-administration}} (\"Charlemagne relied on his palatium, a shifting assemblage of family members, trusted lay and ecclesiastical companions, and assorted hangers-on, which constituted an itinerant court following the king as he carried out his military campaigns and sought to take advantage of the income from widely scattered royal estates.\")</ref> in [[Nijmegen]] at least four times.\n\nThe [[Carolingian empire]] would eventually include France, Germany, northern Italy and much of Western Europe. In 843, the Frankish empire was divided into three parts, giving rise to [[West Francia]] in the west, [[East Francia]] in the east, and [[Middle Francia]] in the centre. Most of what is today the Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]]; Flanders became part of [[West Francia]]. This division was an important factor in the historical distinction between Flanders and the other Dutch-speaking areas.\n\n[[Middle Francia]] ({{lang-la|Francia media}}) was an ephemeral [[Francia|Frankish]] kingdom that had no historical or ethnic identity to bind its varied peoples. It was created by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, which divided the [[Carolingian Empire]] among the sons of [[Louis the Pious]]. Situated between the realms of [[East Francia|East]] and [[West Francia]], Middle Francia comprised the Frankish territory between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Scheldt]], the [[Frisia]]n coast of the [[North Sea]], the former [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] (except for a western portion, later known as [[Duchy of Burgundy|''Bourgogne'']]), [[Provence]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nMiddle Francia fell to [[Lothair I]], the eldest son and successor of [[Louis the Pious]], after an intermittent civil war with his younger brothers [[Louis the German]] and [[Charles the Bald]]. In acknowledgement of Lothair's [[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial]] title, Middle Francia contained the imperial cities of [[Aachen]], the residence of [[Charlemagne]], as well as Rome. In 855, on his deathbed at [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]], Emperor Lothair I again partitioned his realm amongst his sons. Most of the lands north of the [[Alps]], including the Netherlands, passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and consecutively were named [[Lotharingia]]. After Lothair II died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned by his uncles Louis the German and Charles the Bald in the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] in 870. Although some of the Netherlands had come under Viking control, in 870 it technically became part of [[East Francia]], which became the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 962.\n\n===Viking raids===\n[[File:Rorik by H. W. Koekkoek.jpg|thumb|[[Rorik of Dorestad]], [[Viking]] conqueror and ruler of [[Friesland]], a romantic 1912 depiction by [[Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek|Johannes H. Koekkoek]].]]\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, the Vikings raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the coast and along the rivers of the [[Low Countries]]. Although Vikings never settled in large numbers in those areas, they did set up long-term bases and were even acknowledged as lords in a few cases. In Dutch and Frisian historical tradition, the trading centre of [[Dorestad]] declined after Viking raids from 834 to 863; however, since no convincing Viking archaeological evidence has been found at the site (as of 2007), doubts about this have grown in recent years.<ref>More info about Viking raids can be found online at L. van der Tuuk, [http://home.tiscali.nl/gjallar/index.html Gjallar.

Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> Around 850, [[Lothair I]] acknowledged Rorik as ruler of most of Friesland. And again in 870, Rorik was received by [[Charles the Bald]] in [[Nijmegen]], to whom he became a vassal. Viking raids continued during that period. Harald's son Rodulf and his men were killed by the people of [[Oostergo]] in 873. Rorik died sometime before 882.\n\nBuried Viking treasures consisting mainly of silver have been found in the Low Countries. Two such treasures have been found in Wieringen. A large treasure found in Wieringen in 1996 dates from around 850 and is thought perhaps to have been connected to Rorik. The burial of such a valuable treasure is seen as an indication that there was a permanent settlement in Wieringen.<ref>\"[http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html Vikingschat van Wieringen\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718064223/http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html |date=18 July 2011 }}, Museumkennis.nl.

Using [[Ghent]] as his base, they ravaged Ghent, [[Maastricht]], [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Stavelot]], [[Pr\u00fcm]], [[Cologne]], and [[Koblenz]]. Controlling most of Frisia between 882 and his death in 885, Godfrid became known to history as [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. His lordship over Frisia was acknowledged by [[Charles the Fat]], to whom he became a vassal. Godfried was assassinated in 885, after which [[Gerolf of Holland]] assumed lordship and Viking rule of Frisia came to an end.\n\nViking raids of the Low Countries continued for over a century. Remains of Viking attacks dating from 880 to 890 have been found in [[Zutphen]] and [[Deventer]]. In 920, King [[Henry I of Germany|Henry]] of Germany liberated [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. According to a number of chronicles, the last attacks took place in the first decade of the 11th century and were directed at [[Tiel]] and/or [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].<ref>Jesch, Judith, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RkNY2KrdvscC&pg=PA82 Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse]'', Boydell & Brewer, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-85115-826-6}}. p. 82.</ref>\n\nThese Viking raids occurred about the same time that French and German lords were fighting for supremacy over the middle empire that included the Netherlands, so their sway over this area was weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result.\n\n==High and Late Middle Ages (1000\u20131432)==\n\n===Part of the Holy Roman Empire===\nThe German kings and emperors ruled the Netherlands in the 10th and 11th century. Germany was called the Holy Roman Empire after the coronation of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto the Great]] as emperor. The Dutch city of [[Nijmegen]] used to be the spot of an important domain of the German emperors. Several German emperors were born and died there, including for example [[Byzantine]] empress [[Theophanu]], who died in Nijmegen. Utrecht was also an important city and trading port at the time.\n\n===Political disunity===\n[[File:Valkhofkapel.JPG|thumb|Chapel of St Nicholas ({{Interlanguage link multi|Sint-Nicolaaskapel|nl}} or Valkhofkapel) in [[Nijmegen]], one of the oldest buildings in the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was not able to maintain political unity. In addition to the growing independence of the towns, local rulers turned their counties and duchies into private kingdoms and felt little sense of obligation to the emperor who reigned over large parts of the nation in name only. Large parts of what now comprise the Netherlands were governed by the Count of Holland, the Duke of [[Gelre]], the Duke of Brabant and the Bishop of Utrecht. [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] in the north maintained their independence and were governed by the lower nobility.\n\nThe various feudal states were in a state of almost continual war. [[Gelre]] and Holland fought for control of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Utrecht, whose bishop had in 1000 ruled over half of what is today the Netherlands, was marginalised as it experienced continuing difficulty in electing new bishops. At the same time, the dynasties of neighbouring states were more stable. [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]] and most of Gelre, which used to be part of Utrecht, became independent. Brabant tried to conquer its neighbours, but was not successful.  Holland also tried to assert itself in Zeeland and Friesland, but its attempts failed.\n\n===The Frisians===\nThe language and culture of most of the people who lived in the area that is now Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. The sparsely populated area was known as \"West Friesland\" (''Westfriesland''). As Frankish settlement progressed, the Frisians migrated away or were absorbed and the area quickly became [[Old Dutch|Dutch]].  (The part of North Holland situated north of [[Alkmaar]] is still colloquially known as West Friesland).\n\nThe rest of [[Friesland]] in the north continued to maintain its independence during this time. It had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\") and resented the imposition of the feudal system and the patriciate found in other European towns. They regarded themselves as allies of Switzerland. The Frisian battle cry was \"better dead than a slave\". They later lost their independence when they were defeated in 1498 by the German [[Landsknecht]] mercenaries of [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Duke Albrecht of Saxony-Meissen]].\n\n===The rise of Holland===\n[[File:Rochussen Egmond.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirk VI, Count of Holland]], 1114\u20131157, and his mother Petronella visiting the work on the [[Egmond Abbey]], Charles Rochussen, 1881. The sculpture is the [[commons:File:Egmond tympanum.jpg|Egmond Tympanum]], depicting the two visitors on either side of Saint Peter.]]\n[[File:Master of the St Elizabeth Panels 001.jpg|thumb|Two wings of an altar piece, c. 1500, depicting the [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St Elizabeth Flood]] of 18\u201319 November 1421, with Dordrecht at the front left.]]\n\nThe center of power in these emerging independent territories was in the [[County of Holland]]. Originally granted as a fief to the Danish chieftain [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]] in return for loyalty to the emperor in 862, the region of [[Kennemerland|Kennemara]] (the region around modern [[Haarlem]]) rapidly grew under Rorik's descendants in size and importance. By the early 11th century, [[Dirk III, Count of Holland]] was levying tolls on the Meuse estuary and was able to resist military intervention from his overlord, the Duke of Lower Lorraine.\n\nIn 1083, the name \"Holland\" first appears in a deed referring to a region corresponding more or less to the current province of South Holland and the southern half of what is now North Holland. Holland's influence continued to grow over the next two centuries. The [[counts of Holland]] conquered most of [[Zeeland]] but it was not until 1289 that Count [[Floris V]] was able to subjugate the Frisians in West Friesland (that is, the northern half of North Holland).\n\n===Expansion and growth===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Dutch Low Countries}}\n\nAround 1000 AD there were several agricultural developments (described sometimes as an agricultural revolution) that resulted in an increase in production, especially food production. The economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMuch of the western Netherlands was barely inhabited between the end of the Roman period until around 1100 AD, when farmers from [[Flanders]] and [[Utrecht]] began purchasing the swampy land, draining it and cultivating it. This process happened quickly and the uninhabited territory was settled in a few generations. They built independent farms that were not part of villages, something unique in Europe at the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Guilds]] were established and markets developed as production exceeded local needs. Also, the introduction of currency made trading a much easier affair than it had been before. Existing towns grew and new towns sprang into existence around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas. Commerce and town development increased as the population grew.\n\nThe [[Crusade]]s were popular in the Low Countries and drew many to fight in the [[Holy Land]]. At home, there was relative peace. Viking pillaging had stopped. Both the Crusades and the relative peace at home contributed to trade and the growth in commerce.\n\nCities arose and flourished, especially in [[Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. As the cities grew in wealth and power, they started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]], including [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]], the right to self-government and the right to pass laws. In practice, this meant that the wealthiest cities became quasi-independent republics in their own right. Two of the most important cities were [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] (in [[Flanders]]) which would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\n===Hook and Cod Wars===\n{{Main|Hook and Cod wars}}\n[[File:Jacoba van Beieren (1401-1436), gravin van Holland en Zeeland.jpg|thumb|[[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]], 1401\u20131436, known to the Dutch as \"Jacoba of Bavaria\".]]\nThe [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) were a series of wars and battles in the [[County of Holland]] between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over the title of [[count of Holland]], but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the [[bourgeois]] in the cities against the ruling nobility.\n\nThe Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of [[Holland]].  The Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen. Some of the main figures in this multi-generational conflict were [[William IV, Count of Holland|William IV]], [[Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut|Margaret]], [[William V, Count of Hainaut|William V]], [[William VI, Count of Holland]] and Hainaut, [[John, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing|John]] and [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]]. But perhaps the most well known is [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]].\n\nThe conquest of the county of Holland by the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy was an odd affair. Leading noblemen in Holland invited the duke to conquer Holland, even though he had no historical claim to it. Some historians{{Who|date=February 2010}} say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the [[Flanders|Flemish]] economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions. Europe had been wracked by many civil wars in the 14th and 15th centuries, while Flanders had grown rich and enjoyed peace.\n\n== Burgundian and Habsburg period (1433\u20131567) ==\n[[File:Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|thumb|left|The Low Countries in the late 14th century CE.]]\n\n===Burgundian period===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands}}\nMost of what is now the Netherlands and Belgium was eventually united by the Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in 1433. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in, their local duchy or county or as subjects of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Burgundian period is when the Dutch began the road to nationhood.\n\nHolland's trade developed rapidly, especially in the areas of shipping and transport. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of Holland defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital to the people of Holland, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\n===Habsburg rule from Spain===\n{{Main|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Hadrian VI.jpg|thumb|Influential [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] theologian Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens, 1459\u20131523, was an advisor to Charles; in the last year of his life he became pope as [[Pope Adrian VI]] (1522\u201323).]]\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500\u201358) was born and raised in the [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Ghent]]; he spoke French.  Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournai]], Artois, [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret]] acted as regent until 1515. France relinquished its ancient claim on [[Flanders]] in 1528.<ref>{{cite book|author=James D.

J. - Erasmus - Louvre.jpg|left|thumb|[[Desiderius Erasmus]], 1466\u20131536, [[Rotterdam]] Renaissance humanist, Catholic priest and theologian, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1523.]]\nFrom 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands had to contend with the rebellion of [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian peasants]] (led by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and [[Wijard Jelckama]]). [[Gelre]] attempted to build up its own state in northeast Netherlands and northwest Germany. Lacking funds in the 16th century, Gelre had its soldiers provide for themselves by pillaging enemy terrain. These soldiers were a great menace to the Burgundian Netherlands, as when they pillaged [[The Hague]].\n\nThe dukes of Burgundy over the years through astute marriages, purchases and wars, had taken control of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] that made up the Low Countries. They are now the Netherlands in the north, the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now Belgium) in the south, and Luxemburg in the southeast. Known as the \"Burgundian Circle,\" these lands came under the control of the Habsburg family. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] (1500\u201358) became the owner in 1506, but in 1515 he left to become king of Spain and later became the Holy Roman Emperor. Charles turned over control to regents (his close relatives), and in practice rule was exercised by Spaniards he controlled. The provinces each had their own governments and courts, controlled by the local nobility, and their own traditions and rights (\"liberties\") dating back centuries. Likewise the numerous cities had their own legal rights and local governments, usually controlled by the merchants, On top of this the Spanish had imposed an overall government, the Estates General of the Netherlands, with its own officials and courts.<ref>H.G. Koenigsberger, \"The Beginnings of the States General of the Netherlands,\" ''Parliaments, Estates and Representation'' (1988) 8#2 pp 101\u201314.</ref> The Spanish officials sent by Charles ignored traditions and the Dutch nobility as well as local officials, inciting an anti-Spanish sense of nationalism, and leading to the [[Dutch Revolt]]. With the emergence of the Protestant Reformation, Charles\u2014now the Emperor\u2014was determined to crush Protestantism and never compromise with it. Unrest began in the south, centered in the large rich metropolis of Antwerp. The Netherlands was an especially rich unit of the Spanish realm, especially after the [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]] of 1559; it ended four decades of warfare between France and Spain and allowed Spain to reposition its army.<ref name=\"Albert Guerard 1959 pp. 134\">Albert Guerard, ''France, A Modern History'', (1959), pp. 134\u201336.</ref>\n\nIn 1548, Charles granted the Netherlands status as an entity in which many of the laws of the Holy Roman Empire became obsolete.

Po-chia Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006) pp. 118\u201334</ref> Dutch [[Protestants]], after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities.

Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 104</ref> In a society dependent on trade, freedom and tolerance were considered essential. Nevertheless, the Catholic rulers Charles V, and later [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], made it their mission to defeat Protestantism, which was considered a heresy by the Catholic Church and a threat to the stability of the whole hierarchical political system. On the other hand, the intensely moralistic Dutch Protestants insisted their Biblical theology, sincere piety and humble lifestyle was morally superior to the luxurious habits and superficial religiosity of the ecclesiastical nobility.<ref>Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006) pp. 3\u201336</ref> The rulers' harsh punitive measures led to increasing grievances in the Netherlands, where the local governments had embarked on a course of peaceful coexistence. In the second half of the century, the situation escalated. Philip sent troops to crush the rebellion and make the Netherlands once more a Catholic region.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 155</ref>\n\nIn the first wave of the Reformation, [[Lutheranism]] won over the elites in Antwerp and the South.  The Spanish successfully suppressed it there, and Lutheranism only flourished in east Friesland.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 374\u201375</ref>\n\nThe second wave of the Reformation, came in the form of [[Anabaptism]], that was popular among ordinary farmers in [[Holland]] and [[Friesland]]. Anabaptists were socially very radical and equalitarian; they believed that the apocalypse was very near. They refused to live the old way, and began new communities, creating considerable chaos. A prominent Dutch Anabaptist was [[Menno Simons]], who initiated the [[Mennonite]] church. The movement was allowed in the north, but never grew to a large scale.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 86\u201391</ref>\n\nThe third wave of the Reformation, that ultimately proved to be permanent, was [[Calvinism]]. It arrived in the Netherlands in the 1540s, attracting both the elite and the common population, especially in [[Flanders]]. The Catholic Spanish responded with harsh persecution and introduced the [[Inquisition of the Netherlands]]. Calvinists rebelled. First there was the [[Beeldenstorm|iconoclasm]] in 1566, which was the systematic destruction of statues of saints and other Catholic devotional depictions in churches. In 1566, [[William the Silent]], a Calvinist, started the [[Eighty Years' War]] to liberate all Dutch of whatever religion from Catholic Spain. Blum says, \"His patience, tolerance, determination, concern for his people, and belief in government by consent held the Dutch together and kept alive their spirit of revolt.\"<ref>Jerome Blum et al, ''The European World: A History'' (1970) pp 160\u201361</ref>  The provinces of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]], being mainly Calvinist by 1572, submitted to the rule of William. The other states remained almost entirely Catholic.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 361\u201395</ref><ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Reformation'' (2005)  pp. 367\u201372</ref>\n\n===Prelude to war===\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| title = \n| image1 = Isaac Claesz. van Swanenburg - The Removal of the Wool from the Skins and the Combing - WGA21986.jpg|caption1=1595 painting by [[Isaac van Swanenburg]] illustrating [[Leiden]] textile workers.\n| image2 = Adriaen Thomasz.

This treaty ended a forty-year period of warfare between France and Spain conducted in Italy from 1521 to 1559.<ref name=\"Albert Guerard 1959 pp. 134\"/> The Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis was somewhat of a watershed\u2014not only for the battleground that Italy had been, but also for northern Europe. Spain had been keeping troops in the Netherlands to be ready to attack France from the north as well as from the south.\n\nWith the settlement of so many major issues between France and Spain by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, there was no longer any reason to keep Spanish troops in the Netherlands.  Thus, the people of the Netherlands could get on with their peacetime pursuits.  As they did so they found that there was a great deal of demand for their products.  Fishing had long been an important part of the economy of the Netherlands.  However, now the fishing of herring alone came to occupy 2,000 boats operating out of Dutch ports. Spain, still the Dutch trader's best customer, was buying fifty large ships full of furniture and household utensils from Flanders merchants. Additionally, Dutch woolen goods were desired everywhere.  The Netherlands bought and processed enough Spanish wool to sell four million florins of wool products through merchants in Bruges. So strong was the Dutch appetite for raw wool at this time that they bought nearly as much English wool as they did Spanish wool.  Total commerce with England alone amounted to 24 million florins.  Much of the export going to England resulted in pure profit to the Dutch because the exported items were of their own manufacture. The Netherlands was just starting to enter its \"Golden Age.\" Brabant and Flanders were the richest and most flourishing parts of the Dutch Republic at the time.<ref name=\"Claflin\">Claflin, W. Harold, ed. ''History of Nations: Holland and Belgium'', (New York: P.F. Collier & Son, 1907), pp. 72\u201374, 103\u201305</ref> The Netherlands was one of the richest places in the world. The population reached 3 million in 1560, with 25 cities of 10,000 people or more, by far the largest urban presence in Europe; with the trading and financial center of Antwerp being especially important (population 100,000). Spain could not afford to lose this rich land, nor allow it to fall from Catholic control. Thus came 80 years of warfare.\n\nA devout Catholic, Philip was appalled by the success of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the [[Low Countries]], which had led to an increasing number of [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. His attempts to enforce religious persecution of the Protestants, and his centralization of government, law enforcement, and taxes, made him unpopular and led to a [[revolt]]. [[Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba]], was sent with a Spanish Army to punish the unruly Dutch in 1567.<ref name=\"Motley\">John Lathrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' (Harper & Bros.: New York, 1855) pp. 106\u201315, 121, 122, 207, 213</ref>\n\nThe only opposition the Duke of Alba faced in his march across the Netherlands were the nobles, [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]]; [[Philippe de Montmorency, Count of Horn]] and others. With the approach of Alba and the Spanish army, [[William the Silent]] of Orange fled to Germany with his three brothers and his whole family on 11 April 1567. The Duke of Alba sought to meet and negotiate with the nobles that now faced him with armies.  However, when the nobles arrived in Brussels they were all arrested and Egmont and Horn were executed.<ref name=\"Motley\"/> Alba then revoked all the prior treaties that Margaret, the [[Duchess of Parma]] had signed with the Protestants of the Netherlands and instituted the Inquisition to enforce the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].\n\n==The Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648)==\n{{Main|Eighty Years' War|Dutch Revolt}}\n[[File:Slag bij Nieuwpoort.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurits]] at the [[Battle of Nieuwpoort]], 1600 CE, by Paulus van Hillegaert.]]\n[[File:Leo belgicus.png|thumb|[[Leo Belgicus]], a map of the [[low countries]] drawn in the shape of a lion, by [[Claes Jansz. Visscher]] (II), 1609 CE.]]\nThe Dutch War for Independence from Spain is frequently called the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648).  The first fifty years (1568 through 1618) were uniquely a war between Spain and the Netherlands.  During the last thirty years (1618\u20131648) the conflict between Spain and the Netherlands was submerged in the general European War that became known as the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, ed. ''The Thirty Years' War'', New York: Routledge Press, 1987, p. 2.</ref>  The seven rebellious provinces of the Netherlands were eventually united by the [[Union of Utrecht]] in 1579 and formed the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] (also known as the \"United Provinces\"). The [[Act of Abjuration]] or ''Plakkaat van Verlatinghe'' was signed on 26 July 1581, and was the formal [[declaration of independence]] of the northern [[Low Countries]] from the Spanish king.\n\n[[William the Silent|William of Orange]] (Slot Dillenburg, 24 April 1533 \u2013 Delft, 10 July 1584), the founder of the Dutch royal family, led the Dutch during the first part of the war, following the death of Egmont and Horn in 1568. The very first years were a success for the Spanish troops. However, the Dutch countered subsequent sieges in [[Holland]]. In November and December 1572, all the citizens of [[Zutphen]] and [[Naarden]] were slaughtered by the Spanish. From 11 December that year the city of [[Haarlem]] was besieged, holding out for seven months until 13 July 1573. [[Oudewater]] was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed. [[Maastricht]] was besieged, sacked and destroyed twice in succession (in 1576 and 1579) by the Spanish.\n\nIn a war composed mostly of sieges rather than battles, [[Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma|Governor-General Alexander Farnese]] proved his mettle. His strategy was to offer generous terms for the surrender of a city: there would be no more massacres or looting; historic urban privileges were retained; there was a full pardon and amnesty; return to the Catholic Church would be gradual. The conservative Catholics in the south and east supported the Spanish. Farnese recaptured [[Antwerp]] and nearly all of what became Belgium.<ref>Violet Soen, \"Reconquista and Reconciliation in the Dutch Revolt: The Campaign of Governor-General Alexander Farnese (1578\u20131592),\" ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (2012) 16#1 pp. 1\u201322.</ref> Most of the Dutch-speaking territory in the Netherlands was taken from Spain, but not in [[Flanders]], which to this day remains part of Belgium. Flanders was the most radical anti-Spanish territory. Many Flemish fled to Holland, among them half of the population of Antwerp, 3/4 of Bruges and Ghent and the entire population of Nieuwpoort, Dunkerque and countryside.<ref>Bart de Groof, \"Alexander Farnese and the Origins of Modern Belgium,\" ''Bulletin de l'Institut Historique Belge de Rome'' (1993) Vol. 63, pp. 195\u2013219.</ref> His successful campaign gave the Catholics control of the lower half of the Low Countries, and was part of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]].\n\nThe war dragged on for another half century, but the main fighting was over. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], signed in 1648, confirmed the independence of the United Provinces from Spain. The Dutch people started to develop a national identity since the 15th century, but they officially remained a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until 1648. National identity was mainly formed by the province people came from. Holland was the most important province by far. The republic of the Seven Provinces came to be known as '''Holland''' across Europe.\n\nThe Catholics in the Netherlands were an outlawed minority that had been suppressed by the Calvinists. After 1572, however, they made a striking comeback (also as part of the Catholic Counter-Reformation), setting up seminaries, reforming their Church, and sending missionaries into Protestant districts.

During the Golden Age, there was a great flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the sciences in the Netherlands. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch were arguably the most economically wealthy and scientifically advanced of all European nations. This new, officially Calvinist nation flourished culturally and economically, creating what historian [[Simon Schama]] has called an \"embarrassment of riches\".<ref name=\"Schama\">Schama, Simon, ''The Embarrassment of Riches'', Bath: William Collins & Sons, 1987. At p. 8: \"The prodigious quality of their success went to their heads, but it also made them a bit queasy. Even their most uninhibited documents of self-congratulations are haunted by the threat of ''overvloed'', the surfeit that rose like a cresting flood \u2013 a word heavy with warning as well as euphoria...But at the very least, the continuous pricking of conscience on complacency produced the self-consciousness that we think of as embarrassed.\"</ref> [[Tulip mania|Speculation in the tulip trade]] led to a first stock market crash in 1637, but the economic crisis was soon overcome. Due to these developments the 17th century has been dubbed the Golden Age of the Netherlands.\n\nThe invention<ref>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/leeg001haer01_01/leeg001haer01_01_0028.php Sawmills (or \"''saagmolens''\" in Dutch)] were invented in [[Uitgeest]], according to the \"Haarlemmermeer boeck\" by [[Jan Adriaanszoon Leeghwater]]</ref> of the [[sawmill]] enabled the construction of a massive fleet of ships for worldwide trading and for defence of the republic's economic interests by military means. National industries such as shipyards and sugar refineries expanded as well.\n\n[[File:Anatomie Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]], by [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], 1632 CE.]]\nThe Dutch, traditionally able seafarers and keen mapmakers,<ref>The maps used by [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]] to attack Dutch cities overland and by water were made by Dutch mapmakers.</ref> obtained an increasingly dominant position in world trade, a position which before had been occupied by the Portuguese and [[Spain|Spaniards]]. In 1602 the [[Dutch East India Company]] (Dutch: ''Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or ''VOC'') was founded. It was the first-ever [[multinational corporation]], financed by shares that established the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|first modern stock exchange]]. It became the world's largest commercial enterprise of the 17th century. To finance the growing trade within the region, the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] was established in 1609, the precursor to, if not the first true [[central bank]].<ref>Quinn, Stephen. Roberds, William.

In addition some Portuguese colonies were conquered, namely in Northeastern [[Brazil]], Angola, [[Indonesia]] and [[Ceylon]]. In 1640 by the [[Dutch East India Company]] began a trade monopoly with Japan through the trading post on [[Dejima]].\n\nThe Dutch also dominated trade between European countries. The Low Countries were favorably positioned on a crossing of east-west and north-south trade routes and connected to a large German hinterland through the [[Rhine]] river. Dutch traders shipped wine from France and Portugal to the [[Baltic region|Baltic lands]] and returned with grain destined for countries around the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  By the 1680s, an average of nearly 1000 Dutch ships entered the [[Baltic Sea]] each year.<ref>\"[http://www.balticconnections.net/index.cfm?article=Mercantilism+in+the+West+Baltic Baltic Connections: Mercantilism in the West Baltic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181844/http://www.balticconnections.net/index.cfm?article=Mercantilism+in+the+West+Baltic |date=23 September 2015 }}\", BalticConnections.net.

Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was a businessman and scientist in the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age of Dutch science and technology]].]]\n[[Renaissance Humanism]], of which [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (c. 1466\u20131536) was an important advocate, had also gained a firm foothold and was partially responsible for a climate of tolerance. Overall, levels of tolerance were sufficiently high to attract religious refugees from other countries, notably Jewish merchants from [[Portugal]] who brought much wealth with them. The revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France in 1685 resulted in the immigration of many French [[Huguenots]], many of whom were shopkeepers or scientists. Still tolerance had its limits, as philosopher [[Baruch de Spinoza]] (1632\u20131677) would find out. Due to its climate of intellectual tolerance the Dutch Republic attracted scientists and other thinkers from all over Europe. Especially the renowned [[University of Leiden]] (established in 1575 by the Dutch [[stadtholder]], [[William the Silent|William of Oranje]], as a token of gratitude for Leiden's fierce resistance against Spain during the Eighty Years' War) became a gathering place for these people. For instance French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] lived in Leiden from 1628 until 1649.\n\nDutch lawyers were famous for their knowledge of international [[Admiralty law|law of the sea]] and [[commercial law]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583\u20131645) played a leading part in the foundation of [[international law]]. Again due to the Dutch climate of tolerance, book publishers flourished. Many books about religion, philosophy and science that might have been deemed controversial abroad were printed in the Netherlands and secretly exported to other countries. Thus during the 17th century the Dutch Republic became more and more Europe's publishing house.\n\n[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Johannes Vermeer]]'s ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'']]\n\n[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) was a famous [[astronomer]], [[physicist]] and mathematician. He invented the [[pendulum clock]], which was a major step forward towards exact timekeeping. He contributed to the fields of [[optics]]. The most famous Dutch scientist in the area of optics is certainly [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], who invented or greatly improved the [[microscope]] (opinions differ) and was the first to methodically study microscopic life, thus laying the foundations for the field of [[microbiology]]. Famous Dutch hydraulic engineer [[Jan Leeghwater]] (1575\u20131650) gained important victories in The Netherlands's eternal battle against the sea. Leeghwater added a considerable amount of land to the republic by converting several large lakes into [[polder]]s, pumping all water out with windmills.\n\nPainting was the dominant art form in 17th-century Holland. [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] followed many of the tendencies that dominated [[Baroque art]] in other parts of Europe, as with the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], but was the leader in developing the subjects of [[still life]], [[landscape painting|landscape]], and [[genre painting]]. [[Portrait]]ure were also popular, but [[history painting]] \u2013 traditionally the [[hierarchy of genres|most-elevated genre]] struggled to find buyers.  Church art was virtually non-existent, and little sculpture of any kind produced. While art collecting and painting for the open market was also common elsewhere, art historians point to the growing number of wealthy Dutch middle-class and successful mercantile patrons as driving forces in the popularity of certain pictorial subjects.<ref name=\"gardner\">Gardner, Helen, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', Belmont, CA: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005, pp. 718\u201319.</ref> Today, the best-known painters of the Dutch Golden Age are the period's most dominant figure [[Rembrandt]], the [[Delft]] master of genre [[Johannes Vermeer]], the innovative landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], and [[Frans Hals]], who infused new life into portraiture. Some notable artistic styles and trends include Haarlem [[Mannerism]], [[Utrecht Caravaggism]], the [[Delft School (painting)|School of Delft]], the Leiden [[fijnschilder]]s, and Dutch [[classicism]].\n\n[[File:Den Haag, Mauritshuis vanaf Hofvijver 2006-05-29 16.12.JPG|thumb|The [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Classicist]] [[Mauritshuis]], named after [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|Prince Johan Maurits]] and built 1636\u20131641, was designed by [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]].]]\nDue to the thriving economy, cities expanded greatly. New town halls, weighhouses and storehouses were built. Merchants that had gained a fortune ordered a new house built along one of the many new canals that were dug out in and around many cities (for defence and transport purposes), a house with an ornamented fa\u00e7ade that befitted their new status. In the countryside, many new castles and stately homes were built. Most of them have not survived. Starting at 1595 Reformed churches were commissioned, many of which are still landmarks today. The most famous Dutch architects of the 17th century were [[Jacob van Campen]], [[Pieter Post]], Pieter Vingbooms, [[Lieven de Key]], [[Hendrick de Keyser]]. Overall, Dutch architecture, which generally combined traditional building styles with some foreign elements, did not develop to the level of painting.\n\nThe Golden Age was also an important time for developments in literature. Some of the major figures of this period were [[Gerbrand Adriaenszoon Bredero]], [[Jacob Cats]], [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]] and [[Joost van den Vondel]]. Since Latin was the lingua franca of education, relatively few men could speak, write, and read Dutch all at the same time.\n\nMusic did not develop very much in the Netherlands since the Calvinists considered it an unnecessary extravagance, and organ music was forbidden in Reformed Church services, although it remained common at secular functions.\n\n==Dutch Empire==\n\n=== The Dutch in the Americas ===\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|New Amsterdam in 1664 CE.]]\n{{main|Dutch West India Company|New Netherland|New Amsterdam}}\n\nThe Dutch West India Company was a [[chartered company]] (known as the \"GWC\") of Dutch merchants. On 2 June 1621, it was granted a [[:wikisource:Charter of the Dutch West India Company|charter]] for a trade monopoly in the [[West Indies]] (meaning the Caribbean) by the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] and given jurisdiction over the [[African slave trade]], Brazil, the [[Caribbean]], and North America. Its area of operations stretched from West Africa to the Americas, and the Pacific islands. The company became instrumental in the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas]]. The first forts and settlements in [[Guyana]] and on the [[Amazon River]] date from the 1590s. Actual colonization, with Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with England and France. Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of that century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of [[Suriname]] and a number of Dutch Caribbean islands.\n\n[[File:Peter Stuyvesant.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Peter Stuyvesant]], Director-General of [[New Netherland]] (New York). His provincial capital, [[New Amsterdam]], was located at the southern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]].]]\nThe colony was a private business venture to exploit the [[fur trade]] in beaver pelts. New Netherland was slowly settled during its first decades, partially as a result of policy mismanagement by the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC), and conflicts with Native Americans. During the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the [[Atlantic World]], tolerating a highly diverse ethnic mix. The surrender of [[Fort Amsterdam]] to the British control in 1664 was formalized in 1667, contributing to the [[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]].  In 1673 the Dutch re-took the area, but later relinquished it under the 5 April 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] ending the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Holland |volume=13 |page=601 |first=George |last=Edmundson}}</ref>\n\nDescendants of the original settlers played a prominent role in the [[History of the United States]], as typified by the Roosevelt and Vanderbilt families.

The marooned crew, the first Europeans to attempt settlement in the area, built a [[fort]] and stayed for a year until they were rescued. Shortly thereafter, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (in the Dutch of the day: ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', or VOC) decided to establish a permanent settlement. The VOC, one of the major European trading houses sailing the [[Spice trade|spice route]] to East Asia, had no intention of colonizing the area, instead wanting only to establish a secure base camp where passing ships could shelter, and where hungry sailors could stock up on fresh supplies of meat, fruit, and vegetables. To this end, a small VOC expedition under the command of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] reached [[Table Bay]] on 6 April 1652.<ref name=\"Noble-141\">{{Cite book|last=Noble|first=John|title=Illustrated Official Handbook of the Cape and South Africa; A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the history, conditions, populations, productions and resources of the several colonies, states, and territories|publisher=J.C.

This arrangement proved highly successful, producing abundant supplies of fruit, vegetables, wheat, and wine; they also later raised livestock. The small initial group of \"free burghers\", as these farmers were known, steadily increased in number and began to expand their farms further north and east.\n\nThe majority of burghers had [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch ancestry]] and belonged to the [[Calvinist Reformed Church of the Netherlands]], but there were also numerous Germans as well as some Scandinavians. In 1688 the Dutch and the Germans were joined by French [[Huguenots]], also Calvinists, who were fleeing religious persecution in France under [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. The [[Huguenots in South Africa]] were absorbed into the Dutch population but they played a prominent role in South Africa's history.\n\nFrom the beginning, the VOC used the cape as a place to supply ships travelling between the Netherlands and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. There was a close association between the cape and these Dutch possessions in the far east. Van Riebeeck and the VOC began to import large numbers of slaves, primarily from [[Madagascar]] and [[Indonesia]]. These slaves often married Dutch settlers, and their descendants became known as the [[Cape Coloureds]] and the [[Cape Malays]].\n\n[[File:Aernout Smit Table Bay, 1683 William Fehr Collection Cape Town.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Table Bay|De Tafelbaai]] by Aernout Smit, 1683.]]\nDuring the 18th century, the Dutch settlement in the area of the cape grew and prospered.

The supplying of these ships with fresh provisions, fruit, and [[South African wine|wine]] provided a very large market for the surplus produce of the colony.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nSome free burghers continued to expand into the rugged hinterlands of the north and east, many began to take up a semi-nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] lifestyle, in some ways not far removed from that of the [[Khoikhoi]] they had displaced. In addition to its herds, a family might have a [[wagon]], a [[tent]], a Bible, and a few guns. As they became more settled, they would build a [[mud]]-walled [[cottage]], frequently located, by choice, days of travel from the nearest European settlement. These were the first of the [[Trekboer]]s (Wandering Farmers, later shortened to [[Boer]]s), completely independent of official controls, extraordinarily self-sufficient, and isolated from the government and the main settlement in [[Cape Town]].\n\n[[File:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An account of the first [[trekboer]]s.]]\n[[Dutch language|Dutch]] was the official language, but a dialect had formed that was quite distinct from Dutch.

They seized the Cape Colony in 1795 to prevent it from falling into French hands, then briefly relinquished it back to the Dutch (1803), before definitively conquering it in 1806. British [[sovereignty]] of the area was recognised at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. By the time the Dutch colony was seized by the British in 1806, it had grown into an established settlement with 25,000 slaves, 20,000 white colonists, 15,000 [[Khoisan]], and 1,000 freed black slaves. Outside Cape Town and the immediate hinterland, isolated black and white [[pastoralists]] populated the country.\n\nDutch interest in South Africa was mainly as a strategically located VOC port. Yet in the 17th and 18th centuries the Dutch created the foundation of the modern state of South Africa. The Dutch legacy in South Africa is evident everywhere, but particularly in the [[Afrikaner]] people and the [[Afrikaans]] language.\n\n==Dutch Republic: Regents and Stadholders (1649\u20131784)==\n{{main|Dutch Republic}}\n[[File:Hendrick Avercamp - A Scene on the Ice - WGA01076.jpg|thumb|''Skating fun'', a traditional rural scene by 17th-century Dutch painter [[Hendrick Avercamp]].]]\n\nThe Netherlands gained independence from Spain as a result of the [[Eighty Years' War]], during which the Dutch Republic was founded. As the Netherlands was a republic, it was largely governed by an aristocracy of city-merchants called the [[Regenten|regents]], rather than by a king. Every city and province had its own government and laws, and a large degree of autonomy. After attempts to find a competent sovereign proved unsuccessful, it was decided that [[sovereignty]] would be vested in the various provincial Estates, the governing bodies of the provinces. The [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], with its representatives from all the provinces, would decide on matters important to the Republic as a whole. However, at the head of each province was the [[stadtholder]] of that province, a position held by a descendant of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]]. Usually the stadtholdership of several provinces was held by a single man.\n\nAfter having gained its independence in 1648, the Netherlands tried in various coalitions to help to contain France, which had replaced Spain as the strongest nation of Europe. The end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1713) marked the end of the Dutch Republic as a major player. In the 18th century, it just tried to maintain its independence and stuck to a policy of neutrality.\n\nThe economy, based on Amsterdam's role as the center of world trade, remained robust. In 1670 the Dutch merchant marine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping\u2014about half the European total.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tim William Blanning|title=The Pursuit of Glory: Europe, 1648\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmkcaEfwcsQC&pg=PA96|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|page=96|isbn=9780670063208}}</ref> The province of Holland was highly commercial and dominated the country.  Its nobility was small and closed and had little influence, for it was numerically small, politically weak, and formed a strictly closed caste. Most land in the province of Holland was commercialized for cash crops and was owned by urban capitalists, not nobles; there were few links between Holland's nobility and the merchants. By 1650 the burgher families which had grown wealthy through commerce and become influential in government controlled the province of Holland, and to a large extent shaped national policies. The other six provinces were more rural and traditional in life style, had an active nobility, and played a small role in commerce and national politics.  Instead they concentrated on their flood protections and land reclamation projects.<ref>{{cite book|author=E.H. Kossmann, \"The Dutch Republic,\" in F. L.

Many immigrants came to the cities of Holland in the 17th and 18th century from the Protestant parts of Germany and elsewhere. The amount of first generation immigrants from outside the Netherlands in Amsterdam was nearly 50% in the 17th and 18th centuries. Indeed, Amsterdam's population consisted primarily of immigrants, if one includes second and third generation immigrants and migrants from the Dutch countryside. People in most parts of Europe were poor and many were unemployed. But in Amsterdam there was always work. Tolerance was important, because a continuous influx of immigrants was necessary for the economy. Travellers visiting Amsterdam reported their surprise at the lack of control over the influx.\n\n===Economic growth===\n{{main|Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)}}\nThe era of explosive economic growth is roughly coterminous with the period of social and cultural bloom that has been called the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and that actually formed the material basis for that cultural era.  Amsterdam became the hub of world trade, the center into which staples and luxuries flowed for sorting, processing, and distribution, and then reexported around Europe and the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joost Jonker|title=Merchants, bankers, middlemen: the Amsterdam money market during the first half of the 19th century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xwWAQAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=NEHA|page=32|isbn=9789057420016}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1585 through 1622 there was the rapid accumulation of trade capital, often brought in by refugee merchantes from Antwerp and other ports.  The money was typically invested in high-risk ventures like pioneering expeditions to the [[East Indies]] to engage in the [[spice trade]]. These ventures were soon consolidated in the [[Dutch East India Company]] ('''VOC'''). There were similar ventures in different fields however, like the trade on Russia and the [[Levant]]. The profits of these ventures were ploughed back in the financing of new trade, which led to its exponential growth.<ref>Charles R. Boxer, ''The Dutch Seaborne Empire 1600\u20131800'' (1965)</ref>\n\nRapid industrialization led to the rapid growth of the nonagricultural labor force and the increase in real wages during the same time. In the half-century between 1570 and 1620 this labor supply increased 3 percent per annum, a truly phenomenal growth. Despite this, nominal wages were repeatedly increased, outstripping price increases. In consequence, real wages for unskilled laborers were 62 percent higher in 1615\u20131619 than in 1575\u20131579.<ref>Jan de Vries and A. van der Woude, ''The First Modern Economy.

The city contributed the largest quota in taxes to the States of Holland which in turn contributed over half the quota to the States General. Amsterdam was also one of the most reliable in settling tax demands and therefore was able to use the threat to withhold such payments to good effect.<ref>Regin, Deric, ''Traders, Artists, Burghers: A Cultural History of Amsterdam in the 17th century'' Van Gorcum, 1976, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmsterdam was governed by a body of regents, a large, but closed, oligarchy with control over all aspects of the city's life, and a dominant voice in the foreign affairs of Holland. Only men with sufficient wealth and a long enough residence within the city could join the ruling class. The first step for an ambitious and wealthy merchant family was to arrange a marriage with a long-established regent family. In the 1670s one such union, that of the Trip family (the Amsterdam branch of the Swedish arms makers) with the son of Burgomaster Valckenier, extended the influence and patronage available to the latter and strengthened his dominance of the council. The oligarchy in Amsterdam thus gained strength from its breadth and openness. In the smaller towns family interest could unite members on policy decisions but contraction through intermarriage could lead to the degeneration of the quality of the members.\n\nIn Amsterdam the network was so large that members of the same family could be related to opposing factions and pursue widely separated interests.  The young men who had risen to positions of authority in the 1670s and 1680s consolidated their hold on office well into the 1690s and even the new century.<ref>Edwards, Elizabeth, \"Amsterdam and William III,\" ''History Today,'' (Dec 1993), Vol. 43, Issue 12 pp. 25\u201331</ref>\n\nAmsterdam's regents provided good services to residents.

This open door policy has been interpreted as proof of a tolerant ruling class. But toleration was practiced for the convenience of the city. Therefore, the wealthy Sephardic Jews from Portugal were welcomed and accorded all privileges except those of citizenship, but the poor Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe were far more carefully vetted and those who became dependent on the city were encouraged to move on.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paolo Bernardini|author2=Norman Fiering|title=The Jews and the Expansion of Europe to the West, 1400\u20131800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0JAGMuePO0C&pg=PA372|year=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=372|isbn=9781571814302}}</ref> Similarly, provision for the housing of Huguenot immigrants was made in 1681 when [[Louis XIV]]'s religious policy was beginning to drive these Protestants out of France; no encouragement was given to the dispossessed Dutch from the countryside or other towns of Holland.

The regents seized the opportunity: there would be no new stadtholder in Holland for 22 years. [[Johan de Witt]], a brilliant politician and diplomat, emerged as the dominant figure.  Princes of Orange became the stadtholder and an almost hereditary ruler in 1672 and 1748. The Dutch Republic of the United Provinces was a true republic from 1650 to 1672 and 1702\u20131748. These periods are called the [[First Stadtholderless Period]] and [[Second Stadtholderless Period]].\n\n===Anglo-Dutch wars===\n[[File:Vonstetinaseconddayof4daybattleof1666.jpg|thumb|\"The Second Day of the Four Day Battle of 1666\"]]\n{{main|Anglo-Dutch wars}}\nThe Republic and England were major rivals in world trade and naval power. Halfway through the 17th century the Republic's [[Royal Netherlands Navy|navy]] was the rival of Britain's Royal Navy as the most powerful navy in the world.  The Republic fought a series of three [[Anglo-Dutch wars|naval wars against England]] in 1652\u201374.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Richard Hill|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzrya4r-2n8C&pg=PA73|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=68\u201375|isbn=9780198605270}}</ref>\n\nIn 1651, England imposed its first [[1651 Navigation Act|Navigation Act]], which severely hurt Dutch trade interests. An incident at sea concerning the Act resulted in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], which lasted from 1652 to 1654, ending in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)]], which left the Navigation Act in effect.\n\nAfter the [[English Restoration]] in 1660, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] tried to serve his dynastic interests by attempting to make [[William III of England|Prince William III of Orange]], his nephew, [[stadtholder]] of the Republic, using some military pressure. King Charles thought a naval war would weaken the Dutch traders and strengthen the English economy and empire, so the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] was launched in 1665. At first many Dutch ships were captured and the English scored great victories.  However, the [[Raid on the Medway]], in June 1667, ended the war with a Dutch victory. The Dutch recovered their trade, while the English economy was seriously hurt and its treasury nearly bankrupt.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, \"Prizes and Profits: Dutch Maritime Trade during the Second Anglo-Dutch War,\" ''International Journal of Maritime History'' (2007) 19#2 pp 139\u201359.</ref> The greatly expanded Dutch navy was for years after the world's strongest.

England declared war on the Republic, (the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]), followed by France, [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Cologne]], which had all signed alliances against the Republic. France, Cologne and M\u00fcnster invaded the Republic. Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis, who had accomplished a diplomatic balancing act for a long time, were now the obvious scapegoats. They were lynched, and a new [[stadtholder]], William III, was appointed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johan-De-Witt|title=Johan De Witt|date=20 September 2018|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nAn Anglo-French attempt to land on the Dutch shore was barely repelled in three desperate naval battles under command of [[Admiral (Netherlands)|Admiral]] [[Michiel de Ruyter]]. The advance of French troops from the south was halted by a costly inundation of its own heartland, by breaching river dikes. With the aid of friendly German princes, the Dutch succeeded in fighting back [[Cologne]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], after which the peace was signed with both of them, although some territory in the east was lost forever. Peace was signed with England as well, in 1674 ([[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Second Treaty of Westminster]]). In 1678, peace was made with France at the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]], although France's Spanish and German allies felt betrayed by this.\n\nIn 1688, the relations with England reached crisis level once again. Stadtholder [[William III of England|William III]] decided he had to take a huge gamble when he was invited to invade England by Protestant British nobles feuding with William's father-in-law the Catholic [[James II of England]]. This led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] and cemented the principle of parliamentary rule and Protestant ascendency in England.  James fled to France, and William ascended to the English throne as co-monarch with his wife Mary, James' eldest daughter.  This manoeuvre secured England as a critical ally of the United Provinces in its ongoing wars with [[Louis XIV of France]].  William was the commander of the Dutch and English armies and fleets until his death in 1702.  During William's reign as King of England, his primary focus was leveraging British manpower and finances to aid the Dutch against the French.  The combination continued after his death as the combined Dutch, British, and mercenary army conquered Flanders and Brabant, and invaded French territory before the alliance collapsed in 1713 due to British political infighting.\n\n===Second Stadtholderless Period (1702\u20131747)===\n{{main| Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:Cornelis Troost02.jpg|thumb|The Inspectors of the Collegium Medicum in Amsterdam, by [[Cornelis Troost]], 1724. This period is known as the \"Periwig Era\".]]\n\nThe ''Second Stadtholderless Period'' ({{lang-nl|Tweede Stadhouderloze Tijdperk}}) is the designation in Dutch [[historiography]] of the period between the death of [[stadtholder]] [[William III of England|William III]] on 19 March<ref>This is the date from the [[Gregorian calendar]] that was followed at the time in the Dutch Republic; according to the [[Julian calendar]], still used in England at the time, the date of death was 8 March.</ref> 1702 and the appointment of [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] as stadtholder and captain general in all provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]] on 2 May 1747. During this period the office of stadtholder was left vacant in the provinces of [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], though in other provinces that office was filled by members of the House of Nassau-Dietz (later called Orange-Nassau) during various periods.\n\nDuring the period, the Republic lost its Great-Power status and its primacy in world trade, processes that went hand-in-hand, the latter causing the former. Though the economy declined considerably, causing deindustralization and deurbanization in the maritime provinces, a ''rentier''-class kept accumulating a large capital fund that formed the basis for the leading position the Republic achieved in the international capital market. A military crisis at the end of the period caused the fall of the [[Dutch States Party|States-Party regime]] and the restoration of the Stadtholderate in all provinces. However, though the new stadtholder acquired near-dictatorial powers, this did not improve the situation.\n\n===Economic decline after 1730===\nThe slow economic decline after 1730 was relative: other countries grew faster, eroding the Dutch lead and surpassing it. Wilson identifies three causes. Holland lost its world dominance in trade as competitors emerged and copied its practices, built their own ships and ports, and traded on their own account directly without going through Dutch intermediaries. Second, there was no growth in manufacturing, due perhaps to a weaker sense of industrial entrepreneurship and to the high wage scale. Third the wealthy turned their investments to foreign loans. This helped jump-start other nations and provided the Dutch with a steady income from collecting interest, but leaving them with few domestic sectors with a potential for rapid growth.<ref>C. H. Wilson, \"The Economic Decline of the Netherlands,\" ''Economic History Review'' (1939) 9#2 pp. 111\u2013127, esp. p. 113  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2590218 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic'', pp. 999\u20131018</ref>\n\nAfter the Dutch fleet declined, merchant interests became dependent on the goodwill of Britain. The main focus of Dutch leaders was reducing the country's considerable budget deficits. Dutch trade and shipping remained at a fairly steady level through the 18th century, but no longer had a near monopoly and also could not match growing English and French competition. The Netherlands lost its position as the trading centre of Northern Europe to London.\n\nAlthough the Netherlands remained wealthy, investors for the nation's money became more difficult to find. Some investment went into purchases of land for estates, but most went to foreign bonds and Amsterdam remained one of Europe's banking capitals.\n\n===Culture and society===\nDutch culture also declined both in the arts and sciences. Literature for example largely imitated English and French styles with little in the way of innovation or originality.  The most influential intellectual was [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647\u20131706), a Protestant refugee from France who settled in Rotterdam where he wrote the massive [[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]] (''Historical and Critical Dictionary'', 1696). It had a major impact on the thinking of [[The Enlightenment]] across Europe, giving an arsenal of weapons to critics who wanted to attack religion. It was an encyclopaedia of ideas that argued that most \"truths\" were merely opinions, and that gullibility and stubbornness were prevalent.<ref>Thomas M. Lennon and Michael Hickson, \"Pierre Bayle,\" ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (2012) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ online]</ref>\n\nLife for the average Dutchman became slower and more relaxed than in the 18th century. The upper and middle classes continued to enjoy prosperity and high living standards. The drive to succeed seemed less urgent. Unskilled laborers remained locked in poverty and hardship. The large underclass of unemployed beggars and riffraff required government and private charity to survive.\n\nReligious life became more relaxed as well. Catholics grew from 18% to 23% of the population during the 18th century and enjoyed greater tolerance, even as they continued to be outside the political system. They became divided by the feud between moralistic Jansenists (who denied free will) and orthodox believers. One group of Jansenists formed a splinter sect, the [[Old Catholic Church]] in 1723. The upper classes willingly embraced the ideas of the Enlightenment, tempered by the tolerance that meant less hostility to organized religion compared to France.<ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic'', pp. 1021, 1033\u201336</ref>\n\n===The Orangist revolution (1747\u20131751)===\n{{Main|Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:StadhouderWillemIV(4).jpg|thumb|left|[[William IV, Prince of Orange]], stadholder from 1747 to 1751 CE.]]\n[[File:Willem v (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Willem V of Orange]], stadholder from 1751 to 1806, and [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina of Prussia]] with three of their five children.

This started as a Prusso-Austrian conflict, but eventually all the neighbours of the [[Dutch Republic]] became involved. On one side were Prussia, France and their allies and on the other Austria, Britain (after 1744) and their allies. At first the Republic strove to remain neutral in this European conflict, but it maintained garrisons in a number of fortresses in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. French grievances and threats spurred the Republic into bring its army up to European standards (84,000 men in 1743).<ref name=\"Israel\">Israel, Jonathan ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (\"Oxford\" Oxford U.P. 1998)  pp. 996\u201397, 1069\u201387</ref>\n\nIn 1744 and 1745 the French attacked Dutch fortresses at [[Menen]] and [[Tournai]]. This prompted the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1745 to join the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]], but this alliance was severely defeated at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in May 1745. In 1746 the French occupied most of the large cities in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Then, in April 1747, apparently as an exercise in armed diplomacy, a relatively small French military force occupied [[Zeelandic Flanders]], part of the Dutch Republic.<ref name=\"Israel\"/>\n\nThis relatively innocuous invasion fully exposed the rot underlying the Dutch defences.  The consequences were spectacular.  Still mindful of the French invasion in the [[Rampjaar|\"Disaster Year\" of 1672]], many fearful people clamored for the restoration of the stadtholderate.<ref name=Israel/> [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], had been waiting impatiently in the wings since acquiring his princely title in 1732.  Over the next year he and his supporters engaged in a number of political battles in various provinces and towns in the Netherlands to wrest control from the [[regenten|regents]]. The aim was for William IV to obtain a firm grip on government patronage and place loyal officials in all strategic government positions. Eventually he managed to achieve this aim in all provinces.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n[[Willem Bentinck van Rhoon]] was a prominent Orangist. People like Bentinck hoped that gathering the reins of power in the hands of a single \"eminent head\" would soon help restore the state of the Dutch economy and finances. The regents they opposed included the Grand Pensionary [[Jacob Gilles]] and Adriaen van der Hoop. This popular revolt had religious, anti-Catholic and democratic overtones and sometimes involved mob violence. It eventually involved political agitation by [[Daniel Raap]], [[Jean Rousset de Missy]] and the [[Doelisten]], attacks on [[Tax farming|tax farmers]] ([[pachtersoproer]]), religious agitation for enforcement of the Sabbath laws and preference for followers of [[Gisbertus Voetius]] and various demands by the civil militia.<ref name=Israel/>\n\nThe war against the French was itself brought to a not-too-devastating end for the [[Dutch Republic]] with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]]. The French retreated of their own accord from the Dutch frontier. William IV died unexpectedly, at the age of 40, on 22 October 1751.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n===Regency and indolent rule (1752\u20131779)===\nHis son, [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], was 3 years old when his father died, and a long regency characterised by corruption and misrule began. His mother delegated most of the powers of the regency to Bentinck and her favorite, [[Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]. All power was concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few, including the Frisian nobleman [[Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins]].<ref name=Israel/> Still a teenager, William V assumed the position of [[stadtholder]] in 1766, the last to hold that office. In 1767, he married [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia]], the daughter of [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William of Prussia]], niece of [[Frederick the Great]].\n\nThe position of the Dutch during the [[American War of Independence]] was one of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. William V, leading the pro-British faction within the government, blocked attempts by pro-independence, and later pro-French, elements to drag the government to war. However, things came to a head with the Dutch attempt to join the Russian-led [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]], leading to the outbreak of the disastrous [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1780. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], the impoverished nation grew restless under William's rule.\n\nAn English historian summed him up uncharitably as \"a Prince of the profoundest lethargy and most abysmal stupidity.\"<ref>Fulford, Roger ''Royal Dukes'' William Collins and Son London 1933</ref> And yet he would guide his family through the difficult French-Batavian period and his son would be crowned king.\n\n===Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780\u20131784)===\n{{Main|Fourth Anglo-Dutch War}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Dogger Bank 5 August 1781.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)]] by [[Thomas Luny]].]]\nThe [[Fourth Anglo\u2013Dutch War]] (1780\u20131784) was a conflict between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].

In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce was concluded as well.\n\nMost of the war consisted of a series of largely successful British operations against Dutch colonial economic interests, although British and Dutch naval forces also [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)|met once off the Dutch coast]].

(Painted by Jonas Zeuner, 1787)]]\n\nInfluenced by the [[American Revolution]], the [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] sought a more democratic form of government. The opening shot of this revolution is often considered to be the 1781 publication of a manifesto called ''[[Aan het Volk van Nederland]]'' (\"To the People of the Netherlands\") by [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], who would become an influential leader of the Patriot movement. Their aim was to reduce corruption and the power held by the [[stadtholder]], [[William V, Prince of Orange]].\n\nSupport for the Patriots came mostly from the middle class. They formed [[militia]]s called ''[[exercitiegenootschap]]pen''. In 1785, there was an open Patriot rebellion, which took the form of an armed insurrection by local militias in certain Dutch towns, ''Freedom'' being the rallying cry. [[Herman Willem Daendels]] attempted to organise an overthrow of various municipal governments ([[vroedschap]]). The goal was to oust government officials and force new elections. \"Seen as a whole this revolution was a string of violent and confused events, accidents, speeches, rumours, bitter enmities and armed confrontations\", wrote French historian [[Fernand Braudel]], who saw it as a forerunner of the [[French Revolution]].\n\nIn 1785 [[William V, Prince of Orange|the stadholder]] left The Hague and moved his court to [[Nijmegen]] in [[Guelders]], a city remote from the heart of Dutch political life. In June 1787, his energetic wife [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina]] (the sister of [[Frederick William II of Prussia]]) tried to travel to [[The Hague]]. Outside [[Schoonhoven]], she was stopped by Patriot militiamen and taken to a farm near [[Goejanverwellesluis]]. Within two days she was forced to return to Nijmegen, an insult not unnoticed in Prussia.\n\nThe House of Orange reacted with severity, relying on [[Prussia]]n troops led by [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick]] and a small contingent of British troops to [[Prussian invasion of Holland|suppress the rebellion]]. Dutch banks at this time still held much of the world's [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Government-sponsored banks owned up to 40% of Great Britain's [[national debt]] and there were close connections to the [[House of Stuart]]. The stadholder had supported British policies after the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThis severe military response overwhelmed the Patriots and put the stadholder firmly back in control. A small unpaid Prussian army was billeted in the Netherlands and supported themselves by looting and extortion. The exercitiegenootschappen continued urging citizens to resist the government. They distributed pamphlets, formed \"Patriot Clubs\" and held public [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s. The government responded by pillaging those towns where opposition continued. Five leaders were sentenced to death (but fled first). Lynchings also occurred. For a while, no one dared appear in public without an orange cockade to show their support for [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangism]]. Many Patriots, perhaps around 40,000 in all, fled to Brabant, France (especially [[Dunkirk]] and [[Saint-Omer|St. Omer]]) and elsewhere. However, before long the French became involved in Dutch politics and the tide turned.\n\n===Batavian Republic (1795\u20131806)===\n{{Main|Batavian Republic}}\n[[File:Vrijheidsboom.jpg|left|thumb|Liberty tree erected in Dam Square in Amsterdam, 1795 by H. Numan.]]\nThe [[French Revolution]] was popular, and numerous underground clubs were promoting it when in January 1795 the [[Flanders Campaign|French army invaded]]. The underground rose up, overthrew the municipal and provincial governments, and proclaimed the [[Batavian Republic]] ({{lang-nl|Bataafse Republiek}}) [[Batavian Revolution in Amsterdam|in Amsterdam]]. Stadtholder William V fled to England and the States General dissolved itself. The new government was virtually a puppet of France.<ref>C. Cook & J. Stevenson, ''The routledge companion to European history since 1763'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2005), p. 66; J. Dunn, ''Democracy: A history'' (NY: Atlantic Books, 2005), p. 86.</ref>  The Batavian Republic enjoyed widespread support and sent soldiers to fight in the French armies. The 1799 [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] was repulsed by Batavian\u2013French forces. Nevertheless, Napoleon replaced it because the regime of [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]] (1805\u201306) was insufficiently docile.<ref>[[R.R. Palmer|Palmer, R.R.]] \"Much in Little: The Dutch Revolution of 1795,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (1954) 26#1 pp. 15\u201335 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874870 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state.  The 1798 constitution had a genuinely democratic character, though a coup d'\u00e9tat of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power. Ministerial government was introduced for the first time in Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.  Meanwhile, the exiled stadholder [[Kew Letters|handed over the Dutch colonies]] in \"safekeeping\" to Great Britain and ordered the colonial governors to comply.  This permanently ended the colonial empire in Guyana, Ceylon and the Cape Colony. The Dutch East Indies was returned to the Netherlands under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].\n\n===Kingdom of Holland to William I (1806\u20131815)===\n[[File:France L-2 (1812)-fr.svg|thumb|Administrative divisions of the [[First French Empire]] in 1812, illustrating the incorporation of the Netherlands and its internal reorganisation.]]\n{{Main|Kingdom of Holland}}\n\nIn 1806 Napoleon restyled the Netherlands (along with a small part of what is now Germany) into the [[Kingdom of Holland]], putting his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), on the throne. The new king was unpopular, but he was willing to cross his brother for the benefit of his new kingdom. Napoleon forced his abdication in 1810 and incorporated the Netherlands directly into the [[First French Empire|French empire]], imposing economic controls and conscription of all young men as soldiers. When the French retreated from the northern provinces in 1813, a [[Driemanschap|Triumvirate]] took over at the helm of a [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|provisional government]].  Although most members of the provisional government had been among the men who had driven out William V 18 years earlier, the leaders of the provisional government knew that any new regime would have to be headed by his son, William Frederick.  They also knew that it would be better in the long term if the Dutch people themselves installed the prince, rather than have him imposed on the country by the anti-French alliance.  Accordingly, the Triumvirate called William Frederick back on 30 November and offered him the crown.  He refused, but instead proclaimed himself \"[[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|hereditary sovereign prince]]\" on 6 December.\n\nThe [[Great Powers]] had [[Eight Articles of London|secretly agreed]] to merge the northern Netherlands with the more populated [[Austrian Netherlands]] and the smaller [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] into a single constitutional monarchy.  Having a stronger country on France's northern border was considered (especially by [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander]]) to be an important part of the strategy to keep France's power in check.  In 1814, William Frederick gained sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands and Li\u00e8ge as well. Thus, William Frederick had fulfilled his family's three-century quest to unite the Low Countries under a single rule.\n\nOn 15 March 1815; with the encouragement of the powers gathered at the [[Congress of Vienna]], William Frederick raised the Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]].  This was made official later in 1815, when the Low Countries were formally recognized as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The crown was made a hereditary office of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].\n\n==United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131839)==\n{{Main|United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy}}\n[[File:LandingWillemI.jpg|thumb|left|''Landing of the future king [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] at Scheveningen on 30 November 1813'' by Johan Willem Heyting (1915\u20131995).]]\n[[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] became king and also became the hereditary [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], that was part of the Netherlands but at the same time part of the German Confederation. The newly created country had two capitals: [[Amsterdam]] and [[Brussels]]. The new nation had two equal parts. The north (Netherlands proper) had 2 million people. They spoke chiefly Dutch but were divided religiously between a Protestant majority and a large Catholic minority. The south (which would be known as \"Belgium\" after 1830) had a population of 3.4&nbsp;million people. Nearly all were Catholic, but it was divided between French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemings. The upper and middle classes in the south were mostly French-speaking. About 60,000 Belgians were eligible to vote, compared to about 80,000 Dutchmen.  Officially Amsterdam was the capital, but in a compromise the government met alternately in Brussels and The Hague.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 112\u201333</ref>\n\n[[Adolphe Quetelet]] (1796\u20131874), the great Belgian statistician, calculated that the new nation was significantly better off than other states. Mortality was low, the food supply was good, education was good, public awareness was high and the charity rate was the highest in the world. The best years were in the mid-1820s.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 115\u201316</ref>\n\nThe quality of schooling was dismal, however. According to Schama, about 1800 the local school teacher was the \"humble auxiliary of the local priest. Despised by his co-villagers and forced to subsist on the gleanings of the peasants, he combined drumming the catechism into the heads of his unruly charges with the duties of winding the town clock, ringing the church bells or digging its graves. His principal use to the community was to keep its boys out of mischief when there was no labour for them in the fields, or setting the destitute orphans of the town to the 'useful arts' of picking tow or spinning crude flax. As one would expect, standards in such an occupation were dismal.\"<ref>Simon Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" ''History of Education'' (1972) 1:1, pp. 81\u201389 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0046760720010106 link]</ref> But in 1806 the Dutch, led by Adriaan van den Ende, energetically set out to modernise education, focusing on a new system for advanced training of teachers with an elaborate system of inspectors, training courses, teacher examinations and teaching societies.  By 1826, although much smaller than France, the Dutch national government was spending 12 times more than Paris on education.<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\n===Constitutional monarchy===\n[[File:Vereinigteskoenigreich.png|thumb|left|'''The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)|Limburg]] in 1839'''<br>'''1''', '''2''' and '''3''' United Kingdom of the Netherlands (until 1830)<br>'''1''' and '''2''' [[Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (after 1830)<br>'''2''' [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)]] (in the German Confederacy after 1839 as compensation for Waals-Luxemburg)<br>'''3''' and '''4''' [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] (after 1839)<br>'''4''' and '''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (borders until 1839) <br>'''4''' [[Luxembourg (province)|Province of Luxembourg]] (Waals-Luxemburg, to Belgium in 1839)<br>'''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (German Luxemburg; borders after 1839)<br>In blue, the borders of the [[German Confederation]].]]\n\nWilliam I, who reigned from 1815 to 1840, had great constitutional power. An [[enlightened despot]], he accepted the modernizing transformations of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] as a political class and elevated a large number of people to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house. The old provinces were reestablished in name only. The government was now fundamentally unitary, and all authority flowed from the center.\n\nWilliam I was a Calvinist and unsympathetic to the religious culture and practices of the Catholic majority.  He promulgated the \"Fundamental Law of Holland\", with some modifications. This entirely overthrew the old order of things in the southern Netherlands: it abolished the privileges of the Catholic Church, and guaranteed equal protection to every religious creed and the enjoyment of the same civil and political rights to every subject of the king. It reflected the spirit of the French Revolution and in so doing did not please the Catholic bishops in the south, who had detested the Revolution.<ref>Godefroid Kurth, \"Belgium\" in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02395a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907) online]</ref>\n\nWilliam I actively promoted economic modernization. The first 15 years of the Kingdom showed progress and prosperity, as industrialization proceeded rapidly in the south, where the [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed entrepreneurs and labor to combine in a new textile industry, powered by local coal mines. There was little industry in the northern provinces, but most overseas colonies were restored, and highly profitable trade resumed after a 25-year hiatus. Economic liberalism combined with moderate monarchical authoritarianism to accelerate the adaptation of the Netherlands to the new conditions of the 19th century. The country prospered until a crisis arose in relations with the southern provinces.\n\n===Belgium breaks away===\n{{main|Belgian Revolution}}\nWilliam was determined to create a united people, even though the north and south had drifted far apart in the past three centuries. Protestants were the largest denomination in the North (population 2 million), but formed a quarter of the population in the overwhelmingly Catholic South (population 3.5&nbsp;million). Nevertheless, Protestants dominated William's government and army. The Catholics did not consider themselves an integral part of the United Netherlands, preferring instead to identify with mediaeval Dutch culture. Other factors that contributed to this feeling were economic (the South was industrialising, the North had always been a merchants' nation) and linguistic (French was spoken in [[Wallonia]] and a large part of the bourgeoisie in Flemish cities).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAfter having been dominant for centuries, the French-speaking elite in the Southern Netherlands now felt like second-class citizens.\nIn the Catholic South,<ref>see [http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/lowcountries/neth18151830.html online maps 1830, 1839]</ref> William's policies were unpopular. The French-speaking Walloons strenuously rejected his attempt to make Dutch the universal language of government, while the population of [[Flanders]] was divided. Flemings in the south spoke a Dutch dialect (\"Flemish\") and welcomed the encouragement of Dutch with a revival of literature and popular culture. Other Flemings, notably the educated bourgeoisie, preferred to speak French. Although Catholics possessed legal equality, they resented their subordination to a government that was fundamentally Protestant in spirit and membership after having been the state church for centuries in the south. Few Catholics held high office in state or army. Furthermore, political liberals in the south complained about the king's authoritarian methods. All southerners complained of underrepresentation in the national legislature. Although the south was industrializing and was more prosperous than the north the accumulated grievances allowed the multiple opposition forces to coalesce. \n[[File:R\u00e9volution belge de 1830 - La rue de Flandre le jeudi 23 septembre 1830.jpg|thumb|Fighting between Belgian rebels and the Dutch military expedition in [[Brussels]] in September 1830]]\nThe outbreak of [[July Revolution|revolution in France]] in 1830 was a signal for action, at first on behalf of autonomy for Belgium, as the southern provinces were now called, and later on behalf of total independence. William dithered and his half-hearted efforts to reconquer Belgium were thwarted both by the efforts of the Belgians themselves and by the diplomatic opposition of the great powers.\n\nAt the [[London Conference of 1830]], the chief powers of Europe ordered (in November 1830) an armistice between the Dutch and the Belgians. The first draft for a treaty of separation of Belgium and the Netherlands was rejected by the Belgians. A second draft (June 1831) was rejected by William I, who resumed hostilities. Franco-British intervention forced William to withdraw Dutch forces from Belgium late in 1831, and in 1833 an armistice of indefinite duration was concluded. Belgium was effectively independent but William's attempts to recover Luxembourg and Limburg led to renewed tension. The London Conference of 1838\u201339 prepared the final Dutch-Belgian [[Treaty of London (1839)|separation treaty of 1839]]. It divided Luxembourg and Limburg between the Dutch and Belgian crowns. The Kingdom of the Netherlands thereafter was made up of the 11 northern provinces.<ref>{{cite book|first = J. C.

Griffiths argues that certain government policies facilitated the emergence of a national economy in the 19th century. They included the abolition of internal tariffs and guilds, a unified coinage system, modern methods of tax collection, standardized weights and measures, and the building of many roads, canals, and railroads.  However, compared to Belgium, which was leading in industrialization on the Continent, the Netherlands moved slowly. Possible explanations for this difference are the higher costs due to geography and high wages, and the emphasis of entrepreneurs on trade rather than industry.<ref>Richard T. Griffiths, ''Industrial Retardation in the Netherlands, 1830\u20131850'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1979).</ref>\nFor example, in the Dutch coastal provinces agricultural productivity was relatively high. Hence, industrial growth arrived relatively late \u2013 after 1860 \u2013 because incentives to move to labour-intensive industry were quite weak.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The number of people employed in agriculture decreased, while the country made a strong effort to revive its stake in the highly competitive shipping and trade business. The Netherlands lagged behind Belgium until the late 19th century in industrialization, and caught up around 1920. Major industries included textiles and (later) the great Philips industrial conglomerate. Rotterdam became a major shipping and manufacturing center.<ref>{{cite book|author=Loyen, Reginald|title=Struggling for Leadership: Antwerp-Rotterdam Port.

Born in [[Zundert|Groot-Zundert]], van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on [[20th-century art]].]]\n\nIn 1840 William I abdicated in favor of his son, [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]], who attempted to carry on the policies of his father in the face of a powerful liberal movement. In 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|unrest broke out all over Europe]]. Although there were no major events in the Netherlands, these foreign developments persuaded King [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] to agree to liberal and democratic reform. That same year [[Johan Rudolf Thorbecke]], a prominent liberal, was asked by the king to draft a constitution that would turn the Netherlands into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The new constitution was proclaimed on 3 November 1848. It severely limited the king's powers (making the government accountable only to an elected parliament), and it protected [[civil liberties]]. The new liberal constitution, which put the government under the control of the States General, was accepted by the legislature in 1848.  The relationship between monarch, government and parliament has remained essentially unchanged ever since.\n\nWilliam II was succeeded by [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] in 1849. The new king reluctantly chose Thorbecke to head the new government, which introduced several liberal measures, notably the extension of suffrage. However, Thorbecke's government soon fell, when Protestants rioted against the Vatican's reestablishment of the Catholic episcopate, in abeyance since the 16th century. A conservative government was formed, but it did not undo the liberal measures, and the Catholics were finally given equality after two centuries of subordination. Dutch political history from the middle of the 19th century until the [[First World War]] was fundamentally one of the extension of liberal reforms in government, the reorganization and modernization of the Dutch economy, and the rise of trade unionism and socialism as working-class movements independent of traditional liberalism.  The growth in prosperity was enormous, as real per capita GNP soared from 106 guilders in 1804 to 403 in 1913.<ref>E. H.

In 1816, the government took full control of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (''Nederlands Hervormde Kerk''). In 1857, all religious instruction was ended in public schools, but the various churches set up their own schools, and even universities. Dissident members broke away from the Dutch Reformed Church in the Secession of 1834. They were harassed by the government under an onerous Napoleonic law prohibiting gatherings of more than 20 members without a permit. After the harassment ended in the 1850s, a number of these dissidents eventually created the Christian Reformed Church in 1869; thousands migrated to Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa in the United States. By 1900, the dissidents represented about 10% of the population, compared to 45% of the population who were in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], which continued to be the only church to receive state money.<ref>Corwin, \"Holland\" [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc05.h.ix.html  ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,'' (1914) 5:319\u201322]</ref>\n\nAt mid-century, most Dutch belonged either to the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] or dissenter groups that separated from it (around 55%), or the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (35% to 40%), together with smaller [[Protestant]] (for example, [[Lutheran]]) and Jewish groups. A large and powerful sector of nominal Protestants were in fact secular liberals seeking to minimize religious influence. In reaction a novel alliance developed with Catholics and devout Calvinists joining against secular liberals. The Catholics, who had been loosely allied with the liberals in earlier decades, turned against them on the issue of state support, which the liberals insisted should be granted only to public schools, and joined with Protestant political parties in demanding equal state support to schools maintained by religious groups.<ref>J. C. H. Blom and E. Lamberts, eds. ''History of the Low Countries'' (1999) pp. 387\u2013403</ref>\n\nThe Netherlands remained one of the most tolerant countries in Europe towards religious belief, although conservative Protestants objected to the liberalization of the Dutch Reformed Church during the 19th century and faced opposition from the government when they tried to establish separate communities (Catholics and other non-Protestants were left unmolested by Dutch authorities). Some moved to the United States as a consequence, but as the century drew to a close, religious persecution had totally ceased.\n\n[[File:Old-Amsterdam 1891-street-1.jpg|thumb|Street in Amsterdam in 1891 ({{Interlanguage link multi|Vijzelstraat|nl}} looking towards Muntplein).]]\nDutch social and political life became divided by fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society pillarized into three separate parts based on religion.  The economy was not affected. One of the people most responsible for designing pillarization was [[Abraham Kuyper]] (1837\u20131920), a leading politician, [[neo-Calvinist]] theologian, and journalist. Kuyper established orthodox Calvinist organizations, and also provided a theoretical framework by developing such concepts as \"sphere-sovereignty\" that celebrated Dutch society as a society of organized minorities. ''Verzuiling'' (\"pillarization\" or \"pluralism\") after 1850 became the solution to the danger of internal conflict. Everyone was part of one (and only one) pillar (''zuil'') based chiefly on religion (Protestant, Catholic, secular). The secular pillar eventually split into a socialist/working class pillar and a liberal (pro-business) secular pillar. Each pillar built a full set of its own social organizations, including churches (for the religious pillars), political parties, schools, universities,<ref>The oldest universities, in Leiden, Utrecht, and Groningen, had a secular-liberal character. In 1880 Kuyper opened a Protestant university in Amsterdam and in 1923 a Catholic one opened in Nijmegen. The Amsterdam municipal university, which opened in 1877, leaned toward secular-socialism, but was formally neutral.</ref> labor unions, sport clubs, boy scout unions and other youth clubs, and newspapers. The members of different ''zuilen'' lived in close proximity in cities and villages, spoke the same language, and did business with one another, but seldom interacted informally and rarely intermarried.<ref>A Dutch rhyme forbade intermarriage thus: ''Twee geloven op \u00e9\u00e9n kussen, daar slaapt de Duivel tussen'' [Two religions on one pillow, there the Devil sleeps in between.] On the decline of intermarriage see Erik Beekink, et al. \"Changes in Choice of Spouse as an Indicator of a Society in a State of Transition: Woerden, 1830\u20131930.\" ''Historical Social Research'' 1998 23(1\u20132): 231\u201353. {{ISSN|0172-6404}}</ref> In politics Kuyper formed the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) in 1879, and headed it until 1905.\n\nPillarization was officially recognized in the [[Pacification of 1917]], whereby socialists and liberals achieved their goal of universal male suffrage and the religious parties were guaranteed equal funding of all schools.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' pp-57</ref> In 1930 radio was organized so that each pillar had full control of its own network.

[[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1853\u20131928) and his student [[Pieter Zeeman]] (1865\u20131943) shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in physics.

She would rule the Netherlands for 58 years. On her accession to the throne, the [[personal union]] between the Netherlands and Luxembourg ended because Luxembourg law excluded women from rule. Her remote cousin [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] became the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nThis was a time of further growth and colonial development, but it was marked by the difficulties of the [[World War I]] (in which the Netherlands was neutral) \nand the [[Great Depression]]. The Dutch population grew rapidly in the 20th century, as death rates fell, more lands were opened up, and industrialisation created urban jobs.<ref>Michael Wintle, ''An Economic and Social History of the Netherlands, 1800\u20131920: Demographic, Economic, and Social Transition'' (2000) p. 342</ref> Between 1900 and 1950 the population doubled from 5.1 to 10 million people.<ref name=\"CBS Statline - Population; history\">[http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLEN&PA=37556ENG&D1=0-44,53-60&D2=1,11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91,101&LA=EN&VW=T CBS Statline \u2013 Population; history].

It was smaller in 1945 than in 1815 because the Netherlands was the only colonial power that did not expand into Africa or anywhere else.  The empire was run from Batavia (in Java), where the governor and his technical experts had almost complete authority with little oversight from the Hague. Successive governors improved their bureaucratic and military controls, and allowed very little voice to the locals until the 1920s.<ref>Jean Gelman Taylor, ''The Social World of Batavia: Europeans and Eurasians in Colonial Indonesia'' (1983)</ref>\n\nThe colony brought economic opportunity to the mother country and there was little concern at the time about it. One exception came in 1860 when Eduard Dekker, under the pen name \"[[Multatuli]]\" wrote the novel ''[[Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company]]'', one of the most notable books in the history of [[Dutch literature]]. He criticized the exploitation of the colony and as well had harsh words about the indigenous princes who collaborated with the governor. The book helped inspire the Indonesian independence movement in the mid-20th century as well as the \"[[Fair trade]]\" movement for coffee at the end of the century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Antony Wild|title=Coffee: A Dark History|url=https://archive.org/details/coffeedarkhistor0000wild|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=W.

As the map shows, the Dutch slowly expanded their holdings from their base in Java to include all of modern Indonesia by 1920. Most islands were not a problem but there was a long, costly campaign against the [[Aceh Sultanate|Achin (Aceh)]] state in northern Sumatra.\n\nThe Netherlands had not fought a major military campaign since the 1760s, and the strength of its armed forces had gradually dwindled. The Dutch decided not to ally themselves with anyone, and kept out of all European wars especially the First World War that swirled about it.<ref name = \"hvhqei\">Maartje M. Abbenhuis, ''The Art of Staying Neutral the Netherlands in the First World War, 1914\u20131918'' (Amsterdam University Press, 2006).</ref>\n\n=== Neutrality during the First World War ===\n[[File:Hochspannungszaun Belgien-Holland 1.jpg|thumb|[[Electrified fence]] along the border between the Netherlands and [[Belgium]] during the [[First World War]].]]\n\nThe German war plan (the [[Schlieffen Plan]]) of 1905 was modified in 1908 to invade Belgium on the way to Paris but not the Netherlands. It supplied many essential raw materials to Germany such as rubber, tin, quinine, oil and food. The British used its blockade to limit supplies that the Dutch could pass on.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> There were other factors that made it expedient for both the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Central Powers]] for the Netherlands to remain neutral. The Netherlands controlled the mouths of the [[Scheldt]], the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse River]]s. Germany had an interest in the Rhine since it ran through the industrial areas of the [[Ruhr]] and connected it with the Dutch port of Rotterdam. Britain had an interest in the Scheldt River and the Meuse flowed from France. All countries had an interest in keeping the others out of the Netherlands so that no one's interests could be taken away or be changed. If one country were to have invaded the Netherlands, another would certainly have counterattacked to defend their own interest in the rivers. It was too big a risk for any of the belligerent nations and none wanted to risk fighting on another front.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/>\n\n[[File:Afsluitdijk 01.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Afsluitdijk]], the dike closing off the [[Zuiderzee]], was constructed between 1927 and 1933. Public works projects like this were one way to deal with high unemployment during the [[Great Depression]].]]\nThe Dutch were affected by the war, troops were mobilized and conscription was introduced in the face of harsh criticism from opposition parties. In 1918, mutinies broke out in the military. Food shortages were extensive, due to the control the belligerents exercised over the Dutch. Each wanted their share of Dutch produce. As a result, the price of potatoes rose sharply because Britain had demanded so much from the Dutch. Food riots even broke out in the country.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> A big problem was smuggling. When Germany had conquered Belgium, the Allies saw it as enemy territory and stopped exporting to Belgium. Food became scarce for the Belgian people, since the Germans seized all food. This gave the Dutch the opportunity to start to smuggle. This, however, caused great problems in the Netherlands, including inflation and further food shortages. The Allies demanded that the Dutch stop the smuggling, and the government took measures to remain neutral. The government placed many cities under 'state of siege'. On 8 January 1916, a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=on}} zone was created by the government along the border. In that zone, goods could be moved on main roads with a permit.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> German authorities in Belgium had an electrified fence erected all along the Belgian\u2013Dutch border that caused many refugees from Belgium to lose their lives.  The fence was guarded by older German Landsturm soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|title=De Dodendraad \u2013 Wereldoorlog I|url=http://www.bunkergordel.be/14.023%20De%20Dodendraad.htm|publisher=Bunkergordel.be|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Interwar period ===\n{{Main|Great Depression in the Netherlands}}\nAlthough both houses of the Dutch Parliament were elected by the people, only men with high incomes were eligible to vote until 1917, when pressure from socialist movements resulted in elections in which all men regardless of income, were entitled to vote. In 1919, women also obtained the right to vote for the first time in history.\n\nThe worldwide [[Great Depression]] which began after the tumultuous events of [[Black Tuesday]] in 1929, that continued into the early-1930s had crippling effects on the Dutch economy; lasting longer than in most other European countries. The long duration of the Great Depression in the Netherlands is often explained by the very strict fiscal policy of the Dutch government at the time, and its decision to adhere to the [[gold standard]] for much longer than most of its trading partners. The Great Depression led to high unemployment and widespread poverty, as well as increasing social unrest.\n\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany did not go unnoticed in the Netherlands, and there was growing concern at the possibility of armed conflict, but most Dutch people expected that Germany would again respect Dutch neutrality.\n\nThere were separate fascist and Nazi movements in the 1930s. Dutch Fascists admired Mussolini's Italy and called for a traditional corporate ideology. The membership was small, elitist and ineffective. The pro-Nazi movement, however, won support from [[Berlin]] and attempted to build a mass base by 1935. It failed because most Dutch rejected its racial ideology and calls for violence.<ref>Erik Hansen, \"Fascism and Nazism in the Netherlands 1929\u201339,\" ''European Studies Review'' (1981) 11#3 pp. 355\u201385.

The budget was further increased in 1938 (after the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] and occupation of the Czech [[Sudetenland]]). The colonial government also increased its military budget because of increasing tensions with Japan. The Dutch did not mobilise their armed forces until shortly before France and the UK declared war on Germany in September 1939 after the invasion of Poland. Neutrality was still the official policy, but the Dutch government tried to buy new arms for their badly equipped forces; however, a considerable share of ordered weapons never arrived.\n\n==The Second World War (1939\u20131945)==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)}}\n\n===Nazi invasion and occupation===\n{{Main|Battle of the Netherlands|Rotterdam Blitz|Dutch resistance}}\n[[File:Rotterdam, Laurenskerk, na bombardement van mei 1940.jpg|thumb|Rotterdam was destroyed by German bombers on 14 May 1940. 814 people died in the [[Rotterdam Blitz]].]]\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Netherlands once again declared its [[neutral country|neutrality]]. However, on 10 May 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] launched an attack on the Netherlands and Belgium and quickly overran most of the two countries. Fighting against the Dutch army proved to be more of a burden than foreseen; the northern attack was stopped dead, the one in the middle came to a grinding halt near the Grebbeberg and many airborne assault troops were killed and taken prisoner in the west of the country.\nOnly in the south were defences broken, but the one passage over the River Maas at Rotterdam was held by the Dutch. By 14 May, fighting in many locations had ceased and the German army could make little or no headway, so the [[Luftwaffe]] bombed [[Rotterdam]], the second-largest city of the Netherlands, killing about 900 people, destroying most of the inner city and leaving 78,000 people homeless.\n\nFollowing the bombing and German threats of the same treatment for [[Utrecht]], the Netherlands capitulated on 15 May, except for the province of [[Zeeland]] where French and French-Moroccan troops stood side-by-side with the Dutch army. Still, the Dutch Royal Family along with some armed forces fled to the United Kingdom. Some members of the Dutch Royal Family eventually moved to [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada until the Netherlands was liberated five years later.  [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands|Princess Margriet]] was born in Canada, during the period the family spent in exile.\n\nResentment of the Germans grew as the occupation became more harsh, prompting many Dutch in the latter years of the war to join the [[Dutch resistance|resistance]]. But collaboration was not uncommon either; many thousands of young Dutch males volunteered for combat service on the Russian Front with the [[Waffen-SS]] and many companies worked for the German occupiers.\n\n===Holocaust in the Netherlands===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Exhibit of the Anne Frank Zentrum.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Yellow [[Star of David]] with ''Jood'', the Dutch word for \"[[Jew]]\".\n| image2 = WWII netherlands persoonsbewijs.jpg\n| width2 = 165\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Identification papers]] issued to Dutch people during the war.\n| footer = \n}}\nAbout 140,000 Jews lived in the Netherlands at the beginning of the war. Persecution of [[Dutch Jews]] started shortly after the occupation. At the end of the war, 40,000 Jews were still alive. Of the 100,000 Jews who did not go into hiding, about 1,000 survived the war.\n\nOne famous victim of the Holocaust was [[Anne Frank]], who gained worldwide fame when her diary, written in the ''achterhuis'' ('backhouse') while hiding from the Nazis, was found and published posthumously by her father, Otto Frank; who was the only member of the family to survive the Holocaust.\n\n===The war in the Dutch East Indies===\n{{Main|Dutch East Indies campaign}}\nOn 8 December 1941, the day after the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], the Netherlands declared war on Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1941/411208c.html |title=THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS DECLARES WAR WITH JAPAN |publisher=ibiblio |accessdate=5 October 2009}}</ref> The Dutch government-in-exile in London had for long been working with the UK & US governments to cut off oil supplies to Japan.

Dutch citizens and everybody with Dutch ancestry, the so-called \"[[Indo people|Indo's]]\" were captured and put to work in labour camps or interned. As in the Netherlands, many Dutch ships, planes and military personnel managed to reach safety, in this case Australia; from where they were able to fight again.\n\n===False hopes, the Hunger Winter and Liberation===\nIn Europe, after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] landed in [[Normandy]] in June 1944, progress was slow until the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] ended in August 1944. German resistance collapsed in Western Europe and the allied armies advanced quickly towards the Dutch border. The [[First Canadian Army]] and the Second British Army conducted operations on Dutch soil from September onwards. On 17 September, a daring operation, [[Operation Market Garden]]; was executed with the goal of capturing bridges across three major rivers in the southern Netherlands. Despite desperate fighting by American, British and Polish forces, the bridge at [[Arnhem]], across the Neder Rijn, could not be captured.\n\nAreas south of the Rhine river were liberated in the period September\u2013December 1944, including the province of Zeeland, which was liberated in October and November in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]]. This opened [[Antwerp]] to allied shipping. The [[First Canadian Army]] held a static line along the [[river Meuse]] (Maas) from December 1944 through February 1945.\n\nThe rest of the country remained occupied until the spring of 1945. In the face of Dutch defiance, the Nazis deliberately cut off food supplies resulting in near-starvation in the cities during the ''[[Hongerwinter]]'' ([[Hunger winter]]) of 1944\u201345. Soup kitchens were set up but many vulnerable people died.<ref>William I.

In the final weeks of the war in Europe, the First Canadian Army was charged with clearing the [[Netherlands]] of German forces.\n\nThe [[Liberation of Arnhem]] began on 12 April 1945 and proceeded to plan, as the three infantry brigades of the 49th Division leapfrogged each other through the city.

On 27 April a temporary truce came into effect, allowing the distribution of food aid to the starving Dutch civilians in areas under German control ([[Operations Manna and Chowhound|Operation Manna]]). On 5 May 1945, Generaloberst [[Johannes Blaskowitz|Blaskowitz]] agreed to the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands, signing the surrender to Canadian general [[Charles Foulkes (Canadian general)|Charles Foulkes]] at [[Wageningen]].<ref>Stacey, Colonel Charles Perry, ''Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War'', Volume III, ''[http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/docs/Victory_e.pdf The Victory Campaign: The Operations in North-West Europe 1944\u20131945]'' (The Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery Ottawa, 1960) (Downloaded: 4 July 2009), pp. 576\u2013614</ref> (The Fifth of May is now celebrated annually in the Netherlands as [[Liberation Day]].) Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered, bringing the war in Europe to an end.\n\nAfter the euphoria and settling of scores had ended, the Dutch were a traumatised people with a ruined economy, a shattered infrastructure and several destroyed cities including [[Rotterdam]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Arnhem]] and part of [[The Hague]].\n\n===Post-war events===\n\nAfter the war, there were reprisals against those who had collaborated with the Nazis. [[Artur Seyss-Inquart]], Nazi Commissioner of the Netherlands, was tried at N\u00fcremberg.\n\nIn the early post-war years, the Netherlands made continued attempts to expand its territory by annexing neighbouring German territory. The [[Bakker-Schut Plan|larger annexation plans]] were continuously rejected by the United States, but the London conference of 1949 permitted the Netherlands to perform a smaller scale [[annexation]].

He led four successive cabinets [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-1|Drees I]], [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-2|Drees II]], [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-3|Drees III]] and [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-4|Drees IV]] until 1958. His tenure in office saw four major political developments: the traumas of decolonisation, [[economic reconstruction]], the establishment of the Dutch [[welfare state]], and international integration and co-operation, including the formation of [[Benelux]], the [[OEEC]], [[NATO]], the [[European Coal and Steel Community|ECSC]], and the [[EEC]].\n\n===Baby boom and economic reconstruction===\n[[File:Population of the Netherlands 1900-2000.png|thumb|left|Population growth 1900\u20132000]]\n\nDespite the socio-economic problems, this was a period of optimism for many. A baby boom followed the war, as young Dutch couples started the families they couldn't previously due to the war. They had lived through the hardships of the Great Depression and the hell of war. They wanted to start afresh and live better lives without the poverty, starvation, terror, and extreme frugality they knew so well. They had little taste for a strictly imposed rule-oriented traditional system with its rigid hierarchies, sharp pillarised boundaries and strictly orthodox religious doctrines. The translation of ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' (1946), by American pediatrician [[Benjamin Spock]] was a best-seller. His vision of family life as companionate, permissive, enjoyable and even as being fun took hold, and seemed the best way to achieve family happiness in a dawning age of freedom and prosperity.<ref name=\"Janneke Wubs 2002 pp 209\">Nelleke Bakker and Janneke Wubs, \"A Mysterious Success: Doctor Spock and the Netherlands in the 1950s\", ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2002) 38#1 pp. 209\u201326.</ref>\n\nWages were kept low and the recovery of consumption to pre-war levels was delayed to permit rapid rebuilding of the infrastructure. In the years after the war, unemployment fell and the economy grew at an astonishing pace, despite the high birth rate. The shattered infrastructure and destroyed cities were rebuilt. A key contribution to the recovery in the post-war Netherlands came from the [[Marshall Plan]], which provided the country with funds, goods, raw materials and produce.<ref>Van der Eng, Pierre (1987). ''De Marshall-Hulp, Een Perspectief voor Nederland 1947\u20131953.'' Houten: De Haan.</ref>\n\nThe Dutch became internationally active again. Dutch corporations, particularly [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Philips]], became internationally prominent. Businesspeople, scientists, engineers and artists from the Netherlands made important international contributions. For example, Dutch economists, especially [[Jan Tinbergen]] (1903\u20131994), [[Tjalling Koopmans]] (1910\u20131985) and [[Henri Theil]] (1924\u20132000), made major contributions to the mathematical and statistical methodology known as [[econometrics]].<ref>Andrew J.

The Netherlands also experienced years of negative growth after that. Unemployment increased steadily, causing rapid growth in social-security expenditures. Inflation reached double digits; government surpluses disappeared. On the positive side, rich natural gas resources were developed, providing a current account trade surplus during most of the period. Public deficits were high.<ref>Green-Pedersen, ''The Politics of Justification: Party Competition and Welfare-State Retrenchment in Denmark and the Netherlands from 1982\u20131998'' p. 44</ref> According to the long-term economic analysis of Horlings and Smits, the major gains in the Dutch economy were concentrated between 1870\u20131930 and between 1950\u201370.

More than 1,800 people drowned in the ensuing inundation.\n\nThe Dutch government subsequently decided on a large-scale programme of public works (the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\") to protect the country against future floods. The project took more than thirty years to complete. The Oosterscheldedam, an advanced sea storm barrier, became operational in 1986.

Its purpose was to pool the steel and coal resources of the member states, and to support the economies of the participating countries. As a side effect, the ECSC helped defuse tensions between countries which had recently been fighting each other during the war. In time, this economic merger grew, adding members and broadening in scope, to become the [[European Economic Community]], and later the [[European Union]] (EU).\n[[File:Anti kernwapendemonstratie in Den Haag ( 550 duizend deelnemers ) overzichten m, Bestanddeelnr 253-8817.jpg|thumb|Protest in The Hague against the [[nuclear arms race]] between the U.S./NATO and the Warsaw Pact, 1983]]\nThe United States started to have more influence.

However, the Netherlands was much too weak to reconquer Indonesia. The Japanese had imprisoned all the Dutch residents, and turned the islands over to a native government, which was widely popular. The British military arrived to disarm the Japanese. The Dutch finally returned and attempted to eradicate the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] with force, (sometimes [[Rawagede massacre|brutal]] in nature).<ref>Gert Oostindie, et al. \"The decolonization war in Indonesia, 1945\u20131949: War crimes in Dutch veterans' egodocuments.\" ''War in History'' (2018) 25#2 pp 254\u2013276, argues that \"war crimes formed a structural ingredient of Dutch warfare.\"</ref>\n\nHundreds of thousands of Indonesians supported the Dutch position; when Independence finally arrived, most of them were relocated to the Netherlands. The UK mediated a compromise signed in March 1947 whereby de facto control of the new [[Indonesian Republic]] was acknowledged over Java, Maduro and Sumatra, while acknowledging Dutch control over the numerous smaller and far less important islands. Supposedly there would be a federated Indonesian state and a union with the Netherlands, but that never happened. The Indonesians wanted complete transfer of power, and the Dutch refused. By 1946, the United States was financing the Dutch in Indonesia, and was able to exert pressure on The Hague.  Increasing international pressure\u2014including American hints about cutting off military funds\u2014forced the Netherlands to withdraw. A decisive episode was the success of the Indonesian Republic in crushing a Communist revolt.

In fact, the demand for labour was so strong that immigration was actively encouraged, first from Italy and Spain then later on, in larger numbers, from [[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]].\n\n[[Suriname]] became independent on 25 November 1975. The Dutch government supported independence because it wanted to stem the flow of immigrants from Suriname and also to end its colonial status. However, about one-third of the entire population of Suriname, fearing political unrest and economic decline, relocated to the Netherlands, creating a Surinamese community in the Netherlands that is now roughly as large as the population of Suriname itself.\n\n===Liberalisation===\nWhen the post-war baby boom children grew up, they led the revolt in the 1960s against all rigidities in Dutch life.<ref name=\"Janneke Wubs 2002 pp 209\"/> The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid de-[[pillarization]] leading to the erosion of the old divisions along class and religious lines.<ref>Christopher G.

This [[purple (government)]] coalition marked the first absence of the CDA in a government for decades. During the Purple Coalition years, a period lasting until the rise of the populist politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], the government addressed issues previously viewed as taboo under the Christian-influenced cabinet. At this time, the Dutch government introduced unprecedented legislation based on a policy of official tolerance (''gedoogbeleid''). Abortion and [[euthanasia]] were decriminalised, but stricter guidelines were set for their implementation. Drug policy, especially with regard to the regulation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], was reformed. Prostitution was legalised, but confined to brothels where the health and safety of those involved could be properly monitored.

One week later, several arrests were made of several would-be Islamic terrorists, who have later been found guilty of conspiracy with terrorist intentions, this verdict was however reversed on appeal. All this sparked a debate on the position of Islamic extremism and of Islam generally in Dutch society, and on immigration and integration.

In 3500 pages he crafted a literary masterpiece that was translated into numerous languages; his dramatic story reached a wide audience in the 19th century. Motley relied heavily on Dutch scholarship and immersed himself in the sources. His style no longer attracts readers, and scholars have moved away from his simplistic dichotomies of good versus evil, Dutch versus Spanish, Catholic versus Protestant, freedom versus authoritarianism. His theory of causation over-emphasized ethnicity as an unchanging characteristic, exaggerated the importance of William of Orange, and gave undue importance to the issue religious tolerance.<ref>Robert Wheaton, \"Motley and the Dutch Historians,\" ''New England Quarterly'' (1962) 35#3 pp. 318\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/363823 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe pioneering Dutch cultural historian [[Johan Huizinga]] (1872\u20131945), author of ''The Autumn of the Middle Ages'' (1919) (the English translation was called ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'') and ''Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture'' (1935), which expanded the field of cultural history and influenced the historical anthropology of younger historians of the French [[Annales School]]. He was influenced by art history and advised historians to trace \"patterns of culture\" by studying \"themes, figures, motifs, symbols, styles and sentiments.\"<ref>Peter Burke, \"Historians and Their Times: Huizinga, Prophet of 'Blood and Roses.'\" ''History Today'' (Nov 1986) (36): 23\u201328; William U.

The polder model stresses the need for finding consensus; it discourages furious debate and angry dissent in both academia and politics \u2013 in contrast to the highly developed, intense debates in Germany.<ref>Chris Lorenz, \"Het 'Academisch Poldermodel' En De Westforschung in Nederland,\" [The Dutch Academic Polder Model and Westforschung in the Netherlands].

Cruz (2007) explains the major debates among scholars regarding the Dutch bid for independence from Spanish rule. While agreeing that the intellectual milieus of late 19th and 20th centuries affected historians' interpretations, Cruz argues that writings about the revolt trace changing perceptions of the role played by small countries in the history of Europe.  In recent decades grand theory has fallen out of favor among most scholars, who emphasize the particular over the general. Dutch and Belgian historiography since 1945 no longer says the revolt was the culmination of an inevitable process leading to independence and freedom. Instead scholars have put the political and economic details of the towns and provinces under the microscope, while agreeing on the weaknesses of attempts at centralization by the Habsburg rulers. The most influential new studies have been rooted in demographic and economic history, though scholars continue to debate the relationship between economics and politics. The religious dimension has been viewed in terms of mentalities, exposing the minority position of Calvinism, while the international aspects have been studied more seriously by foreign historians than by the Dutch themselves.<ref>Laura Cruz, \"The 80 Years' Question: the Dutch Revolt in Historical Perspective.\"  ''History Compass'' 2007 5(3): 914\u201334.</ref>\n\n[[Pieter Geyl]] was the leading historian of the Dutch Revolt, and a highly influential professor at the University of London (1919\u20131935) and at the State University of Utrecht (1936\u201358). He wrote a six-volume history of the Dutch-speaking peoples.<ref>Three volumes appeared in English translation, ''The Revolit of the Netherlands (1555\u20131609)'' (1932); and ''The Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century'' (2 vol 1936, 1964).</ref> The Nazis imprisoned him in World War II. In his political views, Geyl adopted the views of the 17th-century Dutch Louvestein faction, led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt (1547\u20131619) and Johan de Witt (1625\u201372). It stood for liberty, toleration, and national interests in contrast to the Orange stadholders who sought to promote their own self-interest. According to Geyl, the Dutch Republic reached the peak of its powers during the 17th century. He was also a staunch nationalist and suggested that Flanders could split off from Belgium and join the Netherlands. Later he decried what he called radical nationalism and stressed more the vitality of Western Civilization. Geyl was highly critical of the [[world history]] approach of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]].<ref>Herbert H. Rowen, \"The Historical Work of Pieter Geyl.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 1965 37(1): 35\u201349. {{ISSN|0022-2801}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874563 in Jstor]</ref>\n\n[[Jan Romein]] (1893\u20131962) created a \"theoretical history\" in an attempt to reestablish the relevance of history to public life in the 1930s at a time of immense political uncertainty and cultural crisis, when Romein thought that history had become too inward-looking and isolated from other disciplines. Romein, a Marxist, wanted history to contribute to social improvement. At the same time, influenced by the successes of theoretical physics and his study of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Frederick John Teggart]], and others, he spurred on the development of theoretical history in the Netherlands, to the point where it became a subject in its own right at the university level after the war. Romein used the term integral history as a substitute for cultural history and focused his attention on the period around the turn of the century. He concluded that a serious crisis occurred in European civilization in 1900 because of the rise of anti-Semitism, extreme nationalism, discontent with the parliamentary system, depersonalization of the state, and the rejection of positivism. European civilization waned as the result of this crisis which was accompanied by the rise of the United States, the Americanization of the world, and the emergence of Asia. His interpretation is reminiscent of that of his mentor Johan Huizinga and was criticized by his colleague Pieter Geyl.<ref>A. C.

A more comprehensive genealogy of the product is described in [[Sun Grid Engine]]. Grid Engine was first distributed by Genias Software and from 1999, after a company merger, by Gridware, Inc. In 2000, [[Sun Microsystems]] acquired Gridware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-07/sunflash.20000724.3.xml|title=Gridware's resource management software increases efficiency and productivity in compute-intensive technical computing environments|date=2000-07-24|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>  Sun renamed CODINE/GRD as Sun Grid Engine later that year, and released it as [[open-source software|open-source]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2001-07/sunflash.20010723.1.xml|title=Sun Microsystems makes SUN GRID ENGINE software available to open source community|date=2001-07-23|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired Sun and subsequently renamed SGE to [[Oracle Grid Engine]]. Oracle Grid Engine (6.2u6) moved to a closed-source model providing binaries with the distribution but no source code. As a result, the project's open-source repository no longer reflected changes made by Oracle and users were prevented from contributing code changes.
