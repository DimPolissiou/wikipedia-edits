It fought gallantly at Shiloh, charging repeatedly upon the \"Hornet's Nest\" where it lost Lieutenant Colonel Dunlop. It was through this regiment that General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] rode from the rear to the front, with a tin cup he had appropriated earlier that morning, saying \"Men of Arkansas, the enemy is stubborn. I want you to show General Beauregard and General Bragg what you can do with your bayonets and toothpicks!\" The regiment went forward with a cheer and passed him at a run; in five minutes 130 men of their ranks were killed or wounded, but they did not falter. Lieutenant Duckworth was killed at the head of his company, and Captain Wallace was wounded. It closed up and disappeared into the thicket in front, followed by the whole Confederate line, and the enemy was silenced in twenty minutes. General Johnston, however, received a mortal wound while leading this charge, and shortly thereafter bled to death.  The unit reported 17 killed and 115 wounded at Shiloh.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref>United States. War Department.

The 9th served in Brigadier General [[Abraham Buford]]'s brigade of Major General [[William W. Loring]]'s division of Lieutenant General [[John C. Pemberton]]'s Confederate Army at Champion Hill, and following that battle, Loring retreated north to join General [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army near Jackson rather than being trapped with the rest of Pemberton's army in the Vicksburg defenses. Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]]'s beleaguered garrison. Johnston cautiously advanced his 30,000 soldiers toward the rear of Grant's army surrounding Vicksburg.<ref name=\"Korn, Jerry 1985. Page 156\">Korn, Jerry, and the Editors of Time-Life Books.

I want you to show General Beauregard and General Bragg what you can do with your bayonets and toothpicks!\" The regiment went forward with a cheer and passed him at a run; in five minutes 130 men of their ranks were killed or wounded, but they did not falter. Lieutenant Duckworth was killed at the head of his company, and Captain Wallace was wounded. It closed up and disappeared into the thicket in front, followed by the whole Confederate line, and the enemy was silenced in twenty minutes. General Johnston, however, received a mortal wound while leading this charge, and shortly thereafter bled to death.  The unit reported 17 killed and 115 wounded at Shiloh.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref>United States. War Department.

The 9th served in Brigadier General [[Abraham Buford]]'s brigade of Major General [[William W. Loring]]'s division of Lieutenant General [[John C. Pemberton]]'s Confederate Army at Champion Hill, and following that battle, Loring retreated north to join General [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army near Jackson rather than being trapped with the rest of Pemberton's army in the Vicksburg defenses. Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]]'s beleaguered garrison. Johnston cautiously advanced his 30,000 soldiers toward the rear of Grant's army surrounding Vicksburg.<ref name=\"Korn, Jerry 1985. Page 156\">Korn, Jerry, and the Editors of Time-Life Books.

While the calendars share a common lineage, they also have minor but important variations such as [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] schedules, month names and numbering, use of cycles, etc. In Thailand, the name Buddhist Era is a [[Calendar era|year numbering]] system shared by the traditional [[Thai lunar calendar|Thai lunisolar calendar]] and by the [[Thai solar calendar]].\n\nThe Southeast Asian [[lunisolar calendar]]s are largely based on an older version of the [[Hindu calendar]],<ref name=yo-354-355/> which uses the [[sidereal year]] as the solar year. One major difference is that the Southeast Asian systems, unlike their Indian cousins, do not use apparent reckoning to stay in sync with the sidereal year. Instead, they employ their versions of the [[Metonic cycle]]. However, since the Metonic cycle is not very accurate for sidereal years, the Southeast Asian calendar is slowly drifting out of sync with the sidereal, approximately one day every 100 years. Yet no coordinated structural reforms of the lunisolar calendar have been undertaken.\n\nToday, the traditional Buddhist lunisolar calendar is used mainly for [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]] festivals, and no longer has the official calendar status anywhere. The Thai Buddhist Era, a renumbered [[Gregorian calendar]], is the official calendar in Thailand.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:August2004rs.png|thumbnail|Thailand's version of the lunisolar Buddhist calendar]]\n\n{{See also|Burmese calendar#Structure}}\nThe calculation methodology of the current versions of Southeast Asian Buddhist calendars is largely based on that of the [[Burmese calendar]], which was in use in various Southeast Asian kingdoms down to the 19th century under the names of [[Chula Sakarat]] and [[Jolak Sakaraj]]. The Burmese calendar in turn was based on the \"original\" ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]'' system of ancient India (believed to be Ardharatrika school).<ref name=yo-354-355>Ohashi 2007: 354\u2013355</ref> One key difference with Indian systems is that the Burmese system has followed a variation of the [[Metonic cycle]]. It is unclear from where, when or how the Metonic system was introduced; hypotheses range from China to Europe.<ref group=note>(Ohashi 2001: 398\u2013399):  Astronomers of ancient India certainly knew of the Metonic cycle, and may have introduced the concept to Southeast Asia. However, the Metonic cycle, which employs tropical years, is incompatible with sidereal based Hindu calendars, and thus was not (and still is not) used in Hindu calendars. Chatterjee (1998: 151) suggests that the Metonic system was introduced to Burma by Europeans. Ohashi (2001: 398\u2013399) rejects Chatterjee's hypothesis saying that \"no other trace of European influence is found in South-East Asian astronomy.\" Instead, Ohashi (2001: 401\u2013403) suggests that China may have been the source of the Metonic cycle.</ref> The Burmese system, and indeed the Southeast Asian systems, thus use a \"strange\" combination of [[sidereal year]]s from Indian calendar in combination with the Metonic cycle better for [[tropical year]]s.<ref name=yo-2001-398-399>Ohashi 2001: 398\u2013399</ref>\n\n===Epochal date===\nIn all Theravada traditions, the calendar's epochal [[year 0]] date was the day in which the [[Buddha]] attained ''[[Parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]''. However, not all traditions agree on when it actually took place. In [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhist]] tradition, it was 13 May 544 [[BCE]] (Tuesday, Full moon of Kason 148 Anjanasakaraj).<ref name=my-1-38>Kala Vol. 1 2006: 38</ref> But in Thailand, it was 11 March 545 BCE, the date which the current Thai lunisolar and solar calendars use as the epochal date. Yet, the Thai calendars for some reason have fixed the difference between their Buddhist Era (BE) numbering and the Christian/Common Era (CE) numbering at 543,<ref name=jce-1995-15-16>Eade 1995: 15-16</ref> which points to an epochal year of 544 BCE, not 545 BCE. In Myanmar, the difference between BE and CE can be 543 or 544 for CE dates, and 544 or 543 for BCE dates, depending on the month of the Buddhist Era (as the Buddhist calendar straddles the Gregorian calendar\u2014currently from April to April).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The 15th of the waxing is the civil full moon day. The civil new moon day is the last day of the month (14th or 15th waning). Because of the inaccuracy of the calendrical calculation systems, the mean and real (true) New Moons rarely coincide.

One of its primary objectives is to synchronize the lunar part with the solar part. The lunar months, normally twelve of them, consist alternately of 29 days and 30 days, such that a normal lunar year will contain 354 days, as opposed to the solar year of ~365.25 days. Therefore, some form of addition to the lunar year (of intercalation) is necessary. The overall basis for it is provided by cycles of 57 years. Eleven extra days are inserted in every 57 years, and seven extra months of 30 days are inserted in every 19 years (21 months in 57 years). This provides 20819 complete days to both calendars.<ref name=jce-1995-15>Eade 1995: 15</ref> This 57-year cycle would provide a mean year of about 365.2456 days and a mean month of about 29.530496 days, if not corrected.\n\nAs such, the calendar adds an [[intercalary month]] in [[leap year]]s and sometimes also an [[leap day|intercalary day]] in great leap years. The intercalary month not only corrects the length of the year but also corrects the accumulating error of the month to extent of half a day. The average length of the month is further corrected by adding a day to Nayon at irregular intervals\u2014a little more than seven times in two cycles (39 years). The intercalary day is never inserted except in a year which has an intercalary month.<ref name=ambi-8-9/> The Hindu calendar inserts an intercalary month at any time of year as soon as the accumulated fractions amount to one month. The Burmese calendar however always inserts the intercalary month at the same time of the year, after the [[summer solstice]] while the Arakanese calendar inserts it after the [[vernal equinox]].<ref name=ambi-2-3>Irwin 1909: 2\u20133</ref>\n\n====Burmese====\nThe actual Burmese calendar year consists of 354, 384 or 385 days.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! width=\"150\"|Month\n! width=\"100\"|Regular year\n! width=\"100\"|Small leap year\n! width=\"100\"|Big leap year\n|-\n| Tagu\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Kason\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| Nayon\n| 29\n| 29\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | 30\n|-\n| Waso\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | 2nd Waso\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | n/a\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | 30\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | 30\n|-\n| Wagaung\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Tawthalin\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| Thadingyut\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Tazaungmon\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| Nadaw\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Pyatho\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| Tabodwe\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Tabaung\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFAA\" | '''Total'''\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFAA\" | '''354'''\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFAA\" | '''384'''\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFAA\" | '''385'''\n|}\n\nNote: The [[Arakanese calendar]] adds the intercalary day in Tagu, not in Nayon.\n\n====Cambodian, Lao and Thai====\nThe Cambodian, Lao and Thai lunisolar calendars use a slightly different method to place the intercalary day.

However, the solar year as defined by the Buddhist calendars is really a [[sidereal year]], which is nearly 24 minutes longer than the actual mean [[tropical year]]. Therefore, like all sidereal-based calendars, the lunisolar calendars are slowly drifting away from the seasons.<ref name=ambi-26-27>Irwin 1909: 26\u201327</ref> The calendars are drifting one day approximately every 60 years and 4 months.\n\nThe accumulating drift against the seasons means the New Year's Day which used to fall on 22 March (near the [[vernal equinox]]) in 638 CE now falls on 17 April in 2013 CE. There is no known internationally concerted effort to stop this drift. Thailand has moved its \"Buddhist Era\" to the Gregorian calendar under the name of [[Thai solar calendar]]. In Myanmar, Burmese calendarists have tried to deal with the issue by periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the Metonic cycle. One major downside of this approach is that it is not possible to publish future calendars more than a few years (often even a year) ahead.<ref group=note>(Irwin 1909: 26\u201327): In the mid-19th century, the Burmese [[Konbaung Dynasty]] tried to address the issue by introducing a new calculation methodology. However, the new solar year it chose was actually 0.56 second a year ''less'' accurate than the version still prevalent in the rest of Southeast Asia. The Konbaung court also modified the Metonic cycle, which did more to re-synchronize the calendar with the seasons than the less accurate solar year.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Buddhist Era was first introduced to Southeast Asia along with Buddhism in the early centuries CE. It was not a separate calendar but simply a [[Calendar era|year numbering system]] that employed the organization and calculation methods of the prevailing lunisolar calendars in use throughout the region. In the early centuries CE, the reference civil calendar of the Buddhist calendar prevalent in Southeast Asia was the [[Shalivahana era|Saka Era (Mah\u0101sakaraj Era)]], which is said to have been adopted by the [[Pyu city-states|Pyu state]] of [[Sri Ksetra Kingdom|Sri Ksetra]] in 80 CE. The Saka Era was gradually replaced by the [[Burmese calendar|Burmese Era]] or Cul\u0101sakaraj, first in Myanmar in 640 CE,<ref name=hy-1-216>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 216</ref> and in other Theravada kingdoms of Southeast Asia between the 13th and 16th centuries.<ref group=note>(Eade 1989: 11): The earliest use of the Burmese calendar in lands part of present-day Thailand dates to the mid-13th century.

Therefore, the Thai Buddhist Era year of 2455 began on 1 April 1912 (as opposed to 15 April 1912 according to the lunisolar calendar<ref name=jce-1989-166>Eade 1989: 166</ref>). The Thai Buddhist Era was further realigned to the Gregorian calendar on 6 September 1940 when Prime Minister [[Phibunsongkhram]] decreed 1 January 1941 as the start of the year 2484 BE. As a result, the Year 2483 was only 9 months long, and the Thai Buddhist Era equals that of the [[Common Era]] plus 543 years.\n\n==Current usage==\nThe lunisolar calendar is used to mark important Buddhist holidays.

While the calendars share a common lineage, they also have minor but important variations such as [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] schedules, month names and numbering, use of cycles, etc. In Thailand, the name Buddhist Era is a [[Calendar era|year numbering]] system shared by the traditional [[Thai lunar calendar|Thai lunisolar calendar]] and by the [[Thai solar calendar]].\n\nThe Southeast Asian [[lunisolar calendar]]s are largely based on an older version of the [[Hindu calendar]],<ref name=yo-354-355/> which uses the [[sidereal year]] as the solar year. One major difference is that the Southeast Asian systems, unlike their Indian cousins, do not use apparent reckoning to stay in sync with the sidereal year. Instead, they employ their versions of the [[Metonic cycle]]. However, since the Metonic cycle is not very accurate for sidereal years, the Southeast Asian calendar is slowly drifting out of sync with the sidereal, approximately one day every 100 years. Yet no coordinated structural reforms of the lunisolar calendar have been undertaken.\n\nToday, the traditional Buddhist lunisolar calendar is used mainly for [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]] festivals, and no longer has the official calendar status anywhere. The Thai Buddhist Era, a renumbered [[Gregorian calendar]], is the official calendar in Thailand.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:August2004rs.png|thumbnail|Thailand's version of the lunisolar Buddhist calendar]]\n\n{{See also|Burmese calendar#Structure}}\nThe calculation methodology of the current versions of Southeast Asian Buddhist calendars is largely based on that of the [[Burmese calendar]], which was in use in various Southeast Asian kingdoms down to the 19th century under the names of [[Chula Sakarat]] and [[Jolak Sakaraj]]. The Burmese calendar in turn was based on the \"original\" ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]'' system of ancient India (believed to be Ardharatrika school).<ref name=yo-354-355>Ohashi 2007: 354\u2013355</ref> One key difference with Indian systems is that the Burmese system has followed a variation of the [[Metonic cycle]]. It is unclear from where, when or how the Metonic system was introduced; hypotheses range from China to Europe.<ref group=note>(Ohashi 2001: 398\u2013399):  Astronomers of ancient India certainly knew of the Metonic cycle, and may have introduced the concept to Southeast Asia. However, the Metonic cycle, which employs tropical years, is incompatible with sidereal based Hindu calendars, and thus was not (and still is not) used in Hindu calendars. Chatterjee (1998: 151) suggests that the Metonic system was introduced to Burma by Europeans. Ohashi (2001: 398\u2013399) rejects Chatterjee's hypothesis saying that \"no other trace of European influence is found in South-East Asian astronomy.\" Instead, Ohashi (2001: 401\u2013403) suggests that China may have been the source of the Metonic cycle.</ref> The Burmese system, and indeed the Southeast Asian systems, thus use a \"strange\" combination of [[sidereal year]]s from Indian calendar in combination with the Metonic cycle better for [[tropical year]]s.<ref name=yo-2001-398-399>Ohashi 2001: 398\u2013399</ref>\n\n===Epochal date===\nIn all Theravada traditions, the calendar's epochal [[year 0]] date was the day in which the [[Buddha]] attained ''[[Parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]''. However, not all traditions agree on when it actually took place. In [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhist]] tradition, it was 13 May 544 [[BCE]] (Tuesday, Full moon of Kason 148 Anjanasakaraj).<ref name=my-1-38>Kala Vol. 1 2006: 38</ref> But in Thailand, it was 11 March 545 BCE, the date which the current Thai lunisolar and solar calendars use as the epochal date. Yet, the Thai calendars for some reason have fixed the difference between their Buddhist Era (BE) numbering and the Christian/Common Era (CE) numbering at 543,<ref name=jce-1995-15-16>Eade 1995: 15-16</ref> which points to an epochal year of 544 BCE, not 545 BCE. In Myanmar, the difference between BE and CE can be 543 or 544 for CE dates, and 544 or 543 for BCE dates, depending on the month of the Buddhist Era (as the Buddhist calendar straddles the Gregorian calendar\u2014currently from April to April).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The 15th of the waxing is the civil full moon day. The civil new moon day is the last day of the month (14th or 15th waning). Because of the inaccuracy of the calendrical calculation systems, the mean and real (true) New Moons rarely coincide.

One of its primary objectives is to synchronize the lunar part with the solar part. The lunar months, normally twelve of them, consist alternately of 29 days and 30 days, such that a normal lunar year will contain 354 days, as opposed to the solar year of ~365.25 days. Therefore, some form of addition to the lunar year (of intercalation) is necessary. The overall basis for it is provided by cycles of 57 years. Eleven extra days are inserted in every 57 years, and seven extra months of 30 days are inserted in every 19 years (21 months in 57 years). This provides 20819 complete days to both calendars.<ref name=jce-1995-15>Eade 1995: 15</ref> This 57-year cycle would provide a mean year of about 365.2456 days and a mean month of about 29.530496 days, if not corrected.\n\nAs such, the calendar adds an [[intercalary month]] in [[leap year]]s and sometimes also an [[leap day|intercalary day]] in great leap years. The intercalary month not only corrects the length of the year but also corrects the accumulating error of the month to extent of half a day. The average length of the month is further corrected by adding a day to Nayon at irregular intervals\u2014a little more than seven times in two cycles (39 years). The intercalary day is never inserted except in a year which has an intercalary month.<ref name=ambi-8-9/> The Hindu calendar inserts an intercalary month at any time of year as soon as the accumulated fractions amount to one month. The Burmese calendar however always inserts the intercalary month at the same time of the year, after the [[summer solstice]] while the Arakanese calendar inserts it after the [[vernal equinox]].<ref name=ambi-2-3>Irwin 1909: 2\u20133</ref>\n\n====Burmese====\nThe actual Burmese calendar year consists of 354, 384 or 385 days.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! width=\"150\"|Month\n! width=\"100\"|Regular year\n! width=\"100\"|Small leap year\n! width=\"100\"|Big leap year\n|-\n| Tagu\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Kason\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| Nayon\n| 29\n| 29\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | 30\n|-\n| Waso\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | 2nd Waso\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | n/a\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | 30\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFCB\" | 30\n|-\n| Wagaung\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Tawthalin\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| Thadingyut\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Tazaungmon\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| Nadaw\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Pyatho\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| Tabodwe\n| 29\n| 29\n| 29\n|-\n| Tabaung\n| 30\n| 30\n| 30\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFAA\" | '''Total'''\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFAA\" | '''354'''\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFAA\" | '''384'''\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFAA\" | '''385'''\n|}\n\nNote: The [[Arakanese calendar]] adds the intercalary day in Tagu, not in Nayon.\n\n====Cambodian, Lao and Thai====\nThe Cambodian, Lao and Thai lunisolar calendars use a slightly different method to place the intercalary day.

However, the solar year as defined by the Buddhist calendars is really a [[sidereal year]], which is nearly 24 minutes longer than the actual mean [[tropical year]]. Therefore, like all sidereal-based calendars, the lunisolar calendars are slowly drifting away from the seasons.<ref name=ambi-26-27>Irwin 1909: 26\u201327</ref> The calendars are drifting one day approximately every 60 years and 4 months.\n\nThe accumulating drift against the seasons means the New Year's Day which used to fall on 22 March (near the [[vernal equinox]]) in 638 CE now falls on 17 April in 2013 CE. There is no known internationally concerted effort to stop this drift. Thailand has moved its \"Buddhist Era\" to the Gregorian calendar under the name of [[Thai solar calendar]]. In Myanmar, Burmese calendarists have tried to deal with the issue by periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the Metonic cycle. One major downside of this approach is that it is not possible to publish future calendars more than a few years (often even a year) ahead.<ref group=note>(Irwin 1909: 26\u201327): In the mid-19th century, the Burmese [[Konbaung Dynasty]] tried to address the issue by introducing a new calculation methodology. However, the new solar year it chose was actually 0.56 second a year ''less'' accurate than the version still prevalent in the rest of Southeast Asia. The Konbaung court also modified the Metonic cycle, which did more to re-synchronize the calendar with the seasons than the less accurate solar year.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Buddhist Era was first introduced to Southeast Asia along with Buddhism in the early centuries CE. It was not a separate calendar but simply a [[Calendar era|year numbering system]] that employed the organization and calculation methods of the prevailing lunisolar calendars in use throughout the region. In the early centuries CE, the reference civil calendar of the Buddhist calendar prevalent in Southeast Asia was the [[Shalivahana era|Saka Era (Mah\u0101sakaraj Era)]], which is said to have been adopted by the [[Pyu city-states|Pyu state]] of [[Sri Ksetra Kingdom|Sri Ksetra]] in 80 CE. The Saka Era was gradually replaced by the [[Burmese calendar|Burmese Era]] or Cul\u0101sakaraj, first in Myanmar in 640 CE,<ref name=hy-1-216>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 216</ref> and in other Theravada kingdoms of Southeast Asia between the 13th and 16th centuries.<ref group=note>(Eade 1989: 11): The earliest use of the Burmese calendar in lands part of present-day Thailand dates to the mid-13th century.

Therefore, the Thai Buddhist Era year of 2455 began on 1 April 1912 (as opposed to 15 April 1912 according to the lunisolar calendar<ref name=jce-1989-166>Eade 1989: 166</ref>). The Thai Buddhist Era was further realigned to the Gregorian calendar on 6 September 1940 when Prime Minister [[Phibunsongkhram]] decreed 1 January 1941 as the start of the year 2484 BE. As a result, the Year 2483 was only 9 months long, and the Thai Buddhist Era equals that of the [[Common Era]] plus 543 years.\n\n==Current usage==\nThe lunisolar calendar is used to mark important Buddhist holidays.

{"title_page": "Programming productivity", "text_new": "'''Programming productivity''' (also called '''software productivity''' or '''development productivity''') describes the degree of the ability of individual programmers or development teams to build and evolve software systems. Productivity traditionally refers to the ratio between the quantity of software produced and the cost spent for it. Here the delicacy lies in finding a reasonable way to define software quantity.\n\n==Terminology==\nProductivity is an important topic investigated in disciplines as various as manufacturing, organizational psychology, industrial engineering, strategic management, finance, accounting, marketing and economics. Levels of analysis include the individual, the group, divisional, organizational and national levels [5]. Due to this diversity, there is no clear-cut definition of productivity and its influencing factors, although research has been conducted for more than a century. Like in software engineering, this lack of common agreement on what actually constitutes productivity, is perceived as a major obstacle for a substantiated discussion of productivity.<ref>Neal, A., Hesketh, B., Anderson, N., Ones, D. S., Sinangil, H. K., Viswesvaran, C. (ed.) Handbook of Industrial, Work and Organizational Psychology Productivity in Organizations. Sage Publications Ltd, 2002, 8-24</ref> The following definitions describe the best consensus on the terminology.<ref name=\"tangen2005\">Tangen, S. Demystifying productivity and performance, International Journal of Productivity and Performance, 2005, 54, 34-36</ref>\n\n===Productivity===\n\nWhile there is no commonly agreed on definition of productivity, there appears to be an agreement that productivity describes the ratio between output and input:\n\nProductivity = Output / Input\n\nHowever, across the various disciplines different notions and, particularly, different measurement units for input and output can be found. The manufacturing industry typically uses a straightforward relation between the number of units produced and the number of units consumed.<ref>Chew, B. W. No-Nonsense Guide to Measuring Productivity. Harvard Business Review, 1988, 66, 110-115</ref>  Non-manufacturing industries usually use man-hours or similar units to enable comparison between outputs and inputs.\n\nOne basic agreement is that the meaning of productivity and the means for measuring it vary depending of what context is under evaluation. In a manufacturing company the possible contexts are:<ref name=\"tangen2005\" />\n\n* the individual machine or manufacturing system;\n* the manufacturing function, for example assembly;\n* the manufacturing process for a single product or group of related products;\n* the factory; and\n* the company\u2019s entire factory system\n\nAs long classical production processes are considered a straightforward metric of productivity is simple: how many units of a product of specified quality is produced by which costs. For intellectual work, productivity is much trickier. How do we measure the productivity of authors, scientists, or engineers? Due to the rising importance of [[knowledge work]] (as opposed to manual work),<ref name=\"drucker1999\">Drucker, P. F. Knowledge-Worker Productivity: The Biggest Challenge. California Management Review, 1999, 41, 79-94</ref> many researchers tried to develop productivity measurement means that can be applied in a non-manufacturing context. It is commonly agreed that the nature of knowledge work fundamentally differs from manual work and, hence, factors besides the simple output/input ratio need to be taken into account, e.g. quality, timeliness, autonomy, project success, customer satisfaction and innovation. However, the research communities in neither discipline have been able to establish broadly applicable and accepted means for productivity measurement yet.<ref name=\"ramirez2004\">Ram\u00edrez, Y. W., Nembhard, D. A. Measuring knowledge worker productivity: A taxonomy. Journal of Intellectual Capital, 2004, 5, 602-628</ref> The same holds for more specific area of programming productivity.\n\n===Profitability===\n\nProfitability and performance are closely linked and are, in fact, often confused. However, as profitability is usually defined as the ratio between revenue and cost\n\nProfitability = Revenue / Cost\n\nIt has a wider scope than performance, i.e. the number of factors that influence profitability is greater than the number of factors than influence productivity. Particularly, profitability can change without any change to the productivity, e.g. due to external conditions like cost or price inflation. Besides that, the interdependency between productivity and profitability is usually delayed, i.e. gains in productivity are rarely reflected in immediate profitability gains are more likely realized on the long-term.\n\n===Performance===\n\nThe term performance is even broader than productivity and profitability and covers a plethora of factors that influence a company\u2019s success. Hence, well-known performance controlling instruments like the [[Balanced Scorecard]] do include productivity as a factor that is central but not unique. Other relevant factors are e.g. the customers\u2019 or stakeholders\u2019 perception of the company.\n\n===Efficiency and Effectiveness===\n\nEfficiency and effectiveness are terms that provide further confusion as they themselves are often mixed up and, additionally, efficiency is often confused with productivity. The difference between efficiency and effectiveness is usually explained informally as ''efficiency is doing things right'' and ''effectiveness is doing the right things''. While there are numerous other definitions,<ref name=\"tangen2005\" /> there is a certain agreement that efficiency refers to the utilisation of resources and mainly influences the required input of the productivity ratio.  Effectiveness on the other hand mainly influences the output of the productivity ratio as it usually has direct consequences for the customer. Effectiveness can be defined as \"the ability to reach a desired output\".\n\nGenerally, it is assumed, that efficiency can be quantified, e.g. by utilization rates, considerably more easily than effectiveness.\n\n===Quality===\n\nTangen states: \"Improvements in quality, other than the fact that no-fault products add to output levels, ought not to be included in the concept of productivity.\"<ref name=\"tangen2005\" />  However, most of the classic literature in non-software disciplines, especially in the manufacturing area, does not explicitly discuss the role of quality of the output in the productivity ratio.<ref>Thomas, B. E. & Baron, J. P. Evaluating Knowledge Worker Productivity: Literature Review Construction Engineering Research Lab (USACERL), 1994</ref> More recent works from non-manufacturing disciplines have a stronger focus on knowledge, office or white-collar work and hence increasingly discuss the role of quality with respect to quality.<ref name=\"drucker1999\" /><ref name=\"ramirez2004\" /><ref>Al-Darrab, I. A. Relationships between productivity, efficiency, utilization, and quality. Work Study, 2000, 49, 97-104</ref><ref name=\"saari2006\">Saari, S. Productivity: Theory and Measurement. In Business Proc. of the European Productivity Conference (EPC), 2006</ref><ref>Ray, P., Sahu, S. The Measurement and Evaluation of White-collar Productivity. International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 1989, 9, 28-47</ref>\n\nDrucker stresses the importance of quality for the evaluation of knowledge worker productivity: \"Productivity of knowledge work therefore has to aim first at obtaining quality\u2014and not minimum quality but optimum if not maximum quality. Only then can one ask: \"What is the volume, the quantity of work?\"\"<ref name=\"drucker1999\" />\n\nSaari captures the importance of quality with his extended formula for productivity:<ref name=\"saari2006\" />\n \nTotal productivity = (Output quality and quantity)/(Input quality and quantity)\n\nHowever, it appears that these efforts to include the quality in the determination of productivity did not lead to an operationalizable concept yet. It currently remains unclear how to quantify the vague terms \u201cOutput quality and quantity\u201d as well as \u201cInput quality and quantity\u201d, let alone to calculate the ratio.\n\n==State-of-the-Art in Programming Productivity==\n\nIn software development things are more complicated than in the production of goods. Software development is an engineering process.\n\n===COCOMO II===\n\nBoehm was one of the first researchers that systematically approached the field of software productivity. His cost estimation model [[COCOMO]] \u2013 now COCOMO II<ref>Boehm et al. Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II, 2000</ref> - is standard software engineering knowledge. In this model, he defines a set of factors that influence productivity such as the required reliability or the capability of the analysts. These factors have been widely reused in other similar productivity approaches. The rest of the model is based on function points and finally [[source lines of code]] (LOC). The limitations of LOC as a productivity measure are well-known.\n\n===Jones's Software Productivity===\n\nJones is the author of a series of books on software productivity. Besides several theoretical considerations his main contribution is the systematic provision and integration of a large amount of data relevant for productivity analyses. In at least two of his books,<ref>Jones, C. Software Assessments, Benchmarks, and Best Practices. Addison-Wesley, 2000</ref><ref>Jones, Casper. <u>Programming Productivity</u> McGraw-Hill, Inc. p. 86</ref> he gives a number of productivity factors but also points out that for each project a different set of factors are influential. These factors can form a basis for productivity assessments and for comparison with industrial averages.\n\nThis is one such list:\n<blockquote>\nThe 20 factors whose quantified impacts on software projects have been determined from historical data are the following:\n\n* Programming language used\n* Program size\n* The experience of programmers and design personnel\n* The novelty of requirements\n* The complexity of the program and its data \n* The use of structured programming methods\n* Program class or the distribution method\n* Program type of the application area\n* Tools and environmental conditions\n* Enhancing existing programs or systems\n* Maintaining existing programs or systems\n* Reusing existing modules and standard designs\n* Program generators\n* Fourth-generation languages\n* Geographic separation of development locations\n* Defect potentials and removal methods\n* (Existing) Documentation\n* Prototyping before main development begins\n* Project teams and organization structures\n* Morale and compensation of staff <ref>Jones, Casper. <u>Programming Productivity</u> McGraw-Hill, Inc. p. 86</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Function Points===\n\n[[Function points]] were proposed in 1977 by Albrecht as a better size measure for software than LOC. In that it is based on the specification of the software and thereby aims at measuring the size of its functionality rather than the code itself. The reason is that the size of the code not only depends on the size of the functionality but also on the capability of the programmer: better programmers will produce less code for the same functionality. The function points have undergone several redesigns over the years mainly driven by the International Function Point User Group (IFPUG). This group is large with over 1200 companies as member which shows the rather strong acceptance of this measure. However, in many domains it still lacks practical application because it is often conceived as only applicable to business information systems.\n\n===Value-Based Software Engineering===\n\nSeveral researchers proposed economic-driven or value-based software engineering as an important paradigm in future software engineering research. Boehm and Huang point out that is it not only important to track the costs in a software project but also the real earned value, i.e. the value for the customer.<ref>Barry Boehm, Li Guo Huang. Value-Based Software Engineering: A Case Study. IEEE Software, 2003</ref> They explain that it is important to create the software business case and keep it up to date. In essence, value-based software engineering focuses on the customer value, mainly measured in monetary units.\n\n===Peopleware===\n\nThe famous book [[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams]] by de Marco and Lister<ref>Tom DeMarco, Timothy Lister. Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams, 1987</ref> brought the importance of people-related factors to the attention of a broader audience. They collected in many software projects experiences with good and bad management practice that have an influence on the productivity of the team. They and others showed that these are the decisive issues in software engineering but were only able to describe them anecdotally.\n\n== Factors influencing programming productivity ==\nThere are probably a large number of factors influencing the programming productivity of individuals and teams.

Productivity traditionally refers to the ratio between the quantity of software produced and the cost spent for it. Here the delicacy lies in finding a reasonable way to define software quantity.\n\n==Terminology==\nProductivity is an important topic investigated in disciplines as various as manufacturing, organizational psychology, industrial engineering, strategic management, finance, accounting, marketing and economics. Levels of analysis include the individual, the group, divisional, organizational and national levels [5]. Due to this diversity, there is no clear-cut definition of productivity and its influencing factors, although research has been conducted for more than a century. Like in software engineering, this lack of common agreement on what actually constitutes productivity, is perceived as a major obstacle for a substantiated discussion of productivity.<ref>Neal, A., Hesketh, B., Anderson, N., Ones, D. S., Sinangil, H. K., Viswesvaran, C. (ed.) Handbook of Industrial, Work and Organizational Psychology Productivity in Organizations. Sage Publications Ltd, 2002, 8-24</ref> The following definitions describe the best consensus on the terminology.<ref name=\"tangen2005\">Tangen, S. Demystifying productivity and performance, International Journal of Productivity and Performance, 2005, 54, 34-36</ref>\n\n===Productivity===\n\nWhile there is no commonly agreed on definition of productivity, there appears to be an agreement that productivity describes the ratio between output and input:\n\nProductivity = Output / Input\n\nHowever, across the various disciplines different notions and, particularly, different measurement units for input and output can be found. The manufacturing industry typically uses a straightforward relation between the number of units produced and the number of units consumed.<ref>Chew, B. W. No-Nonsense Guide to Measuring Productivity. Harvard Business Review, 1988, 66, 110-115</ref>  Non-manufacturing industries usually use man-hours or similar units to enable comparison between outputs and inputs.\n\nOne basic agreement is that the meaning of productivity and the means for measuring it vary depending of what context is under evaluation. In a manufacturing company the possible contexts are:<ref name=\"tangen2005\" />\n\n* the individual machine or manufacturing system;\n* the manufacturing function, for example assembly;\n* the manufacturing process for a single product or group of related products;\n* the factory; and\n* the company\u2019s entire factory system\n\nAs long classical production processes are considered a straightforward metric of productivity is simple: how many units of a product of specified quality is produced by which costs. For intellectual work, productivity is much trickier. How do we measure the productivity of authors, scientists, or engineers? Due to the rising importance of [[knowledge work]] (as opposed to manual work),<ref name=\"drucker1999\">Drucker, P. F. Knowledge-Worker Productivity: The Biggest Challenge. California Management Review, 1999, 41, 79-94</ref> many researchers tried to develop productivity measurement means that can be applied in a non-manufacturing context. It is commonly agreed that the nature of knowledge work fundamentally differs from manual work and, hence, factors besides the simple output/input ratio need to be taken into account, e.g. quality, timeliness, autonomy, project success, customer satisfaction and innovation. However, the research communities in neither discipline have been able to establish broadly applicable and accepted means for productivity measurement yet.<ref name=\"ramirez2004\">Ram\u00edrez, Y. W., Nembhard, D. A. Measuring knowledge worker productivity: A taxonomy. Journal of Intellectual Capital, 2004, 5, 602-628</ref> The same holds for more specific area of programming productivity.\n\n===Profitability===\n\nProfitability and performance are closely linked and are, in fact, often confused. However, as profitability is usually defined as the ratio between revenue and cost\n\nProfitability = Revenue / Cost\n\nIt has a wider scope than performance, i.e. the number of factors that influence profitability is greater than the number of factors than influence productivity. Particularly, profitability can change without any change to the productivity, e.g. due to external conditions like cost or price inflation. Besides that, the interdependency between productivity and profitability is usually delayed, i.e. gains in productivity are rarely reflected in immediate profitability gains are more likely realized on the long-term.\n\n===Performance===\n\nThe term performance is even broader than productivity and profitability and covers a plethora of factors that influence a company\u2019s success. Hence, well-known performance controlling instruments like the [[Balanced Scorecard]] do include productivity as a factor that is central but not unique. Other relevant factors are e.g. the customers\u2019 or stakeholders\u2019 perception of the company.\n\n===Efficiency and Effectiveness===\n\nEfficiency and effectiveness are terms that provide further confusion as they themselves are often mixed up and, additionally, efficiency is often confused with productivity. The difference between efficiency and effectiveness is usually explained informally as ''efficiency is doing things right'' and ''effectiveness is doing the right things''. While there are numerous other definitions,<ref name=\"tangen2005\" /> there is a certain agreement that efficiency refers to the utilisation of resources and mainly influences the required input of the productivity ratio.  Effectiveness on the other hand mainly influences the output of the productivity ratio as it usually has direct consequences for the customer. Effectiveness can be defined as \"the ability to reach a desired output\".\n\nGenerally, it is assumed, that efficiency can be quantified, e.g. by utilization rates, considerably more easily than effectiveness.\n\n===Quality===\n\nTangen states: \"Improvements in quality, other than the fact that no-fault products add to output levels, ought not to be included in the concept of productivity.\"<ref name=\"tangen2005\" />  However, most of the classic literature in non-software disciplines, especially in the manufacturing area, does not explicitly discuss the role of quality of the output in the productivity ratio.<ref>Thomas, B. E. & Baron, J. P. Evaluating Knowledge Worker Productivity: Literature Review Construction Engineering Research Lab (USACERL), 1994</ref> More recent works from non-manufacturing disciplines have a stronger focus on knowledge, office or white-collar work and hence increasingly discuss the role of quality with respect to quality.<ref name=\"drucker1999\" /><ref name=\"ramirez2004\" /><ref>Al-Darrab, I. A. Relationships between productivity, efficiency, utilization, and quality. Work Study, 2000, 49, 97-104</ref><ref name=\"saari2006\">Saari, S. Productivity: Theory and Measurement. In Business Proc. of the European Productivity Conference (EPC), 2006</ref><ref>Ray, P., Sahu, S. The Measurement and Evaluation of White-collar Productivity. International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 1989, 9, 28-47</ref>\n\nDrucker stresses the importance of quality for the evaluation of knowledge worker productivity: \"Productivity of knowledge work therefore has to aim first at obtaining quality\u2014and not minimum quality but optimum if not maximum quality. Only then can one ask: \"What is the volume, the quantity of work?\"\"<ref name=\"drucker1999\" />\n\nSaari captures the importance of quality with his extended formula for productivity:<ref name=\"saari2006\" />\n \nTotal productivity = (Output quality and quantity)/(Input quality and quantity)\n\nHowever, it appears that these efforts to include the quality in the determination of productivity did not lead to an operationalizable concept yet. It currently remains unclear how to quantify the vague terms \u201cOutput quality and quantity\u201d as well as \u201cInput quality and quantity\u201d, let alone to calculate the ratio.\n\n==State-of-the-Art in Programming Productivity==\n\nIn software development things are more complicated than in the production of goods. Software development is an engineering process.\n\n===COCOMO II===\n\nBoehm was one of the first researchers that systematically approached the field of software productivity. His cost estimation model [[COCOMO]] \u2013 now COCOMO II<ref>Boehm et al. Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II, 2000</ref> - is standard software engineering knowledge. In this model, he defines a set of factors that influence productivity such as the required reliability or the capability of the analysts. These factors have been widely reused in other similar productivity approaches. The rest of the model is based on function points and finally [[source lines of code]] (LOC). The limitations of LOC as a productivity measure are well-known.\n\n===Jones's Software Productivity===\n\nJones is the author of a series of books on software productivity. Besides several theoretical considerations his main contribution is the systematic provision and integration of a large amount of data relevant for productivity analyses. In at least two of his books,<ref>Jones, C. Software Assessments, Benchmarks, and Best Practices. Addison-Wesley, 2000</ref><ref>Jones, Casper. <u>Programming Productivity</u> McGraw-Hill, Inc. p. 86</ref> he gives a number of productivity factors but also points out that for each project a different set of factors are influential. These factors can form a basis for productivity assessments and for comparison with industrial averages.\n\nThis is one such list:\n<blockquote>\nThe 20 factors whose quantified impacts on software projects have been determined from historical data are the following:\n\n* Programming language used\n* Program size\n* The experience of programmers and design personnel\n* The novelty of requirements\n* The complexity of the program and its data \n* The use of structured programming methods\n* Program class or the distribution method\n* Program type of the application area\n* Tools and environmental conditions\n* Enhancing existing programs or systems\n* Maintaining existing programs or systems\n* Reusing existing modules and standard designs\n* Program generators\n* Fourth-generation languages\n* Geographic separation of development locations\n* Defect potentials and removal methods\n* (Existing) Documentation\n* Prototyping before main development begins\n* Project teams and organization structures\n* Morale and compensation of staff <ref>Jones, Casper. <u>Programming Productivity</u> McGraw-Hill, Inc. p. 86</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Function Points===\n\n[[Function points]] were proposed in 1977 by Albrecht as a better size measure for software than LOC. In that it is based on the specification of the software and thereby aims at measuring the size of its functionality rather than the code itself. The reason is that the size of the code not only depends on the size of the functionality but also on the capability of the programmer: better programmers will produce less code for the same functionality. The function points have undergone several redesigns over the years mainly driven by the International Function Point User Group (IFPUG). This group is large with over 1200 companies as member which shows the rather strong acceptance of this measure. However, in many domains it still lacks practical application because it is often conceived as only applicable to business information systems.\n\n===Value-Based Software Engineering===\n\nSeveral researchers proposed economic-driven or value-based software engineering as an important paradigm in future software engineering research. Boehm and Huang point out that is it not only important to track the costs in a software project but also the real earned value, i.e. the value for the customer.<ref>Barry Boehm, Li Guo Huang. Value-Based Software Engineering: A Case Study. IEEE Software, 2003</ref> They explain that it is important to create the software business case and keep it up to date. In essence, value-based software engineering focuses on the customer value, mainly measured in monetary units.\n\n===Peopleware===\n\nThe famous book [[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams]] by de Marco and Lister<ref>Tom DeMarco, Timothy Lister. Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams, 1987</ref> brought the importance of people-related factors to the attention of a broader audience. They collected in many software projects experiences with good and bad management practice that have an influence on the productivity of the team. They and others showed that these are the decisive issues in software engineering but were only able to describe them anecdotally.\n\n== Factors influencing programming productivity ==\nThere are probably a large number of factors influencing the programming productivity of individuals and teams. For example, the used [[software development process]] probably influences the effectiveness and efficiency of a team.\n\nThe [[personalities]] of software programmers influence the used coding styles which, in turn, influence the productivity of the programmers.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Links between the personalities, styles and performance in computer programming|url = http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2015/10315/|journal = Journal of Systems and Software|date = 2016|pages = 228\u2013241|volume = 111|doi = 10.1016/j.jss.2015.09.011|first = Zahra|last = Karimi|first2 = Ahmad|last2 = Baraani-Dastjerdi|first3 = Nasser|last3 = Ghasem-Aghaee|first4 = Stefan|last4 = Wagner|arxiv = 1611.10169}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Software Cost Estimation with Cocomo II'', [[Barry W.

In October 1996 he travelled with the committee to Bratislava which had a  mandate from the European Parliament to challenge Prime Minister Meciar on his disturbing human rights violations. Hallam's intervention made front-page news in Slovakia.<ref>\"Meciar si to u Hallama pokazil\" Pravda Utorok 29 Oktobra 1996</ref>\n\n===Delegation to Israel===\nHallam visited Israel several times with this standing delegation.

He met separately with the Northern Irish politician and cleric [[Ian Paisley]] regularly at a time when this was seen to be politically risky. In July 1996 Hallam flew to Belfast to discuss the [[Drumcree conflict]] with Ian Paisley in a bid to avert serious bloodshed.<ref>https://www.thechamberlainfiles.com/the-odd-couple-labour-man-tells-how-he-prayed-with-ian-paisley/</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n===Clause IV===\nDavid Hallam was one of many [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members who opposed Labour leader [[Tony Blair]]'s re-writing of the common ownership [[Clause IV]] in the Labour Party constitution. He set out his views in a paper that was widely circulated within the Labour Party entitled ''Common Ownership and Social Justice'' <ref>http://www.thecitizen.org.uk/?p=149</ref>  which drew heavily on Hallam's [[Christian Socialist]] beliefs.<ref>See for example Evans, Stanley  \"Christian Socialism \u2013 A study outline and bibliography\" London 1962</ref>  He clashed with Tony Blair himself when Blair met the European Parliamentary Labour Party.<ref>Pollack p 235, 238, 239</ref>\n\n===Introduction of the regional list system for electing British MEPs===\nIn 1998 the Labour government introduced the  \"regional list\" system for electing MEPs. In an affirmative ballot 95% of Labour Party members in his constituency endorsed Hallam's selection.<ref>\"Hallam is Labour MEP choice\" Shropshire Star 4 August 1998</ref>  However, there is significant independent academic evidence that Labour's selection procedure for the final list was heavily weighted specifically against those MEPs who had opposed the re-writing of Clause IV.<ref>Wring, Baker and Seabright \"Panelism in Action, Labour\u2019s 1999 European Parliament Candidate Selection</ref> Hallam was placed in fifth place on Labour's list for the West Midlands but the party was only allocated three seats following the [[1999 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1999 European Parliamentary Elections]]. Hallam, together with colleague [[Christine Oddy]], was effectively replaced by actor [[Michael Cashman]] and housing director [[Neena Gill]]. Labour Party members in the West Midlands were angry that Hallam and Oddy had been pushed aside. <ref> ''Anger at Labour's Euro horror show - Gay actor ousts Midland duo as candidate'',The Birmingham Post 23 September 1998 and ''My anger at Labour betrayal'', The Birmingham Post, 24 September 1998.</ref>\n\n==Harold Williams==\nShortly after his election Hallam took up the case of Harold \"Ginger\" Williams who had been convicted of the murder of Dorothy Margaret Davies in her house on Whitern Way Hereford in January 1977. Williams was convicted the following November and had been in prison ever since, refusing the terms of parole that would have meant him acknowledging his guilt.<ref>\"Free Ginger campaign launched by Euro-MP\"  Hereford Times 9 October 1997</ref>\n  \nHallam's staff reviewed the available evidence and submitted a dossier to the Criminal Law Review Commission who then referred the case  to the Court of Appeal.<ref>http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Perspective%3A+Ages+of+innocence%3F%3B+Harold+Williams+was+convicted+of...-a098309553</ref> Williams however died just weeks before the case was due to be heard. At the time Hallam commented \"He was my first constituency case. He was also my last. I continued with it even after I had lost my seat. This has really broken our hearts .It\u2019s terrible after more than 23 years in custody, with just weeks to go before his name could finally be cleared, that he has died.

David Hallam worked with IBC in 2016 to publicise their concerns following the publication of the [[Chilcot Report]] which had been commissioned by the British government. He expressed his dismay that the British press had given more coverage to a comparatively trivial story he was promoting at the time, rather than the unnessecary  deaths of thousands of Iraqi civilians.<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/press-officer-murdered-iraqis-pok\u00e9mon-go-david-hallam-ma/ ''A press officer, murdered Iraqis and Pokemon Go''] Pulse, 31 July 2016.

The appointment was greeted by racist daubing on the school walls and threatening letters to the Chief Education Officer. However, O'Connor proved to be a very effective and popular headteacher, respected by children, parents, and colleagues.  On the fiftieth anniversary of the pioneering appointment in 2017, David Hallam announced that he would start a campaign to research the life of O'Connor with a view to erecting a blue plaque on the school walls to mark this important milestone in British educational history.<ref>https://www.expressandstar.com/news/uk-news/2017/12/27/campaign-launched-to-chart-life-of-first-black-headmaster/</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nWhen Hallam was elected as an MEP in 1994 he was in the same congregation at City Road Methodist Church, Birmingham as hymn writer Martin Leckebusch. Leckebusch's hymn \"Called by Christ to be disciples\" has been included as hymn number 660 in the UK's Methodist Church hymnbook, ''[[Singing the Faith]]'', published in 2013. According to the website supporting the new hymnbook \"Martin found himself asking the question: What\u2019s it going to be like for David as an MEP in Europe? How will he be a Christian disciple in that new role?.... Martin started to reflect on the different roles that individual members of a congregation fulfil in their 'day jobs' and how these may become part of their Christian calling\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Called by Christ to be disciples (StF 660) {{!}} Singing the Faith Plus |url=http://singingthefaithplus.org.uk/?calendar=2018-03wp_cat2calendar1&p=2635 |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nHallam's book ''Taking on the Men: the first women parliamentary candidates 1918'' provided the basis for the [https://www.itv.com/news/central/2018-12-06/central-lobby-watch-the-december-edition/ December edition of ITV's political programme in the Midlands, Central Lobby].

Women scrambled to be nominated, but only seventeen made it onto the ballot paper.\n\nThree were in the West Midlands. [[Christabel Pankhurst]] (Smethwick) is probably the best known of them now. But, at the time, [[Mary Macarthur]] (Stourbridge), and [[Margery Corbett Ashby]] (Ladywood) were equally capable of making headline news... and often did.\n\nRanged against them were all the forces of tradition and rigid conservatism, determined that women candidates should fail.\n\nTaking On the Men is a fascinating, superbly researched and thoroughly well-told tale of three women who took on the men and \u2013 simply by standing for Parliament \u2013 scored a small victory against what would now be known as \u2018the patriarchy\u2019.\n\nContains biographies and results for the seventeen women to contest the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 General Election]].\n\nIntroduction by [[Preet Gill]] MP, the UK's first woman Sikh Member of Parliament.\n\n===One hundred years of service to Newton===\n* [https://newtonroadurchistory.wordpress.com One hundred years of service to Newton, the history of Newton Road United Reformed (Allen Memorial) Church 1917-2017], Smethwick, 2018.\n\nThe Newton Road [[United Reformed Church]] closed its doors for the last time on Christmas Day 2017.

She had a difficult marriage, lost a beloved daughter in infancy and lived in a community at Great Barr where hostility to her Methodist faith was never far from the surface.\n\nNevertheless, for over fifty years her little cottage was a regular place of worship and her only son Frank was to go to America to become Bishop [[Francis Asbury]], the first Protestant Bishop in North America.\n\nThis book tells the inspiring story through Eliza's eyes, uncoupling many of the myths that have grown up about the Asbury family.

In October 1996 he travelled with the committee to Bratislava which had a  mandate from the European Parliament to challenge Prime Minister Meciar on his disturbing human rights violations.

He met separately with the Northern Irish politician and cleric [[Ian Paisley]] regularly at a time when this was seen to be politically risky. In July 1996 Hallam flew to Belfast to discuss the [[Drumcree conflict]] with Ian Paisley in a bid to avert serious bloodshed.<ref>https://www.thechamberlainfiles.com/the-odd-couple-labour-man-tells-how-he-prayed-with-ian-paisley/</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n===Clause IV===\nDavid Hallam was one of many [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members who opposed Labour leader [[Tony Blair]]'s re-writing of the common ownership [[Clause IV]] in the Labour Party constitution. He set out his views in a paper that was widely circulated within the Labour Party entitled ''Common Ownership and Social Justice'' <ref>http://www.thecitizen.org.uk/?p=149</ref>  which drew heavily on Hallam's [[Christian Socialist]] beliefs.<ref>See for example Evans, Stanley  \"Christian Socialism \u2013 A study outline and bibliography\" London 1962</ref>  He clashed with Tony Blair himself when Blair met the European Parliamentary Labour Party.<ref>Pollack p 235, 238, 239</ref>\n\n===Introduction of the regional list system for electing British MEPs===\nIn 1998 the Labour government introduced the  \"regional list\" system for electing MEPs. In an affirmative ballot 95% of Labour Party members in his constituency endorsed Hallam's selection.<ref>\"Hallam is Labour MEP choice\" Shropshire Star 4 August 1998</ref>  However, there is significant independent academic evidence that Labour's selection procedure for the final list was heavily weighted specifically against those MEPs who had opposed the re-writing of Clause IV.<ref>Wring, Baker and Seabright \"Panelism in Action, Labour\u2019s 1999 European Parliament Candidate Selection</ref> Hallam was placed in fifth place on Labour's list for the West Midlands but the party was only allocated three seats following the [[1999 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1999 European Parliamentary Elections]]. Hallam, together with colleague [[Christine Oddy]], was effectively replaced by actor [[Michael Cashman]] and housing director [[Neena Gill]]. Labour Party members in the West Midlands were angry that Hallam and Oddy had been pushed aside. <ref> ''Anger at Labour's Euro horror show - Gay actor ousts Midland duo as candidate'',The Birmingham Post 23 September 1998 and ''My anger at Labour betrayal'', The Birmingham Post, 24 September 1998.</ref>\n\n==Harold Williams==\nShortly after his election Hallam took up the case of Harold \"Ginger\" Williams who had been convicted of the murder of Dorothy Margaret Davies in her house on Whitern Way Hereford in January 1977. Williams was convicted the following November and had been in prison ever since, refusing the terms of parole that would have meant him acknowledging his guilt.<ref>\"Free Ginger campaign launched by Euro-MP\"  Hereford Times 9 October 1997</ref>\n  \nHallam's staff reviewed the available evidence and submitted a dossier to the Criminal Law Review Commission who then referred the case  to the Court of Appeal.<ref>http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Perspective%3A+Ages+of+innocence%3F%3B+Harold+Williams+was+convicted+of...-a098309553</ref> Williams however died just weeks before the case was due to be heard. At the time Hallam commented \"He was my first constituency case. He was also my last. I continued with it even after I had lost my seat. This has really broken our hearts .It\u2019s terrible after more than 23 years in custody, with just weeks to go before his name could finally be cleared, that he has died.

David Hallam worked with IBC in 2016 to publicise their concerns following the publication of the [[Chilcot Report]] which had been commissioned by the British government. He expressed his dismay that the British press had given more coverage to a comparatively trivial story he was promoting at the time, rather than the unnessecary  deaths of thousands of Iraqi civilians.<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/press-officer-murdered-iraqis-pok\u00e9mon-go-david-hallam-ma/ ''A press officer, murdered Iraqis and Pokemon Go''] Pulse, 31 July 2016.

The appointment was greeted by racist daubing on the school walls and threatening letters to the Chief Education Officer. However, O'Connor proved to be a very effective and popular headteacher, respected by children, parents, and colleagues.  On the fiftieth anniversary of the pioneering appointment in 2017, David Hallam announced that he would start a campaign to research the life of O'Connor with a view to erecting a blue plaque on the school walls to mark this important milestone in British educational history.<ref>https://www.expressandstar.com/news/uk-news/2017/12/27/campaign-launched-to-chart-life-of-first-black-headmaster/</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nWhen Hallam was elected as an MEP in 1994 he was in the same congregation at City Road Methodist Church, Birmingham as hymn writer Martin Leckebusch. Leckebusch's hymn \"Called by Christ to be disciples\" has been included as hymn number 660 in the UK's Methodist Church hymnbook, ''[[Singing the Faith]]'', published in 2013. According to the website supporting the new hymnbook \"Martin found himself asking the question: What\u2019s it going to be like for David as an MEP in Europe? How will he be a Christian disciple in that new role?.... Martin started to reflect on the different roles that individual members of a congregation fulfil in their 'day jobs' and how these may become part of their Christian calling\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Called by Christ to be disciples (StF 660) {{!}} Singing the Faith Plus |url=http://singingthefaithplus.org.uk/?calendar=2018-03wp_cat2calendar1&p=2635 |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nHallam's book ''Taking on the Men: the first women parliamentary candidates 1918'' provided the basis for the [https://www.itv.com/news/central/2018-12-06/central-lobby-watch-the-december-edition/ December edition of ITV's political programme in the Midlands, Central Lobby].

Women scrambled to be nominated, but only seventeen made it onto the ballot paper.\n\nThree were in the West Midlands. [[Christabel Pankhurst]] (Smethwick) is probably the best known of them now.

She had a difficult marriage, lost a beloved daughter in infancy and lived in a community at Great Barr where hostility to her Methodist faith was never far from the surface.\n\nNevertheless, for over fifty years her little cottage was a regular place of worship and her only son Frank was to go to America to become Bishop [[Francis Asbury]], the first Protestant Bishop in North America.\n\nThis book tells the inspiring story through Eliza's eyes, uncoupling many of the myths that have grown up about the Asbury family.
