This was costly, not attuned to the specific needs of the communities the doctors would serve, and risked the trained doctors remaining in their countries of training.\n\nThe Faculty of Medical Sciences <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://medicine.yale.edu/education/gho/yalestudents/abroad/americari/jamaica.aspx |title = Jamaica}}</ref> was the first faculty to be established in the then University College.<ref name=\"Branday\">{{cite journal |last1=Branday |first1=JM |last2=Carpenter |first2=RA |title=The Evolution of Undergraduate Medical Training at The University of the West Indies, 1948-2008 |journal=West Indian Medical Journal |date=2008 |volume=57 |issue=6 |url=https://www.mona.uwi.edu/fms/wimj/system/files/article_pdfs/branday_the_evolution_of_undergraduate_medical_training_at_the_university_of_the_west_indies_etc.pdf |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> This is because of the pressing need for more (locally trained) doctors to treat conditions such as [[tuberculosis]], [[yaws]], [[tetanus]], [[typhoid]], infant [[malnutrition]] and illnesses related to [[diarrhea]]. The establishment of medical schools in the colonies was replicated in the Gold Coast, Nigeria, Rhodesia and Uganda.<ref name=Branday /> The inaugural entering class in 1948 consisted of 33 students from across the Caribbean, selected from more than 600<ref name=\"Fraser\">{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=HS |title=The Faculties and School of Medical Sciences of The University of the West Indies at its Diamond Jubilee |journal=West Indian Medical Journal |date=2008 |volume=57 |issue=6 |url=https://www.mona.uwi.edu/fms/wimj/system/files/article_pdfs/fraser_the_faculties_and_school_of_medical_sciences_of_the_university_of_the_west_etc.pdf |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> or almost 800<ref name=Branday /> applicants. As the university college was then affiliated with the University of London, the curriculum reflected its curriculum, with the addition of preventative and tropical medicine. Degrees were awarded under the University of London name until 1962, reflective of the role the University played in administering the programme and providing the teaching staff.<ref name=Branday /> In addition to the standard five-year course, a pre-course science year was required for students without adequate preparation in that area. The University Hospital of the West Indies, an acute tertiary hospital, provided the initial context for clinical education.\n\nExpansion of the capacity of the Faculty followed several steps. In addition to population growth, the exodus of medical graduates to North America, never to return, exacerbated the need to increase the output of doctors.<ref name=Fraser /> In the 1960s, it was possible to complete the clinical clerkship element of training in Trinidad and Tobago (at the [[Port of Spain General Hospital]]) and in Barbados (at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]]), as well as in Jamaica.<ref name=Branday /> In 1989, the medical school at the St. Augustine campus opened. However, rather than adopt the 'traditional' existing curriculum at the Mona school, it adopted a problem-based approach.<ref name=Fraser /> Mona, which had already carried out some curricular reform due to World Health Organization recommendations to place greater emphasis on community health promotion and protection, and St. Augustine, had different medical school curricula, though the graduates took the same qualifying exams. Moreover, St. Augustine's Faculty of Medical Sciences included not just a School of Medicine, but also Schools of Dentistry, Veterinarian Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy, which necessitated some sharing of resources.<ref name=Branday /><ref name=Fraser /> In 2008, the clerkships in Barbados were fully developed into a medical school at the Cave Hill campus. Around the same time, the UWI School of Clinical Medicine and Research was established from an existing programme allowing clerkships to be undertaken in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], under the direction of the St. Augustine campus.<ref name=Fraser />  The School offers the final two years of the five-year programme.\n\n==== Specialist Medical Training ====\nSimilar to the general training, specialist training was progressively made available through the UWI. For example, anaesthesia was initially provided by untrained doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Initially, doctors were sent overseas for a year of post-graduate training. While the Faculty was established in 1948, the one-year post-graduate diploma in anaesthetics did not begin until 1966 at the Mona Campus. St. Augustine and Cave Hill added the diploma in 1976. However, Mona was already moving towards a four-year Doctor of Medicine Anaesthetics degree, first offered in 1974. Eventually, this more specialised degree (extended to include ''intensive care'') was extended to the other two campuses in 1984 while the one-year programme was discontinued in 1994.<ref name=\"Anaesthetics\">{{cite journal |last1=Scarlett |first1=MD |last2=Crawford-Sykes |first2=A |last3=Harding |first3=HE |last4=Chen |first4=DR |title=The Development of Postgraduate Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Training at the University of the West Indies |journal=West Indian Medical Journal |date=July 2012 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=463\u2013466 |doi=10.7727/wimj.2012.147}}</ref>\n\nWhile improvements were being made to the training of physicians as anaesthesiologists, there continued to be a shortage of trained personnel in rural areas. In Jamaica, an initiative to train nurse anaesthetists started, with nurses first sent to the US and to Cuba, followed by the establishment of the Jamaica School of Nurse Anaesthetists in 1981, which continues to this day (2019) with the Ministry of Health. This is in addition to specialised additional training for nurses in intensive care which began in 1969.<ref name=Anaesthetics />\n\n==== Dentist Training ====\nTwo of the three faculties of medical sciences offer dentistry. The St. Augustine campus was the first to offer a dental school. It opened in 1989, the first dental school in the anglophone Caribbean. The inaugural class of roughly 20 students was mostly from Trinidad and Tobago, with a couple of students each from Jamaica and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The initial curriculum was modeled on that found in the UK, with the intention to seek recognition from British authorities. It is possible to the exam for membership of the Faculty of Dental Surgery of the Edinburgh-based Royal College of Surgeons.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Naidu |first1=Rahul |last2=Ramroop |first2=Visha |last3=Rafeek |first3=Reisha |title=An Historical Overview of Dentistry in Trinidad and Tobago |journal=History in Action |date=2010 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201310 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265424273_An_Historical_Overview_of_Dentistry_in_Trinidad_and_Tobago |accessdate=2 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Accreditation ====\nStarting in 2004, the medical programmes in the Caribbean ceased to be accredited by the United Kingdom-based [[General Medical Council]], as the UK re-focussed more on integration with Europe.<ref name=Branday /> UWI was a key player in the establishment of the [[Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions]] (CAAM-HP). The three UWI medical schools are accredited together, despite differences in curriculum, and are currently accredited with conditions.<ref name=\"CAAM\">{{cite web |title=Programs |url=https://www.caam-hp.org/programs |website=Caribbean Accreditation Authority or Education in Medicine and Other Health Professions (CAAM-HP) |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> The dental school at St. Augustine is probationary accredited while the dental school at Mona has accreditation with conditions.<ref name=CAAM /> The veterinarian medical school at St. Augustine is also accredited with conditions.<ref name=CAAM /> Efforts are underway to align the curriculum and admission standards of the three medical schools.<ref name=Fraser />\n\n==== Regional Competition ====\nEven with expansion, the UWI medical schools are facing new competition. Many for-profit medical schools have been established in the Caribbean region, with the first established in [[Grenada]] in 1976.<ref name=Branday /> Generally, these schools cater to students from the United States but they sometimes offer scholarships to local students, providing an alternative to UWI programmes or going abroad for medical education [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[United States]]. The quality of these offshore medical schools differ,<ref name=Branday /> though some are accredited by the CAAM-HP.<ref name=CAAM />\n\n==== Research ====\nThe Faculty of Medicines has a research arm called the Caribbean Institute for Health Research (CAIHR), formerly the Tropical Medicine Research Institute (TMRI). The CAIHR comprises the George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research Centre, based on the Cave Hill Campus, and three units all based on the Mona Campus: the Tropical Metabolism Research Unit, the Sickle Cell Unit and the Epidemiology Research Unit.<ref name=Fraser /> Continuing medical education is provided in different ways among the various countries with the medical associations taking the lead in some countries and the medical schools in others.<ref name=Fraser />\n\n=== Faculty of Law ===\nPrior to the establishment of the Faculty of Law at the UWI, residents of the anglophone Caribbean would travel primarily to the [[United Kingdom]] to study.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law /> There, they would join an [[Inns of Court]] where they received lodging and training and underwent examinations. Naturally, the training focused on the legal system and social context of England, which was not the best foundation upon which to practice in the Caribbean.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law /> It was also an expensive endeavor. For the legal profession in England, the influx of prospective lawyers from around the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] was beginning to strain resources. Efforts were underway to limit foreign students in legal studies in England and this was another reason to establish legal training in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Faculty of Law was initially established in 1970 at the Cave Hill Campus, in [[Barbados]],<ref name=\"Barnett\">{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Lloyd |title=Report of the Review Committee on Legal Education in the Caribbean 1996 |url=http://www.clecaribbean.com/barnett.php |website=The Barnett Report |publisher=Council of Legal Education |accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref> but the first year of the degree was available at each campus (and the [[University of Guyana]] in [[Guyana]]).<ref name=\"Lazarus-Black_Law\">{{cite journal |last1=Lazarus-Black |first1=Mindie |title=After Empire: Training Lawyers as a Postcolonial Enterprise |journal=Small Axe |date=February 2008 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=38\u201356 |doi=10.1215/-12-1-38}}</ref>  This structure served, ''inter alia'', to create a regional institution (the Faculty) and a regional identity within the profession. Incrementally, courses from the second and third year of the law programmes were introduced at St. Augustine and Mona, allowing students to take more and more of the degree on those campuses, rather than having to study at Cave Hill. It is now possible to complete the law degree at each campus.<ref name=Barnett />\n\nFollowing completion of the UWI law degree, graduates who intend to practice must complete a two-year practical professional training programme at one of three law schools in the Caribbean. The [[Eugene Dupuch Law School]] in [[The Bahamas]] is normally for citizens of the Bahamas, the [[British Virgin Islands]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]. The [[Norman Manley Law School]] in [[Jamaica]] has allocated citizens from [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]], Jamaica, [[Montserrat]], and [[St. Kitts and Nevis]]. The [[Hugh Wooding Law School]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] serves Barbados, [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], Guyana, [[St. Lucia]], [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], and Trinidad and Tobago.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law /><ref name=Barnett /> The three schools were established by the Caribbean Council of Legal Education. Ironically, despite the Faculty of Law having been founded in Barbados, the country does not have a law school, though one has been mooted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Call for Barbados law school |url=http://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/175012/barbados-law-school |website=NationNews |accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first law students, beginning studies in October 1970, consisted of 24 students in Jamaica, nineteen in Trinidad and Tobago, 35 in Barbados, and thirteen Guyana.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law /> Two years later, almost 300 students were enrolled in the Faculty. The first graduates entered the profession in 1975.\n\nAccess to the Faculty of Law and to the Law Schools are controlled by the institutions. However, costs can vary depending on whether the applicant's country has paid contributory grants to the Faculty or the School. Not all countries did. Therefore, applicants from non-contributing countries would be considered after those from contributing countries and their fees would be higher.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law />\n\n=== Faculty of Sport ===\nLaunched in 2017, the UWI Faculty of Sport integrates teaching and research, professional development, community partnerships, and co- and extra-curricular student sport through three main units: Professional Programmes, Outreach & Projects Unit, Co-curricular & Intramural-Activity Unit and the Academic Programme & Activity Unit.

This was costly, not attuned to the specific needs of the communities the doctors would serve, and risked the trained doctors remaining in their countries of training.\n\nThe Faculty of Medical Sciences <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://medicine.yale.edu/education/gho/yalestudents/abroad/americari/jamaica.aspx |title = Jamaica}}</ref> was the first faculty to be established in the then University College.<ref name=\"Branday\">{{cite journal |last1=Branday |first1=JM |last2=Carpenter |first2=RA |title=The Evolution of Undergraduate Medical Training at The University of the West Indies, 1948-2008 |journal=West Indian Medical Journal |date=2008 |volume=57 |issue=6 |url=https://www.mona.uwi.edu/fms/wimj/system/files/article_pdfs/branday_the_evolution_of_undergraduate_medical_training_at_the_university_of_the_west_indies_etc.pdf |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> This is because of the pressing need for more (locally trained) doctors to treat conditions such as [[tuberculosis]], [[yaws]], [[tetanus]], [[typhoid]], infant [[malnutrition]] and illnesses related to [[diarrhea]]. The establishment of medical schools in the colonies was replicated in the Gold Coast, Nigeria, Rhodesia and Uganda.<ref name=Branday /> The inaugural entering class in 1948 consisted of 33 students from across the Caribbean, selected from more than 600<ref name=\"Fraser\">{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=HS |title=The Faculties and School of Medical Sciences of The University of the West Indies at its Diamond Jubilee |journal=West Indian Medical Journal |date=2008 |volume=57 |issue=6 |url=https://www.mona.uwi.edu/fms/wimj/system/files/article_pdfs/fraser_the_faculties_and_school_of_medical_sciences_of_the_university_of_the_west_etc.pdf |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> or almost 800<ref name=Branday /> applicants. As the university college was then affiliated with the University of London, the curriculum reflected its curriculum, with the addition of preventative and tropical medicine. Degrees were awarded under the University of London name until 1962, reflective of the role the University played in administering the programme and providing the teaching staff.<ref name=Branday /> In addition to the standard five-year course, a pre-course science year was required for students without adequate preparation in that area. The University Hospital of the West Indies, an acute tertiary hospital, provided the initial context for clinical education.\n\nExpansion of the capacity of the Faculty followed several steps. In addition to population growth, the exodus of medical graduates to North America, never to return, exacerbated the need to increase the output of doctors.<ref name=Fraser /> In the 1960s, it was possible to complete the clinical clerkship element of training in Trinidad and Tobago (at the [[Port of Spain General Hospital]]) and in Barbados (at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]]), as well as in Jamaica.<ref name=Branday /> In 1989, the medical school at the St. Augustine campus opened. However, rather than adopt the 'traditional' existing curriculum at the Mona school, it adopted a problem-based approach.<ref name=Fraser /> Mona, which had already carried out some curricular reform due to World Health Organization recommendations to place greater emphasis on community health promotion and protection, and St. Augustine, had different medical school curricula, though the graduates took the same qualifying exams. Moreover, St. Augustine's Faculty of Medical Sciences included not just a School of Medicine, but also Schools of Dentistry, Veterinarian Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy, which necessitated some sharing of resources.<ref name=Branday /><ref name=Fraser /> In 2008, the clerkships in Barbados were fully developed into a medical school at the Cave Hill campus. Around the same time, the UWI School of Clinical Medicine and Research was established from an existing programme allowing clerkships to be undertaken in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], under the direction of the St. Augustine campus.<ref name=Fraser />  The School offers the final two years of the five-year programme.\n\n==== Specialist Medical Training ====\nSimilar to the general training, specialist training was progressively made available through the UWI. For example, anaesthesia was initially provided by untrained doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Initially, doctors were sent overseas for a year of post-graduate training. While the Faculty was established in 1948, the one-year post-graduate diploma in anaesthetics did not begin until 1966 at the Mona Campus. St. Augustine and Cave Hill added the diploma in 1976. However, Mona was already moving towards a four-year Doctor of Medicine Anaesthetics degree, first offered in 1974. Eventually, this more specialised degree (extended to include ''intensive care'') was extended to the other two campuses in 1984 while the one-year programme was discontinued in 1994.<ref name=\"Anaesthetics\">{{cite journal |last1=Scarlett |first1=MD |last2=Crawford-Sykes |first2=A |last3=Harding |first3=HE |last4=Chen |first4=DR |title=The Development of Postgraduate Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Training at the University of the West Indies |journal=West Indian Medical Journal |date=July 2012 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=463\u2013466 |doi=10.7727/wimj.2012.147}}</ref>\n\nWhile improvements were being made to the training of physicians as anaesthesiologists, there continued to be a shortage of trained personnel in rural areas. In Jamaica, an initiative to train nurse anaesthetists started, with nurses first sent to the US and to Cuba, followed by the establishment of the Jamaica School of Nurse Anaesthetists in 1981, which continues to this day (2019) with the Ministry of Health. This is in addition to specialised additional training for nurses in intensive care which began in 1969.<ref name=Anaesthetics />\n\n==== Dentist Training ====\nTwo of the three faculties of medical sciences offer dentistry. The St. Augustine campus was the first to offer a dental school. It opened in 1989, the first dental school in the anglophone Caribbean. The inaugural class of roughly 20 students was mostly from Trinidad and Tobago, with a couple of students each from Jamaica and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The initial curriculum was modeled on that found in the UK, with the intention to seek recognition from British authorities. It is possible to the exam for membership of the Faculty of Dental Surgery of the Edinburgh-based Royal College of Surgeons.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Naidu |first1=Rahul |last2=Ramroop |first2=Visha |last3=Rafeek |first3=Reisha |title=An Historical Overview of Dentistry in Trinidad and Tobago |journal=History in Action |date=2010 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1-10 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265424273_An_Historical_Overview_of_Dentistry_in_Trinidad_and_Tobago |accessdate=2 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Accreditation ====\nStarting in 2004, the medical programmes in the Caribbean ceased to be accredited by the United Kingdom-based [[General Medical Council]], as the UK re-focussed more on integration with Europe.<ref name=Branday /> UWI was a key player in the establishment of the [[Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions]] (CAAM-HP). The three UWI medical schools are accredited together, despite differences in curriculum, and are currently accredited with conditions.<ref name=\"CAAM\">{{cite web |title=Programs |url=https://www.caam-hp.org/programs |website=Caribbean Accreditation Authority or Education in Medicine and Other Health Professions (CAAM-HP) |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> The dental school at St. Augustine is probationary accredited while the dental school at Mona has accreditation with conditions.<ref name=CAAM /> The veterinarian medical school at St. Augustine is also accredited with conditions.<ref name=CAAM /> Efforts are underway to align the curriculum and admission standards of the three medical schools.<ref name=Fraser />\n\n==== Regional Competition ====\nEven with expansion, the UWI medical schools are facing new competition. Many for-profit medical schools have been established in the Caribbean region, with the first established in [[Grenada]] in 1976.<ref name=Branday /> Generally, these schools cater to students from the United States but they sometimes offer scholarships to local students, providing an alternative to UWI programmes or going abroad for medical education [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[United States]]. The quality of these offshore medical schools differ,<ref name=Branday /> though some are accredited by the CAAM-HP.<ref name=CAAM />\n\n==== Research ====\nThe Faculty of Medicines has a research arm called the Caribbean Institute for Health Research (CAIHR), formerly the Tropical Medicine Research Institute (TMRI). The CAIHR comprises the George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research Centre, based on the Cave Hill Campus, and three units all based on the Mona Campus: the Tropical Metabolism Research Unit, the Sickle Cell Unit and the Epidemiology Research Unit.<ref name=Fraser /> Continuing medical education is provided in different ways among the various countries with the medical associations taking the lead in some countries and the medical schools in others.<ref name=Fraser />\n\n=== Faculty of Law ===\nPrior to the establishment of the Faculty of Law at the UWI, residents of the anglophone Caribbean would travel primarily to the [[United Kingdom]] to study.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law /> There, they would join an [[Inns of Court]] where they received lodging and training and underwent examinations. Naturally, the training focused on the legal system and social context of England, which was not the best foundation upon which to practice in the Caribbean.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law /> It was also an expensive endeavor. For the legal profession in England, the influx of prospective lawyers from around the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] was beginning to strain resources. Efforts were underway to limit foreign students in legal studies in England and this was another reason to establish legal training in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Faculty of Law was initially established in 1970 at the Cave Hill Campus, in [[Barbados]],<ref name=\"Barnett\">{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Lloyd |title=Report of the Review Committee on Legal Education in the Caribbean 1996 |url=http://www.clecaribbean.com/barnett.php |website=The Barnett Report |publisher=Council of Legal Education |accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref> but the first year of the degree was available at each campus (and the [[University of Guyana]] in [[Guyana]]).<ref name=\"Lazarus-Black_Law\">{{cite journal |last1=Lazarus-Black |first1=Mindie |title=After Empire: Training Lawyers as a Postcolonial Enterprise |journal=Small Axe |date=February 2008 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=38\u201356 |doi=10.1215/-12-1-38}}</ref>  This structure served, ''inter alia'', to create a regional institution (the Faculty) and a regional identity within the profession. Incrementally, courses from the second and third year of the law programmes were introduced at St. Augustine and Mona, allowing students to take more and more of the degree on those campuses, rather than having to study at Cave Hill. It is now possible to complete the law degree at each campus.<ref name=Barnett />\n\nFollowing completion of the UWI law degree, graduates who intend to practice must complete a two-year practical professional training programme at one of three law schools in the Caribbean. The [[Eugene Dupuch Law School]] in [[The Bahamas]] is normally for citizens of the Bahamas, the [[British Virgin Islands]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]. The [[Norman Manley Law School]] in [[Jamaica]] has allocated citizens from [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]], Jamaica, [[Montserrat]], and [[St. Kitts and Nevis]]. The [[Hugh Wooding Law School]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] serves Barbados, [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], Guyana, [[St. Lucia]], [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], and Trinidad and Tobago.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law /><ref name=Barnett /> The three schools were established by the Caribbean Council of Legal Education. Ironically, despite the Faculty of Law having been founded in Barbados, the country does not have a law school, though one has been mooted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Call for Barbados law school |url=http://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/175012/barbados-law-school |website=NationNews |accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first law students, beginning studies in October 1970, consisted of 24 students in Jamaica, nineteen in Trinidad and Tobago, 35 in Barbados, and thirteen Guyana.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law /> Two years later, almost 300 students were enrolled in the Faculty. The first graduates entered the profession in 1975.\n\nAccess to the Faculty of Law and to the Law Schools are controlled by the institutions. However, costs can vary depending on whether the applicant's country has paid contributory grants to the Faculty or the School. Not all countries did. Therefore, applicants from non-contributing countries would be considered after those from contributing countries and their fees would be higher.<ref name=Lazarus-Black_Law />\n\n=== Faculty of Sport ===\nLaunched in 2017, the UWI Faculty of Sport integrates teaching and research, professional development, community partnerships, and co- and extra-curricular student sport through three main units: Professional Programmes, Outreach & Projects Unit, Co-curricular & Intramural-Activity Unit and the Academic Programme & Activity Unit.

The origin of the University of the Visual and Performing Arts can be traced back to 1893, the era in which the Ceylon Technical College was established. Among the first courses to be taught at the college were Drawing and Painting.  On 1 October 1949, the Department of Drawing and Painting moved from the Technical College at [[Maradana]] to the \u2018Heywood\u2019 building at Horton place and was subsequently renamed as the \u2018School of Art\u2019. A diploma in Fine Arts was awarded to students upon the completion of five years of study. Prominent painter and teacher J.D.A. Perera was the first  Principal of this institution.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/050626/plus/11.html</ref>\n\nOn 2 July 1952,  Music and Dance were included in to the curriculum  and the institute became named as the \u2018Government College of Fine Arts\u2019. On 1 October 1953,  the Departments of Music and Dance were moved to  21, Albert Crescent in Colombo 7, while the Art and Sculpture courses continued to be conducted at the \u2018Heywood\u2019 Building. Three years after this, in 1956, this institution was once again renamed as the \u2018National Institute of Arts\u2019and it was taken under the purview of Ministry of Education and converted into three schools, namely, School of Art and sculpture, School of Music and School of Dancing and Ballet. All  schools came under the administration of Dr. Stanley Abeysinghe, Dr. [[Lionel Edirisinghe]] and Dr. S. Panibharatha respectively.\n\nAs a result of the first university Act of 1972, the institution became known as  the Institute of Aesthetic studies and got affiliated to the [[University of Ceylon]] in 1974. The Institute had 03 Schools and an Academy, namely : School of Art and Sculpture, School of Music and School of Dancing and Ballet, and the Ramanathan  Academy of Jaffna. In 1975, the Ramanathan Academy became affiliated with the [[University of Jaffna]].\n\nFor the first time, in 1978, 63 students were awarded the\u2019 Bachelor of Arts\u2019 degree.  Consequently, the restructuring of the University System in Sri Lanka brought about the affiliation of this Institute to the [http://www.kln.ac.lk University of Kelaniya] in 1980.\n\n===University status ===\nThe special Gazette notice issued by her Excellency the [[President of Sri Lanka]] formally announced the establishment  of the University of Visual and Performing Arts with effect from 1 July 2005. This University was founded in order to promote and develop the [[Visual]] and [[Creative Arts]] as well as to offer recognized higher educational qualifications in these spheres of study. The President appointed Dr. [[Lester James Peiris]] and Professor Sarath Amunugama as the first Chancellor and Vice Chancellor respectively. The University consists of three faculties, Dance and Drama, Music and Visual Arts and Jayasena Kottagoda, Sanath Nandasiri and Sarath Gunasiri Perera were elected as the first Deans of the faculties respectively.\n\n===21st century===\nThere are 22 departments functioning under these three faculties. The present Chancellor of the university is Pandith [[W. D. Amaradeva]] and the Vice Chancellor is Jayasena Kottagoda, the first Vice Chancellor who is a former student of this institution. They were elected in to office in 2008. Currently, in his second term as Vice Chancellor to the UVPA, Kottagoda was also the first Professor, Senior Professor of this university apart from holding the post of the initial Dean of the Faculty of Dance and Drama.\n\n==Governance and administration==\n\nThe University of the Visual and Performing Arts is a [[public university|state university]] and depends on the government for much of its annual grant, which is provided by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC). Due to this, its administration is heavily influenced by the UGC. Undergraduate education is completely free. The Governance of the university is under the provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 1985 along with its own by-laws.\n\nThe university's administration is based upon that of the former [[University of Ceylon]] consisting of a dual structure of bodies: the Council (formally known as the [[University Court]] which is the governing body) and the [[Academic Senate]] (academic affairs).\n\nMuch of the appointments to officers and faculty are carried out by these bodies, however on the recommendations of the UGC.\n\n===Officers of the university===\n;Chancellor\nThe [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] is the head of the university and awards all [[academic degree|degrees]], although most duties are carried out by the Vice-Chancellor. The appointment is made by the [[President of Sri Lanka]], to a distinguished person in academics, clergy or in the civil society. The chancellor is Prof. Sanath Nandasiri.\n\n;Vice-Chancellor\nDay-to-day management of the University is undertaken by the [[Chancellor (education)#Vice Chancellor|Vice-Chancellor]], appointed by the [[President of Sri Lanka]].

The origin of the University of the Visual and Performing Arts can be traced back to 1893, the era in which the Ceylon Technical College was established. Among the first courses to be taught at the college were Drawing and Painting.  On 1 October 1949, the Department of Drawing and Painting moved from the Technical College at [[Maradana]] to the \u2018Heywood\u2019 building at Horton place and was subsequently renamed as the \u2018School of Art\u2019. A diploma in Fine Arts was awarded to students upon the completion of five years of study. Prominent painter and teacher J.D.A. Perera was the first  Principal of this institution.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/050626/plus/11.html</ref>\n\nOn 2 July 1952,  Music and Dance were included in to the curriculum  and the institute became named as the \u2018Government College of Fine Arts\u2019. On 1 October 1953,  the Departments of Music and Dance were moved to  21, Albert Crescent in Colombo 7, while the Art and Sculpture courses continued to be conducted at the \u2018Heywood\u2019 Building. Three years after this, in 1956, this institution was once again renamed as the \u2018National Institute of Arts\u2019and it was taken under the purview of Ministry of Education and converted into three schools, namely, School of Art and sculpture, School of Music and School of Dancing and Ballet. All  schools came under the administration of Dr. Stanley Abeysinghe, Dr. [[Lionel Edirisinghe]] and Dr. S. Panibharatha respectively.\n\nAs a result of the first university Act of 1972, the institution became known as  the Institute of Aesthetic studies and got affiliated to the [[University of Ceylon]] in 1974. The Institute had 03 Schools and an Academy, namely : School of Art and Sculpture, School of Music and School of Dancing and Ballet, and the Ramanathan  Academy of Jaffna. In 1975, the Ramanathan Academy became affiliated with the [[University of Jaffna]].\n\nFor the first time, in 1978, 63 students were awarded the\u2019 Bachelor of Arts\u2019 degree.  Consequently, the restructuring of the University System in Sri Lanka brought about the affiliation of this Institute to the [http://www.kln.ac.lk University of Kelaniya] in 1980.\n\n===University status ===\nThe special Gazette notice issued by her Excellency the [[President of Sri Lanka]] formally announced the establishment  of the University of Visual and Performing Arts with effect from 1 July 2005. This University was founded in order to promote and develop the [[Visual]] and [[Creative Arts]] as well as to offer recognized higher educational qualifications in these spheres of study. The President appointed Dr. [[Lester James Peiris]] and Professor Sarath Amunugama as the first Chancellor and Vice Chancellor respectively. The University consists of three faculties, Dance and Drama, Music and Visual Arts and Jayasena Kottagoda, Sanath Nandasiri and Sarath Gunasiri Perera were elected as the first Deans of the faculties respectively.\n\n===21st century===\nThere are 22 departments functioning under these three faculties. The present Chancellor of the university is Pandith [[W. D. Amaradeva]] and the Vice Chancellor is Jayasena Kottagoda, the first Vice Chancellor who is a former student of this institution. They were elected in to office in 2008. Currently, in his second term as Vice Chancellor to the UVPA, Kottagoda was also the first Professor, Senior Professor of this university apart from holding the post of the initial Dean of the Faculty of Dance and Drama.\n\n==Governance and administration==\n\nThe University of the Visual and Performing Arts is a [[public university|state university]] and depends on the government for much of its annual grant, which is provided by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC). Due to this, its administration is heavily influenced by the UGC. Undergraduate education is completely free. The Governance of the university is under the provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 1985 along with its own by-laws.\n\nThe university's administration is based upon that of the former [[University of Ceylon]] consisting of a dual structure of bodies: the Council (formally known as the [[University Court]] which is the governing body) and the [[Academic Senate]] (academic affairs).\n\nMuch of the appointments to officers and faculty are carried out by these bodies, however on the recommendations of the UGC.\n\n===Officers of the university===\n;Chancellor\nThe [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] is the head of the university and awards all [[academic degree|degrees]], although most duties are carried out by the Vice-Chancellor. The appointment is made by the [[President of Sri Lanka]], to a distinguished person in academics, clergy or in the civil society. The chancellor is Prof. Sanath Nandasiri.\n\n;Vice-Chancellor\nDay-to-day management of the University is undertaken by the [[Chancellor (education)#Vice Chancellor|Vice-Chancellor]], appointed by the [[President of Sri Lanka]].

He later spent ten years as owner and general manager of professional American football teams, and two years as owner and general manager of English [[association football]] club [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] from 1999 to 2001, including a spell as manager during part of his ownership.\n\n==Collegiate career==\nSmith attended [[Cornell University]] for two years, where he played [[Cornell Big Red football|football]] at wide receiver and free safety and [[Cornell Big Red baseball|baseball]] at shortstop and second base. He then transferred to [[Furman University]], where he played football, baseball, and ran track, becoming the only Furman athlete for the past 50 years to play and letter in three sports. In [[Furman Paladins football|football]], he started at free safety for two years on two Southern Conference Championship Furman teams, leading all defensive backs with more than 150 tackles in two seasons and being selected to the Academic All-Southern Conference and All-Region teams. In baseball, he started for two seasons in centerfield, hitting .414 in 1982, the 5th highest single season batting average in Furman history, and he was selected first-team All-Southern Conference and MVP. He finished his career with a .363 career batting average, which is still the second-highest career batting average in Furman history, and the highest career Furman average for the past sixty years. He also stole 29 bases out of 31 attempts, giving him the highest career success rate for steals in Furman history for any player who has attempted more than 10 attempts. In track, he ran the 100 meter, 200 meter, and 400 meter, and he also ran the 4x100, 4x200, and 4x400 relays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/terry-smith-9.html|title=Terry Smith College Stats|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"shannon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.furmanpaladins.com/sports/c-track/2015-16/bios/smith_shannon_aitm?view=bio|title=Shannon Smith - Furman|publisher=Furman University|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/furm/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/SeasonCareerStatLeaders.pdf|title=2008 Furman Baseball The Record Book / Annual Statistical Leaders|publisher=Furman University|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==American football==\n===Professional career===\nSmith started his professional American football career in 1982.

He then went on to sign for the Arizona Wranglers in the USFL, and in professional baseball was invited to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds and signed with the Miami Marlins.\n\n===Coaching career===\nAfter coaching in various U.S. Colleges as a Defensive Coordinator, Smith went to Great Britain because he was signed as the player-head coach of the [[Manchester Spartans]]. Due to his high level of success, which included turning around a 2-10 team into an all-time British and European record 14-0 undefeated team in his first season, then he was chosen by the Great Britain National Governing Body as the head coach of the National Team [[Great Britain national American football team]]. As a wide receiver and free safety, Smith set many playing records, including setting the League and National British record for pass interceptions in a season with 14, and setting the League and National record for pass receptions in a game with 15. He had several 1,000 yard pass receiving seasons, led Europe in receiving yards, and he was named to the All-European Team on several occasions. As a head coach, he won three straight Division Championships, three straight Conference Championships, two straight National Championships, and two straight European Championships, one European Championship with the Manchester Spartans, and one European Championship with the Great Britain National Team. No British team had ever won a single game in European competition until Smith arrived. After leading the Spartans to the National Championship in order to qualify for the European Championships, Smith led the Spartans to victories over Dublin, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Milan, to win the EuroBowl European Championship.  With the Great Britain National Team, Smith led Great Britain to victories over the Netherlands, Germany, and Finland by a combined score of 99-6 to win the European Nations Championship. These were the first two European Championships in British American football history.\n\nSmith is the only coach in European history to have won both of these European Championships. He won more than 100 games in total as a head coach, while losing only 15. Due to his coaching success, Smith was selected as the National Coach of the Year three straight times, and as the European Coach of the Year twice. In addition, due to his playing and coaching success, Smith was selected to the Great Britain American Football Hall of Fame in 2004, and to the U.S. Minor Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\n==Team ownership and management of Chester City==\nSmith went on to become the owner of several professional sports teams, including the European Champion Spartans. In addition, he became the first American owner, chairman, and chief executive in the history of professional English League and European football. Americans have since gone on to own several of the European professional football teams, including English teams Manchester United and Liverpool, but Smith initiated American ownership by becoming the first American to have a vision of the opportunity and to purchase a team. In July 1999, he bought financially struggling English League club [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]], a club that was financially insolvent and being run by an administrator. He declared his belief that the club could reach [[Football League First Division|Division One]] (now the [[EFL Championship]]) within three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chester/1488938.stm|title=The great Chester soap opera|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 February 2011|date=13 August 2001}}</ref> The club was in administration when he took over, and close to folding with more than \u00a31 million in debt, and almost all the veteran players already sold to other clubs in order to pay club bills to keep the club from going out of business. He was credited with rescuing Chester from the brink of bankruptcy by supporters at the time, and announced an intention to appoint three supporters to the club board of directors, which he did.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/dec/05/match.sport8|title=Survival spirit from Mr Smith|work=[[The Observer]]|last=Buckley|first=Will|authorlink=Will Buckley (journalist)|date=6 December 1999|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nManager [[Kevin Ratcliffe]] quit the job four games into the season with the team at the bottom of the table, having not scored a goal yet in the league, attempting to claim \u00a3350,000 from a previously unknown contract that the administrator had not even known existed, an alleged contract that supposedly allowed him to resign by his own choice and still be paid this amount that was equal to more than six years of his managerial salary as a golden parachute severance payment. This made the financial situation even more difficult. With the club already in large debt and losing hundreds of thousands of [[Pound sterling|pounds]] every year, and now with an additional large financial severance claim by the ex-manager, then it was not possible to even consider hiring a new manager, and so Smith put together a plan to utilize the assistant coaches that were already in place.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/rocky-ride-for-white-knight-of-chester-742598.html|title=Rocky ride for white knight of Chester|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 February 2011|date=6 October 1999|first=Guy|last=Hodgson}}</ref> Despite by his own admission having little knowledge of football, Smith appointed himself as the leader of a five-man coaching team, in the role of team manager.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/supporters-fear-for-americans-chester-dream-683471.html|title=Supporters fear for American's Chester dream|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 February 2011|date=3 May 2001|first=David|last=Conn|authorlink=David Conn}}</ref> He took over with almost all young players left in the squad, after almost all of the veteran players had been sold during the administration period in order to stay in business. He kept these young players and tried to develop them in order to keep the player wages low, so that the club could not only balance the budget for that season, but also so they could try to pay off the \u00a31 million of debt.\n\nUsing this low budget strategy, along with increasing revenue through moderate Cup runs in the [[FA Cup]] and the [[EFL Cup|Worthington Cup]], and with increased attendance and commercial advertising, Smith was able to get all the club's debts paid off within only six months, which was two years earlier than the administration required, and the club was out of debt for the first time in at least many decades, possibly in history.\n\nIn Smith's four months in charge of team affairs, Chester had some wins against [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] and others, but lost 5\u20131 and 4\u20131 to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] and [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] respectively, and required a replay to overcome non-league minnows [[Whyteleafe F.C.|Whyteleafe]] in the [[FA Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=663&season_id=138&teamTabs=results#teamTabs=results|title=Chester 1999/00|publisher=Centurycomm|work=[[Soccerbase]]|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref> However, they did find success in the Worthington Cup, beating First Division [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] 6\u20135 on aggregate. During the tie, they won 2\u20131 at the [[Deva Stadium]] in a game which saw both [[Marcus Bent]] and [[Martyn Lancaster]] sent off, and then drew 4\u20134 in the return leg at [[Vale Park]].

He later spent ten years as owner and general manager of professional American football teams, and two years as owner and general manager of English [[association football]] club [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] from 1999 to 2001, including a spell as manager during part of his ownership.\n\n==Collegiate career==\nSmith attended [[Cornell University]] for two years, where he played [[Cornell Big Red football|football]] at wide receiver and free safety and [[Cornell Big Red baseball|baseball]] at shortstop and second base. He then transferred to [[Furman University]], where he played football, baseball, and ran track, becoming the only Furman athlete for the past 50 years to play and letter in three sports. In [[Furman Paladins football|football]], he started at free safety for two years on two Southern Conference Championship Furman teams, leading all defensive backs with more than 150 tackles in two seasons and being selected to the Academic All-Southern Conference and All-Region teams. In baseball, he started for two seasons in centerfield, hitting .414 in 1982, the 5th highest single season batting average in Furman history, and he was selected first-team All-Southern Conference and MVP. He finished his career with a .363 career batting average, which is still the second-highest career batting average in Furman history, and the highest career Furman average for the past sixty years. He also stole 29 bases out of 31 attempts, giving him the highest career success rate for steals in Furman history for any player who has attempted more than 10 attempts. In track, he ran the 100 meter, 200 meter, and 400 meter, and he also ran the 4x100, 4x200, and 4x400 relays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/terry-smith-9.html|title=Terry Smith College Stats|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"shannon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.furmanpaladins.com/sports/c-track/2015-16/bios/smith_shannon_aitm?view=bio|title=Shannon Smith - Furman|publisher=Furman University|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/furm/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/SeasonCareerStatLeaders.pdf|title=2008 Furman Baseball The Record Book / Annual Statistical Leaders|publisher=Furman University|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==American football==\n===Professional career===\nSmith started his professional American football career in 1982.

He then went on to sign for the Arizona Wranglers in the USFL, and in professional baseball was invited to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds and signed with the Miami Marlins.\n\n===Coaching career===\nAfter coaching in various U.S. Colleges as a Defensive Coordinator, Smith went to Great Britain because he was signed as the player-head coach of the [[Manchester Spartans]]. Due to his high level of success, which included turning around a 2-10 team into an all-time British and European record 14-0 undefeated team in his first season, then he was chosen by the Great Britain National Governing Body as the head coach of the National Team [[Great Britain national American football team]]. As a wide receiver and free safety, Smith set many playing records, including setting the League and National British record for pass interceptions in a season with 14, and setting the League and National record for pass receptions in a game with 15. He had several 1,000 yard pass receiving seasons, led Europe in receiving yards, and he was named to the All-European Team on several occasions. As a head coach, he won three straight Division Championships, three straight Conference Championships, two straight National Championships, and two straight European Championships, one European Championship with the Manchester Spartans, and one European Championship with the Great Britain National Team. No British team had ever won a single game in European competition until Smith arrived. After leading the Spartans to the National Championship in order to qualify for the European Championships, Smith led the Spartans to victories over Dublin, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Milan, to win the EuroBowl European Championship.  With the Great Britain National Team, Smith led Great Britain to victories over the Netherlands, Germany, and Finland by a combined score of 99-6 to win the European Nations Championship. These were the first two European Championships in British American football history.\n\nSmith is the only coach in European history to have won both of these European Championships. He won more than 100 games in total as a head coach, while losing only 15. Due to his coaching success, Smith was selected as the National Coach of the Year three straight times, and as the European Coach of the Year twice. In addition, due to his playing and coaching success, Smith was selected to the Great Britain American Football Hall of Fame in 2004, and to the U.S. Minor Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\n==Team ownership and management of Chester City==\nSmith went on to become the owner of several professional sports teams, including the European Champion Spartans. In addition, he became the first American owner, chairman, and chief executive in the history of professional English League and European football. Americans have since gone on to own several of the European professional football teams, including English teams Manchester United and Liverpool, but Smith initiated American ownership by becoming the first American to have a vision of the opportunity and to purchase a team. In July 1999, he bought financially struggling English League club [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]], a club that was financially insolvent and being run by an administrator. He declared his belief that the club could reach [[Football League First Division|Division One]] (now the [[EFL Championship]]) within three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chester/1488938.stm|title=The great Chester soap opera|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 February 2011|date=13 August 2001}}</ref> The club was in administration when he took over, and close to folding with more than \u00a31 million in debt, and almost all the veteran players already sold to other clubs in order to pay club bills to keep the club from going out of business.

This made the financial situation even more difficult. With the club already in large debt and losing hundreds of thousands of [[Pound sterling|pounds]] every year, and now with an additional large financial severance claim by the ex-manager, then it was not possible to even consider hiring a new manager, and so Smith put together a plan to utilize the assistant coaches that were already in place.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/rocky-ride-for-white-knight-of-chester-742598.html|title=Rocky ride for white knight of Chester|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 February 2011|date=6 October 1999|first=Guy|last=Hodgson}}</ref> Despite by his own admission having little knowledge of football, Smith appointed himself as the leader of a five-man coaching team, in the role of team manager.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/supporters-fear-for-americans-chester-dream-683471.html|title=Supporters fear for American's Chester dream|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 February 2011|date=3 May 2001|first=David|last=Conn|authorlink=David Conn}}</ref> He took over with almost all young players left in the squad, after almost all of the veteran players had been sold during the administration period in order to stay in business. He kept these young players and tried to develop them in order to keep the player wages low, so that the club could not only balance the budget for that season, but also so they could try to pay off the \u00a31 million of debt.\n\nUsing this low budget strategy, along with increasing revenue through moderate Cup runs in the [[FA Cup]] and the [[EFL Cup|Worthington Cup]], and with increased attendance and commercial advertising, Smith was able to get all the club's debts paid off within only six months, which was two years earlier than the administration required, and the club was out of debt for the first time in at least many decades, possibly in history.\n\nIn Smith's four months in charge of team affairs, Chester had some wins against [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] and others, but lost 5\u20131 and 4\u20131 to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] and [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] respectively, and required a replay to overcome non-league minnows [[Whyteleafe F.C.|Whyteleafe]] in the [[FA Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=663&season_id=138&teamTabs=results#teamTabs=results|title=Chester 1999/00|publisher=Centurycomm|work=[[Soccerbase]]|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref> However, they did find success in the Worthington Cup, beating First Division [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] 6\u20135 on aggregate.

McCandless is the subject of ''[[Into the Wild (book)|Into the Wild]]'', a nonfiction book by [[Jon Krakauer]] that was later made into [[Into the Wild (film)|a full-length feature film]].\n\nAfter graduating from college in 1990, McCandless traveled across North America and eventually hitchhiked to [[Alaska]] in April 1992. There, he set out along an old mining road known as the [[Stampede Trail]] with minimal supplies, hoping to [[Simple living|live simply]] off the land. On the eastern bank of the Sushana River, McCandless found an abandoned bus, [[Stampede_Trail#Bus_142|Fairbanks Bus 142]], which he used as a makeshift shelter until his death. In September, his [[human decomposition|decomposing]] body, weighing only 67 pounds (30 kilograms), was found by a hunter inside the bus. McCandless's cause of death was officially ruled to be [[starvation]],<ref name=\"Terra Incognita films\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> although the exact cause remains the subject of some debate.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Krakauer2013\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn January 1993, Jon Krakauer published McCandless' story in that month's issue of ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine. He had been assigned the story and had written it under a tight deadline.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Krakauer, Jon |url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-chris-mccandless-died |title=How Chris McCandless Died |date=September 12, 2013 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Inspired by the details of McCandless' story, he wrote and published the more extensive biographical book ''Into the Wild'' in 1996. The book was subsequently adapted into a 2007 [[Into the Wild (film)|film]] directed by [[Sean Penn]], with [[Emile Hirsch]] portraying McCandless. That same year, McCandless' story also became the subject of [[Ron Lamothe]]'s documentary ''[[The Call of the Wild (2007 film)|The Call of the Wild]]'' (2007).\n\n==Early life==\nChristopher Johnson McCandless was born in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], [[California]]. He was the first child of Wilhelmina \"Billie\" McCandless (n\u00e9e Johnson) and Walter \"Walt\" McCandless. Afterwards the couple had one more child, a daughter named Carine. McCandless also had six half-siblings from Walt's first marriage, who lived with their mother in California. Author [[Jon Krakauer]] later speculated that Walt's transition between these two marriages affected McCandless deeply and shaped his [[worldview]].<ref name=\"Krakauer 1997\">{{Cite book |last=Krakauer |first=Jon |title=[[Into the Wild (book)|Into The Wild]] |publisher=Anchor |year=1997 |isbn=0-385-48680-4 |location=[[New York City]] |author-link=Jon Krakauer}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the family relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]], and settled in suburban [[Annandale, Virginia|Annandale]], [[Virginia]], when McCandless' father was hired as an antenna specialist for the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA); McCandless' mother worked as a secretary at [[Hughes Aircraft]]. The couple went on to establish a successful consultancy business out of their home, specializing in Walt's area of expertise.\n\nMcCandless graduated from [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School|W.T.

It was during this journey he learned that his father had not yet divorced his first wife when McCandless and his sister Carine were born, and had apparently maintained somewhat of a [[double life]] before the move to Virginia. It is speculated that this discovery had a profound impact on the younger McCandless.<ref name=\"Krakauer 1997 166\">{{Cite book |last=Krakauer |first=Jon |title=[[Into the Wild (book)|Into The Wild]] |publisher=Anchor |year=1997 |isbn=0-385-48680-4 |location=[[New York City]] |page=166 |author-link=Jon Krakauer}}</ref>\n\nMcCandless graduated from [[Emory University]] in May 1990, with a [[bachelor's degree]] in the double majors of [[history]] and [[anthropology]].<ref name=\"Krakauer\" /> After graduating, he donated his college savings of $24,000 to [[OXFAM]] and adopted a [[vagabond]] lifestyle, working when necessary as a restaurant food preparer and farm hand.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McCandless |first=Carine |title=The Wild Truth |date=2014 |publisher=Harper One |isbn=978-0-06-232514-3 |location=New York City}}</ref> An avid [[outdoorsman]], McCandless completed several lengthy wilderness hiking trips and paddled a canoe down a portion of the [[Colorado River]] before hitchhiking to [[Alaska]] in April 1992.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Krakauer |first=Jon |url=https://archive.org/details/intowild00krak_1/page/5 |title=Into the Wild |date=1996 |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0-679-42850-X |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/intowild00krak_1/page/5 5, 32\u201336]}}</ref>\n\n==Travels==\nBy the end of summer in 1990, McCandless had driven his [[Datsun]] through California, [[Arizona]], and [[South Dakota]], where he worked at a [[grain elevator]] in [[Carthage, South Dakota|Carthage]]. A [[flash flood]] disabled his car, at which point he removed its license plates, took what he could carry, and kept moving on foot. His car was later found, repaired, and put into service as an undercover vehicle for the local police department.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Krakauer |first=Jon |title=Into the Wild |date=1996 |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0-385-48680-4 |location=New York |pages=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===Alaska===\nIn April 1992, McCandless [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] from South Dakota to [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]. He was last seen alive at the head of the [[Stampede Trail]] on April 28 by a local electrician named Jim Gallien, who had given McCandless a ride from Fairbanks to the start of the rugged track just outside the small town of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]]. Gallien later said he had been seriously concerned about the safety of McCandless (who introduced himself as \"Alex\") after noticing his light pack, minimal equipment, meager rations, and obvious lack of experience. Gallien said he had deep doubts about \"Alex's\" ability to survive the harsh and unforgiving [[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaskan bush]].\n\nGallien tried repeatedly to persuade McCandless to delay the trip, at one point offering to detour to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and buy him suitable equipment and supplies. However, McCandless ignored Gallien's persistent warnings and refused his offers of assistance (though McCandless did accept a pair of [[Xtratuf]]s, two sandwiches, and a packet of corn chips from Gallien). Gallien dropped McCandless off believing he would head back towards the highway within a few days as hunger set in.<ref name=\"Krakauer 1997\" />\n\nAfter hiking along the snow-covered [[Stampede Trail]], McCandless came upon an [[Stampede Trail#Bus 142|abandoned bus]] (about {{convert|28|mi|km}} west of Healy at {{coord|63|52|5.96|N|149|46|8.39|W|display=inline}}) alongside an overgrown section of the trail near [[Denali National Park]]. McCandless, according to ''Into the Wild'', attempted to continue \"heading west until I hit the [[Bering Sea]].\" However, he was deterred by the thick Alaskan bush and returned to the bus, where he set up camp and attempted to live off the land. He had {{convert|4.5|kg|lb}} of rice, a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] semi-automatic rifle with 400 rounds of [[.22 Long Rifle|.22LR]] [[hollowpoint]] ammunition, a number of books, including one on local plant life, some personal effects, and a few items of camping equipment. Self-portrait photographs and journal entries indicate he foraged for edible plants and hunted game. McCandless hunted [[porcupine]]s, [[squirrel]]s, and birds, such as [[White-tailed Ptarmigan|ptarmigan]]s and [[Canada geese]]. On June 9, 1992, he stalked and shot a [[moose]]. However, the meat spoiled within days after McCandless failed to properly preserve it.\n\nIt has been speculated that McCandless may have been responsible for [[vandalism|vandalizing]] several cabins in the area that were stocked with food, survival equipment, and emergency supplies. In response, Denali National Park Chief Ranger Ken Kehrer has categorically stated that McCandless was not considered a viable suspect by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>''Into the Wild'', page 197</ref>\n\nMcCandless' journal documents 113 days in the area. In July, after living in the bus for a little over two months, he decided to head back to civilization &ndash; but the trail was blocked by the swollen [[Teklanika River]]; the watercourse by that stage was considerably higher and swifter than when he had crossed in April. McCandless did not have a detailed [[topography|topographical]] map of the region and was unaware of a hand-operated [[tramway (industrial)|tramway]] that crossed the river a quarter-mile away from where he had previously crossed.<ref name=\"Krakauer\" /> At this point, McCandless headed back to the bus and re-established his camp.

Swainsonine inhibits [[metabolism]] of [[glycoprotein]]s, which causes starvation despite ample caloric intake.<ref name=Krakauer2013/>\n\nHowever, in an article in the September 2007 issue of ''[[Men's Journal]]'', Matthew Powers states that extensive laboratory testing showed there were no toxins or alkaloids present in the ''H. alpinum'' seeds McCandless had been eating.

He was last seen alive at the head of the [[Stampede Trail]] on April 28 by a local electrician named Jim Gallien, who had given McCandless a ride from Fairbanks to the start of the rugged track just outside the small town of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]]. Gallien later said he had been seriously concerned about the safety of McCandless (who introduced himself as \"Alex\") after noticing his light pack, minimal equipment, meager rations, and obvious lack of experience. Gallien said he had deep doubts about \"Alex's\" ability to survive the harsh and unforgiving [[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaskan bush]].\n\nGallien tried repeatedly to persuade McCandless to delay the trip, at one point offering to detour to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and buy him suitable equipment and supplies. However, McCandless ignored Gallien's persistent warnings and refused his offers of assistance (though McCandless did accept a pair of [[Xtratuf]]s, two sandwiches, and a packet of corn chips from Gallien). Gallien dropped McCandless off believing he would head back towards the highway within a few days as hunger set in.<ref name=\"Krakauer 1997\" />\n\nAfter hiking along the snow-covered [[Stampede Trail]], McCandless came upon an [[Stampede Trail#Bus 142|abandoned bus]] (about {{convert|28|mi|km}} west of Healy at {{coord|63|52|5.96|N|149|46|8.39|W|display=inline}}) alongside an overgrown section of the trail near [[Denali National Park]]. McCandless, according to ''Into the Wild'', attempted to continue \"heading west until I hit the [[Bering Sea]].\" However, he was deterred by the thick Alaskan bush and returned to the bus, where he set up camp and attempted to live off the land. He had {{convert|4.5|kg|lb}} of rice, a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] semi-automatic rifle with 400 rounds of [[.22 Long Rifle|.22LR]] [[hollowpoint]] ammunition, a number of books, including one on local plant life, some personal effects, and a few items of camping equipment. Self-portrait photographs and journal entries indicate he foraged for edible plants and hunted game. McCandless hunted [[porcupine]]s, [[squirrel]]s, and birds, such as [[White-tailed Ptarmigan|ptarmigan]]s and [[Canada geese]]. On June 9, 1992, he stalked and shot a [[moose]]. However, the meat spoiled within days after McCandless failed to properly preserve it.\n\nIt has been speculated that McCandless may have been responsible for [[vandalism|vandalizing]] several cabins in the area that were stocked with food, survival equipment, and emergency supplies. In response, Denali National Park Chief Ranger Ken Kehrer has categorically stated that McCandless was not considered a viable suspect by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>''Into the Wild'', page 197</ref>\n\nMcCandless' journal documents 113 days in the area. In July, after living in the bus for a little over two months, he decided to head back to civilization &ndash; but the trail was blocked by the swollen [[Teklanika River]]; the watercourse by that stage was considerably higher and swifter than when he had crossed in April. McCandless did not have a detailed [[topography|topographical]] map of the region and was unaware of a hand-operated [[tramway (industrial)|tramway]] that crossed the river a quarter-mile away from where he had previously crossed.<ref name=\"Krakauer\" /> At this point, McCandless headed back to the bus and re-established his camp. He posted an [[SOS|S.O.S.]] note on the bus, which stated: {{quote|Attention Possible Visitors. S.O.S. I need your help. I am injured, near death, and too weak to hike out.

First, he offered that McCandless was running the risk of a phenomenon known as \"[[rabbit starvation]]\", from overrelying on lean game for nutrition.<ref>''Into the Wild'', page 188</ref> Krakauer also speculated<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-chris-mccandless-died |title=How Chris McCandless Died |last=Krakauer |first=Jon |date=September 12, 2013 |website=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=July 25, 2019}}</ref> that McCandless might have been poisoned by a toxic alkaloid called [[swainsonine]], by ingesting seeds (''[[Hedysarum alpinum]]'' or ''[[Hedysarum mackenzii]]'') containing the toxin, or possibly by a [[mould|mold]] that grows on them (''[[Rhizoctonia leguminicola]]'') when he put them damp into a plastic bag. Swainsonine inhibits [[metabolism]] of [[glycoprotein]]s, which causes starvation despite ample caloric intake.<ref name=Krakauer2013/>\n\nHowever, in an article in the September 2007 issue of ''[[Men's Journal]]'', Matthew Powers states that extensive laboratory testing showed there were no toxins or alkaloids present in the ''H. alpinum'' seeds McCandless had been eating.

The ODAP, a toxic [[amino acid]], had not been detected by the previous studies of the seeds because they had suspected and tested for a toxic alkaloid, rather than an amino acid, and nobody had previously suspected that ''Hedysarum alpinum'' seeds contained this toxin. The protein would be relatively harmless to someone who was well-fed and on a normal diet, but toxic to someone who was [[malnourishment|malnourished]], physically stressed, and on an irregular and insufficient diet, as McCandless was.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/when-edible-plants-turn-their-defenses-us |title=When Edible Plants Turn Their Defenses On Us |date=October 24, 2013 |website=usf.edu}}</ref> As Krakauer points out, McCandless' field guide did not warn of any dangers of eating the seeds, which were not yet known to be toxic.
