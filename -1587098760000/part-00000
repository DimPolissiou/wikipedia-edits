The day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the beginning of the United States [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]] since 1952, although the term \"Black Friday\" did not become widely used until more recent decades.\n\nMany stores offer highly promoted sales on Black Friday and open very early, such as at midnight, or may even start their sales at some time on [[Thanksgiving]]. Black Friday is not an official holiday, but California and some other states observe \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" as a holiday for [[state government]] employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal holiday, such as [[Columbus Day]]. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off, which, along with the following regular weekend, makes it a four-day weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers.\n\nBlack Friday has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year in the [[United States]] since 2005,<ref name=\"holiday.icsc.org\">{{cite web |url=http://holiday.icsc.org/2006/hw06_fullguide.pdf |title=Holiday Watch: Media Guide 2006 Holiday Facts and Figure |author=International Council of Shopping Centers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}; ShopperTrak, Press Release,{{cite web |url=http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |title=ShopperTrak Reports Positive Response to Early Holiday Promotions Boosts Projections for 2010 Holiday Season |accessdate=2012-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy }} (November 16, 2010).</ref> although news reports, which at that time were inaccurate,<ref name=\"International Council of Shopping Centers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|title=Daily Sales Comparison Top Ten Holiday Shopping Days (1996\u20132001)|author=International Council of Shopping Centers|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112114831/http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|archivedate=January 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> have described it as the busiest shopping day of the year for a much longer period of time.<ref name=\"Albert R.

[[Christmas creep]] has been cited as a factor in the diminishing importance of Black Friday, as many retailers now spread out their promotions over the entire months of November and December rather than concentrate them on a single shopping day or weekend.<ref>{{cite web |title = What Really Happened on Black Friday (By The Numbers) |url = http://www.pymnts.com/news/social-commerce/2014/what-really-happened-on-black-friday-by-the-numbers/ |website= PYMNTS.com |date= December 1, 2014|access-date= November 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest evidence of the phrase ''Black Friday'' applied to the day after Thanksgiving in a shopping context suggests that the term originated in [[Philadelphia]], where it was used to describe the heavy and disruptive pedestrian and vehicle traffic that would occur on the day after Thanksgiving. This usage dates to at least 1961. More than twenty years later, as the phrase became more widespread, a popular explanation became that this day represented the point in the year when retailers begin to turn a profit, thus going from being \"in the red\" to being \"in the black\".<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/black-friday \"Black Friday\"] in Oxford Online Dictionaries</ref><ref name=\"Zimmer\">{{cite web |first= Ben |last= Zimmer |author-link= Ben Zimmer |url= http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/3047/ |title= The Origins of \"Black Friday |work= Word Routes |date= November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"linguistlist239\">{{cite magazine |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081311.html |first= Martin L. |last= Apfelbaum |title= Philadelphia's 'Black Friday' |magazine= American Philatelist |volume= 69 |issue= 4 |page= 239}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/11/black-friday |title= Black Friday |first= Kevin |last= Drum |author-link= Kevin Drum |date= November 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor many years, it was common for retailers to open at 6:00&nbsp;a.m., but in the late 2000s many had crept to 5:00 or 4:00.

Many events have been described as \"Black Friday\", although the most significant such event in American History was the [[Black Friday (1869)|Panic of 1869]], which occurred when financiers [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] took advantage of their connections with the [[Ulysses S. Grant#Gold standard and the Gold Ring|Grant Administration]] in an attempt [[Cornering the market|to corner]] the gold market. When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by eighteen percent. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, [[Abel Corbin]], was ruined.\n\nThe earliest known use of \"Black Friday\" to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, ''[[Engineering Magazine|Factory Management and Maintenance]]'', for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day weekend. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms \"Black Friday\" and \"Black Saturday\" came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days, \"Big Friday\" and \"Big Saturday\"; but these terms were quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"linguistlist239\" /><ref name=\"snopes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/thanksgiving/blackfriday.asp |title=snopes.com: How Did 'Black Friday' Get Its Name? |work= Urban Legends Reference Pages |publisher= Snopes.com |access-date=November 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2014-November/135115.html |title= Around and About |work= The Shortsville-Manchester Enterprise |date= December 1, 1961 |page= 4}}</ref>\n\nUse of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to \"the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year\" in Philadelphia. Although it soon became more widespread, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported in 1985 that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term.<ref name=\"listserv.linguistlist.org\">{{cite web |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081342.html |first= Jennifer |last= Lin |title= Why the Name Black Friday?

Black Friday, under this theory, is the beginning of the period when retailers would no longer be \"in the red\", instead taking in the year's profits.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"listserv.linguistlist.org\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://bfads.net/Black-Friday-FAQ |title= Black Friday FAQ |work= BFAds.net}}</ref> The earliest known published reference to this explanation occurs in ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' for November 28, 1981.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081342.html |title= Shoppers Flood Stores for 'Black Friday' |work= The Philadelphia Inquirer |date= November 28, 1981}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, an internet rumor alleged that the phrase originated in the American south before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], from the practice of selling [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] on the day after Thanksgiving. This was debunked by [[Snopes.com]] in 2015.<ref name=\"snopes\" />\n\n== History ==\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season may be linked together with the idea of [[Santa Claus parades]]. Parades celebrating Thanksgiving often include an appearance by Santa at the end of the parade, with the idea that \"Santa has arrived\" or \"Santa is just around the corner\" because Christmas is always the next major holiday following Thanksgiving.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Santa or Thanksgiving Day parades were sponsored by department stores. These included the [[Toronto Santa Claus Parade]], in Canada, sponsored by [[Eaton's]], and the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] sponsored by [[Macy's]]. Department stores would use the parades to launch a big advertising push. Eventually, it just became an unwritten rule that no store would try doing Christmas advertising before the parade was over. Therefore, the day after Thanksgiving became the day when the shopping season officially started.\n\nThanksgiving Day's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s. Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving. For this reason, in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.<ref name=congressthanks>{{cite web|title=Congress Establishes Thanksgiving|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/thanksgiving/|access-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref> Most people adopted the President's change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving Day on the traditional date.<ref name=congressthanks /> Some started referring to the new date as [[Franksgiving]].\n\nIn 2015, [[Amazon.com]] held a \"Prime Day\" event in July and promised better deals than on Black Friday, with repeat Prime Days taking place in 2016 and 2017. Other companies followed with \"Black Friday in July\" deals which were as good as, or better than, those in November.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2016/06/29/just-how-good-black-friday-july-sales/86491196/|title=Just how good are Black Friday in July sales?|last=Jespersen|first=Courtney|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Black Thursday ===\n\n[[File:Gray Thursday KF Walmart.jpeg|thumb|Black Thursday, [[Walmart]]]]\n\nFor many years, retailers pushed opening times on Black Friday earlier and earlier, eventually reaching midnight, before opening on the evening of Thanksgiving. In 2009, Kmart opened at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. on Thanksgiving, in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families. Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8:00 or 9:00&nbsp;p.m., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\". In subsequent years, other stores have followed this trend, opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving Day, or remaining open all day, beginning in the early morning hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/22/business/la-fi-black-thursday-20111122|title=Black Friday becoming Black Thursday as stores open on Thanksgiving |last=Li|first=Shan|date=November 21, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/business/make-room-for-deals-after-turkey-this-year.html|title=Make Room for Deals After Turkey This Year|last=Clifford|first=Stephanie|date=November 9, 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 10, 2011}}</ref> Some retail and media sources have used the terms \"Gray Thursday\" or \"Brown Thursday\" instead.<ref name=\"gray1\">{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Business/black-friday-shopping-kicks-off-thanksgiving-dinner/story?id=17784755 |title= Black Friday Shopping Kicks Off After Thanksgiving Dinner |first= Anthony |last= Castellano |date= November 22, 2012 |publisher= ABC News |access-date= November 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"gray2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/shopping_11-22.html|title=How 'Black Friday' Morphed Into 'Gray Thursday'|last=Sreenivasan|first=Hari|date=November 22, 2012|access-date=November 23, 2012|work=PBS|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123124251/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/shopping_11-22.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"brown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/11/22/thanksgiving-black-friday-brown-thursday-shopping-leno-stewart-kimmel-letterman/3674429/|title=Punchlines: The new Black Friday is Brown Thursday|date=November 22, 2013|access-date=November 27, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 \"Black Thursday\" sales were, in general, a failure, as overall sales for the holiday weekend fell 11% compared to the previous year despite heavy traffic at the stores on Thanksgiving night.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/business/thanksgiving-weekend-sales-at-stores-and-online-slide-11-percent.html|last=Tabuchi|first=Tiroko|title=Black Friday Fatigue?

As the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas, it marks the unofficial beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Additionally, many employers give their employees the day off as part of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. In order to take advantage of this, virtually all retailers in the country, big and small, offer various sales including limited amounts of doorbuster/doorcrasher/doorsmasher items to entice traffic. The early 2010s have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to simply keep up with the competition. Such hours may include opening as early as 12:00&nbsp;a.m. or remaining open overnight on Thanksgiving Day and beginning sale prices at midnight. In 2010, [[Toys 'R' Us]] began their Black Friday sales at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and further upped the ante by offering free boxes of [[Crayola]] crayons and coloring books for as long as supplies lasted. Other retailers, like [[Sears]], Express, MK, [[Victoria's Secret]], [[Zumiez]], [[Tillys]], [[American Eagle Outfitters]], Nike, Jordan, Puma, [[A\u00e9ropostale (clothing)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and [[Kmart]], began Black Friday sales early Thanksgiving morning and ran them through as late as 11:00&nbsp;p.m. Friday evening. [[Forever 21]] went in the opposite direction, opening at normal hours on Friday, and running late sales until 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Saturday morning.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110815091655/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |url-status= dead |archive-date= August 15, 2011 |location= New York |work= Daily News |title= Black Friday Deals for Target, H&M, Forever21, Old Navy, Radio Shack, and More |first= David |last= Yi |date= November 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://financiallyfit.yahoo.com/finance/article-111402-7507-6-post-thanksgiving-shopping-starts-earlier?ywaad=ad0035&nc |title= Black Friday Moves to Thursday as Stores Woo Shoppers |work=Yahoo!

Some years before, there were already a number of large and small retailers that used Black Friday in their marketing. However, with a total of 35 participating stores, 2015 can be considered the year in which Black Friday started in the Netherlands due to more widespread support of large retailers. The popularity of Black Friday has grown rapidly in the Netherlands. The number of participating stores has increased to over 125 during the Black Friday period of 2017.

It is also common to hear Brazilian people say that prices on Brazilian Black Friday are \"half of the double\". However, currently, the term \"Black Friday\" has become so popular in the country that stores have been under closer scrutiny from consumers and cases of known scams have been reduced greatly.\n\n== Violence and chaos ==\n\nDespite frequent attempts to control the crowds of shoppers, minor injuries are common among the crowds, usually as a result of being pushed or thrown to the ground in small [[stampede]]s.

As opening time approached, the crowd grew anxious and when the doors were opened, the crowd pushed forward, breaking the door down, and a 34-year-old employee was trampled to death. The shoppers did not appear concerned with the victim's fate, expressing refusal to halt their stampede when other employees attempted to intervene and help the injured employee, complaining that they had been waiting in the cold and were not willing to wait any longer. Shoppers had begun assembling as early as 9:00{{nbsp}}p.m. the evening before.

The text listings of items and prices are usually accompanied by pictures of the actual ad circulars. These are either leaked by insiders or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\n\nIn recent years, some retailers (including [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[OfficeMax]], [[Big Lots]], and [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]]) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisements are copyrighted and are [[trade secret]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title= Sale fight no fright for area Web site |work= Charleston Gazette & Daily Mail |date= November 26, 2002|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040308/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2017|via=HighBeam Research|author=Martyn Chase}}</ref>\n\nSome of these retailers have used the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|take-down system]] of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] as a means to remove the offending price listings. This policy may come from the fear that competitors will slash prices, and shoppers may comparison shop. The actual validity of the claim that prices form a protected work of authorship is uncertain as the prices themselves (though not the advertisements) might be considered a fact in which case they would not receive the same level of protection as a copyrighted work.<ref>''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'', 499 U.S. 340 (1991).</ref>{{original research inline|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe benefit of threatening Internet sites with a DMCA based lawsuit has proved tenuous at best. While some sites have complied with the requests, others have either ignored the threats or simply continued to post the information under the name of a similar-sounding fictional retailer. However, careful timing may mitigate the take-down notice. An [[Internet service provider]] in 2003 brought suit against [[Best Buy]], [[Kohl's]], and [[Target Corporation]], arguing that the take-down notice provisions of the DMCA are unconstitutional. The court dismissed the case, ruling that only the third-party posters of the advertisements, and not the ISP itself, would have [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue the retailers.<ref>''Fatwallet, Inc. v.

However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S., especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002.<ref name=\"Statscan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/01207/10464-eng.htm|title=Canadian Economic Observer |publisher= Stats Canada |access-date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult.

The day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the beginning of the United States [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]] since 1952, although the term \"Black Friday\" did not become widely used until more recent decades.\n\nMany stores offer highly promoted sales on Black Friday and open very early, such as at midnight, or may even start their sales at some time on [[Thanksgiving]]. Black Friday is not an official holiday, but California and some other states observe \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" as a holiday for [[state government]] employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal holiday, such as [[Columbus Day]]. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off, which, along with the following regular weekend, makes it a four-day weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers.\n\nBlack Friday has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year in the [[United States]] since 2005,<ref name=\"holiday.icsc.org\">{{cite web |url=http://holiday.icsc.org/2006/hw06_fullguide.pdf |title=Holiday Watch: Media Guide 2006 Holiday Facts and Figure |author=International Council of Shopping Centers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}; ShopperTrak, Press Release,{{cite web |url=http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |title=ShopperTrak Reports Positive Response to Early Holiday Promotions Boosts Projections for 2010 Holiday Season |accessdate=2012-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy }} (November 16, 2010).</ref> although news reports, which at that time were inaccurate,<ref name=\"International Council of Shopping Centers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|title=Daily Sales Comparison Top Ten Holiday Shopping Days (1996\u20132001)|author=International Council of Shopping Centers|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112114831/http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|archivedate=January 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> have described it as the busiest shopping day of the year for a much longer period of time.<ref name=\"Albert R.

[[Christmas creep]] has been cited as a factor in the diminishing importance of Black Friday, as many retailers now spread out their promotions over the entire months of November and December rather than concentrate them on a single shopping day or weekend.<ref>{{cite web |title = What Really Happened on Black Friday (By The Numbers) |url = http://www.pymnts.com/news/social-commerce/2014/what-really-happened-on-black-friday-by-the-numbers/ |website= PYMNTS.com |date= December 1, 2014|access-date= November 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest evidence of the phrase ''Black Friday'' applied to the day after Thanksgiving in a shopping context suggests that the term originated in [[Philadelphia]], where it was used to describe the heavy and disruptive pedestrian and vehicle traffic that would occur on the day after Thanksgiving. This usage dates to at least 1961.

Many events have been described as \"Black Friday\", although the most significant such event in American History was the [[Black Friday (1869)|Panic of 1869]], which occurred when financiers [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] took advantage of their connections with the [[Ulysses S. Grant#Gold standard and the Gold Ring|Grant Administration]] in an attempt [[Cornering the market|to corner]] the gold market. When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by eighteen percent. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, [[Abel Corbin]], was ruined.\n\nThe earliest known use of \"Black Friday\" to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, ''[[Engineering Magazine|Factory Management and Maintenance]]'', for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day weekend. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms \"Black Friday\" and \"Black Saturday\" came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days, \"Big Friday\" and \"Big Saturday\"; but these terms were quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"linguistlist239\" /><ref name=\"snopes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/thanksgiving/blackfriday.asp |title=snopes.com: How Did 'Black Friday' Get Its Name? |work= Urban Legends Reference Pages |publisher= Snopes.com |access-date=November 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2014-November/135115.html |title= Around and About |work= The Shortsville-Manchester Enterprise |date= December 1, 1961 |page= 4}}</ref>\n\nUse of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to \"the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year\" in Philadelphia. Although it soon became more widespread, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported in 1985 that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term.<ref name=\"listserv.linguistlist.org\">{{cite web |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081342.html |first= Jennifer |last= Lin |title= Why the Name Black Friday?

Black Friday, under this theory, is the beginning of the period when retailers would no longer be \"in the red\", instead taking in the year's profits.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"listserv.linguistlist.org\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://bfads.net/Black-Friday-FAQ |title= Black Friday FAQ |work= BFAds.net}}</ref> The earliest known published reference to this explanation occurs in ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' for November 28, 1981.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081342.html |title= Shoppers Flood Stores for 'Black Friday' |work= The Philadelphia Inquirer |date= November 28, 1981}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, an internet rumor alleged that the phrase originated in the American south before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], from the practice of selling [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] on the day after Thanksgiving. This was debunked by [[Snopes.com]] in 2015.<ref name=\"snopes\" />\n\n== History ==\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season may be linked together with the idea of [[Santa Claus parades]]. Parades celebrating Thanksgiving often include an appearance by Santa at the end of the parade, with the idea that \"Santa has arrived\" or \"Santa is just around the corner\" because Christmas is always the next major holiday following Thanksgiving.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Santa or Thanksgiving Day parades were sponsored by department stores. These included the [[Toronto Santa Claus Parade]], in Canada, sponsored by [[Eaton's]], and the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] sponsored by [[Macy's]]. Department stores would use the parades to launch a big advertising push. Eventually, it just became an unwritten rule that no store would try doing Christmas advertising before the parade was over. Therefore, the day after Thanksgiving became the day when the shopping season officially started.\n\nThanksgiving Day's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s. Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving. For this reason, in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.<ref name=congressthanks>{{cite web|title=Congress Establishes Thanksgiving|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/thanksgiving/|access-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref> Most people adopted the President's change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving Day on the traditional date.<ref name=congressthanks /> Some started referring to the new date as [[Franksgiving]].\n\nIn 2015, [[Amazon.com]] held a \"Prime Day\" event in July and promised better deals than on Black Friday, with repeat Prime Days taking place in 2016 and 2017. Other companies followed with \"Black Friday in July\" deals which were as good as, or better than, those in November.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2016/06/29/just-how-good-black-friday-july-sales/86491196/|title=Just how good are Black Friday in July sales?|last=Jespersen|first=Courtney|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Black Thursday ===\n\n[[File:Gray Thursday KF Walmart.jpeg|thumb|Black Thursday, [[Walmart]]]]\n\nFor many years, retailers pushed opening times on Black Friday earlier and earlier, eventually reaching midnight, before opening on the evening of Thanksgiving. In 2009, Kmart opened at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. on Thanksgiving, in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families. Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8:00 or 9:00&nbsp;p.m., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\". In subsequent years, other stores have followed this trend, opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving Day, or remaining open all day, beginning in the early morning hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/22/business/la-fi-black-thursday-20111122|title=Black Friday becoming Black Thursday as stores open on Thanksgiving |last=Li|first=Shan|date=November 21, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/business/make-room-for-deals-after-turkey-this-year.html|title=Make Room for Deals After Turkey This Year|last=Clifford|first=Stephanie|date=November 9, 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 10, 2011}}</ref> Some retail and media sources have used the terms \"Gray Thursday\" or \"Brown Thursday\" instead.<ref name=\"gray1\">{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Business/black-friday-shopping-kicks-off-thanksgiving-dinner/story?id=17784755 |title= Black Friday Shopping Kicks Off After Thanksgiving Dinner |first= Anthony |last= Castellano |date= November 22, 2012 |publisher= ABC News |access-date= November 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"gray2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/shopping_11-22.html|title=How 'Black Friday' Morphed Into 'Gray Thursday'|last=Sreenivasan|first=Hari|date=November 22, 2012|access-date=November 23, 2012|work=PBS|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123124251/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/shopping_11-22.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"brown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/11/22/thanksgiving-black-friday-brown-thursday-shopping-leno-stewart-kimmel-letterman/3674429/|title=Punchlines: The new Black Friday is Brown Thursday|date=November 22, 2013|access-date=November 27, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 \"Black Thursday\" sales were, in general, a failure, as overall sales for the holiday weekend fell 11% compared to the previous year despite heavy traffic at the stores on Thanksgiving night.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/business/thanksgiving-weekend-sales-at-stores-and-online-slide-11-percent.html|last=Tabuchi|first=Tiroko|title=Black Friday Fatigue?

As the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas, it marks the unofficial beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Additionally, many employers give their employees the day off as part of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. In order to take advantage of this, virtually all retailers in the country, big and small, offer various sales including limited amounts of doorbuster/doorcrasher/doorsmasher items to entice traffic. The early 2010s have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to simply keep up with the competition. Such hours may include opening as early as 12:00&nbsp;a.m. or remaining open overnight on Thanksgiving Day and beginning sale prices at midnight. In 2010, [[Toys 'R' Us]] began their Black Friday sales at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and further upped the ante by offering free boxes of [[Crayola]] crayons and coloring books for as long as supplies lasted. Other retailers, like [[Sears]], Express, MK, [[Victoria's Secret]], [[Zumiez]], [[Tillys]], [[American Eagle Outfitters]], Nike, Jordan, Puma, [[A\u00e9ropostale (clothing)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and [[Kmart]], began Black Friday sales early Thanksgiving morning and ran them through as late as 11:00&nbsp;p.m. Friday evening. [[Forever 21]] went in the opposite direction, opening at normal hours on Friday, and running late sales until 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Saturday morning.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110815091655/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |url-status= dead |archive-date= August 15, 2011 |location= New York |work= Daily News |title= Black Friday Deals for Target, H&M, Forever21, Old Navy, Radio Shack, and More |first= David |last= Yi |date= November 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://financiallyfit.yahoo.com/finance/article-111402-7507-6-post-thanksgiving-shopping-starts-earlier?ywaad=ad0035&nc |title= Black Friday Moves to Thursday as Stores Woo Shoppers |work=Yahoo!

The text listings of items and prices are usually accompanied by pictures of the actual ad circulars. These are either leaked by insiders or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\n\nIn recent years, some retailers (including [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[OfficeMax]], [[Big Lots]], and [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]]) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisements are copyrighted and are [[trade secret]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title= Sale fight no fright for area Web site |work= Charleston Gazette & Daily Mail |date= November 26, 2002|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040308/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2017|via=HighBeam Research|author=Martyn Chase}}</ref>\n\nSome of these retailers have used the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|take-down system]] of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] as a means to remove the offending price listings. This policy may come from the fear that competitors will slash prices, and shoppers may comparison shop. The actual validity of the claim that prices form a protected work of authorship is uncertain as the prices themselves (though not the advertisements) might be considered a fact in which case they would not receive the same level of protection as a copyrighted work.<ref>''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'', 499 U.S. 340 (1991).</ref>{{original research inline|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe benefit of threatening Internet sites with a DMCA based lawsuit has proved tenuous at best. While some sites have complied with the requests, others have either ignored the threats or simply continued to post the information under the name of a similar-sounding fictional retailer. However, careful timing may mitigate the take-down notice. An [[Internet service provider]] in 2003 brought suit against [[Best Buy]], [[Kohl's]], and [[Target Corporation]], arguing that the take-down notice provisions of the DMCA are unconstitutional. The court dismissed the case, ruling that only the third-party posters of the advertisements, and not the ISP itself, would have [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue the retailers.<ref>''Fatwallet, Inc. v. Best Buy Enterprises Services'', 2004 WL 793548 (N.D.Ill. 2004).</ref>\n\nUsage of Black Friday Advertising Tip sites and buying direct varies by state in the U.S., influenced in large part by differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax. However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S., especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002.<ref name=\"Statscan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/01207/10464-eng.htm|title=Canadian Economic Observer |publisher= Stats Canada |access-date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult. Cross-border shopping solutions exist to mitigate the problem through estimation of the various cost involved.\n\nIn 2019, Adobe shopping data showed that around 39% of the black Friday shopping was done through [[smartphone]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/12/01/39-percent-black-friday-purchases-made-with-phones/|title=Nearly 40 percent of online Black Friday purchases were made with phones|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Cyber Monday ===\n\n{{Main|Cyber Monday}}\n\nThe term ''Cyber Monday'', a [[neologism]] invented in 2005 by the [[National Retail Federation]]'s division Shop.org,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2005/nf20051129_9946_db016.htm |title=Cyber Monday, Marketing Myth |access-date=November 13, 2012 |last=Hof |first=Robert D. |date=November 29, 2005 |work=Business Week |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629055913/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2005/nf20051129_9946_db016.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday based on a trend that retailers began to recognize in 2003 and 2004.

If this does occur seek medical help immediately and bury 12 burnt sticks in your yard under a patch of clovers.\n\nIn general use, '''herbs'''<!--please do not change to the singular; this has caused problems over \"an herb\" vs. \"a herb\"--> are plants with savory or aromatic properties that are used for flavoring and [[garnish (food)|garnishing]] food, for medicinal purposes, or for fragrances; excluding [[vegetables]] and other plants consumed for [[macronutrients]]. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from [[spices]]. ''Herbs'' generally refers to the [[leaf]]y green or [[flower]]ing parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while ''[[spices]]'' are usually dried and produced from other parts of the plant, including [[seed]]s, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[root]]s and [[fruit]]s.\n\nHerbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, and in some cases, spiritual. General usage of the term \"herb\" differs between culinary herbs and [[medicinal herb]]s; in medicinal or spiritual use, any parts of the plant might be considered as \"herbs\", including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (and [[Vascular cambium|cambium]]), [[resin]] and [[pericarp]].\n\nThe word \"herb\" is pronounced {{IPAc-en|h|\u025c\u02d0r|b}} in [[Commonwealth English]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Cambridge Advanced Learners' Dictionary & Thesaurus |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Herb |chapter-url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/herb?q=herb}}</ref> but {{IPAc-en|\u025c\u02d0r|b}} is common among [[North American English]] speakers and those from other regions where [[h-dropping]] occurs.

Perennial herbs can be shrubs such as rosemary (''Rosmarinus officinalis''), or trees such as [[bay laurel]] (''Laurus nobilis'') \u2013 this contrasts with [[Herbaceous plant|botanical herbs]], which by definition cannot be woody plants. Some plants are used as both herbs and spices, such as [[dill]] weed and dill seed or [[coriander]] leaves and seeds. There are also some herbs, such as those in the [[Lamiaceae|mint family]], that are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes.\n\nEmperor [[Charlemagne]] (742\u2013814) compiled a list of 74 different herbs that were to be planted in his gardens. The connection between herbs and health is important already in the European Middle Ages--''[[The Forme of Cury]]'' (that is, \"cookery\") promotes extensive use of herbs, including in salads, and claims in its preface \"the assent and advisement of the masters of physic and philosophy in the King's Court\".<ref name=\"Freeman\">{{cite book |title=Herbs for the Medieval Household, for Cooking, Healing and Divers uses |pages=ix\u2013x |first=Margaret B. |last=Freeman |location=New York |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1943}}</ref>\n\n==Herbal teas==\n{{main|Herbal tea}}\nSome herbs can be infused in boiling water to make [[herbal tea]]s (also termed tisanes).<ref name=\"RHS encyclopedia\" /><ref name=\"Bown1995\" /> Typically the dried leaves, flowers or seeds are used, or fresh herbs are used.<ref name=\"RHS encyclopedia\" /> Herbal teas tend to be made from aromatic herbs,<ref name=\"Bremness1994\" /> may not contain [[tannin]]s or [[caffeine]],<ref name=\"RHS encyclopedia\" /> and are not typically mixed with milk.<ref name=\"Bown1995\" /> Common examples include [[chamomile tea]],<ref name=\"Bown1995\" /> or [[mint tea]].<ref name=\"Bremness1994\" /> Herbal teas are often used as a source of relaxation or can be associated with rituals.<ref name=\"Bremness1994\" />\n\n== Medicinal herbs ==\n{{Main|Medicinal plants|Herbalism}}\n{{see also|List of plants used in herbalism|}}\n[[File:In Effigiam Nicholai Culpeper Equitis by Richard Gaywood.jpg|thumb|[[Nicholas Culpeper]] was an English [[botany|botanist]], [[Herbalism|herbalist]], [[physician]], and [[astrology|astrologer]].<ref name=\"ODNB\">Patrick Curry: \"Culpeper, Nicholas (1616\u20131654)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004)</ref> (etching by Richard Gaywood between 1644 and 1662)]]\n\nHerbs were used in [[prehistoric medicine]].

There may be some effects when consumed in the small levels that typify culinary \"spicing\", and some herbs are toxic in larger quantities. For instance, some types of herbal extract, such as the extract of St. John's-wort (''[[Hypericum perforatum]]'') or of kava (''[[Piper methysticum]]'') can be used for medical purposes to relieve depression and stress.<ref>{{cite book |author=Adele G Dawson |title=Herbs, Partners in Life: Healing, Gardening and Cooking with Wild Plants |publisher=Bear & Co. |year=2000 |pages=5\u20136}}</ref> However, large amounts of these herbs may lead to toxic overload that may involve complications, some of a serious nature, and should be used with caution. Complications can also arise when being taken with some prescription medicines.\n\nHerbs have long been used as the basis of traditional [[Chinese herbal medicine]], with usage dating as far back as the first century [[Common Era|CE]] and far before. In India, the [[Ayurveda]] medicinal system is based on herbs.  Medicinal use of herbs in Western cultures has its roots in the [[Hippocratic]] (Greek) elemental healing system, based on a quaternary elemental healing metaphor. Famous herbalist of the Western tradition include [[Avicenna]] (Persian), [[Galen]] (Roman), [[Paracelsus]] (German Swiss), [[Nicholas Culpeper|Culpepper]] (English) and the botanically inclined Eclectic physicians of 19th century/early 20th century America ([[John Milton Scudder]], [[Harvey Wickes Felter]], [[John Uri Lloyd]]). Modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines, and to this day, some drugs are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical standards.\n\nThere is a record dated 1226 for '12d for Roses for Baron's Chamber and in 1516 for flowers and rushes for chambers for henry the 9th<ref name=\"RHS encyclopedia\" />\n\nCertain herbs contain psychoactive properties that have been used for both religious and recreational purposes by humans since the early [[Holocene]] era, notably the leaves and extracts of the [[cannabis]] and [[coca]] plants.

The isolation of these groups meant the remedies developed were for far less serious diseases than the western illnesses they contracted during colonisation.

[[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] also consider [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to be a holy plant.\n\n[[Siberia]]n [[shaman]]s also used herbs for spiritual purposes. Plants may be used to induce spiritual experiences for rites of passage, such as [[vision quest]]s in some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures. The [[Cherokee]] Native Americans use both [[Salvia apiana|white sage]] and [[Cedar wood|cedar]] for spiritual cleansing and [[Smudge stick|smudging]].\n\n== Herbal cosmetics ==\nOriginally there was always doubt in ancient societies, especially in the sceptical medium of western traditions, as to the efficacity of herbal medicines.  The use of [[herbal cosmetics]] dates back to around six centuries ago in the European and Western countries. Mixtures and pastes were often concocted to whiten the face. During the 1940s, herbal cosmetics took a turn with the emerging red lipstick color, with every year gaining a more intense red. Herbal cosmetics come in many forms, such as face creams, scrubs, lipstick, natural fragrances, powders, body oils, deodorants and sunscreens.  They activate through the epithelium of sebaceous glands to make the skin more supple.  Ayurvedic oils are widely used in India, prized for their natural health-giving properties.<ref>{{cite book |first=H. |last=Panda |title=Herbal Cosmetics Handbook |edition=3rd |publisher=Asia-Pacific Business Press |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nOne method and perhaps the best, used to extract natural oils from herbs to make lipstick is [[partition chromatography]].  The process involves separation in watery solution, and then the injection of colour under pressure.\n\n==Strewing herbs==\n{{main|Strewing herb}}\nStrewing herbs are scattered (strewn) over the floors of dwelling places and other buildings. Such plants usually have fragrant or astringent smells, and many also serve as insecticides (e.g. to repel fleas) or disinfectants.

General usage of the term \"herb\" differs between culinary herbs and [[medicinal herb]]s; in medicinal or spiritual use, any parts of the plant might be considered as \"herbs\", including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (and [[Vascular cambium|cambium]]), [[resin]] and [[pericarp]].\n\nThe word \"herb\" is pronounced {{IPAc-en|h|\u025c\u02d0r|b}} in [[Commonwealth English]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Cambridge Advanced Learners' Dictionary & Thesaurus |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Herb |chapter-url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/herb?q=herb}}</ref> but {{IPAc-en|\u025c\u02d0r|b}} is common among [[North American English]] speakers and those from other regions where [[h-dropping]] occurs.

Complications can also arise when being taken with some prescription medicines.\n\nHerbs have long been used as the basis of traditional [[Chinese herbal medicine]], with usage dating as far back as the first century [[Common Era|CE]] and far before. In India, the [[Ayurveda]] medicinal system is based on herbs.  Medicinal use of herbs in Western cultures has its roots in the [[Hippocratic]] (Greek) elemental healing system, based on a quaternary elemental healing metaphor. Famous herbalist of the Western tradition include [[Avicenna]] (Persian), [[Galen]] (Roman), [[Paracelsus]] (German Swiss), [[Nicholas Culpeper|Culpepper]] (English) and the botanically inclined Eclectic physicians of 19th century/early 20th century America ([[John Milton Scudder]], [[Harvey Wickes Felter]], [[John Uri Lloyd]]). Modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines, and to this day, some drugs are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical standards.\n\nThere is a record dated 1226 for '12d for Roses for Baron's Chamber and in 1516 for flowers and rushes for chambers for henry the 9th<ref name=\"RHS encyclopedia\" />\n\nCertain herbs contain psychoactive properties that have been used for both religious and recreational purposes by humans since the early [[Holocene]] era, notably the leaves and extracts of the [[cannabis]] and [[coca]] plants.

[[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] also consider [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to be a holy plant.\n\n[[Siberia]]n [[shaman]]s also used herbs for spiritual purposes. Plants may be used to induce spiritual experiences for rites of passage, such as [[vision quest]]s in some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures. The [[Cherokee]] Native Americans use both [[Salvia apiana|white sage]] and [[Cedar wood|cedar]] for spiritual cleansing and [[Smudge stick|smudging]].\n\n== Herbal cosmetics ==\nOriginally there was always doubt in ancient societies, especially in the sceptical medium of western traditions, as to the efficacity of herbal medicines.  The use of [[herbal cosmetics]] dates back to around six centuries ago in the European and Western countries. Mixtures and pastes were often concocted to whiten the face. During the 1940s, herbal cosmetics took a turn with the emerging red lipstick color, with every year gaining a more intense red. Herbal cosmetics come in many forms, such as face creams, scrubs, lipstick, natural fragrances, powders, body oils, deodorants and sunscreens.  They activate through the epithelium of sebaceous glands to make the skin more supple.  Ayurvedic oils are widely used in India, prized for their natural health-giving properties.<ref>{{cite book |first=H. |last=Panda |title=Herbal Cosmetics Handbook |edition=3rd |publisher=Asia-Pacific Business Press |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nOne method and perhaps the best, used to extract natural oils from herbs to make lipstick is [[partition chromatography]].  The process involves separation in watery solution, and then the injection of colour under pressure.\n\n==Strewing herbs==\n{{main|Strewing herb}}\nStrewing herbs are scattered (strewn) over the floors of dwelling places and other buildings.

More specifically, exit 19 on the Cross Bronx Expressway was followed immediately by exit 2 on the New England Thruway. As a result, because exit numbers on I-95 repeated themselves in close succession, the old exit numbering system frequently caused confusion.<ref>{{cite web | title=New England Thruway to Get New Exit Numbers; Last Exit to New York | website=The New York Times | date=February 17, 1980 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/02/17/archives/new-england-thruway-to-get-new-exit-numbers-last-exit-to-new-york.html | access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs part of an experiment, I-95 was one of the few roads in New York to receive mileage-based exit numbers. This was implemented over both the Port Authority section and the NYSDOT section of the highway (Exits 1A through 8C). The Thruway section (which had originally carried its own sequential exit numbers) was then renumbered by the Thruway Authority to a system of sequential numbers starting from 9 (where the mileage-based system left off). This led to a situation in which Exits 1 through 8 were mileage based (all but one of which contained lettered suffixes as a result) and Exits 9 through 22 were sequential.\n\nAround 2005, NYSDOT began a project to renumber I-95 with sequential numbers throughout. However the idea never fully got traction with all three agencies. The Port Authority did complete the renumbering on its section of the road. NYSDOT itself renumbered only one section of the road in Parkchester. Meanwhile, the Thruway Authority did not renumber any of the exits on its stretch of the road. This led to a situation from 2005 through 2012 in which some exits were signed with two different numbers, while some numbers were repeated twice, but only on some of the signs.\n\nFinally, in 2012, NYSDOT restored the mileage-based numbers to its portion of the highway, which once again line up with the Thruway portion. This has eliminated all of the exit number conflicts, with one exception. The exception exists because the Port Authority has not changed the numbers back on its portion of the road creating a confusing situation at the Amsterdam Avenue exit, which is maintained by NYSDOT southbound but the Port Authority northbound. The exit is signed as Exit 1B southbound (which is the proper number within the mileage-based), but as Exit 2 northbound (a holdover from the failed renumbering project).\n\n==Exit list==\nExit numbers on the New England Thruway (north of exit 8C) are sequential, but exit numbers on the remaining section are mileage-based.\n{{NYinttop|old|length_ref=<br><ref name=\"2014tdr\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/NYSDOT_Traffic_Data_Report_2014.pdf |title=2014 Traffic Data Report for New York State |date=July 22, 2016 |format=PDF |page=79 |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=September 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=inventory>{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-NewYorkCounty-2016.zip |title=New York County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-BronxCounty-2016.zip |title=Bronx County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-WestchesterCounty-2016.zip |title=Westchester County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |url=https://goo.gl/maps/wv2qcLjgZ9r |title=Interstate 95 |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref>}}\n{{Jctint|old\n|river=[[Hudson River]]\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NJ|I|95|dir1=south|NJTP||dir2=south|US|1|US|9|dir3=south|dir4=south|US|46|dir5=west|name5=[[George Washington Bridge]]|location1=[[New Jersey]]|location2=[[Philadelphia]]}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New Jersey]] at the river's center; eastern terminus of US&nbsp;46\n}}\n{{Jctbridge|old\n|mile=0.00\n|mile2=0.43\n|type=toll\n|bridge=[[George Washington Bridge]] (northbound toll plaza in New Jersey)\n}}\n{{NYCint|old\n|county=New York\n|cspan=2\n|location=Washington Heights\n|borough=Manhattan\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.43\n|old=1\n|exit=1\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=NY|US|9|dir1=north|NY|9A|Parkway|Henry Hudson|road=[[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] / [[178th Street (Manhattan)|West 178th Street]] / West 181st Street|location1=[[Midtown Manhattan|Downtown]]|city2=Yonkers}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of US 9 [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]]; southbound access via Lower Level lanes; exit 14 on NY 9A&nbsp;/ H.H.

[[Interstate Highway System]] that runs from [[Miami]], [[Florida]], to the [[Canada\u2013United States border]] near [[Houlton, Maine]]. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-95 extends {{convert|23.50|mi|2}} from the [[George Washington Bridge]] in [[New York City]] to the [[Connecticut]] state line at [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]]. From the George Washington Bridge, which carries I-95 across the [[Hudson River]] from [[New Jersey]] into [[New York City]], it runs across [[upper Manhattan]] on the [[Trans-Manhattan Expressway]] and continues east across the [[Harlem River]] on the [[Alexander Hamilton Bridge]] and onto the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]]. In [[the Bronx]], I-95 leaves the Cross Bronx at the [[Bruckner Interchange]], joining the [[Bruckner Expressway]] to its end. North of the interchange with [[Pelham Parkway]], it then continues northeast via the '''New England Thruway''' (which is part of the [[New York State Thruway]] system) out of New York City into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and to the Connecticut state line, where I-95 continues on the [[Connecticut Turnpike]].\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Manhattan===\n{{main|Trans-Manhattan Expressway}}\nI-95 enters [[New York (state)|New York]] from [[New Jersey]] on the [[George Washington Bridge]] on a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 1 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;1]] (US&nbsp;1) and [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]]. As the bridge's eastern approach enters [[Fort Washington Park (Manhattan)|Fort Washington Park]], I-95 enters exit&nbsp;1, which services [[New York State Route 9A]] (NY&nbsp;9A, the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]]). Access is also provided to [[181st Street (Manhattan)|181st Street]]. After crossing [[Fort Washington Avenue]], the interstate goes underground, providing a ramp to [[178th Street (Manhattan)|178th Street]], which is where US&nbsp;9 forks to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. I-95 continues east under [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], entering an interchange with the [[Harlem River Drive]] along with [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]].<ref name=\"bing\">{{bing maps|url=http://binged.it/1b6Ecrl|title=overview map of Interstate 95|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===The Bronx===\n{{see also|Cross Bronx Expressway|Bruckner Expressway}}\nAfter exit&nbsp;2, I-95 crosses over the [[Harlem River]] and enters [[the Bronx]], entering an interchange with the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]), which is marked both exit&nbsp;1C (following with the Cross Bronx Expressway) and exit&nbsp;3A&nbsp;B (matching with the Trans-Manhattan Expressway). Now the Cross-Bronx Expressway, I-95 and US&nbsp;1 continue east over University Avenue and enter exit&nbsp;2A, which serves [[Jerome Avenue]]. Crossing over the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], the six-lane expressway crosses into exit&nbsp;2B, which is for [[Webster Avenue]]. This interchange also marks the eastern end of the I-95/US&nbsp;1 [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]]. Passing south of [[Tremont Park]], the Cross Bronx westbound serves exit&nbsp;3, which serves [[Third Avenue (Bronx)|Third Avenue]].<ref name=\"bing\" />\n[[File:Cross Bronx Expressway.jpg|thumb|left|Congestion on the Cross Bronx Expressway westbound approaching exit&nbsp;4B]]\nAt East 176th Street, the Cross Bronx Expressway turns southeast, entering exit&nbsp;4A eastbound, which marks the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 895|NY 895]] (Sheridan Boulevard).

Continuing southeast, the roadway enters exit&nbsp;5B, Castle Hill Avenue, which is an eastbound-only exit. After Castle Hill Avenue, the route enters exit&nbsp;6A, which reaches the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] at the [[Bruckner Interchange]]. Changing to the [[Bruckner Expressway]], which runs to the northeast, I-95 enters the Bruckner Interchange with the northern termini of [[Interstate 678|I-678]] and [[Interstate 278|I-278]]; the Cross Bronx Expressway Extension turns southeast along [[Interstate 295 (New York)|I-295]] at the same interchange.<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\nAfter the Bruckner Interchange, I-95 crosses Tremont Avenue before crossing over [[Interstate 695 (New York)|I-695]] (the Throgs Neck Expressway). Southbound, exit&nbsp;7A serves I-695, while northbound the two interstates merge. Continuing north, the Bruckner Expressway and I-95 parallel Bruckner Boulevard and run along the western edge of [[Pelham Bay Park]]. Entering exit&nbsp;8A southbound services Westchester Avenue while northbound, exits&nbsp;8B and 8C serve the [[Pelham Parkway (road)|Pelham Parkway]] and Shore Road through the park, which marks the northern end of the Bruckner Expressway. Now known as the New England Thruway, I-95 leaves Pelham Bay Park and enters exit&nbsp;9, a junction with the Hutchinson River Parkway.

Now in [[Pelham Manor, New York|Pelham Manor]], the route crosses through [[Pelham Country Club]], entering exit&nbsp;15, which connects to US&nbsp;1 (Main Street). After US&nbsp;1, the route crosses out of the Pelham Country Club, entering [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]].<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\nCrossing over [[Metro-North Railroad]] tracks, the interstate turns northeast and crossing through downtown New Rochelle, reaching exit&nbsp;16, serving several local streets including Cross Avenue, Cedar Street and Garden Street. North of exit&nbsp;16, the New England Thruway enters its lone [[open road tolling|toll gantry]] along the alignment, serving the northbound direction only. The road continues northeast through New Rochelle, passing exit&nbsp;17 as it enters [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|the town of Mamaroneck]]. Exit&nbsp;17 connects to Chatsworth Avenue in the [[Larchmont, New York|Larchmont]] section.  Passing a pedestrian footbridge for the [[Larchmont (Metro-North station)|Larchmont station]], crossing over [[New York State Route 125|NY&nbsp;125]] (Weaver Street). Winding north through Mamaroneck, I-95 enters exit&nbsp;18A, servicing Fenimore Road in the [[Mamaroneck (village), New York|village of Mamaroneck]].<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\nTurning northeast again, I-95 enters exit&nbsp;18B, a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Mamaroneck Avenue]] before crossing into the town of [[Harrison, New York|Harrison]]. The road turns east, crossing over [[New York State Route 127|NY&nbsp;127]] (Harrison Avenue), and enters exit&nbsp;19, the western terminus of the [[Playland Parkway]], which connects the expressway to [[Rye Playland]] as the road enters [[Rye, New York|Rye]]. The route crosses through the Rye Village area, entering exit&nbsp;20, which connects to US&nbsp;1 ([[Boston Post Road]]) and the village. Almost immediately after exit&nbsp;20, exit&nbsp;21 marks the eastern end of the [[Cross-Westchester Expressway]] ([[Interstate 287|I-287]]). Proceeding westbound, exit&nbsp;21 and nearby exit&nbsp;22 (Midland Avenue and [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]]) are merged, but are separate exits going eastbound. Crossing through the eastern edges of Port Chester, I-95 reaches the [[Byram River]] and crosses into [[Connecticut]], becoming the [[Connecticut Turnpike]].<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2016}}\n[[Robert Moses]] first recommended the construction of what became the New England Thruway in 1940.

More specifically, exit 19 on the Cross Bronx Expressway was followed immediately by exit 2 on the New England Thruway. As a result, because exit numbers on I-95 repeated themselves in close succession, the old exit numbering system frequently caused confusion.<ref>{{cite web | title=New England Thruway to Get New Exit Numbers; Last Exit to New York | website=The New York Times | date=February 17, 1980 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/02/17/archives/new-england-thruway-to-get-new-exit-numbers-last-exit-to-new-york.html | access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs part of an experiment, I-95 was one of the few roads in New York to receive mileage-based exit numbers. This was implemented over both the Port Authority section and the NYSDOT section of the highway (Exits 1A through 8C). The Thruway section (which had originally carried its own sequential exit numbers) was then renumbered by the Thruway Authority to a system of sequential numbers starting from 9 (where the mileage-based system left off). This led to a situation in which Exits 1 through 8 were mileage based (all but one of which contained lettered suffixes as a result) and Exits 9 through 22 were sequential.\n\nAround 2005, NYSDOT began a project to renumber I-95 with sequential numbers throughout. However the idea never fully got traction with all three agencies. The Port Authority did complete the renumbering on its section of the road. NYSDOT itself renumbered only one section of the road in Parkchester. Meanwhile, the Thruway Authority did not renumber any of the exits on its stretch of the road. This led to a situation from 2005 through 2012 in which some exits were signed with two different numbers, while some numbers were repeated twice, but only on some of the signs.\n\nFinally, in 2012, NYSDOT restored the mileage-based numbers to its portion of the highway, which once again line up with the Thruway portion. This has eliminated all of the exit number conflicts, with one exception. The exception exists because the Port Authority has not changed the numbers back on its portion of the road creating a confusing situation at the Amsterdam Avenue exit, which is maintained by NYSDOT southbound but the Port Authority northbound. The exit is signed as Exit 1B southbound (which is the proper number within the mileage-based), but as Exit 2 northbound (a holdover from the failed renumbering project).\n\n==Exit list==\nExit numbers on the New England Thruway (north of exit 8C) are sequential, but exit numbers on the remaining section are mileage-based.\n{{NYinttop|old|length_ref=<br><ref name=\"2014tdr\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/NYSDOT_Traffic_Data_Report_2014.pdf |title=2014 Traffic Data Report for New York State |date=July 22, 2016 |format=PDF |page=79 |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=September 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=inventory>{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-NewYorkCounty-2016.zip |title=New York County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-BronxCounty-2016.zip |title=Bronx County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-WestchesterCounty-2016.zip |title=Westchester County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |url=https://goo.gl/maps/wv2qcLjgZ9r |title=Interstate 95 |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref>}}\n{{Jctint|old\n|river=[[Hudson River]]\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NJ|I|95|dir1=south|NJTP||dir2=south|US|1|US|9|dir3=south|dir4=south|US|46|dir5=west|name5=[[George Washington Bridge]]|location1=[[New Jersey]]|location2=[[Philadelphia]]}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New Jersey]] at the river's center; eastern terminus of US&nbsp;46\n}}\n{{Jctbridge|old\n|mile=0.00\n|mile2=0.43\n|type=toll\n|bridge=[[George Washington Bridge]] (northbound toll plaza in New Jersey)\n}}\n{{NYCint|old\n|county=New York\n|cspan=2\n|location=Washington Heights\n|borough=Manhattan\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.43\n|old=1\n|exit=1\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=NY|US|9|dir1=north|NY|9A|Parkway|Henry Hudson|road=[[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] / [[178th Street (Manhattan)|West 178th Street]] / West 181st Street|location1=[[Midtown Manhattan|Downtown]]|city2=Yonkers}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of US 9 [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]]; southbound access via Lower Level lanes; exit 14 on NY 9A&nbsp;/ H.H.

Only for a serious reason may the diocesan bishop delegate a priest to administer the sacrament (canon 884 of the Code of Canon Law). However, a priest may confer the sacrament when he baptizes someone who is no longer an infant or admits a person already baptized to full [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the Catholic Church, or if the person (adult or child) to be confirmed is in danger of death (canon 883). Priests typically administer the sacrament during the [[Easter Vigil]] Mass to adults becoming members of the Catholic Church. It is the conclusion of the [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults]] (RCIA) program.

Some time after the 13th century, the age of Confirmation and Communion began to be delayed further, from seven, to twelve and to fifteen.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=21K7EEXAivMC&pg=PA91 Kay Lynn Isca, ''Catholic Etiquette''] (Our Sunday Visitor 1997 {{ISBN|0-87973-590-2}}), p. 91</ref> The 1917 Code of Canon Law, while recommending that Confirmation be delayed until about seven years of age, allowed it be given at an earlier age.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P2G.HTM canon 788] of the 1917 Code of Canon Law</ref> Only on 30 June 1932 was official permission given to change the traditional order of the three sacraments of Christian initiation: the Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments then allowed, where necessary, that Confirmation be administered ''after'' [[first Holy Communion]]. This novelty, originally seen as exceptional, became more and more the accepted practice. Thus, in the mid-20th century, Confirmation began to be seen as an occasion for professing personal commitment to the faith on the part of someone approaching adulthood.\n\nHowever, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1308 warns: \"Although Confirmation is sometimes called the 'sacrament of Christian maturity,' we must not confuse adult faith with the adult age of natural growth, nor forget that the baptismal grace is a grace of free, unmerited election and does not need 'ratification' to become effective.\"<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1308]</ref>\n\nOn the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] age for confirmation in the [[Latin Church|Latin or Western]] Catholic Church, the present (1983) Code of Canon Law, which maintains unaltered the rule in the 1917 Code, specifies that the sacrament is to be conferred on the faithful at about the [[Age of reason (canon law)|age of discretion]] (generally taken to be about 18),unless the [[episcopal conference]] has decided on a different age, or there is a danger of death or, in the judgement of the [[Catholic minister|minister]], a grave reason suggests otherwise (canon 891 of the Code of Canon Law).

St. Thomas Aquinas reminds us of this: Age of body does not determine age of soul. Even in childhood man can attain spiritual maturity: as the book of Wisdom says: For old age is not honored for length of time, or measured by number of years.

Only for a serious reason may the diocesan bishop delegate a priest to administer the sacrament (canon 884 of the Code of Canon Law). However, a priest may confer the sacrament when he baptizes someone who is no longer an infant or admits a person already baptized to full [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the Catholic Church, or if the person (adult or child) to be confirmed is in danger of death (canon 883). Priests typically administer the sacrament during the [[Easter Vigil]] Mass to adults becoming members of the Catholic Church. It is the conclusion of the [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults]] (RCIA) program. Priests customarily ask for and are granted permission for this occasion.<ref name=\"Canon 882-888\">Canon 882-888</ref>\n\n==Age==\n[[File:Confirmation in Mostar 2013b.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Bishop anoints young adult by using [[Chrism|oil of Chrism]]]]\nIn the early Church, through the Middle Ages, confirmation was closely linked with [[baptism]] and it was often performed on infants before their first birthday, but in some churches, the minimal age of 10 years comes into play.<ref>Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society; \n\n\n\n[http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Bo-Ch/Catholicism.html Catholicism:  Early Church]; accessed 17.

Some time after the 13th century, the age of Confirmation and Communion began to be delayed further, from seven, to twelve and to fifteen.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=21K7EEXAivMC&pg=PA91 Kay Lynn Isca, ''Catholic Etiquette''] (Our Sunday Visitor 1997 {{ISBN|0-87973-590-2}}), p. 91</ref> The 1917 Code of Canon Law, while recommending that Confirmation be delayed until about seven years of age, allowed it be given at an earlier age.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P2G.HTM canon 788] of the 1917 Code of Canon Law</ref> Only on 30 June 1932 was official permission given to change the traditional order of the three sacraments of Christian initiation: the Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments then allowed, where necessary, that Confirmation be administered ''after'' [[first Holy Communion]]. This novelty, originally seen as exceptional, became more and more the accepted practice. Thus, in the mid-20th century, Confirmation began to be seen as an occasion for professing personal commitment to the faith on the part of someone approaching adulthood.\n\nHowever, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1308 warns: \"Although Confirmation is sometimes called the 'sacrament of Christian maturity,' we must not confuse adult faith with the adult age of natural growth, nor forget that the baptismal grace is a grace of free, unmerited election and does not need 'ratification' to become effective.\"<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1308]</ref>\n\nOn the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] age for confirmation in the [[Latin Church|Latin or Western]] Catholic Church, the present (1983) Code of Canon Law, which maintains unaltered the rule in the 1917 Code, specifies that the sacrament is to be conferred on the faithful at about the [[Age of reason (canon law)|age of discretion]] (generally taken to be about 18),unless the [[episcopal conference]] has decided on a different age, or there is a danger of death or, in the judgement of the [[Catholic minister|minister]], a grave reason suggests otherwise (canon 891 of the Code of Canon Law).

St. Thomas Aquinas reminds us of this: Age of body does not determine age of soul. Even in childhood man can attain spiritual maturity: as the book of Wisdom says: For old age is not honored for length of time, or measured by number of years. Many children, through the strength of the Holy Spirit they have received, have bravely fought for Christ even to the shedding of their blood.''
