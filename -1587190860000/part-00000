Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to [[Patliputra]] (present-day [[Patna]] in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat [[Megasthenes]] who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of [[Peshawar|Purushapura]], [[Taxila|Takshashila]], [[Hastinapur]]a, [[Kannauj|Kanyakubja]], [[Allahabad|Prayag]], [[Patliputra]] and [[Tamralipta]], a distance of around {{convert|2600|km}}.<ref name=\"KMSarkar1927\"/> \n\nThe route of Chandragupta was built over the ancient \"[[Uttarapatha]]\" or the Northern Road, which had been mentioned by [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]]. The emperor [[Ashoka]] had it recorded in his edict about having trees planted, wells built at every half [[Kos (unit)|kos]] and many \"nimisdhayas\", which is often translated as rest-houses along the route. The emperor [[Kanishka]] is also known to have controlled the Uttarapatha.<ref name=\"Vadime\"/>\n\n=== Sur and Mughal Empires ===\n[[Sher Shah Suri]], the medieval ruler of the [[Sur Empire]], took to rebuilding Chandragupta's Royal Road in the 16th century. The old route was further rerouted at [[Sonargaon]] and [[Rohtas district|Rohtas]] and its breadth increased. [[Fruit trees]] and [[shade trees]] were planted. At every 2 kos, a [[Caravanserai|sarai]] was built, the number of [[Kos Minar|kos minars]] and [[Stepwell|baolis]] increased. Gardens were also built alongside some sections of the highway. Those who stopped at the sarai were provided food for free. His son [[Islam Shah Suri]] constructed an additional sarai in-between every sarai originally built by Sher Shah on the road toward Bengal. More sarais were built under the [[Mughals]]. [[Jahangir]] under his reign issued a decree that all sarais be built of burnt brick and stone. [[Broad-leaved tree]]s were planted in the stretch between Lahore and Agra and he built bridges over all water bodies that were situated on the path of the highways.<ref name=\"Vadime\"/><ref name=\"Romila\"/> The route was referred to as \"Sadak-e-Azam\" by Suri, and \"Badshahi Sadak\" during Mughals.<ref>Anu Kapur, p. 84, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ApCKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT84&dq=sadak+e+azam+sher+shah&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOw-6Vr8PiAhXZfSsKHS8CBIgQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=sadak%20e%20azam%20sher%20shah&f=false Mapping Place Names of India]</ref>\n\n=== British Empire ===\n[[File:GTRoad Ambala.jpg|thumb|A scene from the [[Ambala]] cantonment during the [[British India]].]]\nIn the 1830s the East India Company started a programme of metalled road construction, for both commercial and administrative purposes.

Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to [[Patliputra]] (present-day [[Patna]] in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat [[Megasthenes]] who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of [[Peshawar|Purushapura]], [[Taxila|Takshashila]], [[Hastinapur]]a, [[Kannauj|Kanyakubja]], [[Allahabad|Prayag]], [[Patliputra]] and [[Tamralipta]], a distance of around {{convert|2600|km}}.<ref name=\"KMSarkar1927\"/> \n\nThe route of Chandragupta was built over the ancient \"[[Uttarapatha]]\" or the Northern Road, which had been mentioned by [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]]. The emperor [[Ashoka]] had it recorded in his edict about having trees planted, wells built at every half [[Kos (unit)|kos]] and many \"nimisdhayas\", which is often translated as rest-houses along the route. The emperor [[Kanishka]] is also known to have controlled the Uttarapatha.<ref name=\"Vadime\"/>\n\n=== Sur and Mughal Empires ===\n[[Sher Shah Suri]], the medieval ruler of the [[Sur Empire]], took to rebuilding Chandragupta's Royal Road in the 16th century. The old route was further rerouted at [[Sonargaon]] and [[Rohtas district|Rohtas]] and its breadth increased. [[Fruit trees]] and [[shade trees]] were planted. At every 2 kos, a [[Caravanserai|sarai]] was built, the number of [[Kos Minar|kos minars]] and [[Stepwell|baolis]] increased. Gardens were also built alongside some sections of the highway. Those who stopped at the sarai were provided food for free. His son [[Islam Shah Suri]] constructed an additional sarai in-between every sarai originally built by Sher Shah on the road toward Bengal. More sarais were built under the [[Mughals]]. [[Jahangir]] under his reign issued a decree that all sarais be built of burnt brick and stone. [[Broad-leaved tree]]s were planted in the stretch between Lahore and Agra and he built bridges over all water bodies that were situated on the path of the highways.<ref name=\"Vadime\"/><ref name=\"Romila\"/> The route was referred to as \"Sadak-e-Azam\" by Suri, and \"Badshahi Sadak\" during Mughals.<ref>Anu Kapur, p. 84, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ApCKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT84&dq=sadak+e+azam+sher+shah&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOw-6Vr8PiAhXZfSsKHS8CBIgQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=sadak%20e%20azam%20sher%20shah&f=false Mapping Place Names of India]</ref>\n\n=== British Empire ===\n[[File:GTRoad Ambala.jpg|thumb|A scene from the [[Ambala]] cantonment during the [[British India]].]]\nIn the 1830s the East India Company started a programme of metalled road construction, for both commercial and administrative purposes.

Officially launched in 1997, the CRJ700's [[maiden flight]] took place on 27 May 1999; it was soon followed by the stretched CRJ900 variant. Several additional variants of the type were subsequently introduced, including the CRJ550 and the elongated CRJ1000. While production of the smaller CRJ100/200 range was discontinued during 2006, the larger CRJ Series models have continued to be produced into the 2010s. Competitors have included the [[Fokker 70]]/[[Fokker 100]], the [[BAe 146]] family, and the [[Embraer E-Jet family]].\n\nIn Bombardier's lineup, the CRJ Series was formerly marketed alongside a family of larger jets, the ''C&nbsp;Series'' (now majority-owned by [[Airbus]] and marketed as the [[Airbus A220]]) and a twin-[[turboprop]], the ''Q&nbsp;Series'' (now owned by [[De Havilland Canada]] and marketed as the [[De Havilland Canada Dash 8|Dash 8]]).

Officially launched in 1997, the CRJ700's [[maiden flight]] took place on 27 May 1999; it was soon followed by the stretched CRJ900 variant. Several additional variants of the type were subsequently introduced, including the CRJ550 and the elongated CRJ1000. While production of the smaller CRJ100/200 range was discontinued during 2006, the larger CRJ Series models have continued to be produced into the 2010s. Competitors have included the [[Fokker 70]]/[[Fokker 100]], the [[BAe 146]] family, and the [[Embraer E-Jet family]].\n\nIn Bombardier's lineup, the CRJ Series was formerly marketed alongside a family of larger jets, the ''C&nbsp;Series'' (now majority-owned by [[Airbus]] and marketed as the [[Airbus A220]]) and a twin-[[turboprop]], the ''Q&nbsp;Series'' (now owned by [[De Havilland Canada]] and marketed as the [[De Havilland Canada Dash 8|Dash 8]]). During the late 2010s, Bombardier sought to sell off several of its aircraft programmes. The CRJ programme is to be acquired by Japanese corporation [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] in a deal expected to close by the first half of 2020.\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\nDuring the early 1990s, [[Bombardier Aerospace]] became interested in developing larger variants of the CRJ100/200 series; associated design work commenced in 1994.<ref name = \"markets 1997\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/making-markets-52/ \"Making markets.\"] ''Flight International'', 5 March 1997.</ref> The ''CRJ-X'', as the new range was initially designated, sought to compete with larger [[regional jet]]s such as the [[Fokker 70]]/[[Fokker 100]] or the [[British Aerospace 146|BAe 146]] family.<ref>Doyle, Andrew., Jennifer Pite and Graham Warwick.

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78. While at the Racer helm, Greene coached Racer greats Gary Hooker and Lamont Sleets.\n\n===Newton era (1985\u20131991)===\nIn [[Steve Newton]]'s second season, in 1987\u201388, the team finished with a 13-15 record.<ref name=MS09-10p115>{{cite book|title=2009-10 Murray State Racers Men's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=[[Murray State University]]|page=115|year=2009|url=http://issuu.com/murraystate/docs/msu_basketball_09-10_guide/115?mode=a_p}}</ref> This marked the last time the Racers had a losing season; only [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]], [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], and [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] hold longer streaks.<ref name=CBEp99/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=5220312|title=Capel sees brighter days ahead for OU|date=25 May 2010|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=25 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Murray's win in 1988, two years later the No. 16 seed Racers took No. 1 seed [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] into overtime before falling 75-71. The loss in 1990 was the closest a 16 seeded team had ever come to knocking off a No. 1 seeded team in the tournament.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''. March 28, 1998. p 3B.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015130/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Rookie Of The Year | date=22 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999\u20132000 season with a 23-9 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times. November 19, 2004. p B3</ref>\n\nIn the 2006 tournament, junior guard Trey Pearson missed a critical 3-point shot in the final seconds of the first-round game against No. 3 seeded defending champion [[2005\u201306 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]].  UNC was fouled on the rebound and went to the line to sink the game clinching shots to defeat the No. 14 seeded Racers 69-65.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

The team's 23-0 start under Prohm was the best start to a season in team history. The 23-0 start beat the previous best start record of 16-0 set by the 1935\u201336 men's basketball team under [[Carlisle Cutchin]].

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''. March 28, 1998. p 3B.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015130/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Rookie Of The Year | date=22 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999\u20132000 season with a 23-9 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].
