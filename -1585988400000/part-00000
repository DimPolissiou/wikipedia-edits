It lies within the geologically-defined area known as the [[Newer Volcanics Province]], which stretches from western Victoria to south-eastern [[South Australia]] and the youngest volcanic area in Australia.\n\nIt is situated within the [[Budj Bim National Park]]. Budj Bim is the [[Gunditjmara]] name, meaning \"High Head\". The roughly [[conical]] peak rises {{convert|178|m|ft|0}}. The peak is a [[scoria]] hill that was thrown up beside a group of three overlapping [[volcanic crater]]s that now contain '''Lake Surprise'''. A line of smaller craters and scoria cones runs to the southeast. [[Lava flow]]s extend to form a [[shield volcano]] and are fed by several [[lava channel]]s, or \"lava canals\" as they are known locally. This lava flow, known as the Tyrendarra lava flow, changed the drainage pattern of the region, and created large [[wetlands]].\n\nLarge areas to the west and south-west of the mountain have been [[heritage-listed]]. The [[Budj Bim heritage areas]] include the Tyrendarra [[Indigenous Protected Area]] (declared December 2003), the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape (added to the [[National Heritage List]] in July 2004), and the Budj Bim Cultural Landscape (designated a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in July 2019).\n\n==Formation==\nThe volcano lies within the Newer Volcanics Province, an area defined by its [[geological]] features. This covers an area of {{convert|15,000|km2}}, with over 400 small [[shield volcano]]es and [[volcanic vent]]s, and contains the youngest [[volcano]]es in Australia.<ref>{{cite web | title=Global Volcanism Program | website=Smithsonian Institution &#124; Global Volcanism Program | url=https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=259010 | access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nInitial estimates of the age of the eruption of Budj Bim were all \"minimum ages\", based on [[swamp]]s that formed some time after the eruption and ranged from 6,000 to 27,000 years [[before present|BP]].<ref name=\"kg-age\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hamilton-field-naturalists-club-victoria.org.au/images/pdf/D/VolcAgesKG.pdf |title=The Ages of Our Volcanoes |accessdate=2014-08-05 |first=Ken |last=Grimes |year=2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808050342/http://www.hamilton-field-naturalists-club-victoria.org.au/images/pdf/D/VolcAgesKG.pdf |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later evidence suggested that the eruption was at least 30,000 BP (using dated [[sediment]]s in the floor of the Lake Surprise crater<ref name=\"kg-age\"/>) and could have been as long as 40,000 years ago for the Tyrendarra lava flow.<ref name=\"kg-age\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hamilton-field-naturalists-club-victoria.org.au/images/pdf/D/VolcAgesKG.pdf |title=The Ages of Our Volcanoes |accessdate=2014-08-05 |first=Ken |last=Grimes |year=2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808050342/http://www.hamilton-field-naturalists-club-victoria.org.au/images/pdf/D/VolcAgesKG.pdf |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Research published in February 2020 using [[Argon\u2013argon dating|argon\u2013argon dating]], a method of [[radiometric dating]], has dated the eruption at around 36,900 years ago.

{"title_page": "Dual quaternion", "text_new": "[[File:Quaternion Plaque on Broom Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on Broom bridge (Dublin) commemorating Hamilton's invention of quaternions]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''dual quaternions''' are an 8-dimensional real [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] isomorphic to the [[tensor product]] of the [[quaternions]] and the [[dual numbers]].  Thus, they may be constructed in the same way as the quaternions, except using [[dual number]]s instead of [[real number]]s as coefficients.  A dual quaternion can be represented in the form {{nowrap|''A'' + \u03b5''B''}}, where ''A'' and ''B'' are ordinary quaternions and \u03b5 is the dual unit, which satisfies {{nowrap|1=\u03b5<sup>2</sup> = 0}} and commutes with every element of the algebra.  \nUnlike quaternions, the dual quaternions do not form a [[division algebra]].\n\nIn [[mechanics]], the dual quaternions are applied as a [[number system]] to represent [[rigid transformation]]s in three dimensions.<ref>A.T. Yang, ''Application of Quaternion Algebra and Dual Numbers to the Analysis of Spatial Mechanisms'', Ph.D thesis, Columbia University, 1963.</ref>   Since the space of dual quaternions is 8-dimensional and a rigid transformation have six real degrees of freedom, three for translations and three for rotations, dual quaternions obeying two algebraic constraints are used in this application.\n\nSimilar to the way that rotations in 3d space can be represented by quaternions of unit length, rigid motions in 3d space can be represented by dual quaternions of unit length.  This fact is used in theoretical [[kinematics]] (see McCarthy<ref name=\"mccarthy\"/>), and in applications to 3D [[computer graphics]], [[robot]]ics and [[computer vision]].<ref>[http://www.dsi.unive.it/~rodola/cvpr11-dual.pdf A.

P. Kotelnikov (1895) ''Screw calculus and some applications to geometry and mechanics'', Annal. Imp. Univ. Kazan</ref> developed dual vectors and dual quaternions for use in the study of mechanics.\n\nIn 1891 [[Eduard Study]] realized that this [[associative algebra]] was ideal for describing the group of motions of [[three-dimensional space]]. He further developed the idea in ''Geometrie der Dynamen'' in 1901.<ref>[[Eduard Study]] (1901) ''Geometrie der Dynamen'', Teubner, Leipzig</ref> \n[[B.

Bottema and B. Roth, ''Theoretical Kinematics'', North Holland Publ. Co., 1979]</ref>\n\nA quaternion is a linear combination of the basis elements 1, ''i'', ''j'', and ''k''.  Hamilton's product rule for ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' is often written as\n:<math> i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 .</math>\nCompute {{nowrap|''i'' ( ''i j k'' ) {{=}} \u2212''j k'' {{=}} \u2212''i''}}, to obtain {{nowrap|''j k'' {{=}} ''i''}}, and {{nowrap|( ''i j k'' ) ''k'' {{=}} \u2212''i j'' {{=}} \u2212''k''}} or {{nowrap|''i j'' {{=}} ''k''}}. Now because {{nowrap|''j'' ( ''j k'' ) {{=}} ''j i'' {{=}} \u2212''k''}}, we see that this product yields {{nowrap|''i j'' {{=}} \u2212''j i''}}, which links quaternions to the properties of determinants.\n\nA convenient way to work with the quaternion product is to write a quaternion as the sum of a scalar and a vector, that is {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub> + '''A'''}}, where ''a''<sub>0</sub> is a real number and {{nowrap|'''A''' {{=}} ''A''<sub>1</sub> ''i'' + ''A''<sub>2</sub> ''j'' + ''A''<sub>3</sub> ''k''}} is a three dimensional vector.  The vector dot and cross operations can now be used to define the quaternion product of {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub> + '''A'''}} and {{nowrap|''C'' {{=}} ''c''<sub>0</sub> + '''C'''}} as\n<!--reformatted this equation\n:G = AC = (a<sub>0</sub>+'''A''')(c<sub>0</sub>+'''C''') = (a<sub>0</sub>c<sub>0</sub> \u2212 '''A'''\u00b7'''C''') + (c<sub>0</sub>'''A''' + a<sub>0</sub>'''C''' + '''A'''\u00d7'''C''').\n-->\n:<math> G = AC = (a_0 + \\mathbf{A})(c_0 + \\mathbf{C}) = (a_0 c_0 - \\mathbf{A}\\cdot \\mathbf{C}) + (c_0 \\mathbf{A} + a_0 \\mathbf{C} + \\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{C}).</math>\n\nA dual quaternion is usually described as a quaternion with dual numbers as coefficients.  A [[dual number]] is an ordered pair {{nowrap|''\u00e2'' {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' )}}.  Two dual numbers add componentwise and multiply by the rule {{nowrap|''\u00e2 \u0109'' {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' ) ( ''c'', ''d'' ) {{=}} (''a c'', ''a d'' + ''b c'')}}.  Dual numbers are often written in the form {{nowrap|''\u00e2'' {{=}} ''a'' + \u03b5''b''}}, where \u03b5 is the dual unit that commutes with ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' and has the property {{nowrap|\u03b5<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 0}}.\n\nThe result is that a dual quaternion <!-- :\u00c2 = A + \u03b5B--> can be written as an ordered pair of quaternions {{nowrap|( ''A'', ''B'' )}}.  Two dual quaternions add componentwise and multiply by the rule,\n<!-- reformatted this equation\n:\u00c2\u0108 = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC).\n-->\n:<math> \\hat{A}\\hat{C} = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC).</math>\nIt is convenient to write a dual quaternion as the sum of a dual scalar and a dual vector, {{nowrap|''\u00c2'' {{=}} ''\u00e2''<sub>0</sub> + ''A''}}, where {{nowrap|''\u00e2''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' )}} and {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ( '''A''', '''B''' )}} is the dual vector that defines a [[screw theory|screw]].

In particular, if {{nowrap|''\u00c2'' {{=}} ''\u00e2''<sub>0</sub> + ''A''}}, then\n:<math> \\mbox{Sc}(\\hat{A}) = \\hat{a}_0, \\mbox{Vec}(\\hat{A}) = \\mathsf{A}.\\!</math>\nThis allows the definition of the conjugate of ''\u00c2'' as\n:<math> \\hat{A}^* = \\mbox{Sc}(\\hat{A}) - \\mbox{Vec}(\\hat{A}).\\!</math>\nor, \n:<math> (\\hat{a}_0+\\mathsf{A})^* = \\hat{a}_0 - \\mathsf{A}.\\!</math>\n\nThe product of a dual quaternion with its conjugate yields\n:<math>\\hat{A}\\hat{A}^* = (\\hat{a}_0+\\mathsf{A})(\\hat{a}_0 - \\mathsf{A}) = \\hat{a}_0^2 + \\mathsf{A}\\cdot\\mathsf{A}.\\!</math>\nThis is a dual scalar which is the ''magnitude squared'' of the dual quaternion.\n\n===Dual number conjugate===\n\nA second type of conjugate of a dual quaternion is given by taking the dual number conjugate, given by\n:<math> \\overline{\\hat{A}} = (A, -B) = A - \\varepsilon B. \\!</math>\n\nThe quaternion and dual number conjugates can be combined into a third form of conjugate given by\n:<math> \\overline{\\hat{A}^*} = (A^*, -B^*) = A^* - \\varepsilon B^*. \\!</math>\n\nIn the context of dual quaternions, the term \"conjugate\" can be used to mean the quaternion conjugate, dual number conjugate, or both.\n\n=== Norm ===\nThe ''norm'' of a dual quaternion {{abs|''\u00c2''}} is computed using the conjugate to compute {{nowrap|{{abs|''\u00c2''}} {{=}} {{radic|''\u00c2 \u00c2''<sup>*</sup>}}}}.  This is a dual number called the ''magnitude'' of the dual quaternion.  Dual quaternions with {{nowrap|{{abs|''\u00c2''}} {{=}} 1}} are ''unit dual quaternions''.\n\nDual quaternions of magnitude 1 are used to represent spatial Euclidean displacements. Notice that the requirement that {{nowrap|''\u00c2 \u00c2''<sup>*</sup>}} {{=}} 1, introduces two algebraic constraints on the components of ''\u00c2'', that is\n:<math> \\hat{A}\\hat{A}^* = (A, B)(A^*, B^*) = (AA^*, AB^* + BA^*) = (1, 0).\\!</math>\n\n=== Inverse ===\nIf {{nowrap|''p'' + \u03b5 ''q''}} is a dual quaternion, and ''p'' is not zero, then the inverse dual quaternion is given by \n:''p''<sup>&minus;1</sup> (1 &minus; \u03b5 ''q'' ''p''<sup>&minus;1</sup>).\nThus the elements of the subspace {{nowrap|{ \u03b5 q : q \u2208 H } }} do not have inverses. This subspace is called an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in ring theory. It happens to be the unique [[maximal ideal]] of the ring of dual numbers.\n\nThe [[group of units]] of the dual number ring then consists of numbers not in the ideal. The dual numbers form a [[local ring]] since there is a unique maximal ideal. The group of units is a [[Lie group]] and can be studied using the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential mapping]]. Dual quaternions have been used to exhibit transformations in the [[Euclidean group]]. A typical element can be written as a [[screw theory#Homography|screw transformation]].\n\n== Dual quaternions and spatial displacements ==\nA benefit of the dual quaternion formulation of the composition of two spatial displacements ''D''<sub>''B''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;([''R''<sub>''B''</sub>], '''b''') and ''D''<sub>''A''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;([''R''<sub>''A''</sub>],'''a''') is that the resulting dual quaternion yields directly the [[screw axis]] and dual angle of the composite displacement ''D''<sub>''C''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''D''<sub>''B''</sub>''D''<sub>''A''</sub>.\n\nIn general, the dual quaternion associated with a spatial displacement ''D''&nbsp;=&nbsp;([''A''],&nbsp;'''d''') is constructed from its [[screw axis]] ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;('''S''',&nbsp;'''V''') and the dual angle (''\u03c6'',&nbsp;''d'') where ''\u03c6'' is the rotation about and ''d'' the slide along this axis, which defines the displacement&nbsp;''D''.  The associated dual quaternion is given by,\n:<math> \\hat{S} = \\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\phi}}{2} + \\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\phi}}{2} \\mathsf{S}. </math>\n\nLet the composition of the displacement D<sub>B</sub> with D<sub>A</sub> be the displacement ''D''<sub>''C''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''D''<sub>''B''</sub>''D''<sub>''A''</sub>.  The screw axis and dual angle of D<sub>C</sub> is obtained from the product of the dual quaternions of D<sub>A</sub> and D<sub>B</sub>, given by\n:<math>\\hat{A}=\\cos(\\hat{\\alpha}/2)+ \\sin(\\hat{\\alpha}/2)\\mathsf{A}\\quad\n\\text{and}\\quad \\hat{B}=\\cos(\\hat{\\beta}/2)+ \\sin(\\hat{\\beta}/2)\\mathsf{B}.</math>\nThat is, the composite displacement D<sub>C</sub>=D<sub>B</sub>D<sub>A</sub> has the associated dual quaternion given by\n:<math> \\hat{C}  = \\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2}+\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2}\\mathsf{C}\n=\n\\Big(\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}+\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\mathsf{B}\\Big) \\Big(\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2}+\n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2}\\mathsf{A}\\Big).\n</math>\n\nExpand this product in order to obtain\n:<math>\n\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2}+\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2} \\mathsf{C}  =\n\\Big(\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} - \n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\cdot \\mathsf{A}\\Big)  +  \\Big(\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B} + \n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2} \\mathsf{A} + \n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\times \\mathsf{A}\\Big).\n</math>\n\nDivide both sides of this equation by the identity\n:<math> \\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2} = \\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} - \n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\cdot \\mathsf{A}</math>\nto obtain\n:<math> \\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2} \\mathsf{C}  = \\frac{\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\mathsf{B} + \n\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{A} + \n\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\times \\mathsf{A}}{1 - \n\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\cdot \\mathsf{A}}.\n</math>\n\nThis is [[Olinde Rodrigues|Rodrigues]]' formula for the screw axis of a composite displacement defined in terms of the screw axes of the two displacements.  He derived this formula in 1840.<ref>Rodrigues, O.

Notice that the components of the vector part of the quaternion are listed first and the scalar is listed last.  This is an arbitrary choice, but once this convention is selected we must abide by it.\n\nThe quaternion product AC can now be represented as the matrix product\n:<math> \nAC = [A^+] C =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_0 & A_3 & -A_2 & A_1 \\\\\n-A_3 & a_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\\\\nA_2 & -A_1 & a_0  & A_3 \\\\\n-A_1 & -A_2 & -A_3 & a_0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} C_1 \\\\ C_2 \\\\ C_3 \\\\ c_0 \\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe product AC can also be viewed as an operation by C on the components of A, in which case we have\n:<math>\nAC = [C^-] A = \\begin{bmatrix}\nc_0 & C_3 & -C_2 & C_1 \\\\\n-C_3 & c_0 & C_1 & C_2 \\\\\nC_2 & -C_1 & c_0  & C_3 \\\\\n-C_1 & -C_2 & -C_3 & c_0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} A_1 \\\\ A_2 \\\\ A_3 \\\\ a_0 \\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe dual quaternion product \u00c2\u0108 = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC) can be formulated as a matrix operation as follows.  Assemble the components of \u0108 into the eight dimensional array \u0108 = (C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, c<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, d<sub>0</sub>), then \u00c2\u0108 is given by the 8x8 matrix product\n:<math>\n\\hat{A}\\hat{C} = [\\hat{A}^+]\\hat{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} A^+ & 0 \\\\ B^+ & A^+ \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{Bmatrix} C \\\\ D\\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nAs we saw for quaternions, the product \u00c2\u0108 can be viewed as the operation of \u0108 on the coordinate vector \u00c2, which means \u00c2\u0108 can also be formulated as,\n:<math>\n\\hat{A}\\hat{C} = [\\hat{C}^-]\\hat{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} C^- & 0 \\\\ D^- & C^- \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{Bmatrix} A \\\\ B\\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\n== More on spatial displacements ==\nThe dual quaternion of a displacement D=([A], '''d''') can be constructed from the quaternion S=cos(\u03c6/2) + sin(\u03c6/2)'''S''' that defines the rotation [A] and the vector quaternion constructed from the translation vector '''d''', given by D = d<sub>1</sub>i + d<sub>2</sub>j + d<sub>3</sub>k.   Using this notation, the dual quaternion for the displacement D=([A], '''d''') is given by\n:<math> \\hat{S} = S + \\varepsilon \\frac{1}{2}DS. </math>\n\nLet the Pl\u00fccker coordinates of a line in the direction '''x''' through a point '''p''' in a moving body and its coordinates in the fixed frame which is in the direction '''X''' through the point '''P''' be given by,\n:<math>\\hat{x}=\\mathbf{x} + \\varepsilon \\mathbf{p}\\times\\mathbf{x}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\hat{X}=\\mathbf{X} + \\varepsilon \\mathbf{P}\\times\\mathbf{X}.</math>\nThen the dual quaternion of the displacement of this body transforms Pl\u00fccker coordinates in the moving frame to Pl\u00fccker coordinates in the fixed frame by the formula\n:<math>\\hat{X} = \\hat{S}\\hat{x}\\overline{\\hat{S}^*}.</math>\n\nUsing the matrix form of the dual quaternion product this becomes,\n:<math>\\hat{X} =[\\hat{S}^+][\\hat{S}^-]^*\\hat{x}.</math>\nThis calculation is easily managed using matrix operations.\n\n== Dual quaternions and 4\u00d74 homogeneous transforms ==\nIt might be helpful, especially in rigid body motion, to represent dual quaternions as [[homogeneous transformation matrix|homogeneous matrices]]. As given above a dual quaternion can be written as: <math>\\hat q = r + d\\varepsilon</math> where ''r'' and ''d'' are both quaternions. The ''r'' quaternion is known as the real or rotational part and the <math>d</math> quaternion is known as the dual or displacement part.\n\nThe rotation part can be given by\n:<math>r = r_w + r_xi + r_yj + r_zk = \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) + \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\left( \\vec{a} \\cdot (i, j, k) \\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle of rotation about the direction given by unit vector <math>\\vec{a}</math>. The displacement part can be written as\n\n:<math>d = 0 + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}i + \\frac{\\Delta y}{2}j + \\frac{\\Delta z}{2}k</math>.\n\nThe dual-quaternion equivalent of a 3D-vector is\n\n:<math>\\hat v := 1 + \\varepsilon (v_x i + v_y j + v_z k)</math>\n\nand its transformation by <math>\\hat q</math> is given by<ref>[https://www.cs.utah.edu/~ladislav/kavan06dual/kavan06dual.pdf Dual Quaternions for Rigid Transformation Blending], p. 4.</ref>\n:<math>\\hat{v}' = \\hat q \\cdot \\hat v \\cdot \\overline{\\hat q^*}</math>.\n\nThese dual quaternions (or actually their transformations on 3D-vectors) can be represented by the homogeneous transformation matrix\n:<math> T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  \\\\\n\\Delta x  &   &   &  \\\\\n\\Delta y  &   & R &  \\\\\n\\Delta z  &   &   &  \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nwhere the 3\u00d73 [[orthogonal matrix]] is given by\n:<math>R =\\begin{pmatrix}\nr_w^2+r_x^2-r_y^2-r_z^2   &2r_xr_y-2r_wr_z           &2r_xr_z+2r_wr_y        \\\\\n2r_xr_y+2r_wr_z           &r_w^2-r_x^2+r_y^2-r_z^2 &2r_yr_z-2r_wr_x        \\\\\n2r_xr_z-2r_wr_y           &2r_yr_z+2r_wr_x         &r_w^2-r_x^2-r_y^2+r_z^2\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nFor the 3D-vector\n:<math> v = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\nv_x \\\\\nv_y \\\\\nv_z \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nthe transformation by T is given by\n\n:<math>\\vec{v}' =  T \\cdot  \\vec{v}</math>\n\n==Connection to Clifford algebras==\n\nBesides being the tensor product of two Clifford algebras, the quaternions and the [[dual numbers]], the dual quaternions have two other formulations in terms of Clifford algebras.\n\nFirst, dual quaternions are isomorphic to the [[Clifford algebra]] generated by 3 anticommuting elements i, j, e with i<sup>2</sup> = j<sup>2</sup> = -1 and e<sup>2</sup> = 0.  If we define k = ij and \u03b5 = k, then the relations defining the dual quaternions are implied by these and vice versa.  Second, the dual quaternions are isomorphic to the even part of the Clifford algebra generated by 4 anticommuting elements <math>e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4</math> with\n:<math> e_1 ^2 = e_2^2 =e_3^2 = -1, \\,\\, e_4^2 =0.</math>\nFor details, see [[Clifford algebra#Dual quaternions|Clifford algebras: dual quaternions]].\n\n==Eponyms==\nSince both  [[Eduard Study]] and [[William Kingdon Clifford]] used and wrote about dual quaternions, at times authors refer to dual quaternions as \"Study biquaternions\" or \"Clifford biquaternions\". The latter [[eponym]] has also been used to refer to [[split-biquaternion]]s. Read the article by Joe Rooney linked below for view of a supporter of W.K. Clifford's claim. Since the claims of Clifford and Study are in contention, it is convenient to use the current designation ''dual quaternion'' to avoid conflict.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Screw theory]]\n* [[Rational motion]]\n* [[Quaternions and spatial rotation]]\n* [[Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles]]\n* [[Olinde Rodrigues]]\n* [[Dual complex number]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* A.T.

Thus, they may be constructed in the same way as the quaternions, except using [[dual number]]s instead of [[real number]]s as coefficients.  A dual quaternion can be represented in the form {{nowrap|''A'' + \u03b5''B''}}, where ''A'' and ''B'' are ordinary quaternions and \u03b5 is the dual unit, which satisfies {{nowrap|1=\u03b5<sup>2</sup> = 0}} and commutes with every element of the algebra.  \nUnlike quaternions, the dual quaternions do not form a [[division algebra]].\n\nIn [[mechanics]], the dual quaternions are applied as a [[number system]] to represent [[rigid transformation]]s in three dimensions.<ref>A.T.

Hamilton's product rule for ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' is often written as\n:<math> i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 .</math>\nCompute {{nowrap|''i'' ( ''i j k'' ) {{=}} \u2212''j k'' {{=}} \u2212''i''}}, to obtain {{nowrap|''j k'' {{=}} ''i''}}, and {{nowrap|( ''i j k'' ) ''k'' {{=}} \u2212''i j'' {{=}} \u2212''k''}} or {{nowrap|''i j'' {{=}} ''k''}}. Now because {{nowrap|''j'' ( ''j k'' ) {{=}} ''j i'' {{=}} \u2212''k''}}, we see that this product yields {{nowrap|''i j'' {{=}} \u2212''j i''}}, which links quaternions to the properties of determinants.\n\nA convenient way to work with the quaternion product is to write a quaternion as the sum of a scalar and a vector, that is {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub> + '''A'''}}, where ''a''<sub>0</sub> is a real number and {{nowrap|'''A''' {{=}} ''A''<sub>1</sub> ''i'' + ''A''<sub>2</sub> ''j'' + ''A''<sub>3</sub> ''k''}} is a three dimensional vector.

A [[dual number]] is an ordered pair {{nowrap|''\u00e2'' {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' )}}.  Two dual numbers add componentwise and multiply by the rule {{nowrap|''\u00e2 \u0109'' {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' ) ( ''c'', ''d'' ) {{=}} (''a c'', ''a d'' + ''b c'')}}.  Dual numbers are often written in the form {{nowrap|''\u00e2'' {{=}} ''a'' + \u03b5''b''}}, where \u03b5 is the dual unit that commutes with ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' and has the property {{nowrap|\u03b5<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 0}}.\n\nThe result is that a dual quaternion <!-- :\u00c2 = A + \u03b5B--> can be written as an ordered pair of quaternions {{nowrap|( ''A'', ''B'' )}}.  Two dual quaternions add componentwise and multiply by the rule,\n<!-- reformatted this equation\n:\u00c2\u0108 = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC).\n-->\n:<math> \\hat{A}\\hat{C} = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC).</math>\nIt is convenient to write a dual quaternion as the sum of a dual scalar and a dual vector, {{nowrap|''\u00c2'' {{=}} ''\u00e2''<sub>0</sub> + ''A''}}, where {{nowrap|''\u00e2''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' )}} and {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ( '''A''', '''B''' )}} is the dual vector that defines a [[screw theory|screw]].

This is a dual number called the ''magnitude'' of the dual quaternion.  Dual quaternions with {{nowrap|{{abs|''\u00c2''}} {{=}} 1}} are ''unit dual quaternions''.\n\nDual quaternions of magnitude 1 are used to represent spatial Euclidean displacements. Notice that the requirement that {{nowrap|''\u00c2 \u00c2''<sup>*</sup>}} {{=}} 1, introduces two algebraic constraints on the components of ''\u00c2'', that is\n:<math> \\hat{A}\\hat{A}^* = (A, B)(A^*, B^*) = (AA^*, AB^* + BA^*) = (1, 0).\\!</math>\n\n=== Inverse ===\nIf {{nowrap|''p'' + \u03b5 ''q''}} is a dual quaternion, and ''p'' is not zero, then the inverse dual quaternion is given by \n:''p''<sup>&minus;1</sup> (1 &minus; \u03b5 ''q'' ''p''<sup>&minus;1</sup>).\nThus the elements of the subspace {{nowrap|{ \u03b5 q : q \u2208 H } }} do not have inverses. This subspace is called an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in ring theory. It happens to be the unique [[maximal ideal]] of the ring of dual numbers.\n\nThe [[group of units]] of the dual number ring then consists of numbers not in the ideal. The dual numbers form a [[local ring]] since there is a unique maximal ideal. The group of units is a [[Lie group]] and can be studied using the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential mapping]]. Dual quaternions have been used to exhibit transformations in the [[Euclidean group]]. A typical element can be written as a [[screw theory#Homography|screw transformation]].\n\n== Dual quaternions and spatial displacements ==\nA benefit of the dual quaternion formulation of the composition of two spatial displacements ''D''<sub>''B''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;([''R''<sub>''B''</sub>], '''b''') and ''D''<sub>''A''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;([''R''<sub>''A''</sub>],'''a''') is that the resulting dual quaternion yields directly the [[screw axis]] and dual angle of the composite displacement ''D''<sub>''C''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''D''<sub>''B''</sub>''D''<sub>''A''</sub>.\n\nIn general, the dual quaternion associated with a spatial displacement ''D''&nbsp;=&nbsp;([''A''],&nbsp;'''d''') is constructed from its [[screw axis]] ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;('''S''',&nbsp;'''V''') and the dual angle (''\u03c6'',&nbsp;''d'') where ''\u03c6'' is the rotation about and ''d'' the slide along this axis, which defines the displacement&nbsp;''D''.

Notice that the components of the vector part of the quaternion are listed first and the scalar is listed last.  This is an arbitrary choice, but once this convention is selected we must abide by it.\n\nThe quaternion product AC can now be represented as the matrix product\n:<math> \nAC = [A^+] C =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_0 & A_3 & -A_2 & A_1 \\\\\n-A_3 & a_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\\\\nA_2 & -A_1 & a_0  & A_3 \\\\\n-A_1 & -A_2 & -A_3 & a_0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} C_1 \\\\ C_2 \\\\ C_3 \\\\ c_0 \\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe product AC can also be viewed as an operation by C on the components of A, in which case we have\n:<math>\nAC = [C^-] A = \\begin{bmatrix}\nc_0 & C_3 & -C_2 & C_1 \\\\\n-C_3 & c_0 & C_1 & C_2 \\\\\nC_2 & -C_1 & c_0  & C_3 \\\\\n-C_1 & -C_2 & -C_3 & c_0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} A_1 \\\\ A_2 \\\\ A_3 \\\\ a_0 \\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe dual quaternion product \u00c2\u0108 = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC) can be formulated as a matrix operation as follows.  Assemble the components of \u0108 into the eight dimensional array \u0108 = (C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, c<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, d<sub>0</sub>), then \u00c2\u0108 is given by the 8x8 matrix product\n:<math>\n\\hat{A}\\hat{C} = [\\hat{A}^+]\\hat{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} A^+ & 0 \\\\ B^+ & A^+ \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{Bmatrix} C \\\\ D\\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nAs we saw for quaternions, the product \u00c2\u0108 can be viewed as the operation of \u0108 on the coordinate vector \u00c2, which means \u00c2\u0108 can also be formulated as,\n:<math>\n\\hat{A}\\hat{C} = [\\hat{C}^-]\\hat{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} C^- & 0 \\\\ D^- & C^- \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{Bmatrix} A \\\\ B\\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\n== More on spatial displacements ==\nThe dual quaternion of a displacement D=([A], '''d''') can be constructed from the quaternion S=cos(\u03c6/2) + sin(\u03c6/2)'''S''' that defines the rotation [A] and the vector quaternion constructed from the translation vector '''d''', given by D = d<sub>1</sub>i + d<sub>2</sub>j + d<sub>3</sub>k.   Using this notation, the dual quaternion for the displacement D=([A], '''d''') is given by\n:<math> \\hat{S} = S + \\varepsilon \\frac{1}{2}DS. </math>\n\nLet the Pl\u00fccker coordinates of a line in the direction '''x''' through a point '''p''' in a moving body and its coordinates in the fixed frame which is in the direction '''X''' through the point '''P''' be given by,\n:<math>\\hat{x}=\\mathbf{x} + \\varepsilon \\mathbf{p}\\times\\mathbf{x}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\hat{X}=\\mathbf{X} + \\varepsilon \\mathbf{P}\\times\\mathbf{X}.</math>\nThen the dual quaternion of the displacement of this body transforms Pl\u00fccker coordinates in the moving frame to Pl\u00fccker coordinates in the fixed frame by the formula\n:<math>\\hat{X} = \\hat{S}\\hat{x}\\overline{\\hat{S}^*}.</math>\n\nUsing the matrix form of the dual quaternion product this becomes,\n:<math>\\hat{X} =[\\hat{S}^+][\\hat{S}^-]^*\\hat{x}.</math>\nThis calculation is easily managed using matrix operations.\n\n== Dual quaternions and 4\u00d74 homogeneous transforms ==\nIt might be helpful, especially in rigid body motion, to represent dual quaternions as [[homogeneous transformation matrix|homogeneous matrices]]. As given above a dual quaternion can be written as: <math>\\hat q = r + d\\varepsilon</math> where ''r'' and ''d'' are both quaternions. The ''r'' quaternion is known as the real or rotational part and the <math>d</math> quaternion is known as the dual or displacement part.\n\nThe rotation part can be given by\n:<math>r = r_w + r_xi + r_yj + r_zk = \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) + \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\left( \\vec{a} \\cdot (i, j, k) \\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle of rotation about the direction given by unit vector <math>\\vec{a}</math>. The displacement part can be written as\n\n:<math>d = 0 + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}i + \\frac{\\Delta y}{2}j + \\frac{\\Delta z}{2}k</math>.\n\nThe dual-quaternion equivalent of a 3D-vector is\n\n:<math>\\hat v := 1 + \\varepsilon (v_x i + v_y j + v_z k)</math>\n\nand its transformation by <math>\\hat q</math> is given by<ref>[https://www.cs.utah.edu/~ladislav/kavan06dual/kavan06dual.pdf Dual Quaternions for Rigid Transformation Blending], p. 4.</ref>\n:<math>\\hat{v}' = \\hat q \\cdot \\hat v \\cdot \\overline{\\hat q^*}</math>.\n\nThese dual quaternions (or actually their transformations on 3D-vectors) can be represented by the homogeneous transformation matrix\n:<math> T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  \\\\\n\\Delta x  &   &   &  \\\\\n\\Delta y  &   & R &  \\\\\n\\Delta z  &   &   &  \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nwhere the 3\u00d73 [[orthogonal matrix]] is given by\n:<math>R =\\begin{pmatrix}\nr_w^2+r_x^2-r_y^2-r_z^2   &2r_xr_y-2r_wr_z           &2r_xr_z+2r_wr_y        \\\\\n2r_xr_y+2r_wr_z           &r_w^2-r_x^2+r_y^2-r_z^2 &2r_yr_z-2r_wr_x        \\\\\n2r_xr_z-2r_wr_y           &2r_yr_z+2r_wr_x         &r_w^2-r_x^2-r_y^2+r_z^2\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nFor the 3D-vector\n:<math> v = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\nv_x \\\\\nv_y \\\\\nv_z \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nthe transformation by T is given by\n\n:<math>\\vec{v}' =  T \\cdot  \\vec{v}</math>\n\n==Connection to Clifford algebras==\n\nBesides being the tensor product of two Clifford algebras, the quaternions and the [[dual numbers]], the dual quaternions have two other formulations in terms of Clifford algebras.\n\nFirst, dual quaternions are isomorphic to the [[Clifford algebra]] generated by 3 anticommuting elements i, j, e with i<sup>2</sup> = j<sup>2</sup> = -1 and e<sup>2</sup> = 0.  If we define k = ij and \u03b5 = k, then the relations defining the dual quaternions are implied by these and vice versa.  Second, the dual quaternions are isomorphic to the even part of the Clifford algebra generated by 4 anticommuting elements <math>e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4</math> with\n:<math> e_1 ^2 = e_2^2 =e_3^2 = -1, \\,\\, e_4^2 =0.</math>\nFor details, see [[Clifford algebra#Dual quaternions|Clifford algebras: dual quaternions]].\n\n==Eponyms==\nSince both  [[Eduard Study]] and [[William Kingdon Clifford]] used and wrote about dual quaternions, at times authors refer to dual quaternions as \"Study biquaternions\" or \"Clifford biquaternions\". The latter [[eponym]] has also been used to refer to [[split-biquaternion]]s. Read the article by Joe Rooney linked below for view of a supporter of W.K. Clifford's claim. Since the claims of Clifford and Study are in contention, it is convenient to use the current designation ''dual quaternion'' to avoid conflict.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Screw theory]]\n* [[Rational motion]]\n* [[Quaternions and spatial rotation]]\n* [[Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles]]\n* [[Olinde Rodrigues]]\n* [[Dual complex number]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* A.T.

Buffalo had been left out of the league since the All-Americans (by that point renamed the Bisons) folded in 1929; the Bills were no less than the third professional non-NFL team to compete in the city before the merger, following the [[Buffalo Indians|Indians/Tigers]] of the early 1940s and [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|an earlier team named the Bills]], originally the Bisons, in the late 1940s in the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).\n\nFollowing the AFL\u2013NFL merger, the Bills were generally mediocre in the 1970s, but featured All-Pro running back [[O. J. Simpson]]. After being pushed to the brink of failure in the mid-1980s, the collapse of the [[United States Football League]] and a series of highly drafted players such as [[Jim Kelly]] (who initially played for the USFL instead of the Bills), [[Thurman Thomas]], and [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]] allowed the Bills to rebuild into a perennial contender in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, a period in which the team won four consecutive [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championships]]; the team nevertheless lost all four subsequent [[Super Bowl]]s, records in both categories that still stand.\n\nThe rise of the division rival [[New England Patriots]] under [[Tom Brady]], along with numerous failed attempts at rebuilding in the 2000s and 2010s, prevented the Bills from reaching the playoffs in seventeen consecutive seasons between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year drought that was the longest active playoff drought in all major professional sports at the time. It was broken when the Bills secured a wild-card berth on December 31, 2017. On October 8, 2014, [[Buffalo Sabres]] owners Terry and Kim Pegula received unanimous approval to acquire the Bills during the NFL owners' meetings, becoming the second ownership group of the team after team founder [[Ralph Wilson]].<ref name=\"SesslerBills\" />\n\n===Name origins===\nIn 1947 a contest was held to rename the AAFC Bisons, which was owned by James Breuil of the [[Frontier Oil Company]].

A darker shade of blue was introduced as the main jersey color, and nickel gray was introduced as an accent color. Both the blue and white jerseys featured red side panels. The white jerseys included a dark blue shoulder yoke and royal blue numbers. The helmet remained primarily red with one navy blue, two nickel, two royal blue, two white stripes, and white face mask. A new logo, a stylized \"B\" consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo. The helmet logo adopted in 1974\u2014a charging royal blue bison, with a red streak, white horn and eyeball\u2014remained unchanged.\n\nIn [[2005 Buffalo Bills season|2005]], the Bills revived the standing bison helmet and uniform of the mid-1960s as a throwback uniform.\n\nThe Bills usually wore the all-blue combination at home and the all-white combination on the road when not wearing the throwback uniforms.

Though the Bills and [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] both originated in the [[American Football League]], the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team while the Bills were one of the original eight teams. The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent (the Bills defeated the Dolphins in their first matchup of the 1980s). Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of [[Jim Kelly]] as Buffalo's franchise quarterback, and though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback [[Dan Marino]] shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s. Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the rise of the New England Patriots, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo's primary rival,<ref name = \"2017primaryrivalpoll\"/> and the two teams have typically been close to each other in win-loss records. Miami leads the overall series 61\u201348\u20131 as of 2018, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 3\u20131, including a win in the [[1992\u201393 NFL playoffs|1992 AFC Championship Game]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=17%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}</ref>\n\n====New England Patriots====\n{{main|Bills\u2013Patriots rivalry}}\n\nThe rivalry with the [[New England Patriots]] first started when both teams were original franchises in the [[American Football League]] prior to the NFL-AFL merger. After the rise of head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and quarterback [[Tom Brady]] in New England, the Patriots have dominated the AFC East, including the Bills. The Bills-Patriots rivalry in particular has become lopsided as the Patriots are 31\u20135 against the Bills since Belichick became head coach in 2000. This has led many fans and players in the 2000s and beyond to replace the Dolphins with the Patriots as Buffalo's most hated rival.<ref name = \"2017primaryrivalpoll\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allcounted.com/share?view=summary&cid=stnbvll7tbrir&uid=|title=2017 Buffalo Bills Rivalry Survey|website=www.allcounted.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://247sports.com/nfl/buffalo-bills/Article/New-England-Patriots-named-as-Bills-biggest-rival-74981320|title = Patriots named as Bills biggest rival|website = 247Sports.com|date = July 5, 2016}}</ref> Overall, the Patriots lead the series 74\u201343\u20131 as of 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=19%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry is also notable as numerous players, including [[Drew Bledsoe]], [[Doug Flutie]], [[Lawyer Milloy]], [[Brandon Spikes]], [[Scott Chandler (American football)|Scott Chandler]], [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]], [[Mike Gillislee]] and [[Stephon Gilmore]] have played for both teams at some point in their careers.\n\n====New York Jets====\n{{main|Bills\u2013Jets rivalry}}\n\nThe Bills and [[New York Jets|Jets]] were both original AFL teams, and both represent the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], though the Jets (since 1984) actually play their games in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. While the rivalry represents the differences between [[New York City]] and [[Western New York]], it is not as intense as the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases either have grudging respect or low-key annoyance for each other when the teams are not playing one another. Oftentimes the Bills-Jets rivalry has become characterized by ugly games and shared mediocrity, but it has had a handful of competitive moments. The series heated up recently when former Jets head coach [[Rex Ryan]] became the Bills' head coach for two seasons, and has become notable again as Bills quarterback [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] and Jets quarterback [[Sam Darnold]], both drafted in the same year, maintain a friendly rivalry with one another.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/blog/buffalo-bills/post/_/id/33411/bills-josh-allen-and-jets-sam-darnold-close-friends-division-rivals |title=Bills' Josh Allen, Jets' Sam Darnold: Friendship before rivalry |last=Louis-Jacques |first=Marcell |date=2019-09-07 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> Buffalo leads the series 62\u201355 as of 2018, including a playoff win in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=22%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. New York Jets Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}</ref>\n\n===Other rivalries===\n\n====Tennessee Titans====\n{{See also|The Comeback (American football)|Music City Miracle}}\nThe [[Tennessee Titans]] (formerly the [[Houston Oilers]]) share an extended history with the Bills, both teams being original AFL clubs in 1960 and rivals in that league's East Division before the AFL-NFL merger.

Both teams occupy two of the smallest media markets in the NFL. After years of concurrent bottom feeding in the late 2000s and early 2010s, this rivalry has emerged after former Bills head coach [[Doug Marrone]], who had quit on the team after the 2014 season, was

The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' In the first three decades of the team's existence, the number 31 was only seen once: in 1969, when reserve running back [[Preston Ridlehuber]] damaged his number 36 jersey during a game, equipment manager Tony Marchitte gave him the number 31 jersey to wear while repairing the number 36. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice [[James Williams (defensive back)|James (J.D.) Williams]] wore it for his first two seasons; it has since been returned to general circulation, with safety [[Dean Marlowe]] wearing the number in 2019.\n\nNumber 32 had been withdrawn from circulation, but not retired, after [[O.

Buffalo had been left out of the league since the All-Americans (by that point renamed the Bisons) folded in 1929; the Bills were no less than the third professional non-NFL team to compete in the city before the merger, following the [[Buffalo Indians|Indians/Tigers]] of the early 1940s and [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|an earlier team named the Bills]], originally the Bisons, in the late 1940s in the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).\n\nFollowing the AFL\u2013NFL merger, the Bills were generally mediocre in the 1970s, but featured All-Pro running back [[O. J. Simpson]]. After being pushed to the brink of failure in the mid-1980s, the collapse of the [[United States Football League]] and a series of highly drafted players such as [[Jim Kelly]] (who initially played for the USFL instead of the Bills), [[Thurman Thomas]], and [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]] allowed the Bills to rebuild into a perennial contender in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, a period in which the team won four consecutive [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championships]]; the team nevertheless lost all four subsequent [[Super Bowl]]s, records in both categories that still stand.\n\nThe rise of the division rival [[New England Patriots]] under [[Tom Brady]], along with numerous failed attempts at rebuilding in the 2000s and 2010s, prevented the Bills from reaching the playoffs in seventeen consecutive seasons between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year drought that was the longest active playoff drought in all major professional sports at the time. It was broken when the Bills secured a wild-card berth on December 31, 2017. On October 8, 2014, [[Buffalo Sabres]] owners Terry and Kim Pegula received unanimous approval to acquire the Bills during the NFL owners' meetings, becoming the second ownership group of the team after team founder [[Ralph Wilson]].<ref name=\"SesslerBills\" />\n\n===Name origins===\nIn 1947 a contest was held to rename the AAFC Bisons, which was owned by James Breuil of the [[Frontier Oil Company]].

A darker shade of blue was introduced as the main jersey color, and nickel gray was introduced as an accent color. Both the blue and white jerseys featured red side panels. The white jerseys included a dark blue shoulder yoke and royal blue numbers. The helmet remained primarily red with one navy blue, two nickel, two royal blue, two white stripes, and white face mask. A new logo, a stylized \"B\" consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo. The helmet logo adopted in 1974\u2014a charging royal blue bison, with a red streak, white horn and eyeball\u2014remained unchanged.\n\nIn [[2005 Buffalo Bills season|2005]], the Bills revived the standing bison helmet and uniform of the mid-1960s as a throwback uniform.\n\nThe Bills usually wore the all-blue combination at home and the all-white combination on the road when not wearing the throwback uniforms.

The new Nike uniform was unveiled on April 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Chris|title=Nike unveils new NFL uniforms|url=https://www.buffalobills.com/news/nike-unveils-new-nfl-uniforms-7131790|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=BuffaloBills.com|date=April 3, 2012|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn November 12, 2015, the Bills and the New York Jets became the first two teams to participate in the NFL's [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform initiative, with Buffalo wearing an all-red combination for the first time in team history.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Jets and Bills unveil 'Color Rush' unis Thursday|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000574519/article/jets-and-bills-unveil-color-rush-unis-thursday|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=November 6, 2015|accessdate=September 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA notable use of the Bills' uniforms outside of football was in the [[2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], when the [[United States men's national junior ice hockey team]] wore Bills-inspired uniforms in their [[list of outdoor ice hockey games|outdoor game]] against [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Team Canada]] on December 29, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/06/14/usa-hockey-unveils-special-jersey-world-juniors-outdoor-game-buffalo/|title=USA Hockey unveils Bills-themed jersey for world junior outdoor game in Buffalo|date=June 14, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Rivalries==\nThe Bills have rivalries with their three [[AFC East]] opponents, and also have had occasional or historical rivalries with other teams such as the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts]] (a former divisional rival), [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and [[Dallas Cowboys]].<ref name=whoisarival>{{cite web|url=https://www.allcounted.com/share?view=compare_multiple_choice&cid=stnbvll7tbrir&qid=93326&uid=|title=2017 Buffalo Bills Rivalry Survey|website=www.allcounted.com}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> They also play an annual preseason game against the [[Detroit Lions]].\n\n===Divisional rivalries===\n====Miami Dolphins====\n{{main|Bills\u2013Dolphins rivalry}}\n\nThis is often considered Buffalo's most famous rivalry. Though the Bills and [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] both originated in the [[American Football League]], the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team while the Bills were one of the original eight teams. The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent (the Bills defeated the Dolphins in their first matchup of the 1980s). Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of [[Jim Kelly]] as Buffalo's franchise quarterback, and though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback [[Dan Marino]] shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s. Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the rise of the New England Patriots, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo's primary rival,<ref name = \"2017primaryrivalpoll\"/> and the two teams have typically been close to each other in win-loss records. Miami leads the overall series 61\u201348\u20131 as of 2018, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 3\u20131, including a win in the [[1992\u201393 NFL playoffs|1992 AFC Championship Game]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=17%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}</ref>\n\n====New England Patriots====\n{{main|Bills\u2013Patriots rivalry}}\n\nThe rivalry with the [[New England Patriots]] first started when both teams were original franchises in the [[American Football League]] prior to the NFL-AFL merger. After the rise of head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and quarterback [[Tom Brady]] in New England, the Patriots have dominated the AFC East, including the Bills. The Bills-Patriots rivalry in particular has become lopsided as the Patriots are 31\u20135 against the Bills since Belichick became head coach in 2000. This has led many fans and players in the 2000s and beyond to replace the Dolphins with the Patriots as Buffalo's most hated rival.<ref name = \"2017primaryrivalpoll\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allcounted.com/share?view=summary&cid=stnbvll7tbrir&uid=|title=2017 Buffalo Bills Rivalry Survey|website=www.allcounted.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://247sports.com/nfl/buffalo-bills/Article/New-England-Patriots-named-as-Bills-biggest-rival-74981320|title = Patriots named as Bills biggest rival|website = 247Sports.com|date = July 5, 2016}}</ref> Overall, the Patriots lead the series 74\u201343\u20131 as of 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=19%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry is also notable as numerous players, including [[Drew Bledsoe]], [[Doug Flutie]], [[Lawyer Milloy]], [[Brandon Spikes]], [[Scott Chandler (American football)|Scott Chandler]], [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]], [[Mike Gillislee]] and [[Stephon Gilmore]] have played for both teams at some point in their careers.\n\n====New York Jets====\n{{main|Bills\u2013Jets rivalry}}\n\nThe Bills and [[New York Jets|Jets]] were both original AFL teams, and both represent the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], though the Jets (since 1984) actually play their games in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. While the rivalry represents the differences between [[New York City]] and [[Western New York]], it is not as intense as the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases either have grudging respect or low-key annoyance for each other when the teams are not playing one another. Oftentimes the Bills-Jets rivalry has become characterized by ugly games and shared mediocrity, but it has had a handful of competitive moments. The series heated up recently when former Jets head coach [[Rex Ryan]] became the Bills' head coach for two seasons, and has become notable again as Bills quarterback [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] and Jets quarterback [[Sam Darnold]], both drafted in the same year, maintain a friendly rivalry with one another.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/blog/buffalo-bills/post/_/id/33411/bills-josh-allen-and-jets-sam-darnold-close-friends-division-rivals |title=Bills' Josh Allen, Jets' Sam Darnold: Friendship before rivalry |last=Louis-Jacques |first=Marcell |date=2019-09-07 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> Buffalo leads the series 62\u201355 as of 2018, including a playoff win in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=22%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. New York Jets Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}</ref>\n\n===Other rivalries===\n\n====Tennessee Titans====\n{{See also|The Comeback (American football)|Music City Miracle}}\nThe [[Tennessee Titans]] (formerly the [[Houston Oilers]]) share an extended history with the Bills, both teams being original AFL clubs in 1960 and rivals in that league's East Division before the AFL-NFL merger.

The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice [[James Williams (defensive back)|James (J.D.)
