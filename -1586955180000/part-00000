T. C. Werner]], she had last been seen by acquaintances just before leaving a skating rink the previous night. No one was ever charged in the case.\n\nThough British and Chinese officials cooperated in the investigation, it was hampered by official resistance and the city's general chaos: Beijing at the time was crowded with war refugees, there was upheaval elsewhere in China and Europe, and [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese troops]] were on the verge of [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin#The fall of Beiping|occupying the city]]. They focused on some members of the city's expatriate community, but the case was officially closed with the finding that the mutilation suggested a Chinese killer, before they could be sure of any suspects; the Japanese occupation foreclosed any further efforts to reopen it. Some British diplomatic records pertaining to the case were later [[Weeding (library)|weeded]]; Werner, whose chequered career with the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic Service]] in China had alienated many of his former colleagues who oversaw the investigation, later used his own resources to identify American dentist Wentworth Prentice as the likely killer.\n\nA subject of considerable media attention at the time, the case drifted into obscurity with the ensuing outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which soon grew into [[World War II]], and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] leading to the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] a short time afterwards. Interest in the case was revived with the 2011 publication of [[Paul French (author)|Paul French]]'s [[bestseller]] ''[[Midnight in Peking]]'', which endorsed Werner's conclusions and won several awards. However, a website set up by some of Prentice's descendants argues that documentary evidence from the time contradicts that conclusion and casts doubt on many of French's assertions.<ref name=\"NYT neighborhood walk article\">{{cite news|last=Perlez|first=Jane|authorlink=Jane Perlez|title=\nA Mystery Endures in Beijing's Old Legation Quarter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/travel/a-mystery-endures-in-beijings-old-legation-quarter.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 May 2014|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nPamela Werner was a British citizen with an unusual background. At the time of her death she was living in an increasingly tense and teeming city.\n\n===Beijing in the late 1930s===\n\nAt the start of 1937, Beijing (then referred to in Western languages as Peking) and its 1.5 million residents, both Chinese and foreign, knew that they were living in the end of an era. While the city was the third richest in China, it was no longer capital of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. Despite the success of the [[Northern Expedition]], [[Kuomintang]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] had retreated to [[Nanjing]]. Originally his aim was to better consolidate his political power and military position against [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]], which sought to establish a [[Communist Party of China|Communist state]]; but after the December 1936 [[Xi'an incident]], where [[Zhang Xueliang]] had held him hostage for two weeks, he had agreed to Zhang's demand that he seek an alliance with the Communists to better defend China against the Japanese.<ref name=\"French chapter 1\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul French (author)|title=Midnight in Peking: How the Murder of a Young Englishwoman Haunted the Last Days of Old China|date=2012|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101580387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRC897RFkYUC|accessdate=23 December 2016|chapter=The Approaching Storm}}</ref>\n\nChiang had left General [[Song Zheyuan]] in charge of Peking, to do what he could to hold off both the northern [[Warlord Era|warlords]] who still remained and, increasingly, the Japanese, who having successfully [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|taken Manchuria]] [[North China Buffer State Strategy|over the previous six years]] were now camped within a few miles of the onetime Chinese imperial palace, the [[Forbidden City]], and controlled almost all the routes in and out of the city.<ref name=\"French chapter 1\" />\n\nPlanning to use Peking as a base for their eventual conquest of China, the Japanese were working to undermine the city's resistance. They covertly encouraged the drug trade and staged regular military provocations. Chinese residents of the city believed that Chiang was prepared to abandon it to the Japanese if he could just be assured of retaining all of China south of the [[Yangzi River]]. \"The end was coming,\" [[Paul French (author)|Paul French]] wrote in 2011, \"it was just a question of when.\" Many residents assumed that that end would be death at Japanese hands, either by starvation as they besieged the city, or massacred the survivors afterward.<ref name=\"French chapter 1\" />\n\nThe city's population had swelled as refugees flocked to it. Many were Chinese, fleeing the wars and disruption elsewhere in the country. But a sizable portion had come from Europe, primarily [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|Russian Whites]], left [[Statelessness|stateless]] by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist]] victory in the [[Russian Civil War]] and subsequent establishment of the [[Soviet Union]]. Others were Jews, leaving behind the worsening conditions in [[Nazi Germany]] and elsewhere in Europe, joined by those who also felt at risk from the advancing tide of [[fascism]]. They were joined by military deserters evading capture, fugitives from justice in their homelands, and travelers who had either been stranded in China or decided to stay. Most of the European refugees had come to China penniless, and worked menial jobs, or sometimes engaged in criminal activity, to get by. The city's foreign diplomats and businessmen looked down on them as a threat to European hegemony in the city and hoped they would eventually find their way to [[Shanghai]].<ref name=\"French chapter 3\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul French (author)|title=Midnight in Peking: How the Murder of a Young Englishwoman Haunted the Last Days of Old China|date=2012|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101580387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRC897RFkYUC|accessdate=23 December 2016|chapter=An Old China Hand}}</ref>\n\nThey were sometimes joined in this assessment by the expatriates, many of them businessmen who dealt with the Chinese, or those who had moved to China for better economic prospects serving the expatriate community. The disparate exchange rate between strong Western currencies such as the [[pound sterling]] and [[American dollar]] and the [[History of Chinese currency#Silver dollars|Chinese silver dollar]], as well as lower costs of living in China, made it possible for expatriates to live better than they could in their native countries for the same amount of money. American journalist [[Edgar Snow]], then finishing his book ''[[Red Star Over China]]'', the first Western account of Mao and his Communist army, and his wife [[Helen Foster Snow|Helen]] were able to own a racehorse on their earnings as reporters, for example.<ref name=\"French chapter 1\" />\n\n===The Werners===\n\nEdward Theodore Chalmers Werner was a [[New Zealand]]-born British citizen whose wealthy Prussian father took the family travelling around the world in his own youth. He had returned to [[England]] to attend [[Tonbridge School]]. Due to his father's death in his teens, Werner had to find employment after finishing and, after passing the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s cadet exam, he was sent to Beijing to learn Chinese.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nWerner took readily to the country's language and culture, which he studied avidly while serving the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic Service]] in a variety of positions over the next decades, including at one point as [[Consul (representative)|consul]]. However, his interest in the country where he served was coupled with poor personal skills and many of his postings were remote locations, meant as punishments for volatile disagreements with superiors and sometimes those the consular officers served. He nevertheless married a socially prominent woman, Gladys Ravenshaw, and the couple stayed in Beijing after his 1914 retirement, where he continued his studies.<ref name=\"NYRB review\" />\n\nIn 1919 the Werners adopted a two-year-old girl, whom they named Pamela, from the [[orphanage]] run by Portuguese nuns at the [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Beijing|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]], or South Church, in Beijing. Pamela's biological parentage was not known, although her fair complexion and grey eyes suggest that she was, like many of the other orphans at the South Church, the offspring of exiled Russian Whites. After Gladys died of what was said to have been a [[drug overdose]]<ref name=\"Time review\">{{cite news|last=Ramzy|first=Austin|title=''Midnight in Peking'': Has Paul French Solved a 75-Year-Old Murder?|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/04/30/midnight-in-peking-has-paul-french-solved-a-75-year-old-murder/|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=30 April 2012|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref> while being treated for [[meningitis]] in 1922, Werner devoted much of his life to Pamela, teaching her [[Chinese language|Chinese]] to the point that she was fluent from a very early age; later she would emulate her father by traveling around the city on her bicycle, often unaccompanied. Outside the home, he wrote books and articles about China, researched the language and its many dialects on long walks around Beijing, and occasionally lectured at [[Peking University]].<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nThe Werners lived, like a growing number of foreigners, outside the city's heavily secured [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]], a cramped area of about {{convert|1|sqkm|sqmi}} that was the only [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] portion of the city, in contrast to the more populous [[treaty port]]s of Shanghai and [[Tianjin]]. Among their neighbors in the ''[[hutong]]'' where they lived in a modernized ''[[siheyuan]]'', or courtyard house, were the Snows. Werner sent Pamela to the private schools that catered to the city's more affluent foreigners.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nAt the end of 1936, she was on holiday from Tientsin Grammar School in what is now Tianjin. In the wake of some incidents there that may possibly have involved Sydney Yeates, the school's headmaster, making sexual overtures to her, Werner was preparing to send her back to England to continue her education, a move Pamela did not welcome. He feared his growing daughter was maintaining too active a social life for a woman her age and was also worried about some of the young men who had attempted to court her. He had hit one of them, a young Chinese man, with his cane in front of the house during a confrontation.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\n==Disappearance and death==\n\nOn the last day of her life, Pamela went to a dental appointment in the morning and then returned home to write letters. She left the family home in the late afternoon. Ho Ying, a servant who typically went out to purchase food around 3 p.m. daily, informed her at the time he was doing so and asked her if, as was often the case, she wanted him to buy [[sweetmeat]]s when he did so. She declined, saying she herself would be leaving within the hour, although she indicated she would return by 7:30 for dinner, asking Ho to prepare meatballs and rice. When he returned she was gone; the family's gatekeeper had seen her leave with her bicycle.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\">{{cite news|title=Peiping Tragedy Investigated|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/hm-coroners-inquest.html|newspaper=[[North China Herald]]|via=pamelawernermurderpeking.com|date=10 February 1937|accessdate=25 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving, she met Ethel Gurevitch, a younger friend, the daughter of Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, whom she had known for five years, at the [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits|Wagons-Lits]] Hotel, a popular gathering place for the city's foreign community, per an agreement the two had made the day before; Pamela told Gurevitch she had been there earlier and left briefly before returning to meet her. Afterwards they went back to the Gurevitch home where Ethel's mother served the two tea, buttered bread and cake; Pamela ate very little, saying she was not hungry.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\nThe young women then went out to an ice skating rink operated by a French company, arriving around 6 p.m., where they skated with a third friend, Lillian Marinovski, another Russian. The three remained together for most of the time they were there except for one brief period when Pamela went to speak to another girl. Around 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Gurevitch recalled that Pamela said she had to go home for dinner. They asked her if she felt comfortable returning home alone at night; she told them she always went by herself and that \"nothing can happen to me here in Peking.\" Marinvoski saw her bicycle away, with her skates over her shoulder. It was the last time anyone is known to have seen Pamela Werner alive.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\nBy 8 p.m. Pamela had still not returned home; although her father had. Around 10:30 he asked Ho to go to the skating rink and see if she was there; by the time he arrived, the rink had closed and workers were cleaning up for the evening. They could not tell him anything specifically about Pamela as, they said, there had been around 200 people skating at the rink over the course of the evening. Ho returned to the Werner home, where E.T.C. told him to go home for the night. By the older man's later testimony, he went out himself with an [[Flashlight|electric torch]] to look for his daughter, returning at 1 a.m. and going to bed; later he would claim he had spent most of the night looking for her.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\n===Discovery of body===\n[[File:Beijing Ming City Wall SE Corner Tower.jpg|thumb|right|The Fox Tower in 2007|alt=A tall rectangular stone building with a Chinese-style roof seen from near its base with some bare tree branches in front]]\nShortly after 8 a.m. the next day, two [[rickshaw]] drivers near the [[Beijing city fortifications#Dongbianmen|Fox Tower]] along the city's old walls noticed a group of wild dogs showing interest in a bundle lying in the ditch near the wall, all that remained of the canal that had formerly run along it. An elderly man saw this too, and went down to take a closer look. After finding it was the severely beaten and stabbed body of what appeared to be a young European woman, he ran to the nearest [[police box]], a quarter of a mile (400 m) away, to report it.<ref name=\"French chapter 2\">French, 'The Body at the Fox Tower'.</ref>\n\nThey secured the scene, keeping the dogs away, and covering the body with a bamboo mat to discourage curious onlookers until detectives could arrive. Col. Han Shih-chung of the Peking police supervised the investigation. At first he presumed the decedent to have been yet another of the many Russian Whites who, overwhelmed by despair and/or out of options, had [[suicide|ended their own lives]]; the preceding night having been [[Christmas]] in the [[Russian Orthodox]] calendar lent some support to this. But the wounds seemed more extensive than those a suicide might inflict. Aware that the possible killing of a wealthy foreign woman just outside the [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]] might be of interest to the foreign authorities there, even though the Chinese had jurisdiction, Han called W.P. Thomas, the Legation Quarter's police commissioner, to the scene.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nUncertainty over the woman's identity ended when E.T.C. Werner stumbled across the scene a short while later. After resting at his home, he had resumed his search for his daughter in the morning light and left a note about her disappearance with Thomas's office. When he saw the body, he shrieked \"''Pamela''!\" and collapsed next to the body. He had apparently recognised the clothing and jewellery she was wearing; later a [[constable]] with the Foreign Legation who also knew Pamela confirmed the identification. By the evening the crime scene had been secured and processed, and Pamela's body was taken to [[Peking Union Medical College]] to be [[autopsy|autopsied]].<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\n==Investigation==\n\nThere were plenty of deaths to investigate in Peking at that time. Each morning several bodies were routinely collected from the streets. Most were suicides or natural causes. Homicides were harder to resolve as they could have been either due to routine criminal activity and disputes, or Japanese provocations, or (increasingly) political assassinations carried out by the [[Kuomintang]] of its enemies both internal and external. General Song was also having some of the drug dealers he caught [[summary execution|summarily executed]], particularly if they were not Chinese or Japanese.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nBoth Han and Thomas knew that the investigation into Pamela Werner's death would be unusual. While the Chinese had jurisdiction because of where her body had been found, it was entirely likely that it would be necessary to investigate her death by questioning members of the foreign community, some of whom might enjoy [[diplomatic immunity]] or at least reside in the Legation Quarter, where the Peking police had no authority. That aspect of the investigation would be better conducted by law enforcement officers who ''did'' have jurisdiction.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nGiven Pamela's social standing, the case would likely attract not only the attention of the press but also official interest. The British diplomats would probably not want to see the case solved in any way that would adversely affect the British image in China. Thomas proposed to Han that the Peking police exercise their right to name the official who could serve as an envoy for the investigation, and suggested that that official be [[Chief Inspector#United Kingdom|Detective Chief Inspector]] Richard Dennis, a [[Scotland Yard]] veteran who was chief of police in the [[Concessions in Tianjin#British concession (1860\u20131943)|British concession in Tientsin]]. He could not be as easily pressured by the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic Service]] since he was not under their authority. Han agreed, and the two would work together to try to solve the case, a binational cooperation unusual for the time.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" /><ref name=\"Guardian review\">{{cite news|last=Mitter|first=Rana|title=''Midnight in Peking'' by Paul French - review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/08/midnight-in-peking-paul-french-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 June 2012|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nPamela's body, and where it was found, had already yielded some clues. The expensive [[platinum]] jewelry that had helped confirm the corpse's identity had not been taken, suggesting robbery was not the motive. Pamela's wristwatch had been stopped shortly after midnight, suggesting that was when she had died. There was no blood at the scene other than that on her clothes, suggesting she had been killed elsewhere and dumped there. Nearby was her membership card for the skating rink, with some blood on it (however, her bicycle and skates have never been found).<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\n===Autopsy report===\n\nThe autopsy yielded additional information of interest. Pamela had died from a [[brain hemorrhage]] caused by several blows to the head, possibly inflicted with a smooth-surfaced piece of wood or stone, blows strong enough to [[skull fracture|fracture her skull]].<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" /> From the proximity necessary to inflict those blows, and their directness, the [[forensic pathology|pathologists]] performing the autopsy concluded she had been killed by someone she knew.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul French (author)|title=Midnight in Peking: How the Murder of a Young Englishwoman Haunted the Last Days of Old China|date=2012|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101580387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRC897RFkYUC|accessdate=23 December 2016|chapter=Wild Dogs and Diplomats}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-009048, Rodfeller Hospital in Peking.jpg|thumb|left|Peking Union Medical College, where Pamela was autopsied, in 1924|alt=A black and white image of several buildings with Chinese-style wide-eaved roofs making a corner around a parking area where a 1920s-style automobile is parked]]\nA similar [[blunt force trauma]] injury to the right arm was believed to have been inflicted after death because there was no hemorrhaging around it. Likewise, the low amount of blood released from the stabbings and slashings suggested those, too, were post mortem. They had been inflicted with a knife, likely with two edges to the blade although possibly not equally sharp, at least {{convert|4|in|cm}} long.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\nWithin the body, muscles had been severed cleanly. Through two slits in the abdomen, most of Pamela's internal organs had been removed and her blood drained. The skill required to do this as cleanly and quickly as it had been done suggested to the pathologist that whoever had done so had considerable skill, perhaps that of a surgeon or anatomist. The dogs that had been showing interest in the body could not have inflicted those wounds. Her heart was also missing, with the ribs surrounding broken from the inside to do so, a task requiring a considerable amount of force. A knife had also been used to repeatedly penetrate her [[vagina]], to the point that it could not be determined whether Pamela had been [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] either before or after she was killed.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\nOne of the few internal organs that remained was Pamela's stomach. It was found to contain some partially digested Chinese food. Since she had not been known to have eaten anything other than the bread, cake and tea she had had at her friend's house, this along with the time her watch stopped suggested she had been alive for several hours after leaving the ice rink. The time of death was placed between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\" />\n\nPamela's skirt was loose. Her silk [[stocking]]s had been torn, and her underwear was missing. However, her overcoat and scarf were still with the body, along with shoes and some other personal effects. This further argued for the killing having taken place elsewhere, and the body being dressed afterwards.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\" />\n\nIt was concluded that the killing had been sexually motivated, \"not the work of an ordinary sexual sadist\", according to an [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician-gynaecologist]] who participated. Han and the doctors who performed the autopsy believed that the intent had been to [[dismemberment|dismember]] Pamela after her death but that whoever was doing so was unable to complete the task and hastily dumped the body. Colonel Han made sure distribution of the autopsy report was limited as he did not want the details of Pamela's mutilation widely reported in the press since it would make the case harder to solve. He kept the only copy in his desk.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\" />\n\n===Interviews and leads===\n\nHan knew that, as a practical matter, he had 20 days to solve the case, after which his superiors and the press would lose interest in it and other crimes would likely demand his attention. Dennis arrived in Peking by train, preceded by two of his subordinates who would also work with him for a few days. The two began their investigations at once. Many leads poured in, most of them false. One, a [[rickshaw]] puller who had been seen washing a bloodied seat cushion near where Pamela's body was found, turned out to have been cleaning up the mess from a fight between a Russian and an [[United States Marine Corps|American marine]].<ref name=\"French chapter 6\">French, \"The Investigation\".</ref>\n\nThe two interviewed the friends that Pamela had last been seen with; their stories corroborated each other. E.T.C. Werner himself, though grief-stricken, told them of his last afternoon and an overnight search through the city after Pamela had failed to return. Some others in the foreign community, including many of the British diplomats he had clashed with during his career, seemed to think he might have been responsible. He did admit to officers that he had confronted a young Chinese man outside the house whom he accused of being too interested in Pamela, breaking the man's nose with his cane, a move he called an overreaction. The elder Werner told Dennis that he was sending Pamela back to Britain for continued schooling, owing to some unspecified incident at Tientsin Grammar, a development he was surprised the detective was unaware of.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\nIn retracing Pamela's steps of the afternoon and night of 7 January, the detectives did learn one new piece of information. Between 3 and 4 p.m., she had gone to the [[concierge]] at the Wagons Lits and asked about renting a room, going so far as to check out the hotel's brochure. Why she did was not known\u2014she could have been preparing for a visit by a boy from her class at Tientsin Grammar whom she had expressed interest in, or preparing to leave her father's home on a more long-term basis.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\nAlthough Han would not confirm any reports about the extent to which Pamela's body had been mutilated in his first [[press conference]] about the investigation, or Dennis's participation, he admitted that the police had no solid leads at that point, two days afterward. Speculation filled the gap in reporting. The Fox Tower was long believed to be haunted by evil spirits, and there were some theories that settled on that explanation for the killing.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\nSome of the expatriates suggested Werner himself might have killed his daughter in a fit of rage. While his fits of temper were well known, and indeed had adversely affected his diplomatic career, Dennis ultimately believed he was innocent. [[Helen Foster Snow]], one of the Werners' neighbors, told the detective that it might have been possible that [[Kuomintang]] assassins had mistaken Pamela for her, since the two looked similar. She knew that [[Chiang Kai-Shek|Chiang]]'s government had not been happy with the things she and her husband [[Edgar Snow|Edgar]] had said about them, especially in contrast with their sympathetic portrayal of the Communists.<ref name=\"French chapter 14\">French, \"Radical Chic\"</ref>\n\nDennis considered that theory plausible due to the strong resemblance between Snow and Pamela Werner\u2014in the dark the two could easily have been confused. But the political assassinations carried out by [[Dai Li]]'s [[Blue Shirts Society]] and its more elite counterpart, the [[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics|Military Statistics Bureau]], were much tidier affairs. Their targets were usually shot once in the head and dumped somewhere, not extensively mutilated after death.<ref name=\"French chapter 14\" />\n\nHan ordered police to canvass the areas Pamela might have traveled through, particularly the area known as the Badlands just outside the Legation Quarter, a neighborhood of hutongs where the bars and brothels that served and employed many of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s and refugees in the city were located. Since Pamela's body must have been moved, possibly with a vehicle, he ordered officers to find and check every registered automobile in the Peking area, even though those records had not been kept consistently. A week after the crime a Russian landlady in the Badlands told police about finding a bloodied dagger and cloth in the possession of a tenant of hers.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\n===Suspect arrested and released===\n\nThe man, known by the name Pinfold, was taken into custody by Han's officers and held at headquarters on Morrison Street (today [[Wangfujing]]). Dennis not only attended the interrogation but actively took part, despite orders given him in secret to confine his role in the investigation to the Legation Quarter. Pinfold, later identified by Canadian diplomats in the city as a [[desertion|deserter]] from the [[Canadian Army]] who had fled first to the U.S., where he had acquired a criminal record, and then to China, where he worked as a bodyguard to one of the warlords for several years, before falling into low-paying jobs, refused to talk.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\nDespite being held overnight, Pinfold would not say anything. He smoked heavily and fidgeted nervously, suggesting he was entering the early stages of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] from the [[opiate addiction]] widespread among the city's less affluent foreign population at the time.<ref name=\"SCMP story\">{{cite news|last=French|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul French (author)|title=Broken in the Badlands|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1361023/broken-badlands|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=23 November 2013|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref> One officer recognized him as a man he had seen lingering a little longer than other passers-by when he passed the crime scene, piquing detectives' interest further. In his personal effects they found a business card for an establishment at 27 Chuanban Hutong, a bar run by a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 that, like many other such businesses in Peking at the time, doubled as a brothel. Canadian officials indicated he had often been seen at 28 Chuanban Hutong next door.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\">French, \"Of Rats and Men\".</ref>\n\nThe address was in the middle of the Badlands, a neighborhood where most of the refugees had settled, replete with hastily constructed buildings and activity on both sides of the law. Pamela ordinarily avoided the area at night, according to her friends, but it was possible that, in her haste to get home for dinner, she might have chosen the more direct route, which would have taken her right past Nos. 27 and 28. Han had a squad of officers raid 28, while he and Dennis chose the more discreet route of visiting 27 themselves.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\" />\n\nThe raid received press coverage but yielded no new clues\u2014patrons who had been shown pictures of Pamela did not recognize her as having been there on the night of 7 January, which had been crowded owing to the holiday. However, at 27 Chuanban, the manager, a former U.S. marine named Joseph Knauf, knew Pinfold and said he worked as security at the neighboring bar. He also told the detectives that Pinfold had been present at weekend [[naturism|nudist]] gatherings at a cottage in the city's [[Western Hills]], where participants also hunted in the surrounding woods, although that was becoming more difficult owing to the increasing Japanese presence.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\" />\n\nArmed with that information, Han and Dennis returned to reinterview Pinfold, whereupon Dennis informed him that they knew about the nudist gatherings. Pinfold's reticence evaporated, and he admitted he had been at the events but only as a security guard (sometimes recruiting women to dance naked for attendees). He claimed not to have known Pamela. He refused to say where the blood on his dagger and clothes had come from.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\" />\n\n===The nudist weekends===\n\nAt this point Dennis was suddenly recalled to Tientsin for a meeting with the British consul there. At it he was briefed on why Werner had abruptly withdrawn his daughter from Tientsin Grammar: apparently Pamela had alleged that the headmaster, Sydney Yeates, who also oversaw the house where she boarded while school was in session, had made sexual overtures to her. Yeates had agreed to leave his post and return to England at the end of the school year; in the wake of the murder, for which Yeates had an alibi, that departure had been [[wikt:prepone|preponed]] to the following week. Dennis was told to make sure the murder investigation did not result in any public disclosure of this potential scandal as it would be injurious to British prestige and standing in China at this very difficult time.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\" />\n\nWerner also caused problems with the British authorities in Peking. They offered a reward of a thousand Chinese dollars, roughly ten times what the average Chinese family lived on per year at the time, for information that would help resolve the case. Werner complained, to no avail, that the reward flyer should be printed in Chinese as well as English, and the money made available via a bank account so that the successful informant could claim it anonymously. Since many Chinese distrusted any governmental authorities, whether their own or foreign, he believed this would make it easier for a local informant to come forward.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\" />\n\nBack in Peking Dennis learned from Han that Pinfold would have to be released. The pathologists had found that the blood on his knife and clothing was animal, not human,<ref name=\"SCMP story\" /> and there was no other evidence he could have been held on. A second pair of keys in his possession had been found to unlock a second residence of his in the Legation Quarter, meaning the authorities there would have to permit him to face charges, and the British consul, Nicholas Fitzmaurice, who was also by law presiding over the inquest as [[coroner]], declined to do so as he did not believe there was sufficient evidence to secure a conviction (nor was he eager to set a precedent that would allow Legation Quarter residents to answer to Chinese courts so easily).<ref name=\"French chapter 12\">French, \"In Beijing Earth\"</ref> After his release his whereabouts are unknown, although he is believed to have left Peking.<ref name=\"Toronto Sun story\">{{cite news|last=Burnett|first=Thane|title=Mysterious Cdn at heart of Chinese cold murder case|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/06/21/mysterious-cdn-at-heart-of-chinese-cold-murder-case|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nPinfold's arrest did, however, yield a new lead. Dennis and Han began focusing on the nudist weekends. The Canadian had told them that they were organized by Wentworth Prentice, an American dentist whose patients were mostly wealthy expatriates and diplomats. He had originally settled in China with his wife and children after graduating from [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine|Harvard's dental school]] in 1918, but in 1932 she had returned to the U.S. with the children. His file at the U.S. consulate suggested that at least one person there had been concerned for the safety of one of his children, but did not explain why.<ref name=\"French chapter 12\" />\n\nDennis and Legation Quarter police commissioner E.D. Howard went to interview Prentice at his flat in the quarter. It was located right next to the ice rink where Pamela had last been seen. When they arrived Prentice had the windows open, because, he explained, his landlord had decided to repaint the walls despite it being wintertime. He said he had never treated Pamela and that he had been at the movies the evening she disappeared.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\">French, \"A Respectable Man of Influence\"</ref>\n\nIn the next day's English-language newspaper, George Gorman, an Irish reporter known to be strongly sympathetic to the Japanese, criticized the police for even considering Prentice a suspect. He vouched for Prentice's character, and suggested the real killers were Chinese, not Western. When Dennis spoke with him he learned that Gorman, too, participated in the nudist weekends. Gorman's wife also told him that the night of 6 January, Pamela had visited their house and taken tea with her and her daughter.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\n===Conclusion===\n\nThe investigation became more complicated at this point. Werner, unhappy with the progress or lack thereof of the case, held a press conference of his own on the steps of the British Legation. He decried the lack of information on why Pinfold had been released. Drawing on his considerable knowledge of Chinese culture, he noted that there was absolutely no Chinese religious or folk tradition that involved the harvesting of organs, suggesting to him instead that contrary to widespread rumour his daughter's killer or killers were not Chinese but Western. To the existing reward he added the offer of 5,000 gold Chinese dollars, most of his life savings, an amount triple what an average Chinese family of the time could earn in their lifetimes.<ref name=\"French chapter 12\" />\n\nHis actions annoyed the authorities enough that they told Dennis and Han not to talk to Werner anymore, since he was so obviously overcome by grief. Contrary to what he had suggested, the killers were likely one or more of the many [[sexual frustration|sexually frustrated]] young Chinese men abounding in Peking at the time.<ref name=\"French chapter 12\" />\n\nDennis, suffering from a nagging respiratory ailment since he had come to Peking, had been told by his superiors in Tientsin that he had to return there soon. After some negotiation on his part, they agreed he could stay as late as that year's [[Chinese New Year]], on 7 February. He and Han knew that as a practical matter time was running out for them to solve the case even before then. They vainly sought to learn where Pamela's blood might have been, knowing that the location where she was killed was the only possible lead they had left.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nOn 29 January the inquest was reconvened. After hearing testimony from Pamela's friends and some of the investigating officers, Fitzmaurice recessed the proceeding for lunch and then announced, over reporters' protests, that in the afternoon he would hear from the doctors who had performed the autopsy ''[[in camera]]''. At the conclusion of the day, he rendered his verdict that Pamela's death was an unlawful killing, but left it open to a later hearing as to who might have committed the crime.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nDespite Fitzmaurice's precautions, the newspapers were able to obtain details of the autopsy report and published them the next day. The details of the mutilation scandalized readers and made the foreign population even more fearful. It also made it more unlikely that the investigation would be able to find a suspect since the details of the killing were now widely known, and Han began to express doubt that the killer or killers would ever be found.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nThe Chinese New Year of 1937 was raucously celebrated in Peking by Chinese and foreigners alike; many believed this might be the last such holiday for them and the city. After nothing turned up or happened that might have shed new light on Pamela Werner's killing, Dennis returned to Tientsin to attend to pressing matters there, and Han moved on to other cases as well. The Japanese provocations were becoming increasingly bold, with tanks being driven through the city and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zeros]] flown overhead at low altitudes as part of what the Japanese generals still claimed was routine military maneuvering even as they steadily increased their presence outside Peking.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nAt the end of June Fitzmaurice officially concluded the investigation into Pamela's death. By then the news had long vanished from the newspapers; a few freelance reporters attended in the hope of getting a short story. Pamela Werner, Fitzmaurice said, had been murdered by person or persons unknown, possibly Chinese.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nAfter the announcement, Fitzmaurice boarded a ship to return to England for his customary long summer holiday. Two weeks afterwards, the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] south of Peking finally led to [[Second Sino\u2013Japanese War|war]]; the [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Japanese took Peking and Tientsin]] by the end of July. Fitzmaurice retired rather than return.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\n==Werner's investigation==\n\nE. T. C. Werner remained in Peking despite the occupation, continuing to live in his ''[[siheyuan]]'' even as many of the city's other foreigners clustered in the Legation Quarter, save the stateless Russian Whites, on the advice of their governments who said they would not be safe outside it. His research activities curtailed by the occupation, he devoted his energies to persuading the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] to reopen the case. He supplemented his requests with information he had obtained on his own, using his still-considerable financial resources. They were considerably helpful in a city where both [[inflation]] and [[unemployment]] had risen sharply as a result of the occupation, and he found many people willing to share information with him, including some former Peking police officers whom the Japanese had let go from the force as politically unreliable.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nHis investigation increasingly led him to the brothel at 28 Chuanban; its owners had apparently closed it the day after the murder and left Peking for Tientsin or Shanghai. Likewise, Pinfold, following his arrest, had gone to Tientsin and asked a friend for help hiring a lawyer; the Canadian had also asked if Prentice had been arrested yet. He also had in his possession a receipt from Prentice for straightening some of Pamela's rear teeth about five weeks before the murder, [[orthodontic]] work so minor it would not have been noted as recent, and perhaps not at all, by the pathologists. This contradicted Prentice's assertion to Dennis that he had never treated Pamela.<ref name=\"French chapter 15\u201316\">French, \"Into the Underworld\" and \"Chuanpan Hutong\"</ref>\n\nWerner's agents eventually led him to the rickshaw puller who had briefly been held the day after the body was discovered. He told Werner a different story of how the blood got on his vehicle's cushion than what Han had told Dennis. He, too, had visited 28 Chuanban late that night, where he had picked up two men and a young European woman wrapped in a white sheet who seemed to him to have trouble moving on her own. It had been her blood on his cushion; Han's account of an unrelated fight was untrue. Werner tried on that basis to persuade the British diplomats to reopen the case, even taking the man with him on one visit, but they felt that the puller was not a credible witness.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nAfter repeated requests, the police returned Pamela's clothes and effects to her father. He learned that many of them had not been checked for fingerprints nor properly preserved, leaving them useless as evidence. But in Pamela's diary he learned that during summer 1936 she had gone on a weekend visit to the Western Hills with Gorman and his family, where he had apparently made a sexual overture to her that she rebuffed. That suggested to Werner another connection to Prentice, and a possible motive for the killing.<ref name=\"French chapter 15\u201316\" />\n\nThroughout 1938 and into 1939, Werner continued his investigations. His repeated efforts to get British officials to reopen the case, which many of them saw merely as a pretext to attack them personally over old grudges or what he perceived as their initial failures in the investigation, led to such strain on his relations with them that they ultimately banned him from the Legation Quarter. Despite this, he was able to work with some of the other legations. The American consulate provided him with information on the criminal past of one of the former operators of 28 Chuanban, and later the Japanese, eager to embarrass the British, were able to get some witnesses to speak with him. But after the [[Tientsin Incident]] in summer 1939, in which the Japanese blockaded that city after Dennis had refused to turn over two Chinese assassins who had sought refuge from their likely execution in the British concession there, even that cooperation ended.<ref name=\"French chapter 15\u201316\" />\n\nUltimately Werner theorized that Prentice, Knauf and their associates from the nudist weekends had lured Pamela to 28 Chuanban under the ruse of a Christmas party in order to have sex with her. When she refused, a struggle ensued, during which someone struck the fatal blows to her head, possibly with a fragment of a chair that had broken earlier (Werner had managed to visit the brothel himself, and noticed a wooden chair where a broken leg had been replaced by a piece of metal). After her death, they transported her body to the Fox Tower, because it was dark and unpatrolled, where they mutilated it with the [[hunting knife|hunting knives]] they regularly carried, which former employees of 28 Chuanban said they frequently displayed, sometimes accompanied by threats. By the time police got around to asking any of them about what might have happened, they had arranged for the absence of key witnesses and coordinated their stories of what happened that night.<ref name=\"French chapter 17\u201318\">French, \"The Hunters\", \"An Invitation to a Party\"</ref>\n\nWerner was finally forced to leave his house and move back into the Legation Quarter in late 1941 after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] along with other British and American bases around the Asian Pacific turned the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] into [[World War II]] between Japan and those countries. Even there he continued his efforts, writing long requests to the Foreign Office, which were not always delivered due to the difficulties of wartime. An unknown reviewer of one of the letters wrote in an attached memo, dated 1943, that the case deserved further examination than it had got up to that point, but nothing appears to have come of it.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\">French, \"The Wound that Wouldn't Heal\"</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nIn March 1943 the Japanese removed all the remaining European residents from the Legation Quarter, including Prentice and Werner, and elsewhere in the city. After being marched to the train station before residents who were required to watch the spectacle, they were put on a train to the [[Weixian Internment Camp|Weihsien internment camp]] in [[Shandong]], where they spent the remainder of the war. According to other survivors of the camp, Werner sometimes confronted Prentice about the killing, although he was not the only person the older man accused.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nThe outset of hostilities was even more trying for Dennis. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese relieved him of his duties as police chief in the concession and imprisoned him, along with other members of the police force, in apparent retribution for his stand against them two years earlier. After months of [[solitary confinement]] and torture that culminated in Dennis signing a confession in Japanese to unknown alleged crimes, he was freed by the intervention of the Swiss consul and returned to England, where he worked a desk job with the [[British Army]] for the remainder of the war. Afterwards he returned to China and took part in the [[war crimes]] prosecutions of some of the officials who had overseen his imprisonment; he returned to England and lived there until his death in 1977.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nHan had been forbidden by his superiors from talking to Werner during the initial investigation, but during a chance encounter with Werner on the street in 1938, apologised to him for his failure to resolve the case. The following year, he was forced out of the police by the Japanese for what they felt to be insufficient zeal in investigating an assassination attempt on [[Wang Kemin]], whom they had installed as president of [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937\u201340)|their puppet state]]. After that his fate is unknown.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nFollowing the liberation of Weihsien at the end of the war in 1945, Werner returned to his home in Peking. There he resumed pressing British officials about the case. The index of Foreign Office records in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] shows one communication in 1945 that raises the subject of reopening the case, with the possibility of some connection to the Japanese, but the document itself has been [[weeding (library)|weeded]] so its contents are unknown. Beyond that it appears Werner's appeals were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nWerner remained in Peking through the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic]] under Mao in 1949. Two years later, he finally returned to England, where he died in 1954. Pamela and her mother were buried in the English Cemetery, now under the pavement of modern Beijing's [[2nd Ring Road (Beijing)|Second Ring Road]].<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\n==''Midnight in Peking''==\n{{main|Midnight in Peking}}\nE. T. C. Werner's lengthy obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' noted Pamela's murder in passing, in a short paragraph about his family. That would be the last time the crime was mentioned in any prominent published source for the remainder of the 20th century.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nIn the 2000s, British writer and business consultant [[Paul French (author)|Paul French]], who had moved to China for his work after studying Chinese at the [[University of London]], came across a footnote in a biography of [[Helen Foster Snow]] briefly discussing her fears in the wake of Pamela's murder that she had been the intended victim, as well as some of the other rumours sweeping foreign Peking at that time. He woke up the next morning wanting to know more about the case, and eventually felt a responsibility to tell the story in some form.<ref name=\"Asia Times interview\">{{cite interview|last=French|first=Paul|subject-link=Paul French (author) |interviewer=Victor Fic|title=Author probes a teenage murder in Peking|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/ML01Ad02.html|publisher=|location=|date=1 December 2011|work=[[Asia Times]]|access-date=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring later research at [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in [[Kew, London|Kew]], rain led him to extend his visit. He looked through a box of 1940s records from the British embassy in China, wondering if any of them would have anything about Pamela Werner's killing. There were many, including a 150-page letter from her father documenting what his private efforts had uncovered about the case, a letter whose conclusions, implicating Prentice and the circle of fellow nudists around him, French accepted as the likeliest resolution.<ref name=\"Asia Times interview\" />\n\n''[[Midnight in Peking]]'', French's account of the case, was published late in 2011 and became a bestseller in many of the countries in which it was published over the next two years.

They posted photographs of many original documents referred to in the book, primarily contemporary newspaper articles, book excerpts and the archived communications of British diplomats discussing the case.<ref name=\"Pamelawernermurderpeking home page\">{{cite web|title=The Pamela Werner Murder|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/|publisher=[[Weebly]]|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Werner's reliability====\n\nPrimarily, they argue, Werner had credibility issues. French's account of Werner's diplomatic career generally downplays the extent to which his difficulties getting along with his colleagues were due to his own inability to get along with them\u2014a \"constant series of frictions\", [[John Jordan (diplomat)|John Jordan]], then British ambassador, wrote to him in 1913. And specifically, French does not mention an incident that year in which Werner struck a customs official with a whip while British consul in [[Fuzhou]], an incident which led the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] to invoke the [[Superannuation Act 1887]] and forcibly retire him, one of only two times it did so with its diplomats in China during the [[treaty port]] era.<ref name=\"Werner's career\">{{cite web|title=Jordan re Werner|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/werners-career.html|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn his response to statements by witnesses to those incidents the site authors reproduce a letter to [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] in which Werner refused to accept blame for the incident and instead focused on the perceived injustices done to him by Jordan and others, a pattern they say is also reflected in his handling of his daughter's murder investigation.<ref name=\"Werner's career\" /> Likewise, Werner's 1928 memoir ''Autumn Leaves'' presents the incident untruthfully, in a manner greatly favourable to Werner, they say.<ref name=\"Werner rewriting past\">{{cite web|title=ETC Werner rewrites his past|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/etcw-rewrites-his-past.html|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe site authors say Werner's dubious credibility should be kept in mind when considering the claims made in the lengthy letters to the Foreign Office on which French relied heavily for ''Midnight in Peking'', claims that would be hard to substantiate and rely in part on unreliable or dead sources, in many cases possibly further tainted by the money Werner offered for their accounts. Many of Werner's assertions about Prentice and other suspects are not mentioned in any other accounts of the investigation, not the Foreign Office correspondence nor newspaper articles.<ref name=\"Case against Prentice\">{{cite web|title=Is there a case against Prentice?|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/is-there-a-case-against-prentice.html|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref> Two of Werner's most important claims against Prentice are actually disproved by documentary evidence: Newspaper records show there ''was'' a later cinema show the dentist could have attended on the night of Pamela's murder,<ref name=\"Prentice at the cinema\">{{cite web|title=Prentice at the cinema|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/prentice-at-the-cinema.html|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref>  and the receipt for Pamela's dental work is actually dated six years earlier than Werner claimed.<ref name=\"Case against Prentice\" />\n\n====Inadequate sourcing by French====\n\nFrench comes in for criticism on his own for his poor sourcing. In an ''[[Asia Times]]'' interview, the authors note, he implied he had relied on the police and autopsy reports from the case<ref name=\"Asia Times interview\" /> but never cited them in his own footnotes for the book. They question whether French really saw them, since archivists at the [[Rockefeller Archive Center]], which keeps all of PUMC's prewar records since the school was established with that family's money, have found no report from an autopsy performed later than 1933.<ref name=\"Autopsy report doubts\">{{cite web|title=The Autopsy|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/autopsy.html|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Who killed Pamela?\">{{cite web|title=Who Killed Pamela Werner?|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/who-killed-pamela-werner.html|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref> Most of French's reconstructed account of the investigation comes entirely from Werner's letters.<ref name=\"Autopsy report doubts\"/> Likewise, any police records from that era did not survive the war years.<ref name=\"Sourcing issues\">{{cite web|title=Who Killed Pamela Werner?|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/sources.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nWerner himself, the site authors note, did not always hew strictly to his theory that Prentice and the nudists were responsible. Just before war with the Japanese began in December 1941, he wrote Ambassador [[Archibald Clark Kerr, 1st Baron Inverchapel|Sir Archibald Clark Kerr]] that, instead of Prentice, he now suspected the Chinese student whose nose he had broken after accusing him of having had relations with Pamela.<ref name=\"Official investigation\">{{cite web|title=Official Investigation|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/official-investigation.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref> French also cited an account of the murder and investigation written by [[Fulton Oursler]], under his \"Anthony Abbot\" [[pseudonym]], [[anthology|anthologized]] in his 1948 volume ''These Are Strange Tales'', originally written for ''True Police Cases'' magazine, based entirely on what Oursler learned while talking to reporters in a Shanghai bar on a visit there and then reviewing newspaper articles about it in his hotel, never coming any closer to Peking. Not only is it the apparent source for French's depiction of Pamela's last words before leaving the skating rink, much more fanciful than what her friends recalled her actually saying, it also sets forth Abbot's theory that the murder was possibly committed by a visiting American who had similarly raped, killed and disemboweled young virgins at home, a theory French never mentions as an alternate to Werner's.<ref name=\"Sources in detail\">{{cite web|title=Sources in detail|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/sources-in-detail.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Japanese involvement and other theories====\n\nThe authors furthermore note that besides the idea that Pamela had been mistaken for [[Helen Foster Snow]], French fails to mention yet more alternate theories of the crime. Werner himself noted that Dennis was convinced that the murderer was a former school acquaintance of Pamela. Snow herself wrote of some ancient Chinese practices involving the harvest and ingestion of human organs for medicinal purposes. The mutilation of the body also suggests the possibility of a [[serial killer]], a possibility that cannot be explored since records of crimes against Chinese residents of Peking at that time are missing if indeed they were kept at all.<ref name=\"Who killed Pamela?\" />\n\nThere is also some evidence, according to the site authors, suggesting that Pamela was killed by the Japanese, supposedly as revenge against Fitzmaurice for his refusal to prosecute the Sasaki incident, in which two British legation guards had allegedly killed two Japanese officers the previous summer. The consul had declined to pursue the charges for lack of evidence. British officials reported to London that the Japanese never even showed them any bodies, and the uniform fragments offered as proof of British involvement were more consistent with those worn by U.S. Marines than any British military personnel.<ref name=\"Sasaki case\">{{cite web|title=Sources in detail|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/peking-consular-court-sazaki-case-1936.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938 [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Sir Edmund Backhouse]], another British Sinologist of the era, told Peking consul Allan Archer that his contacts among the Japanese had told him quite openly that the murder was committed by two of their countrymen as revenge for Sasaki. Archer was impressed enough that he wrote Sir [[Robert George Howe]] in Shanghai about it, saying he thought this was finally the truth and dismissing Werner's theories about Prentice and Pinfold, the only time those theories are mentioned anywhere in British official correspondence regarding Pamela's murder other than Werner's letters. However, Backhouse, whose major scholarly work was exposed as fraudulent years after his death, appears to have been trying to ingratiate himself with British authorities in the hopes of becoming valuable to them as a source of intelligence, as there are many implausibilities in how he claims to have come by this information.<ref name=\"Backhouse claim\">{{cite web|title=Sources in detail|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/backhouse.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Backhouse was not alone in his belief that the Japanese killed Pamela as revenge. Two other British diplomats in Peking at the time told historian P.D. Coates several decades later that it was theorised among them that the Japanese, unable to get to Fitzmaurice's wife since she rarely left the heavily guarded Legation Quarter, settled instead for killing Pamela since she was the daughter of a former British consul who was less secure. \"As you will know,\" one of the former diplomats told Coates, by way of explaining the mutilation, \"there are traditions of this sort of thing in [[Bushido]]\", the Japanese warrior code.<ref name=\"Who killed Pamela?\" />\n\nThe theory of Japanese involvement seems to have persisted within British diplomatic circles to the end of the war. In 1945, an unknown official with the consular office wrote a memo about possibly reopening the case. The index of [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] papers from that year at Kew summarises its subject as \"Murder [of Pamela Werner] by Japanese in 1937\". However, the actual document was [[Weeding (library)|weeded]] years ago and its content is not known or referred to in any other paperwork from the era.<ref name=\"Who killed Pamela?\" />\n\n==''A Death in Peking''==\n\nIn 2018 a second book was published on the Werner murder: ''A Death in Peking: Who Really Killed Pamela Werner?'', by British retired police officer Graeme Sheppard (published by [[Earnshaw Books]]). As well as examining the cases against Prentice, Knauf, Cappuzzo, Gorman, and revealing the full identity and origin of Pinfold, this new account introduces previously unexamined suspects and leads, British diplomat David John Cowan, who died in October 1937, being one of them. It also introduces the previously unreported murder theory as disclosed by [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Sir Edmund Backhouse]] (of Sir Hugh Trevor-Roper's Hermit of Peking fame), i.e. that Pamela was murdered by a group of Japanese militarists in an act of political revenge for the killing of a Japanese officer by British soldiers in 1936. ''A Death in Peking'' concludes that a former Chinese student friend of Pamela, Han Shou-ch'ing, was more than likely the lone offender.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Law|United Kingdom}}\n*[[1937 in China]]\n*[[Cold case]]\n*[[Crime in China]]\n*[[History of Beijing]]\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Werner, Pamela}}\n[[Category:1937 deaths]]\n[[Category:Deaths by beating]]\n[[Category:Crime in Beijing]]\n[[Category:Female murder victims]]\n[[Category:Unsolved murders in China]]\n[[Category:Incidents of violence against women]]\n[[Category:China\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:History of Beijing]]\n[[Category:Dongcheng District, Beijing]]\n[[Category:January 1937 events]]\n[[Category:1930s murders in China]]\n[[Category:1937 crimes in China]]\n[[Category:1937 murders in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Unsolved murder of young Englishwoman in 1937 Beijing}}\n{{Infobox event\n| title                    = Murder of Pamela Werner\n| image                    = Pamela Werner 1936 studio portrait.jpg\n| image_size               = 200\n| image_alt                = A black and white photograph of a young woman wearing a floor-length black dress with short sleeves, her right hand on a neighboring table and her left hand behind her as she faces the camera.

T. C. Werner]], she had last been seen by acquaintances just before leaving a skating rink the previous night. No one was ever charged in the case.\n\nThough British and Chinese officials cooperated in the investigation, it was hampered by official resistance and the city's general chaos: Beijing at the time was crowded with war refugees, there was upheaval elsewhere in China and Europe, and [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese troops]] were on the verge of [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin#The fall of Beiping|occupying the city]]. They focused on some members of the city's expatriate community, but the case was officially closed with the finding that the mutilation suggested a Chinese killer, before they could be sure of any suspects; the Japanese occupation foreclosed any further efforts to reopen it. Some British diplomatic records pertaining to the case were later [[Weeding (library)|weeded]]; Werner, whose chequered career with the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic Service]] in China had alienated many of his former colleagues who oversaw the investigation, later used his own resources to identify American dentist Wentworth Prentice as the likely killer.\n\nA subject of considerable media attention at the time, the case drifted into obscurity with the ensuing outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which soon grew into [[World War II]], and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] leading to the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] a short time afterwards. Interest in the case was revived with the 2011 publication of [[Paul French (author)|Paul French]]'s [[bestseller]] ''[[Midnight in Peking]]'', which endorsed Werner's conclusions and won several awards. However, a website set up by some of Prentice's descendants argues that documentary evidence from the time contradicts that conclusion and casts doubt on many of French's assertions.<ref name=\"NYT neighborhood walk article\">{{cite news|last=Perlez|first=Jane|authorlink=Jane Perlez|title=\nA Mystery Endures in Beijing's Old Legation Quarter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/travel/a-mystery-endures-in-beijings-old-legation-quarter.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 May 2014|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nPamela Werner was a British citizen with an unusual background. At the time of her death she was living in an increasingly tense and teeming city.\n\n===Beijing in the late 1930s===\n\nAt the start of 1937, Beijing (then referred to in Western languages as Peking) and its 1.5 million residents, both Chinese and foreign, knew that they were living in the end of an era. While the city was the third richest in China, it was no longer capital of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. Despite the success of the [[Northern Expedition]], [[Kuomintang]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] had retreated to [[Nanjing]]. Originally his aim was to better consolidate his political power and military position against [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]], which sought to establish a [[Communist Party of China|Communist state]]; but after the December 1936 [[Xi'an incident]], where [[Zhang Xueliang]] had held him hostage for two weeks, he had agreed to Zhang's demand that he seek an alliance with the Communists to better defend China against the Japanese.<ref name=\"French chapter 1\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul French (author)|title=Midnight in Peking: How the Murder of a Young Englishwoman Haunted the Last Days of Old China|date=2012|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101580387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRC897RFkYUC|accessdate=23 December 2016|chapter=The Approaching Storm}}</ref>\n\nChiang had left General [[Song Zheyuan]] in charge of Peking, to do what he could to hold off both the northern [[Warlord Era|warlords]] who still remained and, increasingly, the Japanese, who having successfully [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|taken Manchuria]] [[North China Buffer State Strategy|over the previous six years]] were now camped within a few miles of the onetime Chinese imperial palace, the [[Forbidden City]], and controlled almost all the routes in and out of the city.<ref name=\"French chapter 1\" />\n\nPlanning to use Peking as a base for their eventual conquest of China, the Japanese were working to undermine the city's resistance. They covertly encouraged the drug trade and staged regular military provocations. Chinese residents of the city believed that Chiang was prepared to abandon it to the Japanese if he could just be assured of retaining all of China south of the [[Yangzi River]]. \"The end was coming,\" [[Paul French (author)|Paul French]] wrote in 2011, \"it was just a question of when.\" Many residents assumed that that end would be death at Japanese hands, either by starvation as they besieged the city, or massacred the survivors afterward.<ref name=\"French chapter 1\" />\n\nThe city's population had swelled as refugees flocked to it. Many were Chinese, fleeing the wars and disruption elsewhere in the country. But a sizable portion had come from Europe, primarily [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|Russian Whites]], left [[Statelessness|stateless]] by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist]] victory in the [[Russian Civil War]] and subsequent establishment of the [[Soviet Union]]. Others were Jews, leaving behind the worsening conditions in [[Nazi Germany]] and elsewhere in Europe, joined by those who also felt at risk from the advancing tide of [[fascism]]. They were joined by military deserters evading capture, fugitives from justice in their homelands, and travelers who had either been stranded in China or decided to stay. Most of the European refugees had come to China penniless, and worked menial jobs, or sometimes engaged in criminal activity, to get by. The city's foreign diplomats and businessmen looked down on them as a threat to European hegemony in the city and hoped they would eventually find their way to [[Shanghai]].<ref name=\"French chapter 3\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul French (author)|title=Midnight in Peking: How the Murder of a Young Englishwoman Haunted the Last Days of Old China|date=2012|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101580387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRC897RFkYUC|accessdate=23 December 2016|chapter=An Old China Hand}}</ref>\n\nThey were sometimes joined in this assessment by the expatriates, many of them businessmen who dealt with the Chinese, or those who had moved to China for better economic prospects serving the expatriate community. The disparate exchange rate between strong Western currencies such as the [[pound sterling]] and [[American dollar]] and the [[History of Chinese currency#Silver dollars|Chinese silver dollar]], as well as lower costs of living in China, made it possible for expatriates to live better than they could in their native countries for the same amount of money. American journalist [[Edgar Snow]], then finishing his book ''[[Red Star Over China]]'', the first Western account of Mao and his Communist army, and his wife [[Helen Foster Snow|Helen]] were able to own a racehorse on their earnings as reporters, for example.<ref name=\"French chapter 1\" />\n\n===The Werners===\n\nEdward Theodore Chalmers Werner was a [[New Zealand]]-born British citizen whose wealthy Prussian father took the family travelling around the world in his own youth. He had returned to [[England]] to attend [[Tonbridge School]]. Due to his father's death in his teens, Werner had to find employment after finishing and, after passing the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s cadet exam, he was sent to Beijing to learn Chinese.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nWerner took readily to the country's language and culture, which he studied avidly while serving the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic Service]] in a variety of positions over the next decades, including at one point as [[Consul (representative)|consul]]. However, his interest in the country where he served was coupled with poor personal skills and many of his postings were remote locations, meant as punishments for volatile disagreements with superiors and sometimes those the consular officers served. He nevertheless married a socially prominent woman, Gladys Ravenshaw, and the couple stayed in Beijing after his 1914 retirement, where he continued his studies.<ref name=\"NYRB review\" />\n\nIn 1919 the Werners adopted a two-year-old girl, whom they named Pamela, from the [[orphanage]] run by Portuguese nuns at the [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Beijing|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]], or South Church, in Beijing. Pamela's biological parentage was not known, although her fair complexion and grey eyes suggest that she was, like many of the other orphans at the South Church, the offspring of exiled Russian Whites. After Gladys died of what was said to have been a [[drug overdose]]<ref name=\"Time review\">{{cite news|last=Ramzy|first=Austin|title=''Midnight in Peking'': Has Paul French Solved a 75-Year-Old Murder?|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/04/30/midnight-in-peking-has-paul-french-solved-a-75-year-old-murder/|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=30 April 2012|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref> while being treated for [[meningitis]] in 1922, Werner devoted much of his life to Pamela, teaching her [[Chinese language|Chinese]] to the point that she was fluent from a very early age; later she would emulate her father by traveling around the city on her bicycle, often unaccompanied. Outside the home, he wrote books and articles about China, researched the language and its many dialects on long walks around Beijing, and occasionally lectured at [[Peking University]].<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nThe Werners lived, like a growing number of foreigners, outside the city's heavily secured [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]], a cramped area of about {{convert|1|sqkm|sqmi}} that was the only [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] portion of the city, in contrast to the more populous [[treaty port]]s of Shanghai and [[Tianjin]]. Among their neighbors in the ''[[hutong]]'' where they lived in a modernized ''[[siheyuan]]'', or courtyard house, were the Snows. Werner sent Pamela to the private schools that catered to the city's more affluent foreigners.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nAt the end of 1936, she was on holiday from Tientsin Grammar School in what is now Tianjin. In the wake of some incidents there that may possibly have involved Sydney Yeates, the school's headmaster, making sexual overtures to her, Werner was preparing to send her back to England to continue her education, a move Pamela did not welcome. He feared his growing daughter was maintaining too active a social life for a woman her age and was also worried about some of the young men who had attempted to court her. He had hit one of them, a young Chinese man, with his cane in front of the house during a confrontation.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\n==Disappearance and death==\n\nOn the last day of her life, Pamela went to a dental appointment in the morning and then returned home to write letters. She left the family home in the late afternoon. Ho Ying, a servant who typically went out to purchase food around 3 p.m. daily, informed her at the time he was doing so and asked her if, as was often the case, she wanted him to buy [[sweetmeat]]s when he did so. She declined, saying she herself would be leaving within the hour, although she indicated she would return by 7:30 for dinner, asking Ho to prepare meatballs and rice. When he returned she was gone; the family's gatekeeper had seen her leave with her bicycle.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\">{{cite news|title=Peiping Tragedy Investigated|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/hm-coroners-inquest.html|newspaper=[[North China Herald]]|via=pamelawernermurderpeking.com|date=10 February 1937|accessdate=25 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving, she met Ethel Gurevitch, a younger friend, the daughter of Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, whom she had known for five years, at the [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits|Wagons-Lits]] Hotel, a popular gathering place for the city's foreign community, per an agreement the two had made the day before; Pamela told Gurevitch she had been there earlier and left briefly before returning to meet her. Afterwards they went back to the Gurevitch home where Ethel's mother served the two tea, buttered bread and cake; Pamela ate very little, saying she was not hungry.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\nThe young women then went out to an ice skating rink operated by a French company, arriving around 6 p.m., where they skated with a third friend, Lillian Marinovski, another Russian. The three remained together for most of the time they were there except for one brief period when Pamela went to speak to another girl. Around 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Gurevitch recalled that Pamela said she had to go home for dinner. They asked her if she felt comfortable returning home alone at night; she told them she always went by herself and that \"nothing can happen to me here in Peking.\" Marinvoski saw her bicycle away, with her skates over her shoulder. It was the last time anyone is known to have seen Pamela Werner alive.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\nBy 8 p.m. Pamela had still not returned home; although her father had. Around 10:30 he asked Ho to go to the skating rink and see if she was there; by the time he arrived, the rink had closed and workers were cleaning up for the evening. They could not tell him anything specifically about Pamela as, they said, there had been around 200 people skating at the rink over the course of the evening. Ho returned to the Werner home, where E.T.C. told him to go home for the night. By the older man's later testimony, he went out himself with an [[Flashlight|electric torch]] to look for his daughter, returning at 1 a.m. and going to bed; later he would claim he had spent most of the night looking for her.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\n===Discovery of body===\n[[File:Beijing Ming City Wall SE Corner Tower.jpg|thumb|right|The Fox Tower in 2007|alt=A tall rectangular stone building with a Chinese-style roof seen from near its base with some bare tree branches in front]]\nShortly after 8 a.m. the next morning, two [[rickshaw]] drivers near the [[Beijing city fortifications#Dongbianmen|Fox Tower]] along the city's old walls noticed a group of wild dogs showing interest in a bundle lying in the ditch near the wall, all that remained of the canal that had formerly run along it. An elderly man saw this too, and went down to take a closer look. After finding it was the severely beaten and stabbed body of what appeared to be a young European woman, he ran to the nearest [[police box]], a quarter of a mile (400 m) away, to report it.<ref name=\"French chapter 2\">French, 'The Body at the Fox Tower'.</ref>\n\nThey secured the scene, keeping the dogs away, and covering the body with a bamboo mat to discourage curious onlookers until detectives could arrive. Col. Han Shih-chung of the Peking police supervised the investigation. At first he presumed the decedent to have been yet another of the many Russian Whites who, overwhelmed by despair and/or out of options, had [[suicide|ended their own lives]]; the preceding night having been [[Christmas]] in the [[Russian Orthodox]] calendar lent some support to this. But the wounds seemed more extensive than those a suicide might inflict. Aware that the possible killing of a wealthy foreign woman just outside the [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]] might be of interest to the foreign authorities there, even though the Chinese had jurisdiction, Han called W.P. Thomas, the Legation Quarter's police commissioner, to the scene.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nUncertainty over the woman's identity ended when E.T.C. Werner stumbled across the scene a short while later. After resting at his home, he had resumed his search for his daughter in the morning light and left a note about her disappearance with Thomas's office. When he saw the body, he shrieked \"''Pamela''!\" and collapsed next to the body. He had apparently recognised the clothing and jewellery she was wearing; later a [[constable]] with the Foreign Legation who also knew Pamela confirmed the identification. By the evening the crime scene had been secured and processed, and Pamela's body was taken to [[Peking Union Medical College]] to be [[autopsy|autopsied]].<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\n==Investigation==\n\nThere were plenty of deaths to investigate in Peking at that time. Each morning several bodies were routinely collected from the streets. Most were suicides or natural causes. Homicides were harder to resolve as they could have been either due to routine criminal activity and disputes, or Japanese provocations, or (increasingly) political assassinations carried out by the [[Kuomintang]] of its enemies both internal and external. General Song was also having some of the drug dealers he caught [[summary execution|summarily executed]], particularly if they were not Chinese or Japanese.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nBoth Han and Thomas knew that the investigation into Pamela Werner's death would be unusual. While the Chinese had jurisdiction because of where her body had been found, it was entirely likely that it would be necessary to investigate her death by questioning members of the foreign community, some of whom might enjoy [[diplomatic immunity]] or at least reside in the Legation Quarter, where the Peking police had no authority. That aspect of the investigation would be better conducted by law enforcement officers who ''did'' have jurisdiction.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\nGiven Pamela's social standing, the case would likely attract not only the attention of the press but also official interest. The British diplomats would probably not want to see the case solved in any way that would adversely affect the British image in China. Thomas proposed to Han that the Peking police exercise their right to name the official who could serve as an envoy for the investigation, and suggested that that official be [[Chief Inspector#United Kingdom|Detective Chief Inspector]] Richard Dennis, a [[Scotland Yard]] veteran who was chief of police in the [[Concessions in Tianjin#British concession (1860\u20131943)|British concession in Tientsin]]. He could not be as easily pressured by the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic Service]] since he was not under their authority. Han agreed, and the two would work together to try to solve the case, a binational cooperation unusual for the time.<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" /><ref name=\"Guardian review\">{{cite news|last=Mitter|first=Rana|title=''Midnight in Peking'' by Paul French - review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/08/midnight-in-peking-paul-french-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 June 2012|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nPamela's body, and where it was found, had already yielded some clues. The expensive [[platinum]] jewelry that had helped confirm the corpse's identity had not been taken, suggesting robbery was not the motive. Pamela's wristwatch had been stopped shortly after midnight, suggesting that was when she had died. There was no blood at the scene other than that on her clothes, suggesting she had been killed elsewhere and dumped there. Nearby was her membership card for the skating rink, with some blood on it (however, her bicycle and skates have never been found).<ref name=\"French chapter 3\" />\n\n===Autopsy report===\n\nThe autopsy yielded additional information of interest. Pamela had died from a [[brain hemorrhage]] caused by several blows to the head, possibly inflicted with a smooth-surfaced piece of wood or stone, blows strong enough to [[skull fracture|fracture her skull]].<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" /> From the proximity necessary to inflict those blows, and their directness, the [[forensic pathology|pathologists]] performing the autopsy concluded she had been killed by someone she knew.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul French (author)|title=Midnight in Peking: How the Murder of a Young Englishwoman Haunted the Last Days of Old China|date=2012|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101580387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRC897RFkYUC|accessdate=23 December 2016|chapter=Wild Dogs and Diplomats}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-009048, Rodfeller Hospital in Peking.jpg|thumb|left|Peking Union Medical College, where Pamela was autopsied, in 1924|alt=A black and white image of several buildings with Chinese-style wide-eaved roofs making a corner around a parking area where a 1920s-style automobile is parked]]\nA similar [[blunt force trauma]] injury to the right arm was believed to have been inflicted after death because there was no hemorrhaging around it. Likewise, the low amount of blood released from the stabbings and slashings suggested those, too, were post mortem. They had been inflicted with a knife, likely with two edges to the blade although possibly not equally sharp, at least {{convert|4|in|cm}} long.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\nWithin the body, muscles had been severed cleanly. Through two slits in the abdomen, most of Pamela's internal organs had been removed and her blood drained. The skill required to do this as cleanly and quickly as it had been done suggested to the pathologist that whoever had done so had considerable skill, perhaps that of a surgeon or anatomist. The dogs that had been showing interest in the body could not have inflicted those wounds. Her heart was also missing, with the ribs surrounding broken from the inside to do so, a task requiring a considerable amount of force. A knife had also been used to repeatedly penetrate her [[vagina]], to the point that it could not be determined whether Pamela had been [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] either before or after she was killed.<ref name=\"North China Herald inquest story\" />\n\nOne of the few internal organs that remained was Pamela's stomach. It was found to contain some partially digested Chinese food. Since she had not been known to have eaten anything other than the bread, cake and tea she had had at her friend's house, this along with the time her watch stopped suggested she had been alive for several hours after leaving the ice rink. The time of death was placed between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\" />\n\nPamela's skirt was loose. Her silk [[stocking]]s had been torn, and her underwear was missing. However, her overcoat and scarf were still with the body, along with shoes and some other personal effects. This further argued for the killing having taken place elsewhere, and the body being dressed afterwards.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\" />\n\nIt was concluded that the killing had been sexually motivated, \"not the work of an ordinary sexual sadist\", according to an [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician-gynaecologist]] who participated. Han and the doctors who performed the autopsy believed that the intent had been to [[dismemberment|dismember]] Pamela after her death but that whoever was doing so was unable to complete the task and hastily dumped the body. Colonel Han made sure distribution of the autopsy report was limited as he did not want the details of Pamela's mutilation widely reported in the press since it would make the case harder to solve. He kept the only copy in his desk.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\" />\n\n===Interviews and leads===\n\nHan knew that, as a practical matter, he had 20 days to solve the case, after which his superiors and the press would lose interest in it and other crimes would likely demand his attention. Dennis arrived in Peking by train, preceded by two of his subordinates who would also work with him for a few days. The two began their investigations at once. Many leads poured in, most of them false. One, a [[rickshaw]] puller who had been seen washing a bloodied seat cushion near where Pamela's body was found, turned out to have been cleaning up the mess from a fight between a Russian and an [[United States Marine Corps|American marine]].<ref name=\"French chapter 6\">French, \"The Investigation\".</ref>\n\nThe two interviewed the friends that Pamela had last been seen with; their stories corroborated each other. E.T.C. Werner himself, though grief-stricken, told them of his last afternoon and an overnight search through the city after Pamela had failed to return. Some others in the foreign community, including many of the British diplomats he had clashed with during his career, seemed to think he might have been responsible. He did admit to officers that he had confronted a young Chinese man outside the house whom he accused of being too interested in Pamela, breaking the man's nose with his cane, a move he called an overreaction. The elder Werner told Dennis that he was sending Pamela back to Britain for continued schooling, owing to some unspecified incident at Tientsin Grammar, a development he was surprised the detective was unaware of.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\nIn retracing Pamela's steps of the afternoon and night of 7 January, the detectives did learn one new piece of information. Between 3 and 4 p.m., she had gone to the [[concierge]] at the Wagons Lits and asked about renting a room, going so far as to check out the hotel's brochure. Why she did was not known\u2014she could have been preparing for a visit by a boy from her class at Tientsin Grammar whom she had expressed interest in, or preparing to leave her father's home on a more long-term basis.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\nAlthough Han would not confirm any reports about the extent to which Pamela's body had been mutilated in his first [[press conference]] about the investigation, or Dennis's participation, he admitted that the police had no solid leads at that point, two days afterward. Speculation filled the gap in reporting. The Fox Tower was long believed to be haunted by evil spirits, and there were some theories that settled on that explanation for the killing.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\nSome of the expatriates suggested Werner himself might have killed his daughter in a fit of rage. While his fits of temper were well known, and indeed had adversely affected his diplomatic career, Dennis ultimately believed he was innocent. [[Helen Foster Snow]], one of the Werners' neighbors, told the detective that it might have been possible that [[Kuomintang]] assassins had mistaken Pamela for her, since the two looked similar. She knew that [[Chiang Kai-Shek|Chiang]]'s government had not been happy with the things she and her husband [[Edgar Snow|Edgar]] had said about them, especially in contrast with their sympathetic portrayal of the Communists.<ref name=\"French chapter 14\">French, \"Radical Chic\"</ref>\n\nDennis considered that theory plausible due to the strong resemblance between Snow and Pamela Werner\u2014in the dark the two could easily have been confused. But the political assassinations carried out by [[Dai Li]]'s [[Blue Shirts Society]] and its more elite counterpart, the [[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics|Military Statistics Bureau]], were much tidier affairs. Their targets were usually shot once in the head and dumped somewhere, not extensively mutilated after death.<ref name=\"French chapter 14\" />\n\nHan ordered police to canvass the areas Pamela might have traveled through, particularly the area known as the Badlands just outside the Legation Quarter, a neighborhood of hutongs where the bars and brothels that served and employed many of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s and refugees in the city were located. Since Pamela's body must have been moved, possibly with a vehicle, he ordered officers to find and check every registered automobile in the Peking area, even though those records had not been kept consistently. A week after the crime a Russian landlady in the Badlands told police about finding a bloodied dagger and cloth in the possession of a tenant of hers.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\n===Suspect arrested and released===\n\nThe man, known by the name Pinfold, was taken into custody by Han's officers and held at headquarters on Morrison Street (today [[Wangfujing]]). Dennis not only attended the interrogation but actively took part, despite orders given him in secret to confine his role in the investigation to the Legation Quarter. Pinfold, later identified by Canadian diplomats in the city as a [[desertion|deserter]] from the [[Canadian Army]] who had fled first to the U.S., where he had acquired a criminal record, and then to China, where he worked as a bodyguard to one of the warlords for several years, before falling into low-paying jobs, refused to talk.<ref name=\"French chapter 6\" />\n\nDespite being held overnight, Pinfold would not say anything. He smoked heavily and fidgeted nervously, suggesting he was entering the early stages of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] from the [[opiate addiction]] widespread among the city's less affluent foreign population at the time.<ref name=\"SCMP story\">{{cite news|last=French|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul French (author)|title=Broken in the Badlands|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1361023/broken-badlands|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=23 November 2013|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref> One officer recognized him as a man he had seen lingering a little longer than other passers-by when he passed the crime scene, piquing detectives' interest further. In his personal effects they found a business card for an establishment at 27 Chuanban Hutong, a bar run by a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 that, like many other such businesses in Peking at the time, doubled as a brothel. Canadian officials indicated he had often been seen at 28 Chuanban Hutong next door.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\">French, \"Of Rats and Men\".</ref>\n\nThe address was in the middle of the Badlands, a neighborhood where most of the refugees had settled, replete with hastily constructed buildings and activity on both sides of the law. Pamela ordinarily avoided the area at night, according to her friends, but it was possible that, in her haste to get home for dinner, she might have chosen the more direct route, which would have taken her right past Nos. 27 and 28. Han had a squad of officers raid 28, while he and Dennis chose the more discreet route of visiting 27 themselves.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\" />\n\nThe raid received press coverage but yielded no new clues\u2014patrons who had been shown pictures of Pamela did not recognize her as having been there on the night of 7 January, which had been crowded owing to the holiday. However, at 27 Chuanban, the manager, a former U.S. marine named Joseph Knauf, knew Pinfold and said he worked as security at the neighboring bar. He also told the detectives that Pinfold had been present at weekend [[naturism|nudist]] gatherings at a cottage in the city's [[Western Hills]], where participants also hunted in the surrounding woods, although that was becoming more difficult owing to the increasing Japanese presence.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\" />\n\nArmed with that information, Han and Dennis returned to reinterview Pinfold, whereupon Dennis informed him that they knew about the nudist gatherings. Pinfold's reticence evaporated, and he admitted he had been at the events but only as a security guard (sometimes recruiting women to dance naked for attendees). He claimed not to have known Pamela. He refused to say where the blood on his dagger and clothes had come from.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\" />\n\n===The nudist weekends===\n\nAt this point Dennis was suddenly recalled to Tientsin for a meeting with the British consul there. At it he was briefed on why Werner had abruptly withdrawn his daughter from Tientsin Grammar: apparently Pamela had alleged that the headmaster, Sydney Yeates, who also oversaw the house where she boarded while school was in session, had made sexual overtures to her. Yeates had agreed to leave his post and return to England at the end of the school year; in the wake of the murder, for which Yeates had an alibi, that departure had been [[wikt:prepone|preponed]] to the following week. Dennis was told to make sure the murder investigation did not result in any public disclosure of this potential scandal as it would be injurious to British prestige and standing in China at this very difficult time.<ref name=\"French chapter 10\" />\n\nWerner also caused problems with the British authorities in Peking. They offered a reward of a thousand Chinese dollars, roughly ten times what the average Chinese family lived on per year at the time, for information that would help resolve the case. Werner complained, to no avail, that the reward flyer should be printed in Chinese as well as English, and the money made available via a bank account so that the successful informant could claim it anonymously. Since many Chinese distrusted any governmental authorities, whether their own or foreign, he believed this would make it easier for a local informant to come forward.<ref name=\"French chapter 4\" />\n\nBack in Peking Dennis learned from Han that Pinfold would have to be released. The pathologists had found that the blood on his knife and clothing was animal, not human,<ref name=\"SCMP story\" /> and there was no other evidence he could have been held on. A second pair of keys in his possession had been found to unlock a second residence of his in the Legation Quarter, meaning the authorities there would have to permit him to face charges, and the British consul, Nicholas Fitzmaurice, who was also by law presiding over the inquest as [[coroner]], declined to do so as he did not believe there was sufficient evidence to secure a conviction (nor was he eager to set a precedent that would allow Legation Quarter residents to answer to Chinese courts so easily).<ref name=\"French chapter 12\">French, \"In Beijing Earth\"</ref> After his release his whereabouts are unknown, although he is believed to have left Peking.<ref name=\"Toronto Sun story\">{{cite news|last=Burnett|first=Thane|title=Mysterious Cdn at heart of Chinese cold murder case|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/06/21/mysterious-cdn-at-heart-of-chinese-cold-murder-case|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nPinfold's arrest did, however, yield a new lead. Dennis and Han began focusing on the nudist weekends. The Canadian had told them that they were organized by Wentworth Prentice, an American dentist whose patients were mostly wealthy expatriates and diplomats. He had originally settled in China with his wife and children after graduating from [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine|Harvard's dental school]] in 1918, but in 1932 she had returned to the U.S. with the children. His file at the U.S. consulate suggested that at least one person there had been concerned for the safety of one of his children, but did not explain why.<ref name=\"French chapter 12\" />\n\nDennis and Legation Quarter police commissioner E.D. Howard went to interview Prentice at his flat in the quarter. It was located right next to the ice rink where Pamela had last been seen. When they arrived Prentice had the windows open, because, he explained, his landlord had decided to repaint the walls despite it being wintertime. He said he had never treated Pamela and that he had been at the movies the evening she disappeared.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\">French, \"A Respectable Man of Influence\"</ref>\n\nIn the next day's English-language newspaper, George Gorman, an Irish reporter known to be strongly sympathetic to the Japanese, criticized the police for even considering Prentice a suspect. He vouched for Prentice's character, and suggested the real killers were Chinese, not Western. When Dennis spoke with him he learned that Gorman, too, participated in the nudist weekends. Gorman's wife also told him that the night of 6 January, Pamela had visited their house and taken tea with her and her daughter.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\n===Conclusion===\n\nThe investigation became more complicated at this point. Werner, unhappy with the progress or lack thereof of the case, held a press conference of his own on the steps of the British Legation. He decried the lack of information on why Pinfold had been released. Drawing on his considerable knowledge of Chinese culture, he noted that there was absolutely no Chinese religious or folk tradition that involved the harvesting of organs, suggesting to him instead that contrary to widespread rumour his daughter's killer or killers were not Chinese but Western. To the existing reward he added the offer of 5,000 gold Chinese dollars, most of his life savings, an amount triple what an average Chinese family of the time could earn in their lifetimes.<ref name=\"French chapter 12\" />\n\nHis actions annoyed the authorities enough that they told Dennis and Han not to talk to Werner anymore, since he was so obviously overcome by grief. Contrary to what he had suggested, the killers were likely one or more of the many [[sexual frustration|sexually frustrated]] young Chinese men abounding in Peking at the time.<ref name=\"French chapter 12\" />\n\nDennis, suffering from a nagging respiratory ailment since he had come to Peking, had been told by his superiors in Tientsin that he had to return there soon. After some negotiation on his part, they agreed he could stay as late as that year's [[Chinese New Year]], on 7 February. He and Han knew that as a practical matter time was running out for them to solve the case even before then. They vainly sought to learn where Pamela's blood might have been, knowing that the location where she was killed was the only possible lead they had left.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nOn 29 January the inquest was reconvened. After hearing testimony from Pamela's friends and some of the investigating officers, Fitzmaurice recessed the proceeding for lunch and then announced, over reporters' protests, that in the afternoon he would hear from the doctors who had performed the autopsy ''[[in camera]]''. At the conclusion of the day, he rendered his verdict that Pamela's death was an unlawful killing, but left it open to a later hearing as to who might have committed the crime.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nDespite Fitzmaurice's precautions, the newspapers were able to obtain details of the autopsy report and published them the next day. The details of the mutilation scandalized readers and made the foreign population even more fearful. It also made it more unlikely that the investigation would be able to find a suspect since the details of the killing were now widely known, and Han began to express doubt that the killer or killers would ever be found.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nThe Chinese New Year of 1937 was raucously celebrated in Peking by Chinese and foreigners alike; many believed this might be the last such holiday for them and the city. After nothing turned up or happened that might have shed new light on Pamela Werner's killing, Dennis returned to Tientsin to attend to pressing matters there, and Han moved on to other cases as well. The Japanese provocations were becoming increasingly bold, with tanks being driven through the city and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zeros]] flown overhead at low altitudes as part of what the Japanese generals still claimed was routine military maneuvering even as they steadily increased their presence outside Peking.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nAt the end of June Fitzmaurice officially concluded the investigation into Pamela's death. By then the news had long vanished from the newspapers; a few freelance reporters attended in the hope of getting a short story. Pamela Werner, Fitzmaurice said, had been murdered by person or persons unknown, possibly Chinese.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nAfter the announcement, Fitzmaurice boarded a ship to return to England for his customary long summer holiday. Two weeks afterwards, the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] south of Peking finally led to [[Second Sino\u2013Japanese War|war]]; the [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Japanese took Peking and Tientsin]] by the end of July. Fitzmaurice retired rather than return.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\n==Werner's investigation==\n\nE. T. C. Werner remained in Peking despite the occupation, continuing to live in his ''[[siheyuan]]'' even as many of the city's other foreigners clustered in the Legation Quarter, save the stateless Russian Whites, on the advice of their governments who said they would not be safe outside it. His research activities curtailed by the occupation, he devoted his energies to persuading the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] to reopen the case. He supplemented his requests with information he had obtained on his own, using his still-considerable financial resources. They were considerably helpful in a city where both [[inflation]] and [[unemployment]] had risen sharply as a result of the occupation, and he found many people willing to share information with him, including some former Peking police officers whom the Japanese had let go from the force as politically unreliable.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nHis investigation increasingly led him to the brothel at 28 Chuanban; its owners had apparently closed it the day after the murder and left Peking for Tientsin or Shanghai. Likewise, Pinfold, following his arrest, had gone to Tientsin and asked a friend for help hiring a lawyer; the Canadian had also asked if Prentice had been arrested yet. He also had in his possession a receipt from Prentice for straightening some of Pamela's rear teeth about five weeks before the murder, [[orthodontic]] work so minor it would not have been noted as recent, and perhaps not at all, by the pathologists. This contradicted Prentice's assertion to Dennis that he had never treated Pamela.<ref name=\"French chapter 15\u201316\">French, \"Into the Underworld\" and \"Chuanpan Hutong\"</ref>\n\nWerner's agents eventually led him to the rickshaw puller who had briefly been held the day after the body was discovered. He told Werner a different story of how the blood got on his vehicle's cushion than what Han had told Dennis. He, too, had visited 28 Chuanban late that night, where he had picked up two men and a young European woman wrapped in a white sheet who seemed to him to have trouble moving on her own. It had been her blood on his cushion; Han's account of an unrelated fight was untrue. Werner tried on that basis to persuade the British diplomats to reopen the case, even taking the man with him on one visit, but they felt that the puller was not a credible witness.<ref name=\"French chapter 13\" />\n\nAfter repeated requests, the police returned Pamela's clothes and effects to her father. He learned that many of them had not been checked for fingerprints nor properly preserved, leaving them useless as evidence. But in Pamela's diary he learned that during summer 1936 she had gone on a weekend visit to the Western Hills with Gorman and his family, where he had apparently made a sexual overture to her that she rebuffed. That suggested to Werner another connection to Prentice, and a possible motive for the killing.<ref name=\"French chapter 15\u201316\" />\n\nThroughout 1938 and into 1939, Werner continued his investigations. His repeated efforts to get British officials to reopen the case, which many of them saw merely as a pretext to attack them personally over old grudges or what he perceived as their initial failures in the investigation, led to such strain on his relations with them that they ultimately banned him from the Legation Quarter. Despite this, he was able to work with some of the other legations. The American consulate provided him with information on the criminal past of one of the former operators of 28 Chuanban, and later the Japanese, eager to embarrass the British, were able to get some witnesses to speak with him. But after the [[Tientsin Incident]] in summer 1939, in which the Japanese blockaded that city after Dennis had refused to turn over two Chinese assassins who had sought refuge from their likely execution in the British concession there, even that cooperation ended.<ref name=\"French chapter 15\u201316\" />\n\nUltimately Werner theorized that Prentice, Knauf and their associates from the nudist weekends had lured Pamela to 28 Chuanban under the ruse of a Christmas party in order to have sex with her. When she refused, a struggle ensued, during which someone struck the fatal blows to her head, possibly with a fragment of a chair that had broken earlier (Werner had managed to visit the brothel himself, and noticed a wooden chair where a broken leg had been replaced by a piece of metal). After her death, they transported her body to the Fox Tower, because it was dark and unpatrolled, where they mutilated it with the [[hunting knife|hunting knives]] they regularly carried, which former employees of 28 Chuanban said they frequently displayed, sometimes accompanied by threats. By the time police got around to asking any of them about what might have happened, they had arranged for the absence of key witnesses and coordinated their stories of what happened that night.<ref name=\"French chapter 17\u201318\">French, \"The Hunters\", \"An Invitation to a Party\"</ref>\n\nWerner was finally forced to leave his house and move back into the Legation Quarter in late 1941 after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] along with other British and American bases around the Asian Pacific turned the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] into [[World War II]] between Japan and those countries. Even there he continued his efforts, writing long requests to the Foreign Office, which were not always delivered due to the difficulties of wartime. An unknown reviewer of one of the letters wrote in an attached memo, dated 1943, that the case deserved further examination than it had got up to that point, but nothing appears to have come of it.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\">French, \"The Wound that Wouldn't Heal\"</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nIn March 1943 the Japanese removed all the remaining European residents from the Legation Quarter, including Prentice and Werner, and elsewhere in the city. After being marched to the train station before residents who were required to watch the spectacle, they were put on a train to the [[Weixian Internment Camp|Weihsien internment camp]] in [[Shandong]], where they spent the remainder of the war. According to other survivors of the camp, Werner sometimes confronted Prentice about the killing, although he was not the only person the older man accused.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nThe outset of hostilities was even more trying for Dennis. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese relieved him of his duties as police chief in the concession and imprisoned him, along with other members of the police force, in apparent retribution for his stand against them two years earlier. After months of [[solitary confinement]] and torture that culminated in Dennis signing a confession in Japanese to unknown alleged crimes, he was freed by the intervention of the Swiss consul and returned to England, where he worked a desk job with the [[British Army]] for the remainder of the war. Afterwards he returned to China and took part in the [[war crimes]] prosecutions of some of the officials who had overseen his imprisonment; he returned to England and lived there until his death in 1977.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nHan had been forbidden by his superiors from talking to Werner during the initial investigation, but during a chance encounter with Werner on the street in 1938, apologised to him for his failure to resolve the case. The following year, he was forced out of the police by the Japanese for what they felt to be insufficient zeal in investigating an assassination attempt on [[Wang Kemin]], whom they had installed as president of [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937\u201340)|their puppet state]]. After that his fate is unknown.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nFollowing the liberation of Weihsien at the end of the war in 1945, Werner returned to his home in Peking. There he resumed pressing British officials about the case. The index of Foreign Office records in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] shows one communication in 1945 that raises the subject of reopening the case, with the possibility of some connection to the Japanese, but the document itself has been [[weeding (library)|weeded]] so its contents are unknown. Beyond that it appears Werner's appeals were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nWerner remained in Peking through the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic]] under Mao in 1949. Two years later, he finally returned to England, where he died in 1954. Pamela and her mother were buried in the English Cemetery, now under the pavement of modern Beijing's [[2nd Ring Road (Beijing)|Second Ring Road]].<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\n==''Midnight in Peking''==\n{{main|Midnight in Peking}}\nE. T. C. Werner's lengthy obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' noted Pamela's murder in passing, in a short paragraph about his family. That would be the last time the crime was mentioned in any prominent published source for the remainder of the 20th century.<ref name=\"French chapter 19\" />\n\nIn the 2000s, British writer and business consultant [[Paul French (author)|Paul French]], who had moved to China for his work after studying Chinese at the [[University of London]], came across a footnote in a biography of [[Helen Foster Snow]] briefly discussing her fears in the wake of Pamela's murder that she had been the intended victim, as well as some of the other rumours sweeping foreign Peking at that time. He woke up the next morning wanting to know more about the case, and eventually felt a responsibility to tell the story in some form.<ref name=\"Asia Times interview\">{{cite interview|last=French|first=Paul|subject-link=Paul French (author) |interviewer=Victor Fic|title=Author probes a teenage murder in Peking|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/ML01Ad02.html|publisher=|location=|date=1 December 2011|work=[[Asia Times]]|access-date=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring later research at [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in [[Kew, London|Kew]], rain led him to extend his visit. He looked through a box of 1940s records from the British embassy in China, wondering if any of them would have anything about Pamela Werner's killing. There were many, including a 150-page letter from her father documenting what his private efforts had uncovered about the case, a letter whose conclusions, implicating Prentice and the circle of fellow nudists around him, French accepted as the likeliest resolution.<ref name=\"Asia Times interview\" />\n\n''[[Midnight in Peking]]'', French's account of the case, was published late in 2011 and became a bestseller in many of the countries in which it was published over the next two years.

They posted photographs of many original documents referred to in the book, primarily contemporary newspaper articles, book excerpts and the archived communications of British diplomats discussing the case.<ref name=\"Pamelawernermurderpeking home page\">{{cite web|title=The Pamela Werner Murder|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/|publisher=[[Weebly]]|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Werner's reliability====\n\nPrimarily, they argue, Werner had credibility issues. French's account of Werner's diplomatic career generally downplays the extent to which his difficulties getting along with his colleagues were due to his own inability to get along with them\u2014a \"constant series of frictions\", [[John Jordan (diplomat)|John Jordan]], then British ambassador, wrote to him in 1913. And specifically, French does not mention an incident that year in which Werner struck a customs official with a whip while British consul in [[Fuzhou]], an incident which led the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] to invoke the [[Superannuation Act 1887]] and forcibly retire him, one of only two times it did so with its diplomats in China during the [[treaty port]] era.<ref name=\"Werner's career\">{{cite web|title=Jordan re Werner|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/werners-career.html|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn his response to statements by witnesses to those incidents the site authors reproduce a letter to [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] in which Werner refused to accept blame for the incident and instead focused on the perceived injustices done to him by Jordan and others, a pattern they say is also reflected in his handling of his daughter's murder investigation.<ref name=\"Werner's career\" /> Likewise, Werner's 1928 memoir ''Autumn Leaves'' presents the incident untruthfully, in a manner greatly favourable to Werner, they say.<ref name=\"Werner rewriting past\">{{cite web|title=ETC Werner rewrites his past|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/etcw-rewrites-his-past.html|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe site authors say Werner's dubious credibility should be kept in mind when considering the claims made in the lengthy letters to the Foreign Office on which French relied heavily for ''Midnight in Peking'', claims that would be hard to substantiate and rely in part on unreliable or dead sources, in many cases possibly further tainted by the money Werner offered for their accounts. Many of Werner's assertions about Prentice and other suspects are not mentioned in any other accounts of the investigation, not the Foreign Office correspondence nor newspaper articles.<ref name=\"Case against Prentice\">{{cite web|title=Is there a case against Prentice?|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/is-there-a-case-against-prentice.html|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref> Two of Werner's most important claims against Prentice are actually disproved by documentary evidence: Newspaper records show there ''was'' a later cinema show the dentist could have attended on the night of Pamela's murder,<ref name=\"Prentice at the cinema\">{{cite web|title=Prentice at the cinema|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/prentice-at-the-cinema.html|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref>  and the receipt for Pamela's dental work is actually dated six years earlier than Werner claimed.<ref name=\"Case against Prentice\" />\n\n====Inadequate sourcing by French====\n\nFrench comes in for criticism on his own for his poor sourcing. In an ''[[Asia Times]]'' interview, the authors note, he implied he had relied on the police and autopsy reports from the case<ref name=\"Asia Times interview\" /> but never cited them in his own footnotes for the book. They question whether French really saw them, since archivists at the [[Rockefeller Archive Center]], which keeps all of PUMC's prewar records since the school was established with that family's money, have found no report from an autopsy performed later than 1933.<ref name=\"Autopsy report doubts\">{{cite web|title=The Autopsy|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/autopsy.html|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Who killed Pamela?\">{{cite web|title=Who Killed Pamela Werner?|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/who-killed-pamela-werner.html|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref> Most of French's reconstructed account of the investigation comes entirely from Werner's letters.<ref name=\"Autopsy report doubts\"/> Likewise, any police records from that era did not survive the war years.<ref name=\"Sourcing issues\">{{cite web|title=Who Killed Pamela Werner?|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/sources.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nWerner himself, the site authors note, did not always hew strictly to his theory that Prentice and the nudists were responsible. Just before war with the Japanese began in December 1941, he wrote Ambassador [[Archibald Clark Kerr, 1st Baron Inverchapel|Sir Archibald Clark Kerr]] that, instead of Prentice, he now suspected the Chinese student whose nose he had broken after accusing him of having had relations with Pamela.<ref name=\"Official investigation\">{{cite web|title=Official Investigation|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/official-investigation.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref> French also cited an account of the murder and investigation written by [[Fulton Oursler]], under his \"Anthony Abbot\" [[pseudonym]], [[anthology|anthologized]] in his 1948 volume ''These Are Strange Tales'', originally written for ''True Police Cases'' magazine, based entirely on what Oursler learned while talking to reporters in a Shanghai bar on a visit there and then reviewing newspaper articles about it in his hotel, never coming any closer to Peking. Not only is it the apparent source for French's depiction of Pamela's last words before leaving the skating rink, much more fanciful than what her friends recalled her actually saying, it also sets forth Abbot's theory that the murder was possibly committed by a visiting American who had similarly raped, killed and disemboweled young virgins at home, a theory French never mentions as an alternate to Werner's.<ref name=\"Sources in detail\">{{cite web|title=Sources in detail|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/sources-in-detail.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Japanese involvement and other theories====\n\nThe authors furthermore note that besides the idea that Pamela had been mistaken for [[Helen Foster Snow]], French fails to mention yet more alternate theories of the crime. Werner himself noted that Dennis was convinced that the murderer was a former school acquaintance of Pamela. Snow herself wrote of some ancient Chinese practices involving the harvest and ingestion of human organs for medicinal purposes. The mutilation of the body also suggests the possibility of a [[serial killer]], a possibility that cannot be explored since records of crimes against Chinese residents of Peking at that time are missing if indeed they were kept at all.<ref name=\"Who killed Pamela?\" />\n\nThere is also some evidence, according to the site authors, suggesting that Pamela was killed by the Japanese, supposedly as revenge against Fitzmaurice for his refusal to prosecute the Sasaki incident, in which two British legation guards had allegedly killed two Japanese officers the previous summer. The consul had declined to pursue the charges for lack of evidence. British officials reported to London that the Japanese never even showed them any bodies, and the uniform fragments offered as proof of British involvement were more consistent with those worn by U.S. Marines than any British military personnel.<ref name=\"Sasaki case\">{{cite web|title=Sources in detail|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/peking-consular-court-sazaki-case-1936.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938 [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Sir Edmund Backhouse]], another British Sinologist of the era, told Peking consul Allan Archer that his contacts among the Japanese had told him quite openly that the murder was committed by two of their countrymen as revenge for Sasaki. Archer was impressed enough that he wrote Sir [[Robert George Howe]] in Shanghai about it, saying he thought this was finally the truth and dismissing Werner's theories about Prentice and Pinfold, the only time those theories are mentioned anywhere in British official correspondence regarding Pamela's murder other than Werner's letters. However, Backhouse, whose major scholarly work was exposed as fraudulent years after his death, appears to have been trying to ingratiate himself with British authorities in the hopes of becoming valuable to them as a source of intelligence, as there are many implausibilities in how he claims to have come by this information.<ref name=\"Backhouse claim\">{{cite web|title=Sources in detail|url=http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/backhouse.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Backhouse was not alone in his belief that the Japanese killed Pamela as revenge. Two other British diplomats in Peking at the time told historian P.D. Coates several decades later that it was theorised among them that the Japanese, unable to get to Fitzmaurice's wife since she rarely left the heavily guarded Legation Quarter, settled instead for killing Pamela since she was the daughter of a former British consul who was less secure. \"As you will know,\" one of the former diplomats told Coates, by way of explaining the mutilation, \"there are traditions of this sort of thing in [[Bushido]]\", the Japanese warrior code.<ref name=\"Who killed Pamela?\" />\n\nThe theory of Japanese involvement seems to have persisted within British diplomatic circles to the end of the war. In 1945, an unknown official with the consular office wrote a memo about possibly reopening the case. The index of [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] papers from that year at Kew summarises its subject as \"Murder [of Pamela Werner] by Japanese in 1937\". However, the actual document was [[Weeding (library)|weeded]] years ago and its content is not known or referred to in any other paperwork from the era.<ref name=\"Who killed Pamela?\" />\n\n==''A Death in Peking''==\n\nIn 2018 a second book was published on the Werner murder: ''A Death in Peking: Who Really Killed Pamela Werner?'', by British retired police officer Graeme Sheppard (published by [[Earnshaw Books]]). As well as examining the cases against Prentice, Knauf, Cappuzzo, Gorman, and revealing the full identity and origin of Pinfold, this new account introduces previously unexamined suspects and leads, British diplomat David John Cowan, who died in October 1937, being one of them. It also introduces the previously unreported murder theory as disclosed by [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Sir Edmund Backhouse]] (of Sir Hugh Trevor-Roper's Hermit of Peking fame), i.e. that Pamela was murdered by a group of Japanese militarists in an act of political revenge for the killing of a Japanese officer by British soldiers in 1936. ''A Death in Peking'' concludes that a former Chinese student friend of Pamela, Han Shou-ch'ing, was more than likely the lone offender.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Law|United Kingdom}}\n*[[1937 in China]]\n*[[Cold case]]\n*[[Crime in China]]\n*[[History of Beijing]]\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Werner, Pamela}}\n[[Category:1937 deaths]]\n[[Category:Deaths by beating]]\n[[Category:Crime in Beijing]]\n[[Category:Female murder victims]]\n[[Category:Unsolved murders in China]]\n[[Category:Incidents of violence against women]]\n[[Category:China\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:History of Beijing]]\n[[Category:Dongcheng District, Beijing]]\n[[Category:January 1937 events]]\n[[Category:1930s murders in China]]\n[[Category:1937 crimes in China]]\n[[Category:1937 murders in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Daddyman1962", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDiscovery of body:What other part of the day could 'a.m.' be?", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Pamela_Werner"}

The [[Rashomon effect]] is named after the film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a woodcutter ({{lang|ja|\u6728\u6a35\u308a}}; ''Kikori'', played by [[Takashi Shimura]]) and a priest ({{lang|ja|\u65c5\u6cd5\u5e2b}}; ''Tabi H\u014dshi'', [[Minoru Chiaki]]) sitting beneath the [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon city gate]] to stay dry in a downpour. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest.  As he testifies he first found a woman's hat (which belonged to the wife), then a samurai cap (which belonged to the bandit), then cut rope (which had bound the husband), then an amulet, and finally he came upon the body. Upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife travelling the same day the murder happened. Both men are then summoned to testify in court, where they meet the captured bandit Taj\u014dmaru ({{lang|ja|\u591a\u8944\u4e38}}), who claims to have followed the couple after coveting the woman when he glimpses her in the forest.\n\n===The bandit's story===\nTaj\u014dmaru ([[Toshiro Mifune]]), a notorious outlaw, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but eventually was seduced by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. Taj\u014dmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In Taj\u014dmaru's recollection, they fought skillfully and fiercely, with Taj\u014dmaru praising the samurai's swordsmanship.  In the end, Taj\u014dmaru was the victor, and the woman ran away after the fight. At the end of his story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife.  He says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that the dagger's pearl inlay would have made it very valuable.  He laments having left it behind.\n\n===The wife's story===\nThe samurai's wife ([[Machiko Ky\u014d]]) tells a different story to the court. She says that Taj\u014dmaru left after raping her. She begged her husband to forgive her, but he simply looked at her coldly. She then freed him and begged him to kill her so that she would be at peace. He continued to stare at her with a look of loathing. His expression disturbed her so much that she fainted with dagger in hand. She awoke to find her husband dead with the dagger in his chest. She attempted to kill herself, but failed in all her efforts.\n\n===The samurai's story===\nThe court then hears the story of the deceased samurai ([[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]]), told through a [[Mediumship|medium]] ({{lang|ja|\u5deb\u5973}}; ''[[miko]]'', [[Noriko Honma]]). The samurai claims that, after raping his wife, Taj\u014dmaru asked her to travel with him. She accepted and asked Taj\u014dmaru to kill her husband so that she would not feel the guilt of belonging to two men. Taj\u014dmaru, shocked by this request, grabbed her, and gave the samurai a choice of letting the woman go or killing her. \"For these words alone\", the dead samurai recounted, \"I was ready to pardon his crime\". The woman fled, and Taj\u014dmaru, after attempting to recapture her, gave up and set the samurai free. The samurai then [[seppuku|killed himself]] with his wife's dagger. Later, someone removed the dagger from his chest.\n\n===The woodcutter's story===\nBack at Rash\u014dmon gate (after the trial), the woodcutter states to the commoner that all three stories were falsehoods. The woodcutter says he witnessed the rape and murder, but that he declined the opportunity to testify at the trial because he did not want to get involved. According to the woodcutter's new story, Taj\u014dmaru begged the samurai's wife to marry him, but the woman instead freed her husband. The husband was initially unwilling to fight Taj\u014dmaru, saying he would not risk his life for a spoiled woman, but the woman then criticized both him and Taj\u014dmaru, saying they were not real men and that a real man would fight for a woman's love. She urged the men to fight one another, but then hid her face in fear once they raised swords; the men, too, were visibly fearful as they began fighting. In the woodcutter's recollection, the resulting duel was far more pitiful and clumsy than Taj\u014dmaru had recounted previously, with the men constantly tripping and flailing their swords wildly. Taj\u014dmaru ultimately won through a stroke of luck. After some hesitation, he killed the samurai, and the woman subsequently fled. Taj\u014dmaru could not catch her, but took the samurai's sword and left the scene limping.\n\n===Climax===\nAt the gate, the woodcutter, priest, and commoner are interrupted from their discussion of the woodcutter's account by the sound of a crying baby. They find the baby abandoned in a basket, and the commoner takes a kimono and an amulet that have been left for the baby. The woodcutter reproaches the commoner for stealing from the abandoned baby, but the commoner chastises him. Having deduced that the reason the woodcutter did not speak up at the trial was because he was the one who stole the dagger from the scene of the murder, the commoner mocks him as \"a bandit calling another a bandit\". The commoner leaves Rash\u014dmon, claiming that all men are motivated only by [[psychological egoism|self-interest]].\n\nThese deceptions and lies shake the priest's faith in humanity. He claims it is restored when the woodcutter reaches for the baby in the priest's arms. The priest is suspicious at first, but the woodcutter explains that he intends to take care of the baby along with his own six children. This simple revelation recasts the woodcutter's story and the subsequent theft of the dagger in a new light. The priest gives the baby to the woodcutter, saying that the woodcutter has given him reason to continue having hope in humanity. The film closes on the woodcutter, walking home with the baby. The rain has stopped and the clouds have opened revealing the sun in contrast to the beginning where it was overcast.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Kikori, the wood cutter\n* [[Minoru Chiaki]] as Tabi H\u014dshi, the priest\n* Kichijiro Ueda as the listener, a common person\n* [[Toshiro Mifune]] as Taj\u014dmaru, the bandit\n* [[Machiko Ky\u014d]] as the Samurai's wife\n* [[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]] as the Samurai, the husband\n* [[Noriko Honma]] as [[Miko]], the medium\n* [[Daisuke Kat\u014d]] as Houben, the policeman\n\n==Production==\nThe name of the film refers to the enormous, former [[Raj\u014dmon|city gate \"between modern-day Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]\", on Suzaka Avenue's end to the south.<ref>Richie, ''Rashomon'', p 113.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nKurosawa felt that sound cinema multiplies the complexity of a film: \"Cinematic sound is never merely accompaniment, never merely what the sound machine caught while you took the scene. Real sound does not merely add to the images, it multiplies it.\" Regarding ''Rashomon'', Kurosawa said, \"I like silent pictures and I always have... I wanted to restore some of this beauty. I thought of it, I remember in this way: one of the techniques of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.\"<ref>[[Donald Richie]], ''The Films of Akira Kurosawa''.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, there are only three settings in the film: [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon]] gate, the woods, and the [[courtyard]]. The gate and the courtyard are very simply constructed and the [[woodland]] is real. This is partly due to the low budget that Kurosawa got from Daiei.\n\n===Casting===\nWhen Kurosawa shot ''Rashomon'', the actors and the staff lived together, a system Kurosawa found beneficial. He recalls, \"We were a very small group and it was as though I was directing ''Rashomon'' every minute of the day and night. At times like this, you can talk everything over and get very close indeed\".<ref>Qtd. in Richie, ''Films''.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe [[cinematographer]], [[Kazuo Miyagawa]], contributed numerous ideas, technical skill, and expertise in support for what would be an experimental and influential approach to cinematography. For example, in one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship between them.<ref>''The World of Kazuo Miyagawa'' (original title: ''The Camera Also Acts: Movie Cameraman Miyagawa Kazuo'') director unknown. NHK, year unknown. Television/Criterion blu-ray</ref>\n\nUse of contrasting shots is another example of the film techniques used in ''Rashomon''. According to [[Donald Richie]], the length of time of the shots of the wife and of the bandit are the same when the bandit is acting barbarically and the wife is hysterically crazy.<ref>Richie, ''Films''.</ref>\n\n''Rashomon'' had camera shots that were directly into the sun. Kurosawa wanted to use natural light, but it was too weak; they solved the problem by using a mirror to reflect the natural light. The result makes the strong sunlight look as though it has traveled through the branches, hitting the actors. The rain in the scenes at the gate had to be tinted with black ink because camera lenses could not capture the water pumped through the hoses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon|accessdate=21 December 2012|author=Akira Kurosawa|quote=when the camera was aimed upward at the cloudy sky over the gate, the sprinkle of the rain couldn\u2019t be seen against it, so we made rainfall with black ink in it.}}</ref>\n\n====Lighting====\n[[Robert Altman]] compliments Kurosawa's use of \"dappled\" light throughout the film, which gives the characters and settings further ambiguity.<ref>Altman, Robert. One typical example from the movie which shows the ambiguity of the characters is when the bandit and the wife talk to each other in the woods, the light falls on the person who is not talking and shows the amused expressions, this represents the ambiguity present. \"Altman Introduction to Rashomon\", Criterion Collection DVD, Rashomon.</ref> In his essay \"Rashomon\", [[Tadao Sato]] suggests that the film (unusually) uses sunlight to symbolize evil and sin in the film, arguing that the wife gives in to the bandit's desires when she sees the sun. However, Professor Keiko I. McDonald opposes Sato's idea in her essay \"The Dialectic of Light and Darkness in Kurosawa's ''Rashomon''\". McDonald says the film conventionally uses light to symbolize \"good\" or \"reason\" and darkness to symbolize \"bad\" or \"impulse\". She interprets the scene mentioned by Sato differently, pointing out that the wife gives herself to the bandit when the sun slowly fades out. McDonald also reveals that Kurosawa was waiting for a big cloud to appear over Rashomon gate to shoot the final scene in which the woodcutter takes the abandoned baby home; Kurosawa wanted to show that there might be another dark rain any time soon, even though the sky is clear at this moment. Unfortunately, the final scene appears optimistic because it was too sunny and clear to produce the effects of an overcast sky.\n\n===Editing===\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] writes in ''The Impact of Rashomon'' that Kurosawa often shot a scene with several cameras at the same time, so that he could \"cut the film freely and splice together the pieces which have caught the action forcefully, as if flying from one piece to another.\" Despite this, he also used short shots edited together that trick the audience into seeing one shot; [[Donald Richie]] says in his essay that \"there are 407 separate shots in the body of the film ... This is more than twice the number in the usual film, and yet these shots never call attention to themselves\".\n\n===Music===\nThe film was scored by [[Fumio Hayasaka]], who is among the most respected of Japanese composers.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406802357.html |title=Hayasaka, Fumio&nbsp;\u2013 Dictionary definition of Hayasaka, Fumio &#124; Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> At the director's request, he included an adaptation of \"[[Bol\u00e9ro]]\" by [[Maurice Ravel]], especially during the woman's story.<ref name=kurosawa>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon |title=Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon&nbsp;\u2014 From the Current&nbsp;\u2014 The Criterion Collection |publisher=Criterion.com |date=2002-02-25 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\nDue to setbacks and some lost audio, the crew took the urgent step of bringing Mifune back to the studio after filming to record another line. Recording engineer [[Iwao \u014ctani]] added it to the film along with the music, using a different microphone.<ref>Teruyo Nogami, ''Waiting on the Weather: Making Movies with Akira Kurosawa'', Stone Bridge Press, Inc., 1 September 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|1933330090}}.</ref>\n\n==Allegorical and symbolic content==\nThe film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her [[samurai]] husband through the widely differing accounts of four [[witness]]es, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are [[Unreliable narrator|mutually contradictory]] and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television uses of the \"[[Rashomon effect]]\" focus on revealing \"the truth\" in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa's film on the surface.\n\nDue to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, ''Rashomon'' has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson's article, \"Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of ''Rashomon''\" in the December 1954 issue of the ''Antioch Review'', is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements.<ref>The article has since appeared in some subsequent ''Rashomon'' anthologies, including ''Focus on Rashomon'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137529724] in 1972 and ''Rashomon (Rutgers Film in Print)'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813511798] in 1987.

It also briefly mentions James Goodwin's view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, \"[[In a Grove]]\" (the short story by Akutagawa that the film is based on) was published already in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have been the result of Kurosawa's editing rather than the story about the conflicting accounts.\n\nSymbolism runs rampant throughout the film and much has been written on the subject. Bucking tradition, Miyagawa directly filmed the sun through the leaves of the trees, as if to show the light of truth becoming obscured.\n\n==Release==\n''Rashomon'' was released in Japan on August 24, 1950.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}} It was released theatrically in the United States by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] with English subtitles on December 26, 1951.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Japanese critical responses===\nAlthough it won two Japanese awards and performed well at the domestic box office,<ref>{{cite book |last=Richie |first=Donald |date=2001 |title=A Hundred Years of Japanese Film.

However, [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei Motion Picture Company]] (a producer of popular features at the time) and the Japanese government had disagreed with the choice of Kurosawa's work on the grounds that it was \"not [representative enough] of the Japanese movie industry\" and felt that a work of [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]] would have been more illustrative of excellence in Japanese cinema. Despite these reservations, the film was screened at the festival and won both the Italian Critics Award and the [[Golden Lion]] award\u2014introducing western audiences, including western directors, more noticeably to both Kurosawa's films and techniques, such as shooting directly into the sun and using mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the actor's faces.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 26, 1951, by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] in both subtitled and dubbed versions, and it won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1952 for being \"the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951\" (the current [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] wasn't introduced until 1956). The following year, when it was eligible for consideration in other Academy Award categories, it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction for a Black-and-White Film]]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 98% of 52 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; with an average rating of 9.3/10.

The [[Rashomon effect]] is named after the film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a woodcutter ({{lang|ja|\u6728\u6a35\u308a}}; ''Kikori'', played by [[Takashi Shimura]]) and a priest ({{lang|ja|\u65c5\u6cd5\u5e2b}}; ''Tabi H\u014dshi'', [[Minoru Chiaki]]) sitting beneath the [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon city gate]] to stay dry in a downpour. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest.  As he testifies he first found a woman's hat (which belonged to the wife), then a samurai cap (which belonged to the bandit), then cut rope (which had bound the husband), then an amulet, and finally he came upon the body. Upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife travelling the same day the murder happened. Both men are then summoned to testify in court, where they meet the captured bandit Taj\u014dmaru ({{lang|ja|\u591a\u8944\u4e38}}), who claims to have followed the couple after coveting the woman when he glimpses her in the forest.\n\n===The bandit's story===\nTaj\u014dmaru ([[Toshiro Mifune]]), a notorious outlaw, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but eventually was seduced by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. Taj\u014dmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In Taj\u014dmaru's recollection, they fought skillfully and fiercely, with Taj\u014dmaru praising the samurai's swordsmanship.  In the end, Taj\u014dmaru was the victor, and the woman ran away after the fight. At the end of his story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife.  He says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that the dagger's pearl inlay would have made it very valuable.  He laments having left it behind.\n\n===The wife's story===\nThe samurai's wife ([[Machiko Ky\u014d]]) tells a different story to the court. She says that Taj\u014dmaru left after raping her. She begged her husband to forgive her, but he simply looked at her coldly. She then freed him and begged him to kill her so that she would be at peace. He continued to stare at her with a look of loathing. His expression disturbed her so much that she fainted with dagger in hand. She awoke to find her husband dead with the dagger in his chest. She attempted to kill herself, but failed in all her efforts.\n\n===The samurai's story===\nThe court then hears the story of the deceased samurai ([[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]]), told through a [[Mediumship|medium]] ({{lang|ja|\u5deb\u5973}}; ''[[miko]]'', [[Noriko Honma]]). The samurai claims that, after raping his wife, Taj\u014dmaru asked her to travel with him. She accepted and asked Taj\u014dmaru to kill her husband so that she would not feel the guilt of belonging to two men. Taj\u014dmaru, shocked by this request, grabbed her, and gave the samurai a choice of letting the woman go or killing her. \"For these words alone\", the dead samurai recounted, \"I was ready to pardon his crime\". The woman fled, and Taj\u014dmaru, after attempting to recapture her, gave up and set the samurai free. The samurai then [[seppuku|killed himself]] with his wife's dagger. Later, someone removed the dagger from his chest.\n\n===The woodcutter's story===\nBack at Rash\u014dmon gate (after the trial), the woodcutter states to the commoner that all three stories were falsehoods. The woodcutter says he witnessed the rape and murder, but that he declined the opportunity to testify at the trial because he did not want to get involved. According to the woodcutter's new story, Taj\u014dmaru begged the samurai's wife to marry him, but the woman instead freed her husband. The husband was initially unwilling to fight Taj\u014dmaru, saying he would not risk his life for a spoiled woman, but the woman then criticized both him and Taj\u014dmaru, saying they were not real men and that a real man would fight for a woman's love. She urged the men to fight one another, but then hid her face in fear once they raised swords; the men, too, were visibly fearful as they began fighting. In the woodcutter's recollection, the resulting duel was far more pitiful and clumsy than Taj\u014dmaru had recounted previously, with the men constantly tripping and flailing their swords wildly. Taj\u014dmaru ultimately won through a stroke of luck. After some hesitation, he killed the samurai, and the woman subsequently fled. Taj\u014dmaru could not catch her, but took the samurai's sword and left the scene limping.\n\n===Climax===\nAt the gate, the woodcutter, priest, and commoner are interrupted from their discussion of the woodcutter's account by the sound of a crying baby. They find the baby abandoned in a basket, and the commoner takes a kimono and an amulet that have been left for the baby. The woodcutter reproaches the commoner for stealing from the abandoned baby, but the commoner chastises him. Having deduced that the reason the woodcutter did not speak up at the trial was because he was the one who stole the dagger from the scene of the murder, the commoner mocks him as \"a bandit calling another a bandit\". The commoner leaves Rash\u014dmon, claiming that all men are motivated only by [[psychological egoism|self-interest]].\n\nThese deceptions and lies shake the priest's faith in humanity. He claims it is restored when the woodcutter reaches for the baby in the priest's arms. The priest is suspicious at first, but the woodcutter explains that he intends to take care of the baby along with his own six children. This simple revelation recasts the woodcutter's story and the subsequent theft of the dagger in a new light. The priest gives the baby to the woodcutter, saying that the woodcutter has given him reason to continue having hope in humanity. The film closes on the woodcutter, walking home with the baby. The rain has stopped and the clouds have opened revealing the sun in contrast to the beginning where it was overcast.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Kikori, the wood cutter\n* [[Minoru Chiaki]] as Tabi H\u014dshi, the priest\n* Kichijiro Ueda as the listener, a common person\n* [[Toshiro Mifune]] as Taj\u014dmaru, the bandit\n* [[Machiko Ky\u014d]] as the Samurai's wife\n* [[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]] as the Samurai, the husband\n* [[Noriko Honma]] as [[Miko]], the medium\n* [[Daisuke Kat\u014d]] as Houben, the policeman\n\n==Production==\nThe name of the film refers to the enormous, former [[Raj\u014dmon|city gate \"between modern-day Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]\", on Suzaka Avenue's end to the south.<ref>Richie, ''Rashomon'', p 113.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nKurosawa felt that sound cinema multiplies the complexity of a film: \"Cinematic sound is never merely accompaniment, never merely what the sound machine caught while you took the scene. Real sound does not merely add to the images, it multiplies it.\" Regarding ''Rashomon'', Kurosawa said, \"I like silent pictures and I always have... I wanted to restore some of this beauty. I thought of it, I remember in this way: one of the techniques of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.\"<ref>[[Donald Richie]], ''The Films of Akira Kurosawa''.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, there are only three settings in the film: [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon]] gate, the woods, and the [[courtyard]]. The gate and the courtyard are very simply constructed and the [[woodland]] is real. This is partly due to the low budget that Kurosawa got from Daiei.\n\n===Casting===\nWhen Kurosawa shot ''Rashomon'', the actors and the staff lived together, a system Kurosawa found beneficial. He recalls, \"We were a very small group and it was as though I was directing ''Rashomon'' every minute of the day and night. At times like this, you can talk everything over and get very close indeed\".<ref>Qtd. in Richie, ''Films''.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe [[cinematographer]], [[Kazuo Miyagawa]], contributed numerous ideas, technical skill, and expertise in support for what would be an experimental and influential approach to cinematography. For example, in one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship between them.<ref>''The World of Kazuo Miyagawa'' (original title: ''The Camera Also Acts: Movie Cameraman Miyagawa Kazuo'') director unknown. NHK, year unknown. Television/Criterion blu-ray</ref>\n\nUse of contrasting shots is another example of the film techniques used in ''Rashomon''. According to [[Donald Richie]], the length of time of the shots of the wife and of the bandit are the same when the bandit is acting barbarically and the wife is hysterically crazy.<ref>Richie, ''Films''.</ref>\n\n''Rashomon'' had camera shots that were directly into the sun. Kurosawa wanted to use natural light, but it was too weak; they solved the problem by using a mirror to reflect the natural light. The result makes the strong sunlight look as though it has traveled through the branches, hitting the actors. The rain in the scenes at the gate had to be tinted with black ink because camera lenses could not capture the water pumped through the hoses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon|accessdate=21 December 2012|author=Akira Kurosawa|quote=when the camera was aimed upward at the cloudy sky over the gate, the sprinkle of the rain couldn\u2019t be seen against it, so we made rainfall with black ink in it.}}</ref>\n\n====Lighting====\n[[Robert Altman]] compliments Kurosawa's use of \"dappled\" light throughout the film, which gives the characters and settings further ambiguity.<ref>Altman, Robert. One typical example from the movie which shows the ambiguity of the characters is when the bandit and the wife talk to each other in the woods, the light falls on the person who is not talking and shows the amused expressions, this represents the ambiguity present. \"Altman Introduction to Rashomon\", Criterion Collection DVD, Rashomon.</ref> In his essay \"Rashomon\", [[Tadao Sato]] suggests that the film (unusually) uses sunlight to symbolize evil and sin in the film, arguing that the wife gives in to the bandit's desires when she sees the sun. However, Professor Keiko I. McDonald opposes Sato's idea in her essay \"The Dialectic of Light and Darkness in Kurosawa's ''Rashomon''\". McDonald says the film conventionally uses light to symbolize \"good\" or \"reason\" and darkness to symbolize \"bad\" or \"impulse\". She interprets the scene mentioned by Sato differently, pointing out that the wife gives herself to the bandit when the sun slowly fades out. McDonald also reveals that Kurosawa was waiting for a big cloud to appear over Rashomon gate to shoot the final scene in which the woodcutter takes the abandoned baby home; Kurosawa wanted to show that there might be another dark rain any time soon, even though the sky is clear at this moment. Unfortunately, the final scene appears optimistic because it was too sunny and clear to produce the effects of an overcast sky.\n\n===Editing===\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] writes in ''The Impact of Rashomon'' that Kurosawa often shot a scene with several cameras at the same time, so that he could \"cut the film freely and splice together the pieces which have caught the action forcefully, as if flying from one piece to another.\" Despite this, he also used short shots edited together that trick the audience into seeing one shot; [[Donald Richie]] says in his essay that \"there are 407 separate shots in the body of the film ... This is more than twice the number in the usual film, and yet these shots never call attention to themselves\".\n\n===Music===\nThe film was scored by [[Fumio Hayasaka]], who is among the most respected of Japanese composers.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406802357.html |title=Hayasaka, Fumio&nbsp;\u2013 Dictionary definition of Hayasaka, Fumio &#124; Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> At the director's request, he included an adaptation of \"[[Bol\u00e9ro]]\" by [[Maurice Ravel]], especially during the woman's story.<ref name=kurosawa>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon |title=Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon&nbsp;\u2014 From the Current&nbsp;\u2014 The Criterion Collection |publisher=Criterion.com |date=2002-02-25 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\nDue to setbacks and some lost audio, the crew took the urgent step of bringing Mifune back to the studio after filming to record another line. Recording engineer [[Iwao \u014ctani]] added it to the film along with the music, using a different microphone.<ref>Teruyo Nogami, ''Waiting on the Weather: Making Movies with Akira Kurosawa'', Stone Bridge Press, Inc., 1 September 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|1933330090}}.</ref>\n\n==Allegorical and symbolic content==\nThe film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her [[samurai]] husband through the widely differing accounts of four [[witness]]es, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are [[Unreliable narrator|mutually contradictory]] and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television uses of the \"[[Rashomon effect]]\" focus on revealing \"the truth\" in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa's film on the surface.\n\nDue to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, ''Rashomon'' has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson's article, \"Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of ''Rashomon''\" in the December 1954 issue of the ''Antioch Review'', is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements.<ref>The article has since appeared in some subsequent ''Rashomon'' anthologies, including ''Focus on Rashomon'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137529724] in 1972 and ''Rashomon (Rutgers Film in Print)'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813511798] in 1987.

It also briefly mentions James Goodwin's view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, \"[[In a Grove]]\" (the short story by Akutagawa that the film is based on) was published already in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have been the result of Kurosawa's editing rather than the story about the conflicting accounts.\n\nSymbolism runs rampant throughout the film and much has been written on the subject. Bucking tradition, Miyagawa directly filmed the sun through the leaves of the trees, as if to show the light of truth becoming obscured.\n\n==Release==\n''Rashomon'' was released in Japan on August 24, 1950.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}} It was released theatrically in the United States by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] with English subtitles on December 26, 1951.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Japanese critical responses===\nAlthough it won two Japanese awards and performed well at the domestic box office,<ref>{{cite book |last=Richie |first=Donald |date=2001 |title=A Hundred Years of Japanese Film.

However, [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei Motion Picture Company]] (a producer of popular features at the time) and the Japanese government had disagreed with the choice of Kurosawa's work on the grounds that it was \"not [representative enough] of the Japanese movie industry\" and felt that a work of [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]] would have been more illustrative of excellence in Japanese cinema. Despite these reservations, the film was screened at the festival and won both the Italian Critics Award and the [[Golden Lion]] award\u2014introducing western audiences, including western directors, more noticeably to both Kurosawa's films and techniques, such as shooting directly into the sun and using mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the actor's faces.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 26, 1951, by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] in both subtitled and dubbed versions, and it won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1952 for being \"the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951\" (the current [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] wasn't introduced until 1956). The following year, when it was eligible for consideration in other Academy Award categories, it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction for a Black-and-White Film]]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 98% of 52 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; with an average rating of 9.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"One of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's most acclaimed films, Rashomon features an innovative narrative structure, brilliant acting, and a thoughtful exploration of reality versus perception.\"<ref>{{cite web| title = Rashomon| URL = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rashomon| work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| publisher = [[Flixster]]|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> In [[Time Out New York]], [[Andrew Johnston (critic)]] observed, \"''Rashomon'' is probably familiar even to those who haven't seen it, since in movie jargon, the film's title has become synonymous with its chief narrative conceit: a story told multiple times from various points of view.

The operation was intended to by-pass Axis defenses on the Egyptian\u2013Libyan frontier, defeat the Axis armoured forces and relieve the 1941 [[Siege of Tobruk]].\n\nOn 18 November 1941, the Eighth Army launched a surprise attack. The British armoured force became dispersed and suffered 530 tank losses against Axis losses of about 100 tanks up to 22 November. On 23 November the 5th South African Brigade was destroyed at Sidi Rezegh, while inflicting many German tank casualties. On 24 November Rommel ordered the \"dash to the wire\", causing chaos in the British rear echelons but allowing the British armoured forces to recover. On 27 November the New Zealanders reached the Tobruk garrison, relieving the siege.\n\nThe battle continued into December, when supply shortages forced Rommel to narrow his front and shorten his lines of communication. On 7 December 1941 Rommel withdrew the Axis forces to the Gazala position and on 15 December ordered a withdrawal to [[El Agheila]]. The [[2nd Infantry Division (South Africa)|2nd South African Division]] captured [[Bardia, Libya|Bardia]] on 2 January 1942, Sollum on 12 January and the fortified [[Halfaya Pass|Halfaya]] position on 17 January, taking about 13,800 prisoners.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=97}}\n\nOn 21 January 1942 Rommel launched a surprise counter-attack and drove the Eighth Army back to Gazala, where both sides regrouped. This was followed by the [[Battle of Gazala]] at the end of May 1942.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Eighth Army===\n{{Further|Operation Crusader order of battle}}\n\n[[File:AfricaMap3.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Map showing the area and events of Operation Crusader}}]]\nFollowing the costly failure of [[Operation Battleaxe]], General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was relieved as [[Commander-in-Chief]] [[Middle East Command]] and replaced by General [[Claude Auchinleck]]. The [[Western Desert Force]] was reorganised and renamed the [[British Eighth Army|Eighth Army]] under the command of [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Alan Gordon Cunningham|Alan Cunningham]] replaced by [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Neil Ritchie]]. The Eighth Army comprised two Corps: [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] under Lieutenant-General [[Charles Norrie, 1st Baron Norrie|Willoughby Norrie]] and [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] under Lieutenant-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]].\n\nXXX Corps was made up of [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] (commanded by Major-General [[William Gott]]), the understrength [[South African 1st Infantry Division]] with two brigades of the [[Sudan Defence Force]] (newly arrived from the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] and commanded by Major-General [[George Brink]]) and the independent [[22nd Guards Brigade]]. XIII Corps comprised [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]] (commanded by Major-General [[Frank Messervy]]), the newly arrived [[2nd New Zealand Division]] (commanded by Major-General [[Bernard Freyberg]]) and the [[British 1st Army Tank Brigade|1st Army Tank Brigade]].\n\n[[File:Tobruk2Sollum1941 en.svg|thumb|{{centre|Diagram showing the relief of Tobruk, 1941}}]]\nThe Eighth Army also included the Tobruk garrison with the 32nd Army Tank Brigade, and the [[Australian 9th Division]] which (in late 1941), was in the process of being replaced by the British [[70th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|70th Infantry Division]] and the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade|Polish Carpathian Brigade]] (commanded by Major-General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski]]).Australian Major General [[Leslie Morshead]] had been succeeded as  Allied commander at Tobruk by British Major General [[Ronald Scobie]]. However, by November, the Australian [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]] remained in Tobruk, under Brigadier [[John Murray (general)|John Murray]].\n\nIn reserve, the Eighth Army had the [[South African 2nd Infantry Division]], making a total equivalent of about seven [[Division (military)|divisions]] with 770 tanks (including many of the new [[Crusader tank|Crusader]] [[Cruiser tank]]s, after which the operation was named, and new American [[M3 Stuart]] light tanks).

Central to the plan was the destruction of the Axis armour by 7th Armoured Division to allow the relatively lightly armoured XIII Corps to advance north to Bardia on the coast whilst XXX Corps continued north-west to Tobruk and link with a breakout by the 70th Division. There was also a deception plan to persuade the Axis that the main Allied attack would not be ready until early December and would be a sweeping outflanking move through Jarabub, an oasis on the edge of the Great Sand Sea, more than {{convert|150|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south of the real point of attack.

However, 4th Armoured soon started to receive intelligence that the two German Panzer divisions were linking up. In his original battle plan Cunningham had hoped for this so that he would be able to bring his own larger tank force to bear and defeat the ''Afrika Korps'' armour. By attaching 4th Armoured Brigade to XIII Corps, allowing 22nd Armoured Brigade to be sidetracked fighting the Ariete Division and letting 7th Armoured Brigade forge towards Tobruk, his armoured force was by this time hopelessly dispersed. 22nd Armoured Brigade were therefore disengaged from the Ariete and ordered to move east and support 4th Armoured Brigade (while infantry and artillery elements of 1st South African Division were to hold the Ariete) and 4th Armoured were released from their role of defending XIII Corps' flank.{{sfn|Murphy|1961|pp=88\u201390}}\n\nIn the afternoon of 20 November, 4th Armoured were engaged with 15th Panzer Division (21st Panzer having temporarily withdrawn for lack of fuel and ammunition).

Cr\u00fcwell wanted to eliminate the threat of the 7th Armoured Division tanks to the south and felt this needed attention first. 15th Panzer spent most of 28 November once more engaged with 4th and 22nd Armoured and dealing with supply problems.

He drew the inference that Army HQ had given up hope of holding the Tobruk corridor and signalled mid-morning that without the South Africans his position would be untenable and that he was planning a withdrawal.

However the Axis strongholds on the Libya\u2013Egypt border remained, despite Rommel's recommendation that they be evacuated by sea, to block the coast road and tie down Allied troops. Early in December the Allies decided that clearing the Axis frontier positions was essential to facilitate their supply lines and maintain the momentum of their advance. On 16 December the [[2nd Infantry Division (South Africa)|2nd South African Division]] commenced an attack on Bardia, garrisoned by 2,200 German and 6,600 Italian troops and on 2 January 1942 the port fell. Sollum fell to the South Africans on 12 January after a small fiercely fought engagement, surrounding the fortified [[Halfaya Pass]] position (which included the escarpment, the plateau above it and the surrounding ravines) and cut it off from the sea. The Halfaya garrison, of 4,200 Italians of the 55th ''Savona'' Infantry Division and 2,100 Germans, was already desperately short of food and water.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=95\u201396}} The defences allowed the garrison to hold out against heavy artillery and aerial bombardment with relatively few casualties but hunger and thirst forced a capitulation on 17 January.{{sfn|Clifford|1943|pp=219\u2013221}} Rommel reported of General [[Fedele de Giorgis]], \"Superb leadership was shown by the Italian General de Giorgis, who commanded this German-Italian force in its two months' struggle\".{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|1999|p=130}}\n\nOn 21 January Rommel launched a surprise counter-attack from El Agheila. Although the action had originally been a \"reconnaissance in force\", finding the Eighth Army forward elements to be dispersed and tired, in his typical manner he took advantage of the situation and drove Eighth Army back to Gazala where they took up defensive positions along Rommel's old line. Here a stalemate set in as both sides regrouped, rebuilt and reorganised. While it may have proved a limited success, Operation Crusader showed that the Axis could be beaten and was a fine illustration of the dynamic, back and forth fighting which characterised the [[North African Campaign]]. [[Geoffrey Cox (journalist)|Geoffrey Cox]] wrote that Sidi Rezegh was the \"forgotten battle\" of the Desert War. Crusader was \"won by a hair\u2019s breadth\" by the Eighth Army but \"had we lost it, we would have had to fight the battle of Alamein six months or a year earlier, without the decisive weapon of the [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]]\".{{sfn|Cox|1987|p=196}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War II}}\n* [[List of World War II Battles]]\n* [[North African Campaign timeline]]\n* [[List of World War II North Africa Airfields]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{ notelist|1}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Bentz |first=G. |title=From El Wak to Sidi Rezegh: The Union Defence Force's First Experience of Battle in East and North Africa, 1940\u20131941 |journal=Scientia Militaria: South African Journal of Military Studies |volume=XL |number=3 |pages=177\u2013199 |location=South Africa |publisher=Stellenbosch University |year=2012 |oclc=851625548}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Codenames of World War II |first=Christopher |last=Chant |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-134-64787-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n |title =Three Against Rommel: The Campaigns of Wavell, Auchinleck and Alexander\n |first=Alexander\n |last=Clifford\n |year = 1943\n |publisher = George G.

The operation was intended to by-pass Axis defenses on the Egyptian\u2013Libyan frontier, defeat the Axis armoured forces and relieve the 1941 [[Siege of Tobruk]].\n\nOn 18 November 1941, the Eighth Army launched a surprise attack. The British armoured force became dispersed and suffered 530 tank losses against Axis losses of about 100 tanks up to 22 November. On 23 November the 5th South African Brigade was destroyed at Sidi Rezegh, while inflicting many German tank casualties. On 24 November Rommel ordered the \"dash to the wire\", causing chaos in the British rear echelons but allowing the British armoured forces to recover. On 27 November the New Zealanders reached the Tobruk garrison, relieving the siege.\n\nThe battle continued into December, when supply shortages forced Rommel to narrow his front and shorten his lines of communication. On 7 December 1941 Rommel withdrew the Axis forces to the Gazala position and on 15 December ordered a withdrawal to [[El Agheila]]. The [[2nd Infantry Division (South Africa)|2nd South African Division]] captured [[Bardia, Libya|Bardia]] on 2 January 1942, Sollum on 12 January and the fortified [[Halfaya Pass|Halfaya]] position on 17 January, taking about 13,800 prisoners.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=97}}\n\nOn 21 January 1942 Rommel launched a surprise counter-attack and drove the Eighth Army back to Gazala, where both sides regrouped. This was followed by the [[Battle of Gazala]] at the end of May 1942.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Eighth Army===\n{{Further|Operation Crusader order of battle}}\n\n[[File:AfricaMap3.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Map showing the area and events of Operation Crusader}}]]\nFollowing the costly failure of [[Operation Battleaxe]], General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was relieved as [[Commander-in-Chief]] [[Middle East Command]] and replaced by General [[Claude Auchinleck]]. The [[Western Desert Force]] was reorganised and renamed the [[British Eighth Army|Eighth Army]] under the command of [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Alan Gordon Cunningham|Alan Cunningham]] replaced by [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Neil Ritchie]]. The Eighth Army comprised two Corps: [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] under Lieutenant-General [[Charles Norrie, 1st Baron Norrie|Willoughby Norrie]] and [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] under Lieutenant-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]].\n\nXXX Corps was made up of [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] (commanded by Major-General [[William Gott]]), the understrength [[South African 1st Infantry Division]] with two brigades of the [[Sudan Defence Force]] (newly arrived from the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] and commanded by Major-General [[George Brink]]) and the independent [[22nd Guards Brigade]].

Central to the plan was the destruction of the Axis armour by 7th Armoured Division to allow the relatively lightly armoured XIII Corps to advance north to Bardia on the coast whilst XXX Corps continued north-west to Tobruk and link with a breakout by the 70th Division.

By attaching 4th Armoured Brigade to XIII Corps, allowing 22nd Armoured Brigade to be sidetracked fighting the Ariete Division and letting 7th Armoured Brigade forge towards Tobruk, his armoured force was by this time hopelessly dispersed. 22nd Armoured Brigade were therefore disengaged from the Ariete and ordered to move east and support 4th Armoured Brigade (while infantry and artillery elements of 1st South African Division were to hold the Ariete) and 4th Armoured were released from their role of defending XIII Corps' flank.{{sfn|Murphy|1961|pp=88\u201390}}\n\nIn the afternoon of 20 November, 4th Armoured were engaged with 15th Panzer Division (21st Panzer having temporarily withdrawn for lack of fuel and ammunition).

The two brigades made good progress but narrowly failed to breach the line.{{sfn|Murphy|1961|p=497}}\n\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A group of [[Sikh]] soldiers from the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] during the operation}}]]\nMeanwhile, on 14 December, to the south, there was little activity from the ''Afrika Korps'' and 7th Indian Infantry Brigade were limited to patrolling through a shortage of ammunition as supply problems multiplied.<ref name=\"CM167\">Mackenzie (1951), p.167</ref> At Alem Hamza 5th Indian Brigade renewed their attack but made no progress against determined defence and at Point 204 5th Indian Brigade's battalion of the Royal East Kent Regiment (\"The Buffs\"), supported by ten I tanks, an armoured car squadron of the Central India Horse, a company of Bombay Sappers and Miners and the artillery of 31st Field Regiment and elements of 73rd Anti-Tank Regiment and some anti-aircraft guns,<ref name=\"CM168\">Mackenzie (1951), p. 168</ref> were attacked by ten or twelve tanks, the remnants of the ''Ariete'' Armoured Division, which they beat off.\n\nOn 15 December, the ''Brescia'' and ''Pavia'', with ''Trento'' in close support, repelled a strong Polish\u2013New Zealand attack, thus freeing the German 15th Panzer Division which had returned to the Gazala Line, to be used elsewhere,\n\n{{quote|The Poles and New Zealanders made good initial progress, but the Italians rallied well, and by noon it was clear to [General Alfred] Godwin-Austen that his two brigades lacked the weight to achieve a breakthrough on the right flank.

The Buffs lost over 1,000 men killed or captured with only 71 men and a battery of field artillery escaping.<ref name=\"CM169\">Mackenzie (1951), p. 169</ref> Fortunately for the rest of 5th Indian Brigade it was by then too late in the day for the attacking force to collect itself and advance further to intervene at Alem Hamza.{{sfn|Murphy|1961|pp=499\u2013500}} The attackers too had suffered heavily in the engagement: the German commander was heard on a radio intercept to report the inability of his force to exploit his success because of losses sustained.<ref name=\"CM169\"/>\nBy 15 December ''Afrika Korps'' were down to eight working tanks, although the ''Ariete'' still had some 30. Rommel, who had greater respect for the capabilities of 7th Armoured at this time than either Cr\u00fcwell (or apparently even Gott), became very concerned about a perceived flanking move to the south by the British armour. Despite the vehement objections of the Italian generals as well as Cr\u00fcwell, he ordered an evacuation of the Gazala line on the night of the 15th.{{sfn|Murphy|1961|p=501}}\n\nBy the afternoon of 15 December, 4th Armoured, having looped round to the south, was at Bir Halegh el Eleba, some {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} northwest of Alem Hamza and ideally placed both to strike at the rear of the ''Afrika Korps'' and advance north to cut ''Panzer Group Afrika's'' main lines of communication along the coast, which Godwin-Austen was urging them to do. However, early on 16 December only a small detachment was sent north (which caused serious confusion among ''Panzer Group Afrika's'' rear echelon but was not decisive) while the rest of the brigade headed south to meet its petrol supplies. In the afternoon 15th Panzer moving west were able to pass by 4th Armoured's rear and block any return move to the north. While the mere presence of the British armour had tipped Rommel's hand to withdraw from Gazala, the opportunity to gain a decisive victory had been missed.{{sfn|Murphy|1961|pp=502\u2013504}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0927-503, Bei El Agheila, Rommel bei italienischer Division.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Rommel conversing with his staff near [[El Agheila]], 12 January 1942}}]]\nOver the following ten days Rommel's forces withdrew to a line between Ajedabia and El Haseia, maintaining his lines of communication and avoiding being cut off and surrounded as the Italians had been the previous year. As his lines of supply shortened and supplies to [[El Agheila]] improved he was able to rebuild his tank force while correspondingly the Eighth Army lines of supply became more and more stretched. On 27 December Rommel was able in a three-day tank battle at El Haseia to inflict heavy damage on the 22nd Armoured Brigade, forcing the leading echelons of Eighth Army to withdraw.<ref name=\"Toppe, Vol. II, p. A-8-15\">Toppe, Vol. II, p. A-8-15.</ref> This allowed the Axis forces to fall back to a tactically more desirable defensive line at El Agheila during the first two weeks of January without having to deal with pressure from the enemy.<ref name=\"Toppe, Vol. II, p. A-8-15\"/>\n\nAuchinleck's determination and Ritchie's aggression had removed the Axis threat to Egypt and the [[Suez Canal]] for the time being. However the Axis strongholds on the Libya\u2013Egypt border remained, despite Rommel's recommendation that they be evacuated by sea, to block the coast road and tie down Allied troops. Early in December the Allies decided that clearing the Axis frontier positions was essential to facilitate their supply lines and maintain the momentum of their advance. On 16 December the [[2nd Infantry Division (South Africa)|2nd South African Division]] commenced an attack on Bardia, garrisoned by 2,200 German and 6,600 Italian troops and on 2 January 1942 the port fell. Sollum fell to the South Africans on 12 January after a small fiercely fought engagement, surrounding the fortified [[Halfaya Pass]] position (which included the escarpment, the plateau above it and the surrounding ravines) and cut it off from the sea. The Halfaya garrison, of 4,200 Italians of the 55th ''Savona'' Infantry Division and 2,100 Germans, was already desperately short of food and water.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=95\u201396}} The defences allowed the garrison to hold out against heavy artillery and aerial bombardment with relatively few casualties but hunger and thirst forced a capitulation on 17 January.{{sfn|Clifford|1943|pp=219\u2013221}} Rommel reported of General [[Fedele de Giorgis]], \"Superb leadership was shown by the Italian General de Giorgis, who commanded this German-Italian force in its two months' struggle\".{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|1999|p=130}}\n\nOn 21 January Rommel launched a surprise counter-attack from El Agheila. Although the action had originally been a \"reconnaissance in force\", finding the Eighth Army forward elements to be dispersed and tired, in his typical manner he took advantage of the situation and drove Eighth Army back to Gazala where they took up defensive positions along Rommel's old line. Here a stalemate set in as both sides regrouped, rebuilt and reorganised. While it may have proved a limited success, Operation Crusader showed that the Axis could be beaten and was a fine illustration of the dynamic, back and forth fighting which characterised the [[North African Campaign]]. [[Geoffrey Cox (journalist)|Geoffrey Cox]] wrote that Sidi Rezegh was the \"forgotten battle\" of the Desert War. Crusader was \"won by a hair\u2019s breadth\" by the Eighth Army but \"had we lost it, we would have had to fight the battle of Alamein six months or a year earlier, without the decisive weapon of the [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]]\".{{sfn|Cox|1987|p=196}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War II}}\n* [[List of World War II Battles]]\n* [[North African Campaign timeline]]\n* [[List of World War II North Africa Airfields]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{ notelist|1}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Bentz |first=G. |title=From El Wak to Sidi Rezegh: The Union Defence Force's First Experience of Battle in East and North Africa, 1940\u20131941 |journal=Scientia Militaria: South African Journal of Military Studies |volume=XL |number=3 |pages=177\u2013199 |location=South Africa |publisher=Stellenbosch University |year=2012 |oclc=851625548}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Codenames of World War II |first=Christopher |last=Chant |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-134-64787-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n |title =Three Against Rommel: The Campaigns of Wavell, Auchinleck and Alexander\n |first=Alexander\n |last=Clifford\n |year = 1943\n |publisher = George G.

{"title_page": "Anime music video", "text_new": "[[File:AKROSS Con Screening (2009).jpg|thumb|264x264px|AKROSS Con Screening (2009) ]]\n{{Anime and manga}}\nAn '''anime music video''' ('''AMV'''), known in [[wasei-eigo]] as '''MAD''' ('''music anime douga'''), is a [[Fan labor|fan-made]] [[music video]] consisting of clips from one or more Japanese animated shows or movies set to an audio track, often songs or promotional trailer audio. The term is generally specific to Japanese anime, however, it can occasionally include American animation footage or video game footage. AMVs are not official music videos released by the musicians, they are fan compositions which synchronize edited video clips with an audio track. AMVs are most commonly posted and distributed over the Internet through AnimeMusicVideos.org or [[YouTube]]. [[Anime convention]]s frequently run AMV contests who usually show the finalists/winner's AMVs.\n\nAMVs should not be confused with music videos that employ original, professionally made animation (such as numerous music videos for songs by [[Iron Maiden]]), or with such short music video films (such as Japanese duo [[Chage and Aska]]'s song \"[[On Your Mark]]\" that was produced by the film company [[Studio Ghibli]]). AMVs should also not be confused with fan-made \"general animation\" videos using non-Japanese animated video sources like [[Western world|western]] cartoons, or with the practice of [[vidding]] in Western [[media fandom]], which [[convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] and has a distinct history and fan culture. Parallels can be drawn between AMVs and [[songvid]]s, animated fan-made videos using footage from movies, television series, or other sources.\n\nThe first anime music video was created in 1982 by 21-year-old Jim Kaposztas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fo20071115pm.html |last=Macias |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Macias |title=Remix this: anime gets hijacked |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> Kaposztas hooked up two [[VCR]]s to each other and edited the most violent scenes from ''[[Star Blazers]]'' to \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" by [[The Beatles]] to produce a humorous effect.<ref>{{cite av media |author=AnimeCons TV |url=https://animecons.tv/extra/17/jim-kaposztas-interview|title=Jim Kaposztas Interview|date=2 October 2011|accessdate=1 June 2018|publisher=AnimeCons TV}}</ref>\n\n==Creation==\nThe creation of an AMV centers on using various [[film editing|video editing]] styles to create a feeling of synchronization and unity. Some examples include: \n* Raw Editing: Using basic zooming in and out \"effects\" along with simple transitions. \n* FX (Effects) Editing: This style consists of large amounts of visual effects. This can be accomplished in programs such as Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects.\n* Timing Editing: The editor edits the clips such that the anime footage is in sync with the lyrics or beats (from the song) to create a perfect harmony. (E.g. Matching beats to gunshot scenes or making an anime character's lips move to make it seem like the character is saying or singing those words in the AMV)\n* Flow Editing: This requires the editor to use transitions and to keep the AMV flowing rather than to have it consist of rough cuts and choppy parts.\n* Animation Editing: Although it sounds similar to the term AMV editing, it is a new style where editors take a still image and animate it (making it move) (This also applies to Manga Music Videos (MMVs) which are similar to AMVs, instead they use manga as the main source of footage).\n* Masking: This style requires the editor to remove the background from the anime scene they would like to add effects to. It is a painstaking and time-consuming process.\n\n==Popularity==\n[[John Oppliger]] of [[AnimeNation]] has noted that fan-produced AMVs are popular mostly with Western fans but not with Japanese fans. One reason he cited was that Western fans experience a \"more purely\" visual experience inasmuch as most Western fans cannot understand the Japanese language, the original language of most [[anime]], and as a result \"the visuals make a greater impact\" on the senses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/09/08/ask-john-why-are-anime-music-videos-so-popular/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |authorlink=John Oppliger |title=Ask John: Why Are Anime Music Videos so Popular? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=2003-09-08 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430072040/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/09/08/ask-john-why-are-anime-music-videos-so-popular/ |archivedate=2009-04-30 }}</ref> The second reason he cited was that Westerners are \"encouraged by social pressure to grow out of cartoons and comics during the onset of adolescence\" whereas Japanese natives grow up with animation \"as a constant companion\";  as a result, English-speaking fans tend to utilize and reconstruct existing anime to create AMVs whereas Japanese fans \"are more intuitively inclined\" to create or expand on existing manga and anime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/06/23/ask-john-why-hasnt-doujinshi-caught-on-outside-of-japan/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |authorlink=John Oppliger |title=Ask John: Why Hasn\u2019t Doujinshi Caught on Outside of Japan? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=2005-06-23 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111225513/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/06/23/ask-john-why-hasnt-doujinshi-caught-on-outside-of-japan/ |archivedate=2012-01-11 }}</ref>\n\n== Legal issues ==\nThe Japanese culture is generally permissive with regard to the appropriation of ideas. Works such as [[d\u014djinshi]], unauthorized comics continuing the story of an official comic series, are actually encouraged by many anime makers.<ref name=\"lessig1\">{{cite book |last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |title=Free Culture |publisher=Authorama.com |date=March 25, 2004 |url=http://www.authorama.com/book/free-culture.html |accessdate=2009-09-08 |chapter=Chapter One: Creators |chapterurl=http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-4.html |quote=This is the phenomenon of d\u014djinshi. D\u014djinshi are also comics, but they are a kind of copycat comic. The creation of d\u014djinshi is governed by a creators' ethic stating that a work is not d\u014djinshi if it is just a copy; the artist must make a contribution to the art he copies by transforming it either subtly or significantly... These copycat comics exhibit significant market penetration as well. More than 33,000 \"circles\" of creators from across Japan produce d\u014djinshi. More than 450,000 Japanese come together twice a year, in the largest public gathering in the country, to exchange and sell them. This market exists in parallel to the mainstream commercial manga market. In some ways, it obviously competes with that market, but there is no sustained effort by those who control the commercial manga market to shut the d\u014djinshi market down. It flourishes, despite the competition and despite the law.\"}}</ref> These d\u014djinshi take an original copyrighted work and expand upon the story, allowing the characters to continue on after, before, or during the original story. Most anime producers encourage this practice, as it expands their series. Some see it as a tribute while others see it from a business viewpoint that it draws in more support for the anime than it would have had otherwise. Some [[Mangaka|manga artists]] create their own d\u014djinshi, such as Maki Murakami's \"circle\" Crocodile Ave (''[[Gravitation (manga)|Gravitation]]'').\n\nIn an interview with site AnimeNewsNetwork, [[Funimation|FUNimation]] Entertainment copyright specialist Evan Flournay said they generally see AMVs as a sort of free advertising. \"The basic thinking going into fan videos is thus: if it whets the audience's appetite, we'll leave it alone. But if it sates the audience's appetite, it needs to come down,\" he says.<ref name=\"funimation-copyright-amvs\">[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/chicks-on-anime/2009-05-05 \"Chicks On Anime: Copyright Enforcement Interview\"].

Discussion on the AnimeMusicVideos.org forum, thread created May 5, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn recent years there has been an increased demand, primarily on the part of the record industry, for the removal of AMVs from sites like [[YouTube]] and AnimeMusicVideos.org, with particular regard to YouTube due to its relative popularity as well as its for-profit status. Public discussions and perspectives give varying accounts of exactly how widespread these actions have become. Most notably in November 2005, the administrator of AnimeMusicVideos.org (Phade) was contacted by [[Wind-up Records]], requesting the removal of content featuring the work of the bands [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Evanescence]], and [[Seether]].<ref name=\"amvorg-takedown\">[http://www.animemusicvideos.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=60255 \"Evanescence, Seether and Creed videos no longer available\"].

A number of AMV editors report to having had positive contact with various artists, including [[Trey Gunn]] and [[Mae]].<ref name=\"amvorg-artists-like\">[http://www.animemusicvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=93284 \"Musical artists who like AMVs\"].

The term is generally specific to Japanese anime, however, it can occasionally include American animation footage or video game footage. AMVs are not official music videos released by the musicians, they are fan compositions which synchronize edited video clips with an audio track. AMVs are most commonly posted and distributed over the Internet through AnimeMusicVideos.org or [[YouTube]]. [[Anime convention]]s frequently run AMV contests who usually show the finalists/winner's AMVs.\n\nAMVs should not be confused with music videos that employ original, professionally made animation (such as numerous music videos for songs by [[Iron Maiden]]), or with such short music video films (such as Japanese duo [[Chage and Aska]]'s song \"[[On Your Mark]]\" that was produced by the film company [[Studio Ghibli]]). AMVs should also not be confused with fan-made \"general animation\" videos using non-Japanese animated video sources like [[Western world|western]] cartoons, or with the practice of [[vidding]] in Western [[media fandom]], which [[convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] and has a distinct history and fan culture. Parallels can be drawn between AMVs and [[songvid]]s, animated fan-made videos using footage from movies, television series, or other sources.\n\nThe first anime music video was created in 1982 by 21-year-old Jim Kaposztas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fo20071115pm.html |last=Macias |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Macias |title=Remix this: anime gets hijacked |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> Kaposztas hooked up two [[VCR]]s to each other and edited the most violent scenes from ''[[Star Blazers]]'' to \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" by [[The Beatles]] to produce a humorous effect.<ref>{{cite av media |author=AnimeCons TV |url=https://animecons.tv/extra/17/jim-kaposztas-interview|title=Jim Kaposztas Interview|date=2 October 2011|accessdate=1 June 2018|publisher=AnimeCons TV}}</ref>\n\n==Creation==\nThe creation of an AMV centers on using various [[film editing|video editing]] styles to create a feeling of synchronization and unity. Some examples include: \n* Raw Editing: Using basic zooming in and out \"effects\" along with simple transitions. \n* FX (Effects) Editing: This style consists of large amounts of visual effects. This can be accomplished in programs such as Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects.\n* Timing Editing: The editor edits the clips such that the anime footage is in sync with the lyrics or beats (from the song) to create a perfect harmony. (E.g. Matching beats to gunshot scenes or making an anime character's lips move to make it seem like the character is saying or singing those words in the AMV)\n* Flow Editing: This requires the editor to use transitions and to keep the AMV flowing rather than to have it consist of rough cuts and choppy parts.\n* Animation Editing: Although it sounds similar to the term AMV editing, it is a new style where editors take a still image and animate it (making it move) (This also applies to Manga Music Videos (MMVs) which are similar to AMVs, instead they use manga as the main source of footage).\n* Masking: This style requires the editor to remove the background from the anime scene they would like to add effects to. It is a painstaking and time-consuming process.\n\n==Popularity==\n[[John Oppliger]] of [[AnimeNation]] has noted that fan-produced AMVs are popular mostly with Western fans but not with Japanese fans. One reason he cited was that Western fans experience a \"more purely\" visual experience inasmuch as most Western fans cannot understand the Japanese language, the original language of most [[anime]], and as a result \"the visuals make a greater impact\" on the senses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/09/08/ask-john-why-are-anime-music-videos-so-popular/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |authorlink=John Oppliger |title=Ask John: Why Are Anime Music Videos so Popular? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=2003-09-08 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430072040/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/09/08/ask-john-why-are-anime-music-videos-so-popular/ |archivedate=2009-04-30 }}</ref> The second reason he cited was that Westerners are \"encouraged by social pressure to grow out of cartoons and comics during the onset of adolescence\" whereas Japanese natives grow up with animation \"as a constant companion\";  as a result, English-speaking fans tend to utilize and reconstruct existing anime to create AMVs whereas Japanese fans \"are more intuitively inclined\" to create or expand on existing manga and anime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/06/23/ask-john-why-hasnt-doujinshi-caught-on-outside-of-japan/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |authorlink=John Oppliger |title=Ask John: Why Hasn\u2019t Doujinshi Caught on Outside of Japan? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=2005-06-23 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111225513/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/06/23/ask-john-why-hasnt-doujinshi-caught-on-outside-of-japan/ |archivedate=2012-01-11 }}</ref>\n\n== Legal issues ==\nThe Japanese culture is generally permissive with regard to the appropriation of ideas. Works such as [[d\u014djinshi]], unauthorized comics continuing the story of an official comic series, are actually encouraged by many anime makers.<ref name=\"lessig1\">{{cite book |last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |title=Free Culture |publisher=Authorama.com |date=March 25, 2004 |url=http://www.authorama.com/book/free-culture.html |accessdate=2009-09-08 |chapter=Chapter One: Creators |chapterurl=http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-4.html |quote=This is the phenomenon of d\u014djinshi. D\u014djinshi are also comics, but they are a kind of copycat comic. The creation of d\u014djinshi is governed by a creators' ethic stating that a work is not d\u014djinshi if it is just a copy; the artist must make a contribution to the art he copies by transforming it either subtly or significantly... These copycat comics exhibit significant market penetration as well. More than 33,000 \"circles\" of creators from across Japan produce d\u014djinshi. More than 450,000 Japanese come together twice a year, in the largest public gathering in the country, to exchange and sell them. This market exists in parallel to the mainstream commercial manga market. In some ways, it obviously competes with that market, but there is no sustained effort by those who control the commercial manga market to shut the d\u014djinshi market down. It flourishes, despite the competition and despite the law.\"}}</ref> These d\u014djinshi take an original copyrighted work and expand upon the story, allowing the characters to continue on after, before, or during the original story. Most anime producers encourage this practice, as it expands their series. Some see it as a tribute while others see it from a business viewpoint that it draws in more support for the anime than it would have had otherwise. Some [[Mangaka|manga artists]] create their own d\u014djinshi, such as Maki Murakami's \"circle\" Crocodile Ave (''[[Gravitation (manga)|Gravitation]]'').\n\nIn an interview with site AnimeNewsNetwork, [[Funimation|FUNimation]] Entertainment copyright specialist Evan Flournay said they generally see AMVs as a sort of free advertising. \"The basic thinking going into fan videos is thus: if it whets the audience's appetite, we'll leave it alone. But if it sates the audience's appetite, it needs to come down,\" he says.<ref name=\"funimation-copyright-amvs\">[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/chicks-on-anime/2009-05-05 \"Chicks On Anime: Copyright Enforcement Interview\"].

Public discussions and perspectives give varying accounts of exactly how widespread these actions have become. Most notably in November 2005, the administrator of AnimeMusicVideos.org (Phade) was contacted by [[Wind-up Records]], requesting the removal of content featuring the work of the bands [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Evanescence]], and [[Seether]].<ref name=\"amvorg-takedown\">[http://www.animemusicvideos.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=60255 \"Evanescence, Seether and Creed videos no longer available\"].
