Although he would always retain a certain affection for Catholic culture, he ultimately became an [[atheist]].<ref>[[Maurice Isserman]], ''The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2000), pp. 1-104.</ref>\n\nIn 1978, the periodical ''[[Christian Century]]'' quoted him: \"I am a pious apostate, an atheist shocked by the faithlessness of the believers, a fellow traveler of moderate Catholicism who has been out of the church for 20 years.\" Harrington observed of himself and his high school classmate, Tom Dooley, that \"each of us was motivated, in part at least, by the Jesuit inspiration of our adolescence that insisted so strenuously that a man must live his philosophy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/100/notes-jesuit-education |title=Notes on Jesuit Education |publisher=America Magazine |date= October 26, 1985|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn \"The Politics at God's Funeral\",<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/book-reviews/politics-gods-funeral-spiritual-crisis-western-civilization |title=THE POLITICS AT GOD'S FUNERAL: The Spiritual Crisis of Western Civilization &#124; Wilson Quarterly |website=Archive.wilsonquarterly.com |date= |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> Harrington expressed his belief that religion was passing into oblivion, but he worried that the passing of the legitimizing religious authority made Western societies lose a moral basis to inspire virtue or define common values.

After leaving ''The Catholic Worker'', Harrington became a member of the [[Workers Party (United States)|Independent Socialist League]] (ISL), a small organization associated with the former [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] activist [[Max Shachtman]]. Harrington and Shachtman believed that socialism, which in their opinion implied a just and fully democratic society, could not be realized by authoritarian communism, and they were both fiercely critical of the \"[[bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic collectivist]]\" states in [[Eastern Europe]] and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-accidental-century-by-michael-harrington/ |title=The Accidental Century, by Michael Harrington |publisher=Commentary Magazine |date= January 1966|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Harrington was placed on the [[FBI Index]], whose master list contained more than 10 million names in 1939.

After losing at the convention, Harrington resigned and, with his former caucus, he formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]]. (A smaller faction, associated with peace activist [[David McReynolds]], formed the [[Socialist Party USA]]).\n\nHarrington stated that socialists would need to go through the Democratic Party to enact their policies reasoning that the socialist vote had declined from a peak of approximately one million in the years around World War I to a few thousand by the 1950s. He considered running for the Democratic presidential nomination in [[1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1980]] against President [[Jimmy Carter]], but decided against it after Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] announced his campaign.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Lee |url=http://www.salon.com/2015/05/08/the_socialist_revolt_that_america_forgot_a_history_lesson_for_bernie_sanders/ |title=The socialist revolt that America forgot: A history lesson for Bernie Sanders |website=Salon.com |date=May 8, 2015 |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> He later endorsed Kennedy and stated that \"if Kennedy loses or is driven out of this campaign, it will be a loss for the left\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cohen |first=Marty |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CEw9ROwagN0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=ted+kennedy+1980+endorsements#v=onepage&q=ted%20kennedy%201980%20endorsements&f=falsee |title=The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform |date=May 15, 2009 |isbn=9780226112381 |page=197 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/45535434/the_couriernews/ |title=Socialists and the 1980 election |date=February 8, 1980 |work=The Courier-News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200224162532/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/45535434/the_couriernews/ |archive-date=February 24, 2020 |page=7 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=February 24, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee merged with the [[New American Movement]], an organization of New Left activists, forming the [[Democratic Socialists of America]].

The headline accusation was that the pair were using the event as a 'cash grab' and questioned the 'legitimacy' of the match as a professional bout, and many questioned the choice of putting professional world-title bouts on the undercard beneath two YouTubers. Others within the sport, however, were more receptive to the fight and embraced the event. The executive director of the California State Athletic Commission (the fight's sanctioning body), Andy Foster, defended the accusation that the YouTubers weren't fit to fight professionally, saying in an interview that \"If they weren\u2019t YouTube stars, this fight is still approvable in every commission in this country as debut athletes\". Kevin Draper of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted KSI, Paul and the organisers' intention to bring a new audience to a 'stagnant' sport and highlights the fact both YouTubers sought coaching from world-champion boxers and trainers.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Professional boxers [[Anthony Joshua]], [[Deontay Wilder]], [[Tyson Fury]], [[Dillian Whyte]] and [[Andy Ruiz Jr.]] also expressed support for the event and the fact it was being held as a professional bout, highlighting the benefit it could bring to boxing in terms of expanding the sport's audience.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://talksport.com/sport/boxing/626813/ksi-vs-logan-paul-2-anthony-joshua-deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-andy-ruiz-jr-dillian-whyte/ |title=OPINIONS KSI vs Logan Paul 2: What Anthony Joshua, Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury, Andy Ruiz Jr and Dillian Whyte have said about YouTuber fight |last=Benson |first=Michael |website=talksport.com |publisher=TalkSport |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108214840/https://talksport.com/sport/boxing/626813/ksi-vs-logan-paul-2-anthony-joshua-deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-andy-ruiz-jr-dillian-whyte/ |archive-date=8 November 2019 |access-date=10 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter six three minute rounds, KSI was the winner via [[split decision]], with two judges scoring the fight 57\u201354 and 56\u201355 for KSI, while the third judge scored it 56\u201355 in favour of Paul.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.sky.com/story/ksi-vs-logan-paul-2-british-youtuber-wins-boxing-fight-against-social-media-rival-11858631 |title=KSI vs Logan Paul 2: British YouTuber wins boxing fight against social media rival |date=10 November 2019 |work=skysports.com |access-date=10 November 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110061930/https://news.sky.com/story/ksi-vs-logan-paul-2-british-youtuber-wins-boxing-fight-against-social-media-rival-11858631 |archive-date=10 November 2019 |publisher=Sky Sports |agency=Sky}}</ref> Paul and KSI shook hands and shared an embrace after the fight, with both paying respect to one another, though Paul stated his intention to contest the commission for his point deduction for his illegal punches, stating that he does not dispute what happened but thought he deserved only a warning.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.boxingscene.com/briggs-furious-with-referee-taking-two-points-from-logan-paul--144171 |title=Briggs Furious With Referee Taking Two Points From Logan Paul |website=boxingscene.com |publisher=Boxing Scene |access-date=10 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/logan-paul-contest-commission-loss-ksi-rematch-11073074/ |title=Logan Paul to contest Commission after loss to KSI in rematch |date=10 November 2019 |website=Metro |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110092945/https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/logan-paul-contest-commission-loss-ksi-rematch-11073074/ |archive-date=10 November 2019 |access-date=10 November 2019}}</ref> When asked about a possible rematch, Paul expressed his support for the idea, but KSI rejected any prospect of a third fight against Paul, saying \"It's done ...

Nauru has established diplomatic relations with a number of nations, including most of its Pacific neighbors with which it maintains economic, cultural and administrative ties with its regionally.\n\n==Membership in international organizations==\n\nNauru was admitted to the [[United Nations]] on 14 September 1999. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1249|Nauru's application to the United Nations]] was questioned by the People\u2019s Republic of China due to Nauru's close diplomatic and trade links to Taiwan. Nevertheless, Nauru was granted UN full membership.\n\nNauru became a full member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in May 1999. Since independence, Nauru had been a [[Special membership of the Commonwealth of Nations|special member]] of the Commonwealth prior to 1999, but having fallen behind in payments, reverted to Special Member Status on 1 July 2005, with no authoritative power. It then returned to be a full member again on June 2011.<ref name=\"RNZI_61413\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=61413 |title=Nauru back as full Commonwealth member |date=26 June 2011 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally outside the region, Nauru is a member or participant of the [[ACP (Lom\u00e9 Convention)]],  the [[Alliance of Small Island States]], the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[Group of 77|G-77]],  the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]],  the [[International Olympic Committee]], and the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]\n\nNauru is notable for its lack of membership in several major international organizations. For example, Nauru is one of only three UN-recognized nations with a sea border that is not a member of the [[International Maritime Organization]] (the others are the Federated States of Micronesia and Niue).  Similarly, Nauru is one of only seven UN members that is not a member of the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] and one of 12 not part of the [[International Finance Corporation]]. Nauru also is not a member of the [[International Development Association]] and has no society associated with the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]. Finally, as with many other nations in Oceania, Nauru is not a member of the  [[International Hydrographic Organization]].\n\n==Membership in regional organizations==\n\nRegional cooperation through various multilateral organizations is a key element in Nauru's foreign policy. The country also hosted the regional meeting that resulted in the [[Nauru Agreement|Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation In The Management Of Fisheries Of Common Interest]] whose eight signatories (including Nauru) collectively controls 25-30% of the world's tuna supply and approximately 60% of the western and central Pacific tuna supply.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://klima-tuvalu.no/2011/04/13/pacific-islands-fighting-for-their-tuna/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819123129/http://klima-tuvalu.no/2011/04/13/pacific-islands-fighting-for-their-tuna/ |archive-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Additionally, Nauru is a full member of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]],  the [[Pacific Regional Environment Programme]] and the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]].\n\n==Hosting refugees==\n\nIn 2001 Nauru became host to approximately 867 [[refugee]]s, mostly [[Afghan refugees|Afghan]], who were intercepted while attempting to enter [[Australia]] illegally.

Nauru has established diplomatic relations with a number of nations, including most of its Pacific neighbors with which it maintains economic, cultural and administrative ties with its regionally.\n\n==Membership in international organizations==\n\nNauru was admitted to the [[United Nations]] on 14 September 1999. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1249|Nauru's application to the United Nations]] was questioned by the People\u2019s Republic of China due to Nauru's close diplomatic and trade links to Taiwan. Nevertheless, Nauru was granted UN full membership.\n\nNauru became a full member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in May 1999. Since independence, Nauru had been a [[Special membership of the Commonwealth of Nations|special member]] of the Commonwealth prior to 1999, but having fallen behind in payments, reverted to Special Member Status on 1 July 2005, with no authoritative power. It then returned to be a full member again on June 2011.<ref name=\"RNZI_61413\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=61413 |title=Nauru back as full Commonwealth member |date=26 June 2011 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally outside the region, Nauru is a member or participant of the [[ACP (Lom\u00e9 Convention)]],  the [[Alliance of Small Island States]], the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[Group of 77|G-77]],  the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]],  the [[International Olympic Committee]], and the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]\n\nNauru is notable for its lack of membership in several major international organizations. For example, Nauru is one of only three UN-recognized nations with a sea border that is not a member of the [[International Maritime Organization]] (the others are the Federated States of Micronesia and Niue).  Similarly, Nauru is one of only seven UN members that is not a member of the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] and one of 12 not part of the [[International Finance Corporation]]. Nauru also is not a member of the [[International Development Association]] and has no society associated with the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]. Finally, as with many other nations in Oceania, Nauru is not a member of the  [[International Hydrographic Organization]].\n\n==Membership in regional organizations==\n\nRegional cooperation through various multilateral organizations is a key element in Nauru's foreign policy. The country also hosted the regional meeting that resulted in the [[Nauru Agreement|Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation In The Management Of Fisheries Of Common Interest]] whose eight signatories (including Nauru) collectively controls 25-30% of the world's tuna supply and approximately 60% of the western and central Pacific tuna supply.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://klima-tuvalu.no/2011/04/13/pacific-islands-fighting-for-their-tuna/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819123129/http://klima-tuvalu.no/2011/04/13/pacific-islands-fighting-for-their-tuna/ |archive-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Additionally, Nauru is a full member of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]],  the [[Pacific Regional Environment Programme]] and the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]].\n\n==Hosting refugees==\n\nIn 2001 Nauru became host to approximately 867 [[refugee]]s, mostly [[Afghan refugees|Afghan]], who were intercepted while attempting to enter [[Australia]] illegally.

At first, he acted as the leader of the Royal Flush Gang, though he abandoned them soon after. In their place, he created the short-lived Luck League, a group who could mimick the powers of the JLA. Still later, Fortune battled [[Justice League Europe]], but was again defeated when his luck ran out.\n\n===Villains United===\nWhen [[Parademon]] blew up the [[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]] in ''[[Villains United]]'' #6 (2005), Fortune suffered injuries that left him blind in one eye and half his face disfigured. Fortune covered up his disfigured face with a mask. His attempt to escape Enclave M in ''Villains United Infinite Crisis Special'', was foiled by the Secret Six. Interrogated while dangling out of a helicopter, by [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]], he revealed the fact that the Secret Society was planning an all-out assault on Metropolis.

[[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] helped [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]] against this plot, given they had faced him before many years ago while on a training mission as then-new recruits of the JLA, alongside [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Aquaman]], [[Vibe (comics)|Vibe]], and [[Commander Steel|Steel]] (Vibe and Steel were also new recruits at the time), as they fought both the previous and then-new incarnations of the [[Royal Flush Gang]], as seen in flashback in ''JLA Classified'' #22-25.\n\nAmos's origin was revised and revisited in ''Justice League'' #35-37; it stated that he became obsessed with playing cards and luck upon the death of his father, a gambler who was murdered by the mob after he failed to pay a debt. Growing up in poverty and tormented over his weight, Amos developed a ruthless streak as he used his knowledge of games of chance to fleece his classmates of their money. The original Royal Flush Gang were retconned as his enforcers, then gang members as they began robbing local stores. The group eventually were brought into the service of a local mafia don, who further trained them in crime. When the don found out about Amos's skill at cards, he charged Amos with the task of shaking down a private poker party being held for a group of wealthy gamblers. Amos's skill allowed him to beat the wealthy card players, but after winning a rather large pot with a royal flush, the wealthy gamblers decided to kill Amos rather than let him collect his winnings. However, Amos and his gang (who had come with him) fought back and killed the wealthy gamblers, taking their money for themselves, to finance the creation of the Royal Flush gang.\n\nThe new origin claimed that Amos was the original \"Ace\" of the Royal Flush Gang, and that after several battles, where the group barely escaped from the Justice League, Amos and the group decided to \"expand\" the Royal Flush gang; franchising the villain group (which in turn explains away the many different variations of the group) with Amos Fortune becoming a kingpin figure over his crime empire.\n\nUsing his many incarnations of the Royal Flush Gang, Amos and [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette]] become involved in a twisted game where Roulette bets that Amos's Royal Flush Gang syndicate can't beat the Justice League, which had recently seen its ranks decimated following the events of Final Crisis.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #35 (July 2009)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #36 (August 2009)</ref> The League defeats Fortune's gang, but he and Roulette manage to escape.

Fortune was also a formidable hand-to-hand fighter, having learned to defend himself at an early age. He was also a genius-level inventor and armorer, having discovered the existence of \"Luck Glands\" and how to exploit them to one's advantage after acquiring odds-altering technology (that he had his subordinates steal from a high-tech casino in Las Vegas) to manufacture equippable \"Stimoluck\" devices that can tilt a person's chances of good luck probability.\n\n==In other media==\n* Amos Fortune's Resort and Casino is seen in the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]-set ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode \"Wild Cards\".
