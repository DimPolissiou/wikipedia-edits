He spent over 48 years in baseball, culminating with 14 years as president of the [[American League]] (AL).\n\nDuring his 20-year playing career (1926\u20131945), Cronin played for three teams, primarily the [[Boston Red Sox]]; he was a [[Player-coach|player-manager]] for 13 seasons (1933\u20131945), and served as manager for two additional seasons (1946\u20131947). A seven-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Cronin became the first AL player to become an All-Star with two teams; he was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1956 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1956]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:1937 all stars crop FINAL2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Seven of the American League's 1937 All-Star players, from left to right [[Lou Gehrig]], Joe Cronin, [[Bill Dickey]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], [[Jimmie Foxx]], and [[Hank Greenberg]].

The [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] had cost his Irish Catholic parents almost all of their possessions.<ref name=Corcoran>{{cite book|last=Corcoran|first=Dennis|title=Induction Day at Cooperstown: A History of the Baseball Hall of Fame Ceremony|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786444169|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dF2PsAeDeYC&pg=PA68&dq=joe+cronin+death&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZuFxUsatC-visAT454CYBA&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Armour|first1=Mark|title=Joe Cronin|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/572b61e8|website=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref> Cronin attended Sacred Heart High School. He played several sports as a child and he won a city tennis championship for his age group when he was 14. As he was not greatly interested in school, Cronin's grades improved only when the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] began giving away tickets to students with good conduct and attendance. At the time, the nearest MLB team was nearly 2,000 miles from San Francisco.<ref>Armour, pp. 9-10.</ref>\n\n==Major league career==\n\n===As a player===\nBaseball promoter [[Joe Engel]], who scouted for the Senators and managed the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]] at [[Engel Stadium]], originally signed Cronin. Engel first spotted Cronin playing in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. \"I knew I was watching a great player\", Engel said. \"I bought Cronin at a time he was hitting .221. When I told [[Clark Griffith]] what I had done, he screamed, 'You paid $7,500 for that bum? Well, you didn't buy him for me. You bought him for yourself. He's not my ballplayer \u2013 he's yours.

Cronin won both the AL Writers' MVP (the forerunner of the BBWAA MVP, established in 1931) and the [[The Sporting News Most Valuable Player Award|AL Sporting News MVP]]. His 1931 season was also outstanding, with him posting a .306 [[batting average (baseball)|average]], 12 home runs, and 126 RBIs. Cronin led the Senators to the [[1933 World Series]] and later married Griffith's niece, Mildred Robertson.\n\n===As a player-manager and manager===\nCronin was named player-manager of the Senators in {{mlby|1933}}, a post he would hold for two years. In his first year, he led the Senators to what would be their last pennant in Washington. \n\nWhile Cronin was on his honeymoon with Mildred in his hometown of San Francisco, he got a message from Griffith\u2013the [[Boston Red Sox]] had offered the Senators their starting shortstop, [[Lyn Lary]], in return for Cronin and $250,000. Red Sox owner [[Tom Yawkey]] also offered Cronin a five-year contract as player-manager. Well aware of the Senators' perennial financial problems (Griffith had no income apart from the Senators), Cronin accepted the trade.<ref name=SABR>{{cite web|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/572b61e8|title=Joe Cronin|author1=Mark Armour|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|date=2015}}</ref> Cronin remained as player-manager of the Red Sox until {{mlby|1945}}, then remained solely as manager until {{mlby|1947}}.\n\nAs early as {{mlby|1938}}, it was apparent that Cronin was nearing the end of his playing career. Red Sox farm director [[Billy Evans]] thought he had found Cronin's successor in [[Pee Wee Reese]], the star shortstop for the [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)|Louisville Colonels]] of the Triple-A [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. He was so impressed by Reese that he was able to talk Yawkey into buying the Colonels and making them the Red Sox' top farm club. However, when Yawkey and Evans asked Cronin to scout Reese, Cronin realized he was scouting his replacement. Believing that he was still had enough left to be a regular player, Cronin deliberately downplayed Reese's talent and suggested that the Red Sox trade him. Reese was eventually traded to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], where he went on to a Hall of Fame career.<ref name=Neyer>{{cite book |last=Neyer |first=Rob |authorlink=Rob Neyer |coauthors= |title=Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Blunders |year=2006 |publisher=Fireside |location=New York City |isbn=0-7432-8491-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/robneyersbigbook0000neye }}</ref> As it turned out, Evans' and Yawkey's initial concerns about Cronin were valid. His last year as a full-time player was {{mlby|1941}}; after that year, he never played more than 76 games per season. \n\nEven when [[World War II]] saw dozens of young players either enlist or be drafted, Cronin limited his playing appearances to cameo roles as a utility infielder and pinch-hitter.<ref name=SABR/>  On June 17, 1943, Cronin sent himself into pinch hit in both games of a doubleheader and hit a home run each time. \n\nIn April 1945, he broke his leg in a game against the Yankees. He sat out the remainder of the season, and retired as a player for good at the end of the year.<ref name=SABR/>\n\nOver his career, Cronin batted .300 or higher eight times, as well as driving in 100 runs or more eight times. He finished with a .301 average, 170 home runs, and 1,424 RBIs.\n\nAs a manager, he compiled a 1,236\u20131,055 record and won two [[American League]] pennants (in 1933 and 1946). His 1933 Senators dropped the [[1933 World Series]] to the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], and his 1946 Red Sox lost the [[1946 World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\n===As a general manager===\nAt the end of the 1947 season, Cronin succeeded [[Eddie Collins]] as [[general manager]] of the Red Sox and held the post for over 11 years, through mid-January {{mlby|1959}}. The Red Sox challenged for the AL pennant in {{mlby|1948}}\u2013[[1949 in baseball|49]] (finishing second by a single game both seasons) thanks to Cronin's aggressive trades. In his first off-season, he acquired shortstop [[Vern Stephens]] and [[pitcher]]s [[Ellis Kinder]] and [[Jack Kramer (baseball)|Jack Kramer]] from the [[St. Louis Browns]]; all played major roles in Boston's [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|1948 season]], when the Red Sox finished in a flatfooted tie for the pennant but lost a [[1948 American League tie-breaker game|one-game tie-breaker]]. Kinder and Stephens were centerpieces of the Red Sox' 1949\u201350 contenders as well. In the former year, they were edged out by the Yankees during the regular season's final weekend; in the latter, they finished third but came within three games of the league-leading Yanks.\n\nAs it turned out, {{mlby|1950}} was the last hurrah for the Red Sox during Cronin's tenure as general manager. With the exception of [[Ted Williams]] (who missed most of the 1952\u201353 seasons while serving in the [[Korean War]]), the core of the 1946\u201350 team aged quickly and the Red Sox faced a significant rebuilding job starting in {{mlby|1952}}. Cronin's acquisition of future [[American League Most Valuable Player]] [[Jackie Jensen]] from Washington in {{mlby|1954}} represented a coup, but the club misfired on several [[bonus baby|\"bonus babies\"]] who never lived up to their potential. The Red Sox posted winning season records for all but two of Cronin's 11 seasons as general manager, but from 1951\u201358 they lagged behind the AL pennant-winners by an average of 17<small>{{fraction|3|4}}</small> games. Then, beginning in {{mlby|1959}}, they began a skein of eight straight below-.500 and second-division campaigns. They would not be a factor in a pennant race again until the \"Impossible Dream\" season of 1967.\n\nMost attention has been focused on Cronin and Yawkey's refusal to [[Baseball color line|integrate]] the Red Sox roster; by January 1959, when Cronin's tenure as general manager ended, the Red Sox were the only team in the big leagues without an [[African-American]] or [[Afro-Latin Americans|Afro-Latin American]] player.  Notably, Cronin once passed on signing a young [[Willie Mays]] and never traded for an African-American player.<ref name=\"edes\">[http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/36622/george-digby-and-willie-mays-the-one-who-got-away Edes, Gordon, ''George Digby and Willie Mays: The One Who Got Away.'' [[ESPN|ESPN Boston]], May 3, 2014]</ref> The Red Sox did not break the [[baseball color line]] until six months after Cronin's departure for the AL presidency, when they promoted [[Pumpsie Green]], a [[utility (baseball)|utility]] [[infielder]], from their [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate, the [[Minneapolis Millers]], in July 1959.\n\n===As AL president===\nIn January 1959, Cronin was elected president of the American League, the first former player to be so elected and the fourth full-time chief executive in the league's history. When he replaced the retiring [[Will Harridge]], who became board chairman, Cronin moved the league's headquarters from [[Chicago]] to [[Boston]]. Cronin served as AL president until December 31, 1973, when he was succeeded by [[Lee MacPhail]].\n\nDuring Cronin's 15 years in office, the Junior Circuit [[expansion team|expanded]] from eight to 12 teams, adding the [[Los Angeles Angels]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|expansion Washington Senators]] in {{mlby|1961}}<ref>[https://sabr.org/research/mis-management-101-american-league-expansion-1961 McCue, Andy, and Thompson, Eric (2011), \"Mismanagement 101: The American League's Expansion of 1961.\" ''The National Pastime 2011,'' [[Society for American Baseball Research]]]</ref>  and the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]] in {{mlby|1969}}.\n\nIt also endured four franchise shifts: the relocation of the original Senators club (owned by Cronin's brother-in-law and sister-in-law, [[Calvin Griffith]] and [[Thelma Griffith Haynes]]) to [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], creating the [[Minnesota Twins]] (1961); the shift of the [[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]] from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] ({{mlby|1968}}); the transfer of the Pilots after only one season in [[Seattle]] to [[Milwaukee]] as the [[Milwaukee Brewers|Brewers]] ({{mlby|1970}}); and the transplantation of the expansion Senators after 11 seasons in Washington, D.C., to [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]] as the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] ({{mlby|1972}}). The Angels also moved from Los Angeles to adjacent [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in {{mlby|1966}} and adopted a regional identity, in part because of the dominance of the [[National League]] [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]], who were the Angels' landlords at [[Dodger Stadium|\"Chavez Ravine\" (Dodger Stadium)]] from 1962\u201365.  Of the four expansion teams that joined the league beginning in 1961, three abandoned their original host cities within a dozen years (the Pilots after only one season), and only one team\u2014the Royals\u2014remained in its original municipality. Two of the charter members of the old eight-team league, the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Cleveland Indians]], also suffered significant attendance woes and were targets of relocation efforts by other cities.\n\nIn addition, the AL found itself at a competitive disadvantage compared with the National League during Cronin's term.

He spent over 48 years in baseball, culminating with 14 years as president of the [[American League]] (AL).\n\nDuring his 20-year playing career (1926\u20131945), Cronin played for three teams, primarily the [[Boston Red Sox]]; he was a [[Player-coach|player-manager]] for 13 seasons (1933\u20131945), and served as manager for two additional seasons (1946\u20131947). A seven-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Cronin became the first AL player to become an All-Star with two teams; he was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1956 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1956]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:1937 all stars crop FINAL2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Seven of the American League's 1937 All-Star players, from left to right [[Lou Gehrig]], Joe Cronin, [[Bill Dickey]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], [[Jimmie Foxx]], and [[Hank Greenberg]].

The [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] had cost his Irish Catholic parents almost all of their possessions.<ref name=Corcoran>{{cite book|last=Corcoran|first=Dennis|title=Induction Day at Cooperstown: A History of the Baseball Hall of Fame Ceremony|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786444169|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dF2PsAeDeYC&pg=PA68&dq=joe+cronin+death&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZuFxUsatC-visAT454CYBA&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Armour|first1=Mark|title=Joe Cronin|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/572b61e8|website=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref> Cronin attended Sacred Heart High School. He played several sports as a child and he won a city tennis championship for his age group when he was 14. As he was not greatly interested in school, Cronin's grades improved only when the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] began giving away tickets to students with good conduct and attendance. At the time, the nearest MLB team was nearly 2,000 miles from San Francisco.<ref>Armour, pp. 9-10.</ref>\n\n==Major league career==\n\n===As a player===\nBaseball promoter [[Joe Engel]], who scouted for the Senators and managed the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]] at [[Engel Stadium]], originally signed Cronin. Engel first spotted Cronin playing in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. \"I knew I was watching a great player\", Engel said. \"I bought Cronin at a time he was hitting .221. When I told [[Clark Griffith]] what I had done, he screamed, 'You paid $7,500 for that bum? Well, you didn't buy him for me. You bought him for yourself. He's not my ballplayer \u2013 he's yours. You keep him and don't either you or Cronin show up at the ballpark.'\"<ref name=Emerald>{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Charley|title=The Emerald Diamond: How the Irish Transformed America's Favorite Pastime|year=2012|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=0062089919|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SI7M0GwFsWEC&pg=PT239&dq=cronin+griffith+bought+him+for+yourself&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ld9xUuzaEMaisASqkoHIDA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=cronin%20griffith%20bought%20him%20for%20yourself&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn {{Baseball year|1930}}, Cronin had a breakout year, batting .346 with 13 [[home run]]s and 126 [[runs batted in|RBI]]. Cronin won both the AL Writers' MVP (the forerunner of the BBWAA MVP, established in 1931) and the [[The Sporting News Most Valuable Player Award|AL Sporting News MVP]]. His 1931 season was also outstanding, with him posting a .306 [[batting average (baseball)|average]], 12 home runs, and 126 RBIs. Cronin led the Senators to the [[1933 World Series]] and later married Griffith's niece, Mildred Robertson.\n\n===As a player-manager and manager===\nCronin was named player-manager of the Senators in {{Baseball year|1933}}, a post he would hold for two years. In his first year, he led the Senators to what would be their last pennant in Washington. \n\nWhile Cronin was on his honeymoon with Mildred in his hometown of San Francisco, he got a message from Griffith\u2013the [[Boston Red Sox]] had offered the Senators their starting shortstop, [[Lyn Lary]], in return for Cronin and $250,000. Red Sox owner [[Tom Yawkey]] also offered Cronin a five-year contract as player-manager. Well aware of the Senators' perennial financial problems (Griffith had no income apart from the Senators), Cronin accepted the trade.<ref name=SABR>{{cite web|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/572b61e8|title=Joe Cronin|author1=Mark Armour|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|date=2015}}</ref> Cronin remained as player-manager of the Red Sox until {{Baseball year|1945}}, then remained solely as manager until {{Baseball year|1947}}.\n\nAs early as {{baseball year|1938}}, it was apparent that Cronin was nearing the end of his playing career. Red Sox farm director [[Billy Evans]] thought he had found Cronin's successor in [[Pee Wee Reese]], the star shortstop for the [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)|Louisville Colonels]] of the Triple-A [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. He was so impressed by Reese that he was able to talk Yawkey into buying the Colonels and making them the Red Sox' top farm club. However, when Yawkey and Evans asked Cronin to scout Reese, Cronin realized he was scouting his replacement. Believing that he was still had enough left to be a regular player, Cronin deliberately downplayed Reese's talent and suggested that the Red Sox trade him. Reese was eventually traded to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], where he went on to a Hall of Fame career.<ref name=Neyer>{{cite book |last=Neyer |first=Rob |authorlink=Rob Neyer |coauthors= |title=Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Blunders |year=2006 |publisher=Fireside |location=New York City |isbn=0-7432-8491-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/robneyersbigbook0000neye }}</ref> As it turned out, Evans' and Yawkey's initial concerns about Cronin were valid. His last year as a full-time player was {{baseball year|1941}}; after that year, he never played more than 76 games per season. \n\nEven when [[World War II]] saw dozens of young players either enlist or be drafted, Cronin limited his playing appearances to cameo roles as a utility infielder and pinch-hitter.<ref name=SABR/>  On June 17, 1943, Cronin sent himself into pinch hit in both games of a doubleheader and hit a home run each time. \n\nIn April 1945, he broke his leg in a game against the Yankees. He sat out the remainder of the season, and retired as a player for good at the end of the year.<ref name=SABR/>\n\nOver his career, Cronin batted .300 or higher eight times, as well as driving in 100 runs or more eight times. He finished with a .301 average, 170 home runs, and 1,424 RBIs.\n\nAs a manager, he compiled a 1,236\u20131,055 record and won two [[American League]] pennants (in 1933 and 1946). His 1933 Senators dropped the [[1933 World Series]] to the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], and his 1946 Red Sox lost the [[1946 World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\n===As a general manager===\nAt the end of the 1947 season, Cronin succeeded [[Eddie Collins]] as [[general manager]] of the Red Sox and held the post for over 11 years, through mid-January {{Baseball year|1959}}. The Red Sox challenged for the AL pennant in {{Baseball year|1948}}\u2013[[1949 in baseball|49]] (finishing second by a single game both seasons) thanks to Cronin's aggressive trades. In his first off-season, he acquired shortstop [[Vern Stephens]] and [[pitcher]]s [[Ellis Kinder]] and [[Jack Kramer (baseball)|Jack Kramer]] from the [[St. Louis Browns]]; all played major roles in Boston's [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|1948 season]], when the Red Sox finished in a flatfooted tie for the pennant but lost a [[1948 American League tie-breaker game|one-game tie-breaker]]. Kinder and Stephens were centerpieces of the Red Sox' 1949\u201350 contenders as well. In the former year, they were edged out by the Yankees during the regular season's final weekend; in the latter, they finished third but came within three games of the league-leading Yanks.\n\nAs it turned out, {{baseball year|1950}} was the last hurrah for the Red Sox during Cronin's tenure as general manager. With the exception of [[Ted Williams]] (who missed most of the 1952\u201353 seasons while serving in the [[Korean War]]), the core of the 1946\u201350 team aged quickly and the Red Sox faced a significant rebuilding job starting in {{baseball year|1952}}. Cronin's acquisition of future [[American League Most Valuable Player]] [[Jackie Jensen]] from Washington in {{baseball year|1954}} represented a coup, but the club misfired on several [[bonus baby|\"bonus babies\"]] who never lived up to their potential. The Red Sox posted winning season records for all but two of Cronin's 11 seasons as general manager, but from 1951\u201358 they lagged behind the AL pennant-winners by an average of 17<small>{{fraction|3|4}}</small> games. Then, beginning in {{mlby|1959}}, they began a skein of eight straight below-.500 and second-division campaigns. They would not be a factor in a pennant race again until the \"Impossible Dream\" season of 1967.\n\nMost attention has been focused on Cronin and Yawkey's refusal to [[Baseball color line|integrate]] the Red Sox roster; by January 1959, when Cronin's tenure as general manager ended, the Red Sox were the only team in the big leagues without an [[African-American]] or [[Afro-Latin Americans|Afro-Latin American]] player.  Notably, Cronin once passed on signing a young [[Willie Mays]] and never traded for an African-American player.<ref name=\"edes\">[http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/36622/george-digby-and-willie-mays-the-one-who-got-away Edes, Gordon, ''George Digby and Willie Mays: The One Who Got Away.'' [[ESPN|ESPN Boston]], May 3, 2014]</ref> The Red Sox did not break the [[baseball color line]] until six months after Cronin's departure for the AL presidency, when they promoted [[Pumpsie Green]], a [[utility (baseball)|utility]] [[infielder]], from their [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate, the [[Minneapolis Millers]], in July 1959.\n\n===As AL president===\nIn January 1959, Cronin was elected president of the American League, the first former player to be so elected and the fourth full-time chief executive in the league's history. When he replaced the retiring [[Will Harridge]], who became board chairman, Cronin moved the league's headquarters from [[Chicago]] to [[Boston]]. Cronin served as AL president until December 31, 1973, when he was succeeded by [[Lee MacPhail]].\n\nDuring Cronin's 15 years in office, the Junior Circuit [[expansion team|expanded]] from eight to 12 teams, adding the [[Los Angeles Angels]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|expansion Washington Senators]] in {{baseball year|1961}}<ref>[https://sabr.org/research/mis-management-101-american-league-expansion-1961 McCue, Andy, and Thompson, Eric (2011), \"Mismanagement 101: The American League's Expansion of 1961.\" ''The National Pastime 2011,'' [[Society for American Baseball Research]]]</ref>  and the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]] in {{baseball year|1969}}.\n\nIt also endured four franchise shifts: the relocation of the original Senators club (owned by Cronin's brother-in-law and sister-in-law, [[Calvin Griffith]] and [[Thelma Griffith Haynes]]) to [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], creating the [[Minnesota Twins]] (1961); the shift of the [[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]] from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] ({{baseball year|1968}}); the transfer of the Pilots after only one season in [[Seattle]] to [[Milwaukee]] as the [[Milwaukee Brewers|Brewers]] ({{baseball year|1970}}); and the transplantation of the expansion Senators after 11 seasons in Washington, D.C., to [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]] as the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] ({{baseball year|1972}}). The Angels also moved from Los Angeles to adjacent [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in {{baseball year|1966}} and adopted a regional identity, in part because of the dominance of the [[National League]] [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]], who were the Angels' landlords at [[Dodger Stadium|\"Chavez Ravine\" (Dodger Stadium)]] from 1962\u201365.  Of the four expansion teams that joined the league beginning in 1961, three abandoned their original host cities within a dozen years (the Pilots after only one season), and only one team\u2014the Royals\u2014remained in its original municipality. Two of the charter members of the old eight-team league, the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Cleveland Indians]], also suffered significant attendance woes and were targets of relocation efforts by other cities.\n\nIn addition, the AL found itself at a competitive disadvantage compared with the National League during Cronin's term. With strong teams in larger markets and a host of new stadiums, the NL outdrew the AL for 33 consecutive years (1956\u201388).<ref name=\"joeblows\">{{cite book|last1=Studenmund|first1=Dave|last2=Tamer|first2=Greg|title=The Hardball Times 2004 Baseball Annual|year=2004|publisher=The Hardball Times|isbn=|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ry_K7X-iKIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In 1973, Cronin's final season as league president, the NL attracted 55 percent of total MLB attendance, 16.62 million vs. 13.38 million total fans, despite the opening of [[Royals Stadium]] in Kansas City and the American League's adoption of the [[designated hitter]] rule, which was designed to spark scoring and fan interest. While the National League held only an 8\u20137 edge in [[World Series]] play during the Cronin era, it dominated the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], going 15\u20133\u20131 in the 19 games played from 1959\u201373.\n\nAfter the {{by|1968}} season, Cronin drew headlines when he fired AL [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]] [[Al Salerno]] and [[Bill Valentine]], ostensibly for poor performance; however, it later surfaced that the two officials were fired for attempting to organize an umpires' [[trade union|union]].

He made his major league debut on June 25, 1983.\nIn his 13 seasons in the majors, he hit for a .246 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] with 46 [[home run]]s and 439 [[run batted in|RBI]]s in 1544 [[games played|games]].\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Player ===\n\nA [[switch-hitter]], he attended [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]] and was the All-Tournament Team shortstop in the [[1982 College World Series]].

His first hit came off [[Jim Gott]]. On July 13, 1983, he hit his first big league [[home run]] against [[Boston Red Sox]] pitcher [[Doug Bird]] at [[Fenway Park]].\n\nIn [[1986 in sports|1986]], he was named team captain of the Mariners.<ref>{{cite web|last=Street|first=Jim|title=Mailbag: What's lowdown on Lowe?|url=http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070604&content_id=2005778&vkey=news_sea&fext=.jsp&c_id=sea|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=August 29, 2010|date=June 4, 2007|archive-date=June 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617062130/http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070604&content_id=2005778&vkey=news_sea&fext=.jsp&c_id=sea}}</ref> On August 19, Owen and center fielder [[Dave Henderson]] were traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for [[Rey Qui\u00f1ones]], [[Mike Trujillo]], [[Mike Brown (pitcher)|Mike Brown]] and a player to be named later.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-18/sports/sp-18144_1_pennant-race|title=Red Sox Get Spike Owen From Mariners|date=August 18, 1986|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> In his third game with the Red Sox, he tied a major league record with six [[run (baseball)|runs]] scored in a game.

In the [[1986 World Series]], he hit .300 in a Boston loss to the [[New York Mets]] 4 games to 3 after having the Mets down to their last strike twice in extra innings of Game 6.\n\nOn December 8, 1988, the [[Red Sox]] traded him to the [[Montreal Expos]] for pitcher [[John Dopson]] and shortstop [[Luis Rivera (infielder)|Lu\u00eds Rivera]].\n\nIn [[1990 in sports|1990]], he set a [[National League]] record with 63 consecutive [[error (baseball)|errorless]] games at shortstop. Despite hitting only .234, he showed some decent power with 24 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 5 [[triple (baseball)|triples]] and 5 home runs among his 106 [[hit (baseball)|hits]]. Patience at the plate was the secret of his success with 70 [[base on balls|walks]] (12 intentional), for a respectable .333 [[on-base percentage]]. Walks are important for an eighth-place hitter in the NL because there is no [[designated hitter]], the usually weak-hitting [[pitcher]] bats ninth, and the top of the order starts the next inning if the pitcher makes the last out. Also, if the pitcher bats with less than two outs, he can make a productive out by bunting the runner(s) over.\n\nOwen's most productive season was [[1992 in sports|1992]], with career highs in average (.269), home runs (7), [[stolen base]]s (7) and [[slugging percentage]] (.381). In addition, he had a healthy .348 [[on-base percentage]] and hit well in the clutch at .319 in 91 [[at bat|at-bats]] with runners in scoring position. He also led the NL in [[fielding percentage]] twice. A hard-nosed competitor, he quickly established himself as a leader in the Montreal clubhouse and helped rookie [[Delino DeShields]] transition to [[second base]].\n\nAfter the 1992 season, Owen was supplanted as Montreal shortstop by the emergence of [[Wil Cordero]] and became a free agent. On December 4, 1992, he signed a three-year contract with the [[New York Yankees]], aspiring to anchor their infield and provide team leadership. However, in 1993, he led a horde of AL middle infielders in one category\u2014salary.
