Carnacki was the protagonist of a series of six short stories published between 1910 and 1912 in ''[[The Idler (1892\u20131911)|The Idler]]'' magazine and ''The New Magazine''. \n\nThese stories were printed together as ''[[Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder]]'' in 1913. A 1948 [[Arkham House]] edition of ''Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder'' edited by [[August Derleth]] added three stories: \"[[Carnacki#\"The Haunted Jarvee\"|The Haunted ''Jarvee'']]\", published posthumously in ''The Premier Magazine'' in 1929; \"[[Carnacki#\"The Hog\"|The Hog]]\", published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in 1947; and \"[[Carnacki#\"The Find\"|The Find]]\", a previously unpublished story.\n\n== Notes on the series ==\nThe stories are inspired by the tradition of fictional detectives such as [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Carnacki lives in a bachelor flat in No 472 [[Cheyne Walk]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]; the stories are told from a first-person perspective by Dodgson, a member of Carnacki's \"strictly limited circle of friends\", much as Holmes' adventures were told from Watson's point of view (his other friends are Jessop, Arkwright and Taylor). Whereas the Holmes stories never made use of the supernatural except as a red herring, this is the central theme of the Carnacki stories, though several of the stories have non-supernatural endings.\n\nThe character of Carnacki was inspired in part by Dr. Hesselius, a supernaturally inclined scientist who appeared in short stories by the Irish fantasy writer [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], notably the early and influential vampire story \"[[Carmilla]]\".  Carnacki is also highly reminiscent of [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s John Silence.\n\n=== General structure ===\nThe stories are presented using a framework story: Carnacki periodically sends notes of invitation to four friends, asking them to come to dinner and hear his latest tale. One of the men, Dodgson, is the actual narrator of the story, who comprises an extremely minimal part of each Carnacki story. Carnacki forbids discussion of the case in question over dinner. After dinner, Carnacki lights his pipe, everyone settles into their favourite chairs, and he tells the tale without interruption.\n\nEach of Carnacki's tales tells of an investigation into an unusual [[haunting]], which Carnacki is charged to identify and to end. He employs a variety of scientific methods in his investigations, as well as resorting to more traditional [[folklore]]. He employs technologies such as photography and his own fictional invention, the [[Electric Pentacle]]. He is not presumptuous, and always uses evidence to draw his final conclusions, so that in some stories he decides the haunting is real, while in others it is staged or faked by an adversary for various reasons. This variety makes the stories suspenseful, as the audience is never sure if the ghosts are real or not: of the nine Carnacki stories, one has no supernatural component, four feature authentic paranormal activity, two have the appearance of the supernatural as a disguise for mundane human activity, and two contain manmade hoaxes in parallel with an actual haunting.\n\nAfter the tale is complete, Carnacki usually answers a few questions from his guests and may hand around a relevant memento, but does not discuss the case at great length. He usually dismisses his guests with the genial phrase \"Out you go!\".\n\n=== Inventions ===\nIn addition to the trademark electric pentacle, Hodgson invented several rituals and ancient texts that feature in the Carnacki stories.\n\nCarnacki uses a fictional ancient text, the \"Sigsand Manuscript\", as a resource to protect himself against supernatural influences. Carnacki refers to \"Aeiirii\" and \"Saiitii\" manifestations, the latter being more dangerous and capable of overcoming Carnacki's protective devices, and several rituals, including the \"Saaamaaa Ritual\", with its mysterious \"eight signs\" and \"unknown last line\" that is invoked in \"The Whistling Room\" by a mysterious power.\n\nThere are references to even more arcane fictional works, including the \"Incantation of Raaaee\", but no further information is provided in the stories.\n\n=== Influence ===\nThe stories influenced later horror and fantasy writers, notably [[Seabury Quinn]] and [[Algernon Blackwood]], both of whom had their own supernatural detective characters ([[Jules de Grandin]] and [[John Silence]] respectively). [[Simon R. Green]] pays homage to Hodgson with his Ghost Finders series, where the protagonists work for the mysterious Carnacki Institute.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://simonrgreen.co.uk/books/# |title=Books \u2013 Simon R Green |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> ''[[Judas Ghost]]'', a film based on Green's series, was released November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338027/ |title=Judas Ghost (2013) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417155801/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338027/ |archivedate=17 April 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n=== Critical opinion ===\nUnlike some of Hodgson's work, the Carnacki stories remain very accessible to a modern audience. A. F. Kidd and [[Rick Kennett]] in their introduction to ''No. 472 Cheyne Walk: Carnacki, the Untold Stories'' pose the question: \"What is it about Thomas Carnacki that fascinates so many people?\" According to Kidd and Kennett, the series' enduring attraction comes more from Hodgson's capacity for world-building than any special appeal of Carnacki himself:\n\n<blockquote>It certainly isn't his dynamic personality. Not much character is evident in Hodgson's creation: he is your generic stiff upper-lip Edwardian Englishman ... but the exotic landscapes he inhabits are supernatural... it's his exploits, and the carefully constructed milieu in which they take place, that continue to intrigue. They are quite timeless.</blockquote>\n\nAlthough a self-proclaimed fan of Hodgson's work, [[H. P. Lovecraft]] considered ''Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder'' \"vastly inferior\" to his earlier novels, calling it \"his poorest work\" and Carnacki himself \"very weak, artificial and stereotyped\", \"surely only a mediocre echo of John Silence\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nightland.website/index.php/background/essays/198-h-p-lovecraft-letters-mentioning-william-hope-hodgson||title=Selected Letters |}}</ref>\n\n== Summaries of Hodgson's Carnacki stories ==\n\nThe first six stories are covered here in sequence of their original publication, five in 1910 monthly issues of ''The Idler'' and \"The Thing Invisible\" in ''The New Magazine'', January 1912.\n\"The Thing Invisible\" is first as the stories were collected in 1913, and again as collected in 1947. Most if not all collections follow that sequence, prior to Project Gutenberg Ebook #10832 (2004), which contains the first six stories alone, in their magazine sequence.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10832 \"Carnacki, the Ghost Finder by William Hope Hodgson\"]. [[Project Gutenberg]] Ebook #10832. 2004, last updated 2012. Retrieved 24 June 2019.</ref>\n\n\"The Thing Invisible\" was revised, and expanded by about half, presumably for the 1913 or 1947 collection. The collection as presented by Forgotten Futures contains both versions of \"The Thing Invisible\" and publishing history notes that identify some minor differences in the other stories.<ref>[http://www.forgottenfutures.com/game/ff4/ ''Carnacki the Ghost Finder''].

Carnacki is summoned to investigate a noisy spirit that tears off the bedclothes and slams the door(s). The manifestation is far more powerful than he expects, and he spends a miserable, terrified night in his electric pentacle while a horrible apparition in the form of a giant human hand pounds at his defences. The next day, Carnacki finds the fabled \"luck ring\", and he brings it with him into the pentacle. This proves unwise, as when night falls the vicious entity pours from the ring itself and Carnacki is inside the pentacle with it. He barely escapes with his life, while the entity is trapped. He ends the haunting by melting down the ring into a lump of slag within his protective barrier.\n\n=== \"The House Among the Laurels\" ===\nA deserted mansion in Ireland displays signs of haunting, including what appears to be blood dripping from the ceiling, and several men have been found dead in the house. Is it a prank or a haunting? Carnacki recruits a group of burly local men to investigate, along with several dogs, and they attempt to stay the night within the mansion. During their ordeal doors slam, the fire goes out, a dog is killed, and the entire group bolts from the house in terror. Upon studying his photograph, Carnacki realises that he and the men have been played for fools. His photograph shows a wire, too fine to see in the dark, lowered from the ceiling to remove the hook holding the door open. The \"blood drip\" is coloured water, and the \"ghosts\" are actually a criminal gang living in secret rooms in the mansion and playing a trick on him, taking advantage of the local legends to frighten away interlopers.\n\n=== \"The Whistling Room\" ===\nWhen a chamber in a mansion manifests a loud, eerie whistling, Carnacki is called to investigate. He makes an exceedingly thorough search of the room, but can find no explanation. He is still not convinced of the supernatural nature of the sound until he climbs a ladder outside and peers into the room through the window: the floor of the room itself is puckering like a pair of grotesque, blistered lips. He hears Tassoc, the mansion's owner, calling for help, and enters the room via the window. But Tassoc is not in the room\u2014only an extraordinarily dangerous supernatural entity. Carnacki is saved only by the intervention of an unknown, second being, which utters the unknown last line of the Saamaa ritual, temporarily rendering the whistling entity powerless. With that, Carnacki throws himself through the window to escape. He then has the room demolished, and all parts burned in a blast furnace within a protective pentacle including an ancient inscription in Celtic. According to legend, a court jester was once killed in the room's fireplace, and whistled as he was roasted to death.\n\n=== \"The Horse of the Invisible\" ===\nAccording to Hisgins family tradition, any first-born female will be haunted by a ghostly horse during her courtship. This story has been long considered a legend, but now for the first time in seven generations there is a first-born female, and her fianc\u00e9e has just suffered a broken arm after an attack by a mysterious assailant. Carnacki is summoned to investigate. He and the woman, Mary, and her fianc\u00e9e, Beaumont, hear hoofbeats in the night, but no horse is seen. Many people present hear the hoofbeats, but no one can find an explanation; Carnacki sets up the electric pentacle around Mary's bed. The hoofbeats are heard again during the night, but nothing else happens. No marks of hooves can be found around the grounds the next morning. The following evening, hoofbeats and neighing are heard on the grounds, and Mary is heard screaming. Carnacki rushes out with his camera, and snaps a picture, but sees nothing after the blinding flash. Beaumont is struck in the head, but not badly injured; he claims that he has seen an enormous horse's head. The hoofbeats are again heard during the night. The decision is made to accelerate the wedding plans, in the hopes that the haunting will disappear with the successful conclusion of the courtship.\n\nThe next day, Carnacki takes Mary around the house, snapping photographs to see if any manifestation can be seen on film. In the cellar a horrible neighing is heard, but nothing is seen. In one of the developed photographs, however, an enormous hoof can be seen. The night again passes uneventfully. The next morning, though, hoofbeats and neighing can be heard almost immediately, in what seems a direct assault by the invisible horse; Carnacki fires his weapon and Mary's father attacks with his sword. As a light is brought they discover a rejected suitor, Parsket, wearing an enormous costume horse head and hooves. As they interrogate Parsket, hoofbeats are again heard in the house, and this time it is not a trick; Parsket dies of fright. The marriage goes on as planned, and the manifestation is never heard again.\n\n=== \"The Searcher of the End House\" ===\nCarnacki investigates a haunting in his own mother's house. The first indication that something is amiss comes when Carnacki, up late reading, hears his mother knocking, so he thinks, on the banister to tell him to go to his bed. She does not remember doing so the next day, and it happens again the following night. When Carnacki looks in on her, he finds her door open, but she is sound asleep. A strange mildew smell is in the bedroom. Carnacki investigates the house, including the three cellars, but can find no explanation.\n\nThe opening of the door happens again the following night, and this time while Carnacki is speaking to his mother the two of them hear a door slam twice downstairs. The smell of mildew is powerful as Carnacki investigates the house. More doors are heard slamming in the night, but Carnacki can find nothing. The next day, he consults the landlord, and learns something of the house's mysterious history, which includes a former tenant named Captain Tobias, and rumours of a ghostly woman. Several previous tenants had left upon seeing this apparition. The landlord agrees to spend the night in the house as well. In the dead of night, they see a ghostly, naked child running through the house. They have little doubt that it is a supernatural manifestation. The landlord claims to see a woman, apparently searching for the child, although Carnacki cannot see it. All of the seals on the doors are unbroken. As they debate what they have seen, the mildew smell returns, more powerful than ever. The downstairs passages are wet with grotesquely shaped footprints. In his nervousness, the landlord accidentally fires his revolver. No one is hit, but the police arrive to investigate. The physical evidence convinces the officer that an investigation is in order. As they wind up their tour, a second officer sees the ghostly woman. The men follow the wet footprints and smell into the cellars; on the top step, they find a wriggling maggot. Through their investigation of the third cellar, they find that the prints stop at a disused well, filled with water. They watch the well for the rest of the night, but nothing more happens.\n\nThe next evening, the men reconvene in the basement with lamps, a tripwire, and a wire cage to suspend over the well. Carnacki locks and seals the doors. As they keep watch, the ghostly child again manifests, apparently fleeing from an unseen pursuer. All present but Carnacki claim to see a woman, although he does see all the metal objects in the basement shining strangely. While they watch, something is heard to emerge from the well, giving off the horrible smell; Carnacki lowers the cage, and when the men uncover the lanterns they discover that they have caught Captain Tobias, carrying a leg of spoiled [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]]. He came in through a secret passage at the bottom of the well. We learn that Captain Tobias is wanted for smuggling, after being released from prison only a few weeks earlier. He is trying to drive out the tenants of his old home so that he can retrieve smuggled goods; the sounds were produced when he entered a hidden passage in Carnacki's mother's bedroom. The wooden panels have warped with age, and so make a clicking sound.\n\nAs for the ghost, Captain Tobias also reports that he has seen the woman and child. Carnacki believes that \"...the Woman and the Child were not only two complete and different entities; but even they were each not in quite the same planes of existence.\" He thinks the men may have witnessed the ghost of a wayward unborn child that refused to accept birth into the natural world and which was thus pulled back by what Sigsand called \"thee Haggs\". Carnacki goes on to say \"it leaves us with the conception of a child's soul adrift half-way between two lives, and running through Eternity from Something incredible and inconceivable (because not understood) to our senses.\"\n\n=== \"The Thing Invisible\" ===\nA chapel attached to an Edwardian manor house contains an ancient, cursed dagger that has just apparently almost murdered someone of its own accord, and naturally, Carnacki is called in to investigate. He spends the night in the chapel wearing armour with his camera ready to photograph any mysterious phenomena. All night he hears mysterious noises. As he approaches the altar, the dagger nearly kills him. The photographic evidence settles it, though\u2014there is a rational explanation. The somewhat demented elderly gentleman of the manor house has armed an ancient trap that guards the altar: a spring mechanism designed to fling the dagger when the altar gate is opened. Carnacki uncovers the truth because of a subtle difference between the \"before\" and \"after\" photographs of the altar's cast iron metalwork.\n\n=== \"The Hog\" ===\nThis story was first printed in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' (Jan 1947). Carnacki faces perhaps his most powerful adversary: a disturbing hog spirit of giant proportions which is trying to enter our world, manifesting as a series of horrifying nightmares. He is equipped with a new variant on the electric pentacle involving rainbow-coloured tubes. When connected to the head of the dreamer these tubes fluctuate in color and light intensity. Carnacki photographs the tubes on a slowly moving strip of paper which he specially develops to create raised images. When the paper is run under the reproducer of a specially modified phonograph the sounds heard by the dreamer are reproduced- in this instance the sounds of evil swine.\n\n=== \"The Haunted ''Jarvee''\" ===\nCarnacki decides to go for a voyage aboard the ''Jarvee'', his old friend Captain Thompson's antique sailing ship, for purposes of rejuvenation, but also to investigate the ambiguous complaints of ghosts his friend had been making for some time.\nCarnacki performs his standard methods of exhaustively and completely searching the designated area to eliminate obvious physical causes of a haunting.\nFinding nothing, Carnacki is left to wait. After four days, whilst performing his usual patrol along the ship's [[poop deck]] with the Captain, his old friend suddenly points out to him a shadow of some sort on the ocean's surface, speeding towards the ship. He notices similar shadows converging on the ship from all of the cardinal directions. The closer they get to the ''Jarvee'', the harder it is to see them, and eventually they disappear from sight.\nCarnacki, the Captain and the rest of the crew retire, and the night goes normally, until about eleven o'clock, when a furious storm bursts upon the ship without a hint of warning. Refusing to send men up above to lower the sails and masts because of previous experiences in which he did just that, and his men were hurled to their death, Captain Thompson forces them to sit out the storm completely unprepared, and the ''Jarvee'' suffers tremendous damage.\nObserving all this, Carnacki guesses that the phenomenon is caused by vibrations, so when he observes the shadows converging on the ship again the next day, he sets up a device to emit repellent vibrations. The ship is then struck by a furious squall, which tears one of the sails right off of the ropes. It is not until 2 A.M that the squall passes, followed by an entire week of calm seas, with a furious wind storm every night.\n\nDuring this week of calm, however, Carnacki is left to experiment with his repellent vibrations, until finally, he is given the distinct impression that his experiments are producing results, and he finally convinces Captain Thompson to allow him to set up his machine to emit the vibrations at full power, without stopping, starting at sunset.\nAfraid for their lives, Carnacki orders the crew to stay below decks, padlocking the doors and making the first and eighth signs of the Saaamaaa Ritual, connected with triple lines crossed at every seventh inch. The Captain and the three mates demand to accompany him during the night, and Carnacki reluctantly agrees.\nHe draws a pentacle with chalk around the machine emitting the vibrations, and around the Captain and his mates. He then erects the Electric Pentacle and turns the vibration machine on.\nSoon after, he and the Captain witness the mysterious shadows racing towards the ship.\nStrange, purple lightning is then witnessed, but it is not accompanied by thunder. Soon after, the ship undergoes a series of strange \"shudderings\" before it starts to tip onto its side, sending the Electric Pentacle sliding, and forcing Carnacki, Captain Thompson and his three mates to hold on for dear life. Carnacki is forced to shut his machine off.\n\nPredictably, there is a booming of thunder, and a furious storm starts raging. Towards morning, the storm calms, and soon after, the ''Jarvee'' is running before a strong wind\u2014but a leak has been sprung, and two days after, they are forced to abandon ship and take to the boats.\n\nThe ''Jarvee'' sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nAfter he finishes his tale, Dodgson, the narrator asks what caused the haunting. Carnacki then explains his theory of \"focuses\", saying that the ''Jarvee'', for whatever reason, be it the particular mood a builder was in as he hammered a nail home, or the tree that makes up a certain board, was a focal point for \"attractive vibrations\". He summarises by saying that it is impossible for him to know fully why the ''Jarvee'' was being haunted, and he could only make suppositions.\n\n=== \"The Find\" ===\nCarnacki investigates a seemingly impossible book forgery. It is the only Carnacki story without any hint of the supernatural.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n===Television===\n\"The Horse of the Invisible\" was adapted as an episode of the 1970s British TV series, ''[[The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes (television series)|The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes]]''.\n\n'''Cast'''\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Carnacki\n* [[Tony Steedman]] as Captain Hisgins\n* [[Michele Dotrice]] as Mary Hisgins\n* Michael Johnson as Charles Beaumont\n* [[Geoffrey Whitehead]] as Harry Parsket\n* Aim\u00e9e Delamain as Miss Hisgins\n* [[Arthur White (actor)|Arthur White]] as March\n\n===Audio===\n[[Big Finish Productions]] has recorded six of the stories in unabridged audiobook format.

The adventures of Thomas Carnacki will be told in short story format steeped in weird fiction, folklore, ghost stories, mythology and symbolism. The graphic novel is written and illustrated by [https://mscorley.com/About M. S. Corley] who regularly shares his working process on his project's page [https://www.patreon.com/hollowowl/posts?sort=published_at&tag=Carnacki \"Carnacki: Recorder of Things Strange\"]\n\n=== ''472 Cheyne Walk'' ===\nThe book ''No. 472 Cheyne Walk: Carnacki, the Untold Stories'' by A. F. Kidd and [[Rick Kennett]] collects twelve stories written about the further adventures of Carnacki. Four of these stories were originally published as a 32-page booklet of the same title in 1992. The book version was printed in a limited edition of 500 copies.\n\nMany of these stories are inspired by off-hand references to other cases of hauntings that Carnacki makes in his stories, which were never explained further in the original story series. In their introduction to the 1992 booklet the authors describe these stories as [[pastiche]], in the sense of respectful imitation or homage, as opposed to [[parody]], which mocks the original (either with respectful humour, or more viciously). The authors suggest that Hodgson, by having Carnacki casually drop references to other cases which he himself did not write about, \"invited\" his readers to enter the \"shared universe\" and pick up where he left off. Readers may decide for themselves whether to consider these stories \"canon\" or a legitimate part of the Carnacki story arc; they closely follow not only the basic framework structure of the Carnacki original stories but also Hodgson's style and vocabulary.\n\n==== \"The Darkness\" ====\nIn \"The Gateway of the Monster\" and \"The Horse of the Invisible\", Carnacki makes passing references to the \"Black Veil case\", in which a man named Aster died because he did not accept the necessity of staying inside the protective pentacle. In \"The Darkness\", Aster is a reporter who accompanies Hodgson on his investigation of a haunted room. An apparition of a mysterious woman can be seen in the window and a rotting black veil is found inside a secret compartment in a window-seat. Carnacki burns the veil inside a pentacle in the hopes of ending the haunting. However, as night falls, Aster will not enter the pentacle, believing this to be superstitious nonsense. Both men lose the power of sight as the apparition manifests, and Carnacki must listen helplessly from inside the pentacle as Aster is driven into screaming madness and death. No option remains to end the haunting but to destroy the house itself.\n\n==== \"Matheson's Inheritance\" ====\nIn \"The Gateway of the Monster\" Carnacki makes reference to the \"Noving Fur\" case. It is unclear if this is a typographical error and Hodgson intended \"Moving Fur\" instead; the ''Collected Fiction'' edition and the [[Project Gutenberg]] electronic text show this correction. \"Matheson's Inheritance\" covers both bases by including moving fur and placing the haunting in Noving House in Wales.\n\nMatheson has inherited a baroque mansion. Local legend says the house was once occupied by a ''dewi'' (wizard) and his familiar an [[afanc]]. One room in the house emanates dread. Carnacki and Matheson can find no natural explanation, and so Carnacki spends the night in the room, inside his protective [[pentacle]]. In the middle of his vigil his candle flames suddenly turn black, and the floor becomes a heaving carpet of fur, as if the pentacle was upon the back of a giant animal. It is clear that the protective barrier has failed utterly. As in \"The Whistling Room\", a second powerful entity intervenes and the candle flames turn blue; Carnacki is given a moment to escape the room, and does so, although his pantlegs are torn and his legs covered with cuts. In daylight, strange, ancient bones are found under the floorboards of the room; before the room can be demolished, that wing of the mansion burns.\n\nThe blue candle flames point Carnacki back to references to the protective powers of colours in the Sigsand manuscript, suggesting the origin of the coloured tubes that appear in Hodgson's Carnacki story \"The Hog\". The afanc is described as having a horse-like head; this description does not match the Welsh myth, and so may be a reference to \"The Horse of the Invisible\".\n\n[[William Hope Hodgson#Motifs in Hodgson's Work|Motifs]]: a legend; a protective pentacle; a supernatural manifestation; protection from one supernatural entity by another, more powerful one; a creature or creatures unknown to science; a vigil.\n\n=== \"Doctor Who: Foreign Devils\" ===\n{{Main|Foreign Devils (novella)}}\nIn 2002, an [[Andrew Cartmel]] novella appeared as one of [[Telos Doctor Who novellas|a series]] based upon ''[[Doctor Who]]''. ''[[Foreign Devils (novella)|Foreign Devils]]'' featured Carnacki alongside the [[Second Doctor]] as his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]].\n\n=== ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' ===\n{{Main|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen}}\n\nIn 2007 a graphic novel entitled ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'' was released, written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]. It is part of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' series, and is the first release to feature Thomas Carnacki. Carnacki is a member of the 1910s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, with [[Mina Harker|Wilhelmina Murray]], [[Allan Quatermain]], [[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]], and [[A. J. Raffles]]. The ''Black Dossier'' is filled with non-comic pieces, taking the form of prose stories, letters, maps, guidebooks, magazines and even a lost Shakespeare folio. Carnacki features most prominently in a short story \"What Ho, Gods of the Abyss\" and concerns a visit by [[Jeeves]] and [[Bertie Wooster]] (by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]) to Wooster's [[Aunt Dahlia]] wherein they encounter an [[Elder Thing]], along with a [[Mi-go]] and a [[Cthulhu]] cult. Carnacki is described as being \"an older man...who seemed to be regarded by the others as an expert on the sort of business going on within my aunt's estate.\" After questioning Wooster closely he performs a ritual banishing of the Elder Thing with the help of his team. In another section of the ''Black Dossier'' entitled \"The Sincerest Form of Flattery\" it is mentioned that Carnacki \"had encounters with some form of spirit that allowed him brief, fragmentary visions of the future\" regarding an attempt to derail the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. Due to ill health following his visions of World War I, Carnacki did not participate in the League's battle with ''Les Hommes Mysterieux'', and had by 1937 retired from active duty.\n\nReleased in 2009, Part I of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century]]'' entitled \"What Keeps Mankind Alive\" features Carnacki as a main character. Set in 1910, following his visions of a black cabal, Carnacki brings Mina Harker, Allan Quatermain, Orlando, and A.J. Raffles to an occult club which is populated by a range of fictional occult detectives looking for clues as to the cabal. This leads them to investigate and confront the cabal led by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s [[Aleister Crowley]] analogue, Oliver Haddo. Carnacki suspects that they are trying to end the world by creating a [[Moonchild (novel)|Moonchild]].\n\n=== Audience with the Ghost Finder ===\n{{Main|Audience with the Ghost Finder}}\n''Audience with the Ghost Finder'', a stage play by M. J. Starling, features Carnacki and Dodgson as main characters.  Though the story is original, the play is an explicit homage to Hodgson's stories, several of which are directly referenced by the characters - most notably ''The Horse of the Invisible'', the events of which form part of the backstory. The play also borrows imagery from H. P. Lovecraft's story ''The Dreams in the Witch-House''.\n\n''Audience with the Ghost Finder'' was first performed by Blackshaw Theatre in May 2013, at the Wandsworth Arts Festival and Fringe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackshawonline.com/waff/|work=Blackshaw Theatre|title=Wandsworth Arts Festival & Fringe 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305155122/http://www.blackshawonline.com/waff|archivedate=5 March 2013}}</ref> It was revived in October 2013 as part of the London Horror Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonhorrorfestival.com/whats-on/an-audience-with-the-ghost-finder/|work=London Horror Festival|title=an audience with the ghost finder|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917045544/http://www.londonhorrorfestival.com/whats-on/an-audience-with-the-ghost-finder/|archivedate=17 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Diogenes Club ===\n[[Kim Newman]] has written a number of short stories about [[the Diogenes Club]], as originally from the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. In Newman's setting, the Club investigates paranormal and occult matters for British intelligence and police agencies. In the stories \"The Man Who Got Off The Ghost Train\" and \"Swellhead\", it is mentioned that Carnacki was a member of the Diogenes Club as a special occult investigator; when he retired, his position was taken by Newman's character [[Richard Jeperson]]. Carnacki is also mentioned as having investigated several cases alongside [[Sherlock Holmes]].\n\n=== Carnacki in the Cthulhu Mythos ===\n[[Barbara Hambly]]'s short story \"The Adventure of the Antiquarian's Niece\" (from ''[[Shadows Over Baker Street]]'') and A. F. Kidd's short story \"The Grantchester Grimoire\" (from ''[[Gaslight Grimoire]]'') both also feature Carnacki aiding Sherlock Holmes in an investigation of an occult matter.\n\n=== \"A Forgotten Caudetan Incident\" ===\nSpanish author [[Alberto L\u00f3pez Aroca]] wrote the short story \"''Un olvidado episodio caudetano''\" (\"A Forgotten Caudetan Incident\"), included in the book ''Los Espectros Conjurados'' ({{ISBN|978-84-607-9866-8}}), featuring Carnacki in a Spanish village, [[Caudete]]; and by the same author, \"''Algunos derivados del alquitr\u00e1n''\" (\"Some Coal-tar Derivatives\"), included in the volume ''Sherlock Holmes y lo Outr\u00e9'' -Publisher: Academia de Mitolog\u00eda Creativa Jules Verne de Albacete, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stardustcf.com/libroindiv.asp?libro=1418 |title=STARDUST.

Carnacki appears as an old man in another work by L\u00f3pez Aroca, ''Necronomic\u00f3n Z'' (Ediciones Dolmen, 2012; {{ISBN|978-84-15296-59-1}}), a [[Cthulhu Mythos]] novel.\n\n=== Gravel ===\nIn 2008, the comic publisher [[Avatar Press|Avatar]] started serialising ''[[Gravel (comics)|Gravel]]'', the ongoing adventures of [[Warren Ellis]]' and [[Mike Wolfer]]'s combat magician William Gravel (previously told in the ''Strange Kisses'', ''Stranger Kisses'' and the ''Strange Killings'' [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]]). In the first storyline of the ongoing ''Gravel'' comic, Ellis and Wolfer had the \"Sigsand manuscript\", split in parts for each of the \"Minor Seven\" (Britain's occult detectives). In his quest for revenge for having been ousted from the group, Gravel must collect each magician's piece of the manuscript, but spends most of the third issue hearing about Thomas Carnacki (including an extended homage to \"The Whistling Room\" and the particular writing style Hodgson used when writing the Carnacki stories).\n\nPreviously, Warren Ellis had included the Sigsand Manuscript in the 13th issue of his ongoing ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' series. It is picked up by [[Elijah Snow]] from Sherlock Holmes' book shelf.\n\n=== Sherlock Holmes: The Breath of God ===\n{{Main|Sherlock Holmes: The Breath of God}}\nIn 2012, a [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|Sherlock Holmes pastiche]] novel by [[Guy Adams]] was published that featured Carnacki.\n\n=== Parodies ===\n[[David Langford]]'s 1988 parody collection ''[[He Do The Time Police In Different Voices|The Dragonhiker's Guide to Battlefield Covenant at Dune's Edge: Odyssey Two]]'' contains a parody of \"The Gateway of the Monster\", in which the creature manifests not as a human hand, but as another body part entirely.\n\n[[Rick Kennett]] has also written a parody of \"The Whistling Room\" called \"The Sniffling Room\", published in ''The Goblin Muse'', April 2000. In this brief story, rather than receiving an invitation and then eagerly attending Carnacki's storytelling evenings, the attending gentlemen are instead kidnapped, dragged to Carnacki's home, and forced to listen against their will to a tale told by a man they consider to be a raving lunatic. It thus mocks primarily the common ''framework'' of the Carnacki stories, rather than Carnacki's actual investigation.\n\nThe French writer G\u00e9rard D\u00f4le has published a volume of parodies of Carnacki, in which he encounters the likes of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[S\u00e2r Dubnotal]] while two other French writers, Fabrice Colin and Andr\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois Ruaud have given to Thomas Carnacki a nephew, William Carnacki, reporting to his uncle the life in a parallel world where most monsters do exist (children book ''Le Livre des monstres\u2014Chroniques du monde noir'', 2008).\n\n[[Anton LaVey]], founder and High Priest of the [[Church of Satan]], named his son \"Satan Xerxes Carnacki LaVey\".\n\n===The Adventure of the Haunted Library===\n\n[[August Derleth]], whose [[Arkham House]] publishing firm issued the first American (and first expanded edition) of ''Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder'', pays affectionate tribute to the character in one of his [[Solar Pons]] stories. While Carnacki does not actually appear in the story, it is mentioned several times in \"The Adventure of the Haunted Library\" (which appears in ''[[The Casebook of Solar Pons]]'' (1965)) that Carnacki was called in to investigate the case, but having been unable to solve it, thereafter referred it to Solar Pons.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Occult detective fiction]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist |25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Leigh Blackmore]]. \"Things Invisible: Human and 'Ab-Human' in Two of Hodgson's Carnacki Stories\".

Carnacki was the protagonist of a series of six short stories published between 1910 and 1912 in ''[[The Idler (1892\u20131911)|The Idler]]'' magazine and ''The New Magazine''. \n\nThese stories were printed together as ''[[Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder]]'' in 1913. A 1948 [[Arkham House]] edition of ''Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder'' edited by [[August Derleth]] added three stories: \"[[Carnacki#\"The Haunted Jarvee\"|The Haunted ''Jarvee'']]\", published posthumously in ''The Premier Magazine'' in 1929; \"[[Carnacki#\"The Hog\"|The Hog]]\", published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in 1947; and \"[[Carnacki#\"The Find\"|The Find]]\", a previously unpublished story.\n\n== Notes on the series ==\nThe stories are inspired by the tradition of fictional detectives such as [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Carnacki lives in a bachelor flat in No 472 [[Cheyne Walk]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]; the stories are told from a first-person perspective by Dodgson, a member of Carnacki's \"strictly limited circle of friends\", much as Holmes' adventures were told from Watson's point of view (his other friends are Jessop, Arkwright and Taylor). Whereas the Holmes stories never made use of the supernatural except as a red herring, this is the central theme of the Carnacki stories, though several of the stories have non-supernatural endings.\n\nThe character of Carnacki was inspired in part by Dr. Hesselius, a supernaturally inclined scientist who appeared in short stories by the Irish fantasy writer [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], notably the early and influential vampire story \"[[Carmilla]]\".  Carnacki is also highly reminiscent of [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s John Silence.\n\n=== General structure ===\nThe stories are presented using a framework story: Carnacki periodically sends notes of invitation to four friends, asking them to come to dinner and hear his latest tale. One of the men, Dodgson, is the actual narrator of the story, who comprises an extremely minimal part of each Carnacki story. Carnacki forbids discussion of the case in question over dinner. After dinner, Carnacki lights his pipe, everyone settles into their favourite chairs, and he tells the tale without interruption.\n\nEach of Carnacki's tales tells of an investigation into an unusual [[haunting]], which Carnacki is charged to identify and to end. He employs a variety of scientific methods in his investigations, as well as resorting to more traditional [[folklore]]. He employs technologies such as photography and his own fictional invention, the [[Electric Pentacle]]. He is not presumptuous, and always uses evidence to draw his final conclusions, so that in some stories he decides the haunting is real, while in others it is staged or faked by an adversary for various reasons. This variety makes the stories suspenseful, as the audience is never sure if the ghosts are real or not: of the nine Carnacki stories, one has no supernatural component, four feature authentic paranormal activity, two have the appearance of the supernatural as a disguise for mundane human activity, and two contain manmade hoaxes in parallel with an actual haunting.\n\nAfter the tale is complete, Carnacki usually answers a few questions from his guests and may hand around a relevant memento, but does not discuss the case at great length. He usually dismisses his guests with the genial phrase \"Out you go!\".\n\n=== Inventions ===\nIn addition to the trademark electric pentacle, Hodgson invented several rituals and ancient texts that feature in the Carnacki stories.\n\nCarnacki uses a fictional ancient text, the \"Sigsand Manuscript\", as a resource to protect himself against supernatural influences. Carnacki refers to \"Aeiirii\" and \"Saiitii\" manifestations, the latter being more dangerous and capable of overcoming Carnacki's protective devices, and several rituals, including the \"Saaamaaa Ritual\", with its mysterious \"eight signs\" and \"unknown last line\" that is invoked in \"The Whistling Room\" by a mysterious power.\n\nThere are references to even more arcane fictional works, including the \"Incantation of Raaaee\", but no further information is provided in the stories.\n\n=== Influence ===\nThe stories influenced later horror and fantasy writers, notably [[Seabury Quinn]] and [[Algernon Blackwood]], both of whom had their own supernatural detective characters ([[Jules de Grandin]] and [[John Silence]] respectively). [[Simon R. Green]] pays homage to Hodgson with his Ghost Finders series, where the protagonists work for the mysterious Carnacki Institute.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://simonrgreen.co.uk/books/# |title=Books \u2013 Simon R Green |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> ''[[Judas Ghost]]'', a film based on Green's series, was released November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338027/ |title=Judas Ghost (2013) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417155801/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338027/ |archivedate=17 April 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n=== Critical opinion ===\nUnlike some of Hodgson's work, the Carnacki stories remain very accessible to a modern audience. A. F. Kidd and [[Rick Kennett]] in their introduction to ''No. 472 Cheyne Walk: Carnacki, the Untold Stories'' pose the question: \"What is it about Thomas Carnacki that fascinates so many people?\" According to Kidd and Kennett, the series' enduring attraction comes more from Hodgson's capacity for world-building than any special appeal of Carnacki himself:\n\n<blockquote>It certainly isn't his dynamic personality. Not much character is evident in Hodgson's creation: he is your generic stiff upper-lip Edwardian Englishman ... but the exotic landscapes he inhabits are supernatural... it's his exploits, and the carefully constructed milieu in which they take place, that continue to intrigue. They are quite timeless.</blockquote>\n\nAlthough a self-proclaimed fan of Hodgson's work, [[H. P. Lovecraft]] considered ''Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder'' \"vastly inferior\" to his earlier novels, calling it \"his poorest work\" and Carnacki himself \"very weak, artificial and stereotyped\", \"surely only a mediocre echo of John Silence\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nightland.website/index.php/background/essays/198-h-p-lovecraft-letters-mentioning-william-hope-hodgson||title=Selected Letters |}}</ref>\n\n== Summaries of Hodgson's Carnacki stories ==\n\nThe first six stories are covered here in sequence of their original publication, five in 1910 monthly issues of ''The Idler'' and \"The Thing Invisible\" in ''The New Magazine'', January 1912.\n\"The Thing Invisible\" is first as the stories were collected in 1913, and again as collected in 1947. Most if not all collections follow that sequence, prior to Project Gutenberg Ebook #10832 (2004), which contains the first six stories alone, in their magazine sequence.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10832 \"Carnacki, the Ghost Finder by William Hope Hodgson\"]. [[Project Gutenberg]] Ebook #10832. 2004, last updated 2012. Retrieved 24 June 2019.</ref>\n\n\"The Thing Invisible\" was revised, and expanded by about half, presumably for the 1913 or 1947 collection. The collection as presented by Forgotten Futures contains both versions of \"The Thing Invisible\" and publishing history notes that identify some minor differences in the other stories.<ref>[http://www.forgottenfutures.com/game/ff4/ ''Carnacki the Ghost Finder''].

Carnacki is summoned to investigate a noisy spirit that tears off the bedclothes and slams the door(s). The manifestation is far more powerful than he expects, and he spends a miserable, terrified night in his electric pentacle while a horrible apparition in the form of a giant human hand pounds at his defences. The next day, Carnacki finds the fabled \"luck ring\", and he brings it with him into the pentacle. This proves unwise, as when night falls the vicious entity pours from the ring itself and Carnacki is inside the pentacle with it. He barely escapes with his life, while the entity is trapped. He ends the haunting by melting down the ring into a lump of slag within his protective barrier.\n\n=== \"The House Among the Laurels\" ===\nA deserted mansion in Ireland displays signs of haunting, including what appears to be blood dripping from the ceiling, and several men have been found dead in the house. Is it a prank or a haunting? Carnacki recruits a group of burly local men to investigate, along with several dogs, and they attempt to stay the night within the mansion. During their ordeal doors slam, the fire goes out, a dog is killed, and the entire group bolts from the house in terror. Upon studying his photograph, Carnacki realises that he and the men have been played for fools. His photograph shows a wire, too fine to see in the dark, lowered from the ceiling to remove the hook holding the door open. The \"blood drip\" is coloured water, and the \"ghosts\" are actually a criminal gang living in secret rooms in the mansion and playing a trick on him, taking advantage of the local legends to frighten away interlopers.\n\n=== \"The Whistling Room\" ===\nWhen a chamber in a mansion manifests a loud, eerie whistling, Carnacki is called to investigate. He makes an exceedingly thorough search of the room, but can find no explanation. He is still not convinced of the supernatural nature of the sound until he climbs a ladder outside and peers into the room through the window: the floor of the room itself is puckering like a pair of grotesque, blistered lips. He hears Tassoc, the mansion's owner, calling for help, and enters the room via the window. But Tassoc is not in the room\u2014only an extraordinarily dangerous supernatural entity. Carnacki is saved only by the intervention of an unknown, second being, which utters the unknown last line of the Saamaa ritual, temporarily rendering the whistling entity powerless. With that, Carnacki throws himself through the window to escape. He then has the room demolished, and all parts burned in a blast furnace within a protective pentacle including an ancient inscription in Celtic. According to legend, a court jester was once killed in the room's fireplace, and whistled as he was roasted to death.\n\n=== \"The Horse of the Invisible\" ===\nAccording to Hisgins family tradition, any first-born female will be haunted by a ghostly horse during her courtship. This story has been long considered a legend, but now for the first time in seven generations there is a first-born female, and her fianc\u00e9e has just suffered a broken arm after an attack by a mysterious assailant. Carnacki is summoned to investigate. He and the woman, Mary, and her fianc\u00e9e, Beaumont, hear hoofbeats in the night, but no horse is seen. Many people present hear the hoofbeats, but no one can find an explanation; Carnacki sets up the electric pentacle around Mary's bed. The hoofbeats are heard again during the night, but nothing else happens. No marks of hooves can be found around the grounds the next morning. The following evening, hoofbeats and neighing are heard on the grounds, and Mary is heard screaming. Carnacki rushes out with his camera, and snaps a picture, but sees nothing after the blinding flash. Beaumont is struck in the head, but not badly injured; he claims that he has seen an enormous horse's head. The hoofbeats are again heard during the night. The decision is made to accelerate the wedding plans, in the hopes that the haunting will disappear with the successful conclusion of the courtship.\n\nThe next day, Carnacki takes Mary around the house, snapping photographs to see if any manifestation can be seen on film. In the cellar a horrible neighing is heard, but nothing is seen. In one of the developed photographs, however, an enormous hoof can be seen. The night again passes uneventfully. The next morning, though, hoofbeats and neighing can be heard almost immediately, in what seems a direct assault by the invisible horse; Carnacki fires his weapon and Mary's father attacks with his sword. As a light is brought they discover a rejected suitor, Parsket, wearing an enormous costume horse head and hooves. As they interrogate Parsket, hoofbeats are again heard in the house, and this time it is not a trick; Parsket dies of fright. The marriage goes on as planned, and the manifestation is never heard again.\n\n=== \"The Searcher of the End House\" ===\nCarnacki investigates a haunting in his own mother's house. The first indication that something is amiss comes when Carnacki, up late reading, hears his mother knocking, so he thinks, on the banister to tell him to go to his bed. She does not remember doing so the next day, and it happens again the following night. When Carnacki looks in on her, he finds her door open, but she is sound asleep. A strange mildew smell is in the bedroom. Carnacki investigates the house, including the three cellars, but can find no explanation.\n\nThe opening of the door happens again the following night, and this time while Carnacki is speaking to his mother the two of them hear a door slam twice downstairs. The smell of mildew is powerful as Carnacki investigates the house. More doors are heard slamming in the night, but Carnacki can find nothing. The next day, he consults the landlord, and learns something of the house's mysterious history, which includes a former tenant named Captain Tobias, and rumours of a ghostly woman. Several previous tenants had left upon seeing this apparition. The landlord agrees to spend the night in the house as well. In the dead of night, they see a ghostly, naked child running through the house. They have little doubt that it is a supernatural manifestation. The landlord claims to see a woman, apparently searching for the child, although Carnacki cannot see it. All of the seals on the doors are unbroken. As they debate what they have seen, the mildew smell returns, more powerful than ever. The downstairs passages are wet with grotesquely shaped footprints. In his nervousness, the landlord accidentally fires his revolver. No one is hit, but the police arrive to investigate. The physical evidence convinces the officer that an investigation is in order. As they wind up their tour, a second officer sees the ghostly woman. The men follow the wet footprints and smell into the cellars; on the top step, they find a wriggling maggot. Through their investigation of the third cellar, they find that the prints stop at a disused well, filled with water. They watch the well for the rest of the night, but nothing more happens.\n\nThe next evening, the men reconvene in the basement with lamps, a tripwire, and a wire cage to suspend over the well. Carnacki locks and seals the doors. As they keep watch, the ghostly child again manifests, apparently fleeing from an unseen pursuer. All present but Carnacki claim to see a woman, although he does see all the metal objects in the basement shining strangely. While they watch, something is heard to emerge from the well, giving off the horrible smell; Carnacki lowers the cage, and when the men uncover the lanterns they discover that they have caught Captain Tobias, carrying a leg of spoiled [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]]. He came in through a secret passage at the bottom of the well. We learn that Captain Tobias is wanted for smuggling, after being released from prison only a few weeks earlier. He is trying to drive out the tenants of his old home so that he can retrieve smuggled goods; the sounds were produced when he entered a hidden passage in Carnacki's mother's bedroom. The wooden panels have warped with age, and so make a clicking sound.\n\nAs for the ghost, Captain Tobias also reports that he has seen the woman and child. Carnacki believes that \"...the Woman and the Child were not only two complete and different entities; but even they were each not in quite the same planes of existence.\" He thinks the men may have witnessed the ghost of a wayward unborn child that refused to accept birth into the natural world and which was thus pulled back by what Sigsand called \"thee Haggs\". Carnacki goes on to say \"it leaves us with the conception of a child's soul adrift half-way between two lives, and running through Eternity from Something incredible and inconceivable (because not understood) to our senses.\"\n\n=== \"The Thing Invisible\" ===\nA chapel attached to an Edwardian manor house contains an ancient, cursed dagger that has just apparently almost murdered someone of its own accord, and naturally, Carnacki is called in to investigate. He spends the night in the chapel wearing armour with his camera ready to photograph any mysterious phenomena. All night he hears mysterious noises. As he approaches the altar, the dagger nearly kills him. The photographic evidence settles it, though\u2014there is a rational explanation. The somewhat demented elderly gentleman of the manor house has armed an ancient trap that guards the altar: a spring mechanism designed to fling the dagger when the altar gate is opened. Carnacki uncovers the truth because of a subtle difference between the \"before\" and \"after\" photographs of the altar's cast iron metalwork.\n\n=== \"The Hog\" ===\nThis story was first printed in [[Weird Tales]] (Jan 1947). Carnacki faces perhaps his most powerful adversary: a disturbing hog spirit of giant proportions which is trying to enter our world, manifesting as a series of horrifying nightmares. He is equipped with a new variant on the electric pentacle involving rainbow-coloured tubes. When connected to the head of the dreamer these tubes fluctuate in color and light intensity. Carnacki photographs the tubes on a slowly moving strip of paper which he specially develops to create raised images. When the paper is run under the reproducer of a specially modified phonograph the sounds heard by the dreamer are reproduced- in this instance the sounds of evil swine.\n\n=== \"The Haunted ''Jarvee''\" ===\nCarnacki decides to go for a voyage aboard the ''Jarvee'', his old friend Captain Thompson's antique sailing ship, for purposes of rejuvenation, but also to investigate the ambiguous complaints of ghosts his friend had been making for some time.\nCarnacki performs his standard methods of exhaustively and completely searching the designated area to eliminate obvious physical causes of a haunting.\nFinding nothing, Carnacki is left to wait. After four days, whilst performing his usual patrol along the ship's [[poop deck]] with the Captain, his old friend suddenly points out to him a shadow of some sort on the ocean's surface, speeding towards the ship. He notices similar shadows converging on the ship from all of the cardinal directions. The closer they get to the ''Jarvee'', the harder it is to see them, and eventually they disappear from sight.\nCarnacki, the Captain and the rest of the crew retire, and the night goes normally, until about eleven o'clock, when a furious storm bursts upon the ship without a hint of warning. Refusing to send men up above to lower the sails and masts because of previous experiences in which he did just that, and his men were hurled to their death, Captain Thompson forces them to sit out the storm completely unprepared, and the ''Jarvee'' suffers tremendous damage.\nObserving all this, Carnacki guesses that the phenomenon is caused by vibrations, so when he observes the shadows converging on the ship again the next day, he sets up a device to emit repellent vibrations. The ship is then struck by a furious squall, which tears one of the sails right off of the ropes. It is not until 2 A.M that the squall passes, followed by an entire week of calm seas, with a furious wind storm every night.\n\nDuring this week of calm, however, Carnacki is left to experiment with his repellent vibrations, until finally, he is given the distinct impression that his experiments are producing results, and he finally convinces Captain Thompson to allow him to set up his machine to emit the vibrations at full power, without stopping, starting at sunset.\nAfraid for their lives, Carnacki orders the crew to stay below decks, padlocking the doors and making the first and eighth signs of the Saaamaaa Ritual, connected with triple lines crossed at every seventh inch. The Captain and the three mates demand to accompany him during the night, and Carnacki reluctantly agrees.\nHe draws a pentacle with chalk around the machine emitting the vibrations, and around the Captain and his mates. He then erects the Electric Pentacle and turns the vibration machine on.\nSoon after, he and the Captain witness the mysterious shadows racing towards the ship.\nStrange, purple lightning is then witnessed, but it is not accompanied by thunder. Soon after, the ship undergoes a series of strange \"shudderings\" before it starts to tip onto its side, sending the Electric Pentacle sliding, and forcing Carnacki, Captain Thompson and his three mates to hold on for dear life. Carnacki is forced to shut his machine off.\n\nPredictably, there is a booming of thunder, and a furious storm starts raging. Towards morning, the storm calms, and soon after, the ''Jarvee'' is running before a strong wind\u2014but a leak has been sprung, and two days after, they are forced to abandon ship and take to the boats.\n\nThe ''Jarvee'' sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nAfter he finishes his tale, Dodgson, the narrator asks what caused the haunting. Carnacki then explains his theory of \"focuses\", saying that the ''Jarvee'', for whatever reason, be it the particular mood a builder was in as he hammered a nail home, or the tree that makes up a certain board, was a focal point for \"attractive vibrations\". He summarises by saying that it is impossible for him to know fully why the ''Jarvee'' was being haunted, and he could only make suppositions.\n\n=== \"The Find\" ===\nCarnacki investigates a seemingly impossible book forgery. It is the only Carnacki story without any hint of the supernatural.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n===Television===\n\"The Horse of the Invisible\" was adapted as an episode of the 1970s British TV series, ''[[The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes (television series)|The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes]]''.\n\n'''Cast'''\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Carnacki\n* [[Tony Steedman]] as Captain Hisgins\n* [[Michele Dotrice]] as Mary Hisgins\n* Michael Johnson as Charles Beaumont\n* [[Geoffrey Whitehead]] as Harry Parsket\n* Aim\u00e9e Delamain as Miss Hisgins\n* [[Arthur White (actor)|Arthur White]] as March\n\n===Audio===\n[[Big Finish Productions]] has recorded six of the stories in unabridged audiobook format. The stories adapted are:\n*The Gateway of the Monster\n*The House Among the Laurels\n*The Whistling Room\n*The Horse of the Invisible\n*The Searcher of the End House\n*The Thing Invisible\n\n'''Cast'''\n*[[Dan Starkey (actor)|Dan Starkey]] as Carnacki\n*[[Joseph Kloska]] as Dodgson\n\n== Carnacki stories by other authors ==\n\n=== \"Carnacki: Recorder of Things Strange\" ===\nA graphic novel adaptation and continuation of the story of Thomas Carnacki called \"Carnacki: Recorder of Things Strange\" is currently in the works, fully inspired by the original stories written by William Hope Hodgson. The adventures of Thomas Carnacki will be told in short story format steeped in weird fiction, folklore, ghost stories, mythology and symbolism. The graphic novel is written and illustrated by [https://mscorley.com/About M. S. Corley] who regularly shares his working process on his project's page [https://www.patreon.com/hollowowl/posts?sort=published_at&tag=Carnacki \"Carnacki: Recorder of Things Strange\"]\n\n=== ''472 Cheyne Walk'' ===\nThe book ''No. 472 Cheyne Walk: Carnacki, the Untold Stories'' by A. F. Kidd and [[Rick Kennett]] collects twelve stories written about the further adventures of Carnacki. Four of these stories were originally published as a 32-page booklet of the same title in 1992. The book version was printed in a limited edition of 500 copies.\n\nMany of these stories are inspired by off-hand references to other cases of hauntings that Carnacki makes in his stories, which were never explained further in the original story series. In their introduction to the 1992 booklet the authors describe these stories as [[pastiche]], in the sense of respectful imitation or homage, as opposed to [[parody]], which mocks the original (either with respectful humour, or more viciously). The authors suggest that Hodgson, by having Carnacki casually drop references to other cases which he himself did not write about, \"invited\" his readers to enter the \"shared universe\" and pick up where he left off. Readers may decide for themselves whether to consider these stories \"canon\" or a legitimate part of the Carnacki story arc; they closely follow not only the basic framework structure of the Carnacki original stories but also Hodgson's style and vocabulary.\n\n==== \"The Darkness\" ====\nIn \"The Gateway of the Monster\" and \"The Horse of the Invisible\", Carnacki makes passing references to the \"Black Veil case\", in which a man named Aster died because he did not accept the necessity of staying inside the protective pentacle. In \"The Darkness\", Aster is a reporter who accompanies Hodgson on his investigation of a haunted room. An apparition of a mysterious woman can be seen in the window and a rotting black veil is found inside a secret compartment in a window-seat. Carnacki burns the veil inside a pentacle in the hopes of ending the haunting. However, as night falls, Aster will not enter the pentacle, believing this to be superstitious nonsense. Both men lose the power of sight as the apparition manifests, and Carnacki must listen helplessly from inside the pentacle as Aster is driven into screaming madness and death. No option remains to end the haunting but to destroy the house itself.\n\n==== \"Matheson's Inheritance\" ====\nIn \"The Gateway of the Monster\" Carnacki makes reference to the \"Noving Fur\" case. It is unclear if this is a typographical error and Hodgson intended \"Moving Fur\" instead; the ''Collected Fiction'' edition and the [[Project Gutenberg]] electronic text show this correction. \"Matheson's Inheritance\" covers both bases by including moving fur and placing the haunting in Noving House in Wales.\n\nMatheson has inherited a baroque mansion. Local legend says the house was once occupied by a ''dewi'' (wizard) and his familiar an [[afanc]]. One room in the house emanates dread. Carnacki and Matheson can find no natural explanation, and so Carnacki spends the night in the room, inside his protective [[pentacle]]. In the middle of his vigil his candle flames suddenly turn black, and the floor becomes a heaving carpet of fur, as if the pentacle was upon the back of a giant animal. It is clear that the protective barrier has failed utterly. As in \"The Whistling Room\", a second powerful entity intervenes and the candle flames turn blue; Carnacki is given a moment to escape the room, and does so, although his pantlegs are torn and his legs covered with cuts. In daylight, strange, ancient bones are found under the floorboards of the room; before the room can be demolished, that wing of the mansion burns.\n\nThe blue candle flames point Carnacki back to references to the protective powers of colours in the Sigsand manuscript, suggesting the origin of the coloured tubes that appear in Hodgson's Carnacki story \"The Hog\". The afanc is described as having a horse-like head; this description does not match the Welsh myth, and so may be a reference to \"The Horse of the Invisible\".\n\n[[William Hope Hodgson#Motifs in Hodgson's Work|Motifs]]: a legend; a protective pentacle; a supernatural manifestation; protection from one supernatural entity by another, more powerful one; a creature or creatures unknown to science; a vigil.\n\n=== \"Doctor Who: Foreign Devils\" ===\n{{Main|Foreign Devils (novella)}}\nIn 2002, an [[Andrew Cartmel]] novella appeared as one of [[Telos Doctor Who novellas|a series]] based upon ''[[Doctor Who]]''. ''[[Foreign Devils (novella)|Foreign Devils]]'' featured Carnacki alongside the [[Second Doctor]] as his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]].\n\n=== ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' ===\n{{Main|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen}}\n\nIn 2007 a graphic novel entitled ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'' was released, written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]. It is part of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' series, and is the first release to feature Thomas Carnacki. Carnacki is a member of the 1910s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, with [[Mina Harker|Wilhelmina Murray]], [[Allan Quatermain]], [[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]], and [[A. J. Raffles]]. The ''Black Dossier'' is filled with non-comic pieces, taking the form of prose stories, letters, maps, guidebooks, magazines and even a lost Shakespeare folio. Carnacki features most prominently in a short story \"What Ho, Gods of the Abyss\" and concerns a visit by [[Jeeves]] and [[Bertie Wooster]] (by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]) to Wooster's [[Aunt Dahlia]] wherein they encounter an [[Elder Thing]], along with a [[Mi-go]] and a [[Cthulhu]] cult. Carnacki is described as being \"an older man...who seemed to be regarded by the others as an expert on the sort of business going on within my aunt's estate.\" After questioning Wooster closely he performs a ritual banishing of the Elder Thing with the help of his team. In another section of the ''Black Dossier'' entitled \"The Sincerest Form of Flattery\" it is mentioned that Carnacki \"had encounters with some form of spirit that allowed him brief, fragmentary visions of the future\" regarding an attempt to derail the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. Due to ill health following his visions of World War I, Carnacki did not participate in the League's battle with ''Les Hommes Mysterieux'', and had by 1937 retired from active duty.\n\nReleased in 2009, Part I of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century]]'' entitled \"What Keeps Mankind Alive\" features Carnacki as a main character. Set in 1910, following his visions of a black cabal, Carnacki brings Mina Harker, Allan Quatermain, Orlando, and A.J. Raffles to an occult club which is populated by a range of fictional occult detectives looking for clues as to the cabal. This leads them to investigate and confront the cabal led by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s [[Aleister Crowley]] analogue, Oliver Haddo. Carnacki suspects that they are trying to end the world by creating a [[Moonchild (novel)|Moonchild]].\n\n=== Audience with the Ghost Finder ===\n{{Main|Audience with the Ghost Finder}}\n''Audience with the Ghost Finder'', a stage play by M. J. Starling, features Carnacki and Dodgson as main characters.  Though the story is original, the play is an explicit homage to Hodgson's stories, several of which are directly referenced by the characters - most notably ''The Horse of the Invisible'', the events of which form part of the backstory. The play also borrows imagery from H. P. Lovecraft's story ''The Dreams in the Witch-House''.\n\n''Audience with the Ghost Finder'' was first performed by Blackshaw Theatre in May 2013, at the Wandsworth Arts Festival and Fringe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackshawonline.com/waff/|work=Blackshaw Theatre|title=Wandsworth Arts Festival & Fringe 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305155122/http://www.blackshawonline.com/waff|archivedate=5 March 2013}}</ref> It was revived in October 2013 as part of the London Horror Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonhorrorfestival.com/whats-on/an-audience-with-the-ghost-finder/|work=London Horror Festival|title=an audience with the ghost finder|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917045544/http://www.londonhorrorfestival.com/whats-on/an-audience-with-the-ghost-finder/|archivedate=17 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Diogenes Club ===\n[[Kim Newman]] has written a number of short stories about [[the Diogenes Club]], as originally from the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. In Newman's setting, the Club investigates paranormal and occult matters for British intelligence and police agencies. In the stories \"The Man Who Got Off The Ghost Train\" and \"Swellhead\", it is mentioned that Carnacki was a member of the Diogenes Club as a special occult investigator; when he retired, his position was taken by Newman's character [[Richard Jeperson]]. Carnacki is also mentioned as having investigated several cases alongside [[Sherlock Holmes]].\n\n=== Carnacki in the Cthulhu Mythos ===\n[[Barbara Hambly]]'s short story \"The Adventure of the Antiquarian's Niece\" (from ''[[Shadows Over Baker Street]]'') and A. F. Kidd's short story \"The Grantchester Grimoire\" (from ''[[Gaslight Grimoire]]'') both also feature Carnacki aiding Sherlock Holmes in an investigation of an occult matter.\n\n=== \"A Forgotten Caudetan Incident\" ===\nSpanish author [[Alberto L\u00f3pez Aroca]] wrote the short story \"''Un olvidado episodio caudetano''\" (\"A Forgotten Caudetan Incident\"), included in the book ''Los Espectros Conjurados'' ({{ISBN|978-84-607-9866-8}}), featuring Carnacki in a Spanish village, [[Caudete]]; and by the same author, \"''Algunos derivados del alquitr\u00e1n''\" (\"Some Coal-tar Derivatives\"), included in the volume ''Sherlock Holmes y lo Outr\u00e9'' -Publisher: Academia de Mitolog\u00eda Creativa Jules Verne de Albacete, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stardustcf.com/libroindiv.asp?libro=1418 |title=STARDUST.

Carnacki appears as an old man in another work by L\u00f3pez Aroca, ''Necronomic\u00f3n Z'' (Ediciones Dolmen, 2012; {{ISBN|978-84-15296-59-1}}), a [[Cthulhu Mythos]] novel.\n\n=== Gravel ===\nIn 2008, the comic publisher [[Avatar Press|Avatar]] started serialising ''[[Gravel (comics)|Gravel]]'', the ongoing adventures of [[Warren Ellis]]' and [[Mike Wolfer]]'s combat magician William Gravel (previously told in the ''Strange Kisses'', ''Stranger Kisses'' and the ''Strange Killings'' [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]]). In the first storyline of the ongoing ''Gravel'' comic, Ellis and Wolfer had the \"Sigsand manuscript\", split in parts for each of the \"Minor Seven\" (Britain's occult detectives). In his quest for revenge for having been ousted from the group, Gravel must collect each magician's piece of the manuscript, but spends most of the third issue hearing about Thomas Carnacki (including an extended homage to \"The Whistling Room\" and the particular writing style Hodgson used when writing the Carnacki stories).\n\nPreviously, Warren Ellis had included the Sigsand Manuscript in the 13th issue of his ongoing ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' series. It is picked up by [[Elijah Snow]] from Sherlock Holmes' book shelf.\n\n=== Sherlock Holmes: The Breath of God ===\n{{Main|Sherlock Holmes: The Breath of God}}\nIn 2012, a [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|Sherlock Holmes pastiche]] novel by [[Guy Adams]] was published that featured Carnacki.\n\n=== Parodies ===\n[[David Langford]]'s 1988 parody collection ''[[He Do The Time Police In Different Voices|The Dragonhiker's Guide to Battlefield Covenant at Dune's Edge: Odyssey Two]]'' contains a parody of \"The Gateway of the Monster\", in which the creature manifests not as a human hand, but as another body part entirely.\n\n[[Rick Kennett]] has also written a parody of \"The Whistling Room\" called \"The Sniffling Room\", published in ''The Goblin Muse'', April 2000. In this brief story, rather than receiving an invitation and then eagerly attending Carnacki's storytelling evenings, the attending gentlemen are instead kidnapped, dragged to Carnacki's home, and forced to listen against their will to a tale told by a man they consider to be a raving lunatic. It thus mocks primarily the common ''framework'' of the Carnacki stories, rather than Carnacki's actual investigation.\n\nThe French writer G\u00e9rard D\u00f4le has published a volume of parodies of Carnacki, in which he encounters the likes of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[S\u00e2r Dubnotal]] while two other French writers, Fabrice Colin and Andr\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois Ruaud have given to Thomas Carnacki a nephew, William Carnacki, reporting to his uncle the life in a parallel world where most monsters do exist (children book ''Le Livre des monstres\u2014Chroniques du monde noir'', 2008).\n\n[[Anton LaVey]], founder and High Priest of the [[Church of Satan]], named his son \"Satan Xerxes Carnacki LaVey\".\n\n===The Adventure of the Haunted Library===\n\n[[August Derleth]], whose [[Arkham House]] publishing firm issued the first American (and first expanded edition) of ''Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder'', pays affectionate tribute to the character in one of his [[Solar Pons]] stories. While Carnacki does not actually appear in the story, it is mentioned several times in \"The Adventure of the Haunted Library\" (which appears in ''[[The Casebook of Solar Pons]]'' (1965)) that Carnacki was called in to investigate the case, but having been unable to solve it, thereafter referred it to Solar Pons.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Occult detective fiction]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist |25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Leigh Blackmore]]. \"Things Invisible: Human and 'Ab-Human' in Two of Hodgson's Carnacki Stories\".

The diocese forms part of the [[ecclesiastical province]] of [[Ecclesiastical province of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]], and is thus [[suffragan]] to the [[Archdiocese of Zaragoza]].\n\nIn 1912 the diocese of Teruel comprised the [[Provinces of Spain|civil province]] of the [[Teruel (province)|same name]], excepting the town of [[Bechi]] ([[Castell\u00f3n (province)|Castell\u00f3n]]).\n\nAll the churches of Teruel are contemporary with its foundation (1176), as the founders built nine churches, one, [[Santa Maria de Mediavilla]], in the centre, and the remaining eight in a circle following the circuit of the walls. The central church was made a collegiate church in 1423 and named the cathedral in 1577. It was originally built of brick and rubblework, but since the restoration in the seventeenth century it has lost its primitive character. The Doric choir stalls were the gift of [[Mart\u00edn Terrer de Valenzuela]], Bishop of Teruel, and later of [[Diocese of Tarazona|Tarazona]].\n\n==History==\n===[[Roman Empire|Roman]] period===\nIt is believed by some that [[Teruel]] and the ancient ''Turba'' are the same. ''Turba'' was the city whose disputes with the [[Sagunt]]ines gave [[Hannibal]] an excuse for attacking ''[[Saguntum]]'' and beginning the [[Second Punic War]]. According to the annals of Teruel it appears that ''Turba'' was not situated on the site of the present city of Teruel, but at its boundary line.\n\n===Middle Ages (1176\u20131577)===\nTeruel was founded in 1176 by [[Sancho S\u00e1nchez Mu\u00f1oz]] and [[Blasco Garc\u00e9s Marcilla]]. It formed a separate community and was governed by the [[Fuero de Sep\u00falveda]].\n\nKing [[James I of Aragon|Jaime I]] received its support in the conquest of [[Valencia (taifa)|Valencia]] (1238), and the standards of Teruel were the first to wave in the gateway of Serranos. In 1271 it joined in the war against [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], invaded [[Huete]] and [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]].\n\nTeruel sided with king [[Peter IV of Aragon|Pedro IV]] in his war against the \"Union\". In recognition of this the king visited the city in 1348 and conferred upon it the title of exenta (exempt).\n\n[[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] visited Teruel in 1482, took the oath in the cathedral, and received the freedom of the city. The founding of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] in 1484 produced serious changes because the [[Converso|converts]] were numerous and powerful. The inquisitor, [[Juan de Solivellia]], was forced to leave. Property to the amount of 133,000 sueldos was confiscated and turned over to the city.\n\n===Diocese of Teruel (1577\u20131851)===\n[[Pope Gregory XIII]] at the earnest solicitations of king [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] created the diocese in 1577. The first bishop, [[Juan P\u00e9rez de Artieda]], was elected but not consecrated; the first bishop installed was [[Andr\u00e9s Santos de Sampedro]], who was transferred to [[Archdiocese of Zaragoza|Saragossa]] in 1579.\n\nIn 1598 the inhabitants of Teruel abjured the [[Fuero de Sep\u00falveda]] before the [[courts of Aragon]], in order to come under the Government of [[Aragon]].\n\nThe [[seminary]], dedicated to St. Toribio de Mogrovejo, was founded by the bishop [[Francisco Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Chico]], who after the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1769 was granted the use of their magnificent college by king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]. During the [[Peninsular War|wars of independence]] and the civil wars that followed, the building was taken over for military quarters and shortly afterwards the seminary was suppressed. It was re-established in 1849 by Don [[Antonio Lao y Cuevas]], who gave his own palace for the purpose. The Jesuit college has since been restored to the order.\n[[Image:Albarrac\u00edn - Vista02.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Cathedral of [[Albarrac\u00edn]]]]\nAmong the distinguished citizens of Teruel must be

Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016</ref>\n\n==Episcopal see==\nThe city of [[Tarazona]] is situated on a commanding point, surrounded by a beautiful open plain, through which the river [[Queiles]] flows.\n\n==Cathedral==\n{{main|Cathedral of Tarazona}}\nThe '''Church of the Magdalene''' was the ancient cathedral, but the [[Moors]], objecting to its prominent position, compelled them to use a church on the outskirts of the town. In the records left by Miguel this was variously called Santa Maria de la Hidria, de la Vega, or de la Huerta, on account of its position. It was endowed by Teresa Cajal, mother of [[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s]] and wife of Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, and was begun in 1152. Architecturally it is a combination of Byzantine and Gothic, with a high portico entrance and a high brick-trimmed tower. The centre nave with its pointed arches rises above the side aisles and merges into a spacious transept. In the windows Gothic gives place to [[Plateresque]], but in the side chapels dedicated to [[St. Lawrence]], [[St. Andrew]], the [[Rosary]], [[St. Peter]], the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist]], the [[Annunciation]], St. [[Elizabeth of Portugal]], the [[Purification of the Virgin|Purification]] and [[St. James the Great]], Gothic prevails in the [[reredos]] and tombs. Bishop Moncada attempted to rebuild the beautiful cloister which had been destroyed in the [[War of the Two Peters]], but as late as 1529 this had not been completed.\n\n==Other churches==\nBesides the Church of the Magdalene, the '''Church of St. Michael''', with its simple Gothic nave, and that of the Conception nuns, are also notable.\n\nThe '''Church of St. Francis''' is said to have been founded by Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] himself in 1214, and [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]] was consecrated archbishop of [[Archdiocese of Toledo|Toledo]] in the Chapel of La Piedad in 1495.\n\nThe '''episcopal palace''', the ancient Azuda, is built upon a commanding eminence and has a beautiful view. Bishop [[Pedro P\u00e9rez Calvillo]] purchased this from the Aragonese governor, [[Jord\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Urries]], in 1386, and entailed it to the bishopric.\n\nThe '''diocesan seminary''', dedicated to [[Gaudiosus of Tarazona|St. Gaudiosus]], was founded in 1593 by Bishop [[Pedro Cerbuna]]. It has recently been extensively renovated.\n\nMention should be made of the monastery of [[Veruela Abbey|Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Veruela]], a [[Cistercian]] abbey founded by [[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s]], and now a [[Jesuit]] [[novitiate]]; also of the Church of Borja, ranking as a [[collegiate church]] since the time of [[Pope Nicholas V]] (1449), favoured and protected by [[Pope Alexander VI]]; and of the ancient collegiate church of Calatayud, Santa Maria de Mediavilla, whose [[prior]]s ranked as mitred [[Dean (religion)|deans]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman period===\nTuriaso was one of the principal towns of the ancient [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] province, and within the confines of the diocese are found many very ancient cities: Bilbilis ([[Calatayud]]); Aquae Bilbilitanorum ([[Alhama de Arag\u00f3n|Alhama]]); Atacum ([[Ateca]]); Augustobriga ([[Muro de \u00c1greda|Muro]]); Boverca ([[Buvierca]]); Bursao ([[Borja, Spain|Borja]]); Cascantum ([[Cascante]]); Gracuris ([[Corella, Spain|Corella]]); Mon\u00f3briga ([[Mun\u00e9brega]]); and Vergegium ([[Verdejo]]). [[Pliny the Elder]] numbers [[Tarazona]] among the principal cities of the Celtiberians, and its inhabitants had the privileges of citizenship. Its coat of arms bore the motto \"Tubal-Cain built me and Hercules rebuilt me\".\n\nNothing definite is known of the origin of Christianity in Tarazona. Owing to its proximity to [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]] it is supposed that it was visited at an early date by the disciples of [[Saint James the Great]], but until the 5th century there is no reliable mention of a [[bishop]] of Tarazona.\n\n===[[Visigoth]] period (5th to 7th centuries)===\nThe chronicler [[Idatius]] names Leo as bishop in 449; the chronological list of bishops gives St. Prudentius, but the history of this saint is uncertain. The [[Tarazona Breviary]] gives 390 as his date, but other sources place him as late as the 9th century. Idatius says that Leo was killed in an uprising led by a certain Basilius where the [[Bagandae]] took refuge in the cathedral, and in which a great number were killed.\n\n[[Gaudiosus of Tarazona|St. Gaudiosus]], a former monk of the Monastery of Asanense and a disciple of St. Victorian(us), was bishop in 530. He worked against the [[Arianism|Arians]], and died in his native city, [[Escoron]]. His remains were translated to the Monastery of Asanense, and King [[Sancho Ramirez]] had them removed to Montearag\u00f3n.\n\n[[St. Braulius]], in his life of St. Emilianus, speaks of a Didymus, Bishop of Tarazona. A Bishop Stephen assisted at the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589) and at the [[Second Council of Zaragoza]] (592); Floridius assisted at the [[Council of Gundemar]] (611); Elpidius, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo|Fourth]] and [[Fifth Council of Toledo]] (633 and 636); Antherius (683) sent a [[deacon]] to represent him at the [[Thirteenth Council of Toledo]] (683); and Nepotianus assisted at the [[Fifteenth Council of Toledo|Fifteenth]] and [[Seventeenth Council of Toledo]] (688 and 694). He seems to have been the last bishop of the Visigothic epoch.\n\n===Moorish period (early 8th century \u2013 1119)===\nWhen the [[Moors]] took Tarazona they were able to hold it for a long time on account of its fortified position near the [[Sierra del Moncayo]], between the [[Douro]] and the [[Ebro]] rivers. The names of its [[Mozarabic]] bishops have not come down to us, although it is very probable there were such; on the other hand we know of the Mozarabic saints, [[St. Attilanus]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zamora in Spain|Bishop of Zamora]] and St. I\u00f1igo of Calatayud.\n\n===After the [[Reconquista|Reconquest]] (1119\u2013today)===\nKing [[Alfonso I of Aragon|Alfonso I]] ''the Battler'' of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] took possession of Tarazona in 1119, and named [[Miguel Cornel]] as bishop. King [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], in an effort to get possession of Tarazona, intruded a certain de Bujedo into the see; but de Bujedo repented shortly afterwards, restored the see to its rightful owner, Miguel, and retired to the Monastery of Valpuesta.\n\nThe [[Council of Burgos]], which was convened in 1139, and was presided over by the legate Guido, took from the jurisdiction of Tarazona most of the towns of [[Soria (province)|Soria]], but bestowed in its place the [[Archdeaconry]] of [[Calatayud]].\n\nMiguel Cornel was the real restorer of the see. He governed for thirty-three years (1118\u20131151), and established the [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]] of Tarazona, Calatayud, and [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], under the [[Rule of St. Augustine]]. In his time also were founded the Monasteries of [[Monastery of Fitero|Fitero]] and [[Royal Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Veruela|Veruela]].\n\nThree bishops of the name of Frontin succeeded him: Juan (1173\u20131194); Garcia, who was present at the [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212), and Garcia II, the counsellor of [[James I of Aragon|James the Conqueror]] (''el Conquistador''). In a species of national council held at Tarazona, the marriage of [[James I of Aragon|James]] to Leonor of Castile was declared null on account of the relationship existing between them.

Tarazona was laid waste and its cathedral desecrated by the Castilians.

Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016</ref>\n\n==Episcopal see==\nThe city of [[Tarazona]] is situated on a commanding point, surrounded by a beautiful open plain, through which the river [[Queiles]] flows.\n\n==Cathedral==\n{{main article|Cathedral of Tarazona}}\nThe '''Church of the Magdalene''' was the ancient cathedral, but the [[Moors]], objecting to its prominent position, compelled them to use a church on the outskirts of the town. In the records left by Miguel this was variously called Santa Maria de la Hidria, de la Vega, or de la Huerta, on account of its position. It was endowed by Teresa Cajal, mother of [[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s]] and wife of Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, and was begun in 1152. Architecturally it is a combination of Byzantine and Gothic, with a high portico entrance and a high brick-trimmed tower. The centre nave with its pointed arches rises above the side aisles and merges into a spacious transept. In the windows Gothic gives place to [[Plateresque]], but in the side chapels dedicated to [[St. Lawrence]], [[St. Andrew]], the [[Rosary]], [[St. Peter]], the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist]], the [[Annunciation]], St. [[Elizabeth of Portugal]], the [[Purification of the Virgin|Purification]] and [[St. James the Great]], Gothic prevails in the [[reredos]] and tombs. Bishop Moncada attempted to rebuild the beautiful cloister which had been destroyed in the [[War of the Two Peters]], but as late as 1529 this had not been completed.\n\n==Other churches==\nBesides the Church of the Magdalene, the '''Church of St. Michael''', with its simple Gothic nave, and that of the Conception nuns, are also notable.\n\nThe '''Church of St. Francis''' is said to have been founded by Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] himself in 1214, and [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]] was consecrated archbishop of [[Archdiocese of Toledo|Toledo]] in the Chapel of La Piedad in 1495.\n\nThe '''episcopal palace''', the ancient Azuda, is built upon a commanding eminence and has a beautiful view. Bishop [[Pedro P\u00e9rez Calvillo]] purchased this from the Aragonese governor, [[Jord\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Urries]], in 1386, and entailed it to the bishopric.\n\nThe '''diocesan seminary''', dedicated to [[Gaudiosus of Tarazona|St. Gaudiosus]], was founded in 1593 by Bishop [[Pedro Cerbuna]]. It has recently been extensively renovated.\n\nMention should be made of the monastery of [[Veruela Abbey|Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Veruela]], a [[Cistercian]] abbey founded by [[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s]], and now a [[Jesuit]] [[novitiate]]; also of the Church of Borja, ranking as a [[collegiate church]] since the time of [[Pope Nicholas V]] (1449), favoured and protected by [[Pope Alexander VI]]; and of the ancient collegiate church of Calatayud, Santa Maria de Mediavilla, whose [[prior]]s ranked as mitred [[Dean (religion)|deans]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman period===\nTuriaso was one of the principal towns of the ancient [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] province, and within the confines of the diocese are found many very ancient cities: Bilbilis ([[Calatayud]]); Aquae Bilbilitanorum ([[Alhama de Arag\u00f3n|Alhama]]); Atacum ([[Ateca]]); Augustobriga ([[Muro de \u00c1greda|Muro]]); Boverca ([[Buvierca]]); Bursao ([[Borja, Spain|Borja]]); Cascantum ([[Cascante]]); Gracuris ([[Corella, Spain|Corella]]); Mon\u00f3briga ([[Mun\u00e9brega]]); and Vergegium ([[Verdejo]]). [[Pliny the Elder]] numbers [[Tarazona]] among the principal cities of the Celtiberians, and its inhabitants had the privileges of citizenship. Its coat of arms bore the motto \"Tubal-Cain built me and Hercules rebuilt me\".\n\nNothing definite is known of the origin of Christianity in Tarazona. Owing to its proximity to [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]] it is supposed that it was visited at an early date by the disciples of [[Saint James the Great]], but until the 5th century there is no reliable mention of a [[bishop]] of Tarazona.\n\n===[[Visigoth]] period (5th to 7th centuries)===\nThe chronicler [[Idatius]] names Leo as bishop in 449; the chronological list of bishops gives St. Prudentius, but the history of this saint is uncertain. The [[Tarazona Breviary]] gives 390 as his date, but other sources place him as late as the 9th century. Idatius says that Leo was killed in an uprising led by a certain Basilius where the [[Bagandae]] took refuge in the cathedral, and in which a great number were killed.\n\n[[Gaudiosus of Tarazona|St. Gaudiosus]], a former monk of the Monastery of Asanense and a disciple of St. Victorian(us), was bishop in 530. He worked against the [[Arianism|Arians]], and died in his native city, [[Escoron]]. His remains were translated to the Monastery of Asanense, and King [[Sancho Ramirez]] had them removed to Montearag\u00f3n.\n\n[[St. Braulius]], in his life of St. Emilianus, speaks of a Didymus, Bishop of Tarazona. A Bishop Stephen assisted at the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589) and at the [[Second Council of Zaragoza]] (592); Floridius assisted at the [[Council of Gundemar]] (611); Elpidius, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo|Fourth]] and [[Fifth Council of Toledo]] (633 and 636); Antherius (683) sent a [[deacon]] to represent him at the [[Thirteenth Council of Toledo]] (683); and Nepotianus assisted at the [[Fifteenth Council of Toledo|Fifteenth]] and [[Seventeenth Council of Toledo]] (688 and 694). He seems to have been the last bishop of the Visigothic epoch.\n\n===Moorish period (early 8th century \u2013 1119)===\nWhen the [[Moors]] took Tarazona they were able to hold it for a long time on account of its fortified position near the [[Sierra del Moncayo]], between the [[Douro]] and the [[Ebro]] rivers. The names of its [[Mozarabic]] bishops have not come down to us, although it is very probable there were such; on the other hand we know of the Mozarabic saints, [[St. Attilanus]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zamora in Spain|Bishop of Zamora]] and St. I\u00f1igo of Calatayud.\n\n===After the [[Reconquista|Reconquest]] (1119\u2013today)===\nKing [[Alfonso I of Aragon|Alfonso I]] ''the Battler'' of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] took possession of Tarazona in 1119, and named [[Miguel Cornel]] as bishop. King [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], in an effort to get possession of Tarazona, intruded a certain de Bujedo into the see; but de Bujedo repented shortly afterwards, restored the see to its rightful owner, Miguel, and retired to the Monastery of Valpuesta.\n\nThe [[Council of Burgos]], which was convened in 1139, and was presided over by the legate Guido, took from the jurisdiction of Tarazona most of the towns of [[Soria (province)|Soria]], but bestowed in its place the [[Archdeaconry]] of [[Calatayud]].\n\nMiguel Cornel was the real restorer of the see. He governed for thirty-three years (1118\u20131151), and established the [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]] of Tarazona, Calatayud, and [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], under the [[Rule of St. Augustine]]. In his time also were founded the Monasteries of [[Monastery of Fitero|Fitero]] and [[Royal Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Veruela|Veruela]].\n\nThree bishops of the name of Frontin succeeded him: Juan (1173\u20131194); Garcia, who was present at the [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212), and Garcia II, the counsellor of [[James I of Aragon|James the Conqueror]] (''el Conquistador''). In a species of national council held at Tarazona, the marriage of [[James I of Aragon|James]] to Leonor of Castile was declared null on account of the relationship existing between them.

It is bounded on the north by [[Soria]], on the east by [[Zaragoza]] and [[Teruel]], on the south by [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]] and on the west by [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]] and [[Segovia]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe diocese was established in 589 AD: the fictitious chronicles pretended that [[Sacerdos of Limoges|St. Sacerdos]] of [[Limoges]] in France had been its bishop; Protogenes was present as Bishop of Sig\u00fcenza at the [[Third Council of Toledo]] and again the same Protogenes at [[Gundemar's council]] in 610; Ilsidclus assisted at the fourth, fifth and sixth councils; Wideric, at the seventh to the tenth; Egica, at the eleventh; Ela, at the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth; Gunderic, at the fifteenth and sixteenth. The succession of bishops continued under the Arab domination: after [[Eulogius (disambiguation)|St. Eulogius]], in 851, we find there Sisemund, a man of great sagacity. But later on Sig\u00fcenza was so completely depopulated that it does not appear among the cities conquered by [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] (1065-1109) when he subdued all this region. The first bishop of Sig\u00fcenza, after it had been repeopled, was Bernardo, a native of [[Agen]] in France, who had been \"capisol\" (''caput schola'', Latin for school head(master)) of Toledo; he rebuilt the church and consecrated it on the Feast of St. Stephen, 1123, and placed in it a chapter of [[canons regular]]; he died Bishop-elect of Santiago. On 14 March 1140, [[Alfonso VII]] granted the bishop the feudal lordship of Sig\u00fcenza, which his successors retained until the fourteenth century, making the diocese a minor [[prince-bishop]]ric.\n\nAfter the long episcopate of Bernardo, Pedro succeeded, and was succeeded by Cerebruno, who began the building of the new cathedral. Jocelin, an Englishman, was present with the king at the conquest of Cuenca; he was succeeded by Arderico, who was transferred to [[Palencia]]; Mart\u00edn de Hinojosa, the holy [[Abbot of Huerta]], abdicated the see in 1192, and was succeeded by Rodrigo.\n\nIn 1465 Diego L\u00f3pez of Madrid, having usurped the [[mitre]], fortified himself there. [[Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza]], the [[Crown Cardinal]] of Spain, held this diocese together with the archbishopric of Toledo, and enriched his relations by providing establishments for them at Sig\u00fcenza. His successor, Cardinal [[Bernardino de Carvajal]], was dispossessed as a [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] by [[pope Julius II]] for his share in the [[Conciliabulum of Pisa]]. Bishop of Sig\u00fcenza [[Fadrique de Portugal y Noro\u00f1a]] became in the first third of the 16th Century, [[Archbishop of Zaragoza]] and [[Viceroy of Catalonia]]. Bishops [[Garcia de Loaisa]], [[Fernando de Vald\u00e9s y Salas]], Pedro Paeheco and others held this wealthy see. The castle-palace, modified in various ways, suffered much from the storms of civil war, and was restored by Joaquin Fernandez Cortina, who was bishop from 1848, and the restoration was continued by Bishop Gomez Salazar (1876\u201379).\n\nIn 1959 it was established as '''Diocese of Sig\u00fcenza-Guadalajara'''.\n\n==Ordinaries==\n*Rodrigo (1192\u20131221 Died)\n*Juan (3 Jun 1300 \u2013 )\n*Arnaldo (17 Nov 1326 \u2013 1328 Died)\n*Blasco D\u00e1vila (1340\u20131341 Died)\n*Lope Rodrigo de Villalobos (29 Oct 1382 \u2013 21 Jun 1386 Died)\n*Juan de Serrano (22 Dec 1389 \u2013 24 Feb 1402 Died)\n*Juan Gonzalez Fernandez de Illescas (30 Jul 1403 \u2013 15 Nov 1415 Died)\n*[[Pedro da Fonseca (cardinal)|Pedro da Fonseca]] (6 Jun 1419 \u2013 22 Aug 1422 Died)\n*[[Alfonso Carrillo de Albornoz]] (17 Sep 1422 \u2013 14 Mar 1434 Died)\n*[[Fernando Lujan (bishop)]] (17 Mar 1449 \u2013 1465 Died)\n*[[Juan de Mella]] (20 May 1465 \u2013 12 Oct 1467 Died)\n*[[Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza]] (30 Oct 1467 \u2013 11 Jan 1495 Died)<ref name=CathHierPedroMendoza>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bgondmep.html \"Pedro Cardinal Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza\"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''.

It is bounded on the north by [[Soria]], on the east by [[Zaragoza]] and [[Teruel]], on the south by [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]] and on the west by [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]] and [[Segovia]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe diocese was established in 589 AD: the fictitious chronicles pretended that [[Sacerdos of Limoges|St. Sacerdos]] of [[Limoges]] in France had been its bishop; Protogenes was present as Bishop of Sig\u00fcenza at the [[Third Council of Toledo]] and again the same Protogenes at [[Gundemar's council]] in 610; Ilsidclus assisted at the fourth, fifth and sixth councils; Wideric, at the seventh to the tenth; Egica, at the eleventh; Ela, at the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth; Gunderic, at the fifteenth and sixteenth. The succession of bishops continued under the Arab domination: after [[Eulogius (disambiguation)|St. Eulogius]], in 851, we find there Sisemund, a man of great sagacity. But later on Sig\u00fcenza was so completely depopulated that it does not appear among the cities conquered by [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] (1065-1109) when he subdued all this region. The first bishop of Sig\u00fcenza, after it had been repeopled, was Bernardo, a native of [[Agen]] in France, who had been \"capisol\" (''caput schola'', Latin for school head(master)) of Toledo; he rebuilt the church and consecrated it on the Feast of St. Stephen, 1123, and placed in it a chapter of [[canons regular]]; he died Bishop-elect of Santiago. On 14 March 1140, [[Alfonso VII]] granted the bishop the feudal lordship of Sig\u00fcenza, which his successors retained until the fourteenth century, making the diocese a minor [[prince-bishop]]ric.\n\nAfter the long episcopate of Bernardo, Pedro succeeded, and was succeeded by Cerebruno, who began the building of the new cathedral. Jocelin, an Englishman, was present with the king at the conquest of Cuenca; he was succeeded by Arderico, who was transferred to [[Palencia]]; Mart\u00edn de Hinojosa, the holy [[Abbot of Huerta]], abdicated the see in 1192, and was succeeded by Rodrigo.\n\nIn 1465 Diego L\u00f3pez of Madrid, having usurped the [[mitre]], fortified himself there. [[Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza]], the [[Crown Cardinal]] of Spain, held this diocese together with the archbishopric of Toledo, and enriched his relations by providing establishments for them at Sig\u00fcenza. His successor, Cardinal [[Bernardino de Carvajal]], was dispossessed as a [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] by [[pope Julius II]] for his share in the [[Conciliabulum of Pisa]]. Bishop of Sig\u00fcenza [[Fadrique de Portugal y Noro\u00f1a]] became in the first third of the 16th Century, [[Archbishop of Zaragoza]] and [[Viceroy of Catalonia]]. Bishops [[Garcia de Loaisa]], [[Fernando de Vald\u00e9s y Salas]], Pedro Paeheco and others held this wealthy see. The castle-palace, modified in various ways, suffered much from the storms of civil war, and was restored by Joaquin Fernandez Cortina, who was bishop from 1848, and the restoration was continued by Bishop Gomez Salazar (1876\u201379).\n\nIn 1959 it was established as '''Diocese of Sig\u00fcenza-Guadalajara'''.\n\n==Ordinaries==\n*Rodrigo (1192\u20131221 Died)\n*Juan (3 Jun 1300 \u2013 )\n*Arnaldo (17 Nov 1326 \u2013 1328 Died)\n*Blasco D\u00e1vila (1340\u20131341 Died)\n*Lope Rodrigo de Villalobos (29 Oct 1382 \u2013 21 Jun 1386 Died)\n*Juan de Serrano (22 Dec 1389 \u2013 24 Feb 1402 Died)\n*Juan Gonzalez Fernandez de Illescas (30 Jul 1403 \u2013 15 Nov 1415 Died)\n*[[Pedro da Fonseca (cardinal)|Pedro da Fonseca]] (6 Jun 1419 \u2013 22 Aug 1422 Died)\n*[[Alfonso Carrillo de Albornoz]] (17 Sep 1422 \u2013 14 Mar 1434 Died)\n*[[Fernando Lujan (bishop)]] (17 Mar 1449 \u2013 1465 Died)\n*[[Juan de Mella]] (20 May 1465 \u2013 12 Oct 1467 Died)\n*[[Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza]] (30 Oct 1467 \u2013 11 Jan 1495 Died)<ref name=CathHierPedroMendoza>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bgondmep.html \"Pedro Cardinal Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza\"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''.
