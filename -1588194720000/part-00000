The protagonist is [[Leslie Knope]] ([[Amy Poehler]]), the deputy parks director as well as serving on city council, and the rest of the ensemble cast consists of her friends and co-workers, including nurse [[Ann Perkins]] ([[Rashida Jones]]), parks director [[Ron Swanson]] ([[Nick Offerman]]), and parks department employees [[Tom Haverford]] ([[Aziz Ansari]]), [[April Ludgate]] ([[Aubrey Plaza]]), [[Andy Dwyer]] ([[Chris Pratt]]), [[Jerry Gergich]] ([[Jim O'Heir]]), and [[Donna Meagle]] ([[Retta]]).\n\nWhile most of the main cast have been with the series since it debuted in April 2009, actors [[Rob Lowe]] and [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] joined the cast late in the [[Parks and Recreation (season 2)|second season]] portraying [[Chris Traeger]] and [[Ben Wyatt (Parks and Recreation)|Ben Wyatt]], two state auditors who later take permanent jobs in Pawnee. [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] was a regular cast member during the first two seasons as city planner [[Mark Brendanawicz]], but he departed at the end of season two. [[Billy Eichner]] who portrays [[Craig Middlebrooks]], the \"associate administrator\" of the Pawnee parks department, recurred throughout the show's [[Parks and Recreation (season 6)|sixth season]] until he was promoted to the main cast in the fourth episode of the [[Parks and Recreation (season 7)|seventh season]]. The majority of ''Parks and Recreation'' episodes are set in Pawnee, and most of the recurring and supporting characters are friends of the main characters or residents of the town.\n\nSeveral guest stars have made appearances on the show, including [[Louis C.K.]], [[John Larroquette]], [[Justin Theroux]] and [[Parker Posey]]. [[Megan Mullally]], Offerman's real-life wife, played his character's ex-wife Tammy Swanson, and Poehler's former husband [[Will Arnett]] made an appearance as a man on a [[Wikt:Blind date|blind date]] with Leslie. Several of Poehler's past colleagues on the [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' have appeared on ''Parks and Recreation'', including [[Fred Armisen]], [[Will Forte]] and [[Andy Samberg]].\n\n== Main cast ==\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#7FFFD4|border=darkgray}} = Main (credited in opening title sequence)</small>\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#7FFFD4|border=darkgray}} = Starring (credited after the opening title sequence, with star billing)</small>\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#FFDDDD|border=darkgray}} = Recurring</small>\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#ADD8E6|border=darkgray}} = Guest</small>\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#DDDDFF|border=darkgray}} = Special Guest</small>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Portrayed by\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"7\" | Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 4)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 5)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 6)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 7)|7]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Leslie Knope]]\n| [[Amy Poehler]]\n| colspan=\"7\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Ann Perkins]]\n| [[Rashida Jones]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| bgcolor=#DDDDFF colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| Special Guest\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Mark Brendanawicz]]\n| [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Tom Haverford]]\n| [[Aziz Ansari]]\n| colspan=\"7\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Ron Swanson]]\n| [[Nick Offerman]]\n| colspan=\"7\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[April Ludgate]]\n| [[Aubrey Plaza]]\n| colspan=\"7\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Andy Dwyer]]\n| [[Chris Pratt]]\n| colspan=\"1\" style=\"background:#fdd; text-align:center;\"| Recurring \n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Ben Wyatt (Parks and Recreation)|Ben Wyatt]]\n| [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]\n| {{N/A|}}\n| bgcolor=#ADD8E6 colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| Guest\n| colspan=\"5\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Chris Traeger]]\n| [[Rob Lowe]]\n| {{N/A|}}\n| bgcolor=#ADD8E6 colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| Guest\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| bgcolor=#DDDDFF colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| Special Guest\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Jerry Gergich]]\n| [[Jim O'Heir]]\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#fdd; text-align:center;\"| Recurring\n| colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|Starring}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Donna Meagle]]\n| [[Retta]]\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#fdd; text-align:center;\"| Recurring\n| colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|Starring}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Craig Middlebrooks]]\n| [[Billy Eichner]]\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" colspan=\"1\" | Recurring\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Starring}}\n|-\n|}\n\nEach of the following primary characters were played by members of the ''Parks and Recreation'' regular cast, rather than guest stars or non-regular supporting cast members.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stanley |first=Alessandra |author-link=Alessandra Stanley |title=Misguided, She Yearns to Guide |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 9, 2009 |url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/arts/television/09park.html |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406071940/http://tv.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/arts/television/09park.html |archivedate=April 6, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation Season 3 Cast Photo |website=Daemon's TV |date=November 8, 2010 |url=http://www.daemonstv.com/2010/11/08/parks-and-recreation-season-3-cast-photo/ |accessdate=December 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zQN60XwP?url=http://www.daemonstv.com/2010/11/08/parks-and-recreation-season-3-cast-photo |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Leslie Knope===\n{{main|Leslie Knope}}\n[[File:Amy Poehler (8894155873) (cropped).jpg|left|upright|thumb|alt=23|[[Amy Poehler]]]]\n\nLeslie Knope ([[Amy Poehler]]) is the deputy director of the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department, and the protagonist of ''Parks and Recreation''.

In the episode \"Doppelgangers\", he and other Eagleton employees were brought in to Pawnee's offices after the Pawnee\u2013Eagleton city merger. Craig is the one former Eagleton Parks employee not laid off after the merger, and continues to work at the Pawnee offices under the title of \"Associate Administrator\". By 2017, he has replaced Ron Swanson as director of the Pawnee Parks department. Craig at first seemed to be the polar opposite to Donna's more laid-back personality (with layoffs imminent, Donna actually suggested to Leslie that Craig should have her job because he was much more passionate). The two of them bonded over their mutual love of the TV series ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]''. The overdramatic Craig often raises his voice to the point of shouting, and frequently blows things out of proportion, although he proves to be a highly efficient employee who is familiar with city politics and a strong negotiator.

In the season three finale, [[Li'l Sebastian]] dies, and everyone is devastated (except for Ben, who still doesn't understand). Leslie used Tom's company, Entertainment 720, to give Li'l Sebastian a funeral. Andy then writes the song \"5000 [[Candle in the Wind|Candles in the Wind]]\" to honor Li'l Sebastian.\n\n===Linda Lonegan===\nProfessor Linda Lonegan ([[Danielle Bisutti]]) was Andy's Women's Studies professor.

Ron even stated \"If that woman wasn't so violently opposed to marriage, I'd propose to her\". When Andy finished the course, Linda went to dinner with them to celebrate, where April tried to set her up with Chris.

She is also the former girlfriend of [[Tom Haverford]]. She is partly responsible for the opening of her father Dr. Saperstein's store which eventually runs [[Tom Haverford]]'s Rent-a-Swag store out of business. She first appeared in season 5 and continued to appear in the final two seasons (particularly Season 6) as an unreformed lunatic who frightened/terrorized anyone in her path. When she appears in Season 7 her father offers an embarrassed explanation for her insanity by telling Ben and April one word: \"pills.\"\n\n===Dr. Saperstein===\nDr. Saperstein ([[Henry Winkler]]), the father of Jean-Ralphio and Mona-Lisa, is a gynecologist in Pawnee who invests in several area businesses. Though he openly admits his two children are ne'er-do-well leeches, he loves them unconditionally anyway. After Tom and Mona-Lisa break up, Dr. Saperstein opens a store similar to Tom's Rent-a-Swag directly across the street for the express purpose of ruining Tom and forcing him to sell his store cheaply. He later relents a bit and offers Tom a deal that will let him break even as well as get a small portion of \"Tommy's Closet\" revenues going forward, which Tom glumly accepts. He is also the doctor whom Ann and Chris go to while the former is pregnant. In the season six finale, he shows up to the opening of Tom's Bistro (Tom is aghast to see him, but Mona-Lisa cluelessly followed up on Tom's request to bring in big names) and is happy when it appears the restaurant is going to flop. However, he later states the food is incredible and asks Tom if he can be a minority investor, to which Tom coolly replies that he will give Dr. Saperstein's offer some time and thought.\n\n===Orin===\nOrin (Eric Isenhower) is the creepy and intense friend of April Ludgate. He seldom speaks and often stares at people and makes them feel awkward.

This marked the first time someone on the show directly let Orin know they didn't like him. When he applied for the job of Animal Control director in Season 5, his resume contained one word: his name, in regular font. Leslie told him to go away, and after April asked him what qualified him to work in animal control, and he responded, \"I studied zoology in college. And I can control animals with my mind\", to which Leslie curtly says he will not be hired and repeats that he needs to get lost, which he does. He appeared briefly in Season 6 twice, in the episode \"[[Ann and Chris]]\" dressed up as the Easter Bunny at Ann and Chris's going away party and in the episode \"[[Parks and Recreation (season 6)#ep108|Prom]]\" pretending to be April's mom when Andy picked her up to go to the senior [[prom]].\n\n===Tammy Swanson (Tammy I)===\n[[File:Patricia Clarkson 2009 Whatever Works portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Patricia Clarkson]]]]\n\nTammy Swanson ([[Patricia Clarkson]]) is the first ex-wife of Ron Swanson.

Ron explains that Tammy had been present throughout most of his young life: she delivered him as a baby, was his teacher, and she even took his virginity. Tammy returns as an [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] agent who arrives at the end of [[Parks and Recreation (season 3)|the third season]] (although she is not shown to the audience until [[I'm Leslie Knope|the fourth-season premiere]]) to audit Ron. Both Ron and his second wife named Tammy panic at the news of her arrival, and Ron attempts to flee before deciding to return to face her. Leslie then enlists Ron's eccentric mother (also named Tammy) in a drinking contest to drive Tammy I away once and for all. Since Tammy I's claim she was auditing Ron was a lie designed to let her search for his hidden gold, she ends up leaving with nothing, as Ron had deliberately put a tiny amount of gold out as a decoy, and was happy to sacrifice it in order to get rid of Tammy I.\n\n===Tammy Swanson (Tammy II)===\n[[File:Megan Mullally by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nick Offerman]]'s real-life wife [[Megan Mullally]] played Ron's ex-wife Tammy.]]\n\nTammy Swanson ([[Megan Mullally]]) is the second ex-wife of Ron Swanson.

She is a junior high school vice principal and a single mother of two young girls, Ivy (Sadie Salizar) and Zoey (Rylan Lee). Ron Swanson meets her when he goes to fix a [[pothole]] in front of her house (since the Department of Public Works had been ignoring her complaints, Ron decided to simply take the matter into his own hands). Diane is far from Ron's usual \"type\". She's not named \"Tammy\" and she has two small girls. Ron is not good with children, or more specifically, with little girls (Ron had previously taken teenage and pre-teen boys camping to teach them survival skills, and also coached a basketball team). After he fixes the pothole, Diane's girls put makeup on Ron and Andy's faces (Ron had taken Andy with him to help fix the pothole), and have a little girl's tea party with them, which Ron tolerates surprisingly well. Ron really likes Diane and in episode 5 of season 5 (\"Halloween Surprise\") begins a dating relationship with her, deciding that dealing with a single mother and her girls might help him to expand his life experience. Diane, in return, in the episode \"Ron and Diane\", shows an impressive level of patience and understanding at Tammy II's psychotic attempts to ruin her relationship with Ron. In a private conversation with Leslie, Diane admits that she feels more threatened by Leslie than by Tammy II, as she feels that Leslie knows Ron in a way that she never can. When she confesses this fear to Ron, he assures her that, while Leslie is a loyal friend and colleague, he could never have any romantic feelings towards her. Then, to prove his commitment to Diane, he reveals to her his Duke Silver identity (a night club saxophone player, something even Leslie didn't know), and he plays Diane a song, naming her as his \"duchess\". In the same episode, Leslie decides that Diane is a good guardian of Ron's well-being and a shield against the disruptive antics of Tammy II. Later, during the episode \"Women in Garbage\", Ron is babysitting her daughters in the office with Ann, and accidentally allows them to lock themselves in his office with the contents of Ann's medical bag. The girls cut each other's hair before Ron and Ann can stop them, which destroys their hairstyles. Ron and Ann are horrified by this, and when Ron considers Diane's potential reaction, he blurts out to Ann that he has fallen in love with Diane (a statement he immediately tries to take back). Diane, however, is understanding of the accident, saying that it was just kids being kids. She tells him that she is touched by how much he cared, and that she loves him. Ron sheepishly admits that he loves her as well. It is implied at the end of the fifth season that Diane may be pregnant. In the beginning of the first episode of the sixth season, Diane confirms her pregnancy and Ron proposes marriage to which she accepts under one condition: that the wedding be as plain as possible. With that in mind, the two head up to the fourth floor with Leslie and April in tow. Leslie is asked to be the matron of honour and April appoints herself as Ron's 'Best Man'. The two are married in an extremely fast-paced wedding filmed on April's phone and with highlighter pens acting as a bouquet. Later on in the episode where Leslie, Ron, April and Andy are in London, it is revealed that Diane suggested tagging along to make the trip hers and Ron's honeymoon; however, her morning sickness meant that she couldn't go and Ron had to take plenty of photos for her. Ron and Diane's baby, John Swanson, is born later in the season.\nAlthough Diane does not appear in Season 7, she is frequently mentioned as still being married to Ron.\n\n===Gayle Gergich===\nGayle Gergich ([[Christie Brinkley]]) is Jerry's inexplicably gorgeous wife, as well as the mother of their equally gorgeous daughters Millicent, Miriam, and Gladys. Gayle has a solid and overly-affectionate relationship with Jerry, puzzling to his coworkers. She is referenced until she makes an appearance in \"Ron and Diane\". She also appears again in \"Jerry's Retirement.\"\n\n===Millicent Gergich===\nMillicent \"Millie\" Gergich ([[Sarah Wright]]) is the gorgeous daughter of Gayle and Jerry. She was introduced in season 4 as Chris's love interest. In \"Bowling for Votes\", Chris mentions his plans to move in with Millicent, but she breaks up with him off screen that same episode. In \"Ron and Diane\" it's revealed that Millicent is engaged to a rafting instructor named Carl. She makes another appearance in \"Jerry's Retirement.\"\n\n===Gladys Gergich===\nGladys Gergich (Katie Gill) is one of Gayle and Jerry's other daughters. She first appears in \"Ron and Diane\", singing Christmas carols with her mother, father, and sister, Miriam. She also appears again in \"Jerry's Retirement.\"\n\n===Miriam Gergich===\nMiriam Gergich (Maliabeth Johnson) is one of Gayle and Jerry's other daughters. She first appears in \"Ron and Diane\", singing Christmas carols with her mother, father, and Gladys. She also appears again in \"Jerry's retirement.\"\n\n===Typhoon Montalban===\nNorman \"Typhoon\" Montalban ([[Rodney To]]) is a hairdresser in Pawnee who marries [[Craig Middlebrooks]] ([[Billy Eichner]]) in the flash forwards of the season finale. Typhoon was introduced in the 5th episode of Season 6 as Donna's hairdresser after she recommends him to Ron, following the passing of Ron's former regular barber. Ron is at first reluctant to take on a new stylist, but bonds with Typhoon over their shared hatred of Europe and bicycles. He appears again in the 7th episode of Season 7 as Donna's stylist for her wedding, and again in the final episode when he marries Craig. Ron is shown to be the best man at their wedding.\n\n==Elected officials and city employees==\n\n===Bill Dexhart===\n[[File:Kevin Symons 2.JPG|thumb|175 px|right|[[Kevin Symons]] portrays Pawnee Councilman Bill Dexhart.|alt=A brown-haired man wearing a brown fleece jacket looks directly ahead.]]\n\nBill Dexhart ([[Kevin Symons]]) is a Pawnee councilman who regularly participates in outrageous sex scandals with multiple partners.<ref name=\"Heisler1108\" /><ref name=\"Fowler1211\" /> His character was inspired by [[South Carolina]] [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Mark Sanford]] and his [[Mark Sanford disappearance and extramarital affair|2009 scandal]], in which he admitted to a long-time extramarital affair with an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] woman. Dexhart first appeared in \"Practice Date\", when he publicly admitted to having participated in a [[foursome (group sex)|foursome]] in a [[Brazil]] cave under the guise of building houses for the underprivileged.<ref name=\"Heisler1108\" /> Dexhart was featured prominently in \"Christmas Scandal\", which began with Leslie portraying him in a satirical holiday skit in which he discussed his an affair with multiple women that resulted in a love child. Unbeknownst to Leslie, Dexhart turned out to be involved in a sexual arrangement very similar to that one: four-way sex in a hospital room where he has just overseen the birth of his love child. When he confronted her about it, members of the media took pictures of Leslie and Dexhart together and speculated that the two of them were having an affair. Dexhart refused to deny the allegations, and even went so far as to confirm them, because the fictional affair was less scandalous than his actual sexual discretions. As proof of the affair, he claimed Leslie had a mole on her right buttock, but she publicly proved him wrong by dropping her pants on live television and revealing there is no mole. In Season 5 he was something of a swing vote for Leslie on the City Council because he was less likely to fully support her than Howser, but also less likely to thoughtlessly oppose her than either Milton or Jamm.<ref name=\"Fowler1211\" /><ref name=\"Pierce1211\" /> That has changed during the recall campaign against Leslie in Season 6, as Dexhart has cheerfully joined Jamm in blocking any initiatives by her and making it clear they both hope she is booted from office. In the episode \"Second Chunce\", Dexhart publicly confesses to \"texting, sexting and [[Tex-Mex]]ting\" approximately one hundred women under a series of implausible pseudonyms, parodying the [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandals]]. In fact, \"[[Anthony Weiner]]\" is the last in the list of pseudonyms Dexhart reads out at a press conference. Leslie briefly considers running for his seat after being impeached, but is dissuaded by Jennifer Barkley.\nThe district that Dexhart is in charge of is a run-down, crime-ridden part of town that he had promised to clean up, but his only action has been to rename it Beach View Terrace.\n\n===Carl Lorthner===\nCarl Lorthner ([[Andy Samberg]])<ref>{{cite news|last=Harris |first=Bill |title=Samberg reunites with former SNLer |date=March 17, 2010 |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/tv/2010/03/17/13266786.html |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xCmp6Jyl?url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/tv/2010/03/17/13266786.html |archivedate=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> is a [[park ranger]] and the head of outdoor security for Pawnee.

The chief agreed to Leslie's request that he release him to Leslie's custody. Ben feared Leslie cashing in this favor meant the chief would not agree to provide security for the upcoming harvest festival, but Chief Trumple agreed to do so anyway out of his respect for Leslie, telling Ben he will always do favors for Leslie because she is the kind of person who uses those favors to help people.<ref name=\"Sundermann0211\" /><ref name=\"Sepinwall0210\" /> The chief reappeared in the episode \"[[Eagleton (Parks and Recreation)|Eagleton]]\", where he arrested Leslie when she refused to apologize after getting in a fight with [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Lindsay Carlisle Shay|Lindsay Carlisle Shay]], her rival from the neighboring city of Eagleton.<ref name=\"Meslow0506\" /> Trumple retired as police chief in Season 4.\n\n===Jeremy Jamm===\nAn orthodontist by day, Jamm ([[Jon Glaser]]) is a member of the Pawnee City Council, and has made himself Leslie's major nemesis. He also appears to have a grudge against the entire Parks Department, angry over the fact that Leslie ruined his Paunch Burger plan. Tom shoved him into a swimming pool, Ann refused to sleep with him, and Ron punched him in the mouth. After fighting with Leslie over the use of her private bathroom for her office, he becomes a continual thorn in Leslie's side for any proposal she makes. His catch phrase, \"you just got Jammed,\" is used whenever he one-ups Leslie or any other adversary. He failed to turn Lot 48 into a new Paunch Burger restaurant when Leslie won over the city planning committee and got the Pawnee Commons park project approved, leading to him getting drunk and temporarily ruining Ben and Leslie's impromptu on-site wedding. Afterward, he was punched by Ron Swanson; both of them were thrown in jail but Ron was quickly released while Jamm was left to sober up in his cell, and the wedding took place at City Hall. He then sued Ron and it looked he would win, but Tom, Andy and April threatened a similarly bogus lawsuit that Jamm knew he would lose, so both sides backed off. When Leslie is under political pressure to resign, Jamm complicates Leslie's role on the council by teaming up with councilman Dexhart and voting down any proposal Leslie has, to spite her. When Donna Meagle accidentally sends a sexually suggestive tweet from the department [[Twitter]], Jamm uses this as an opportunity to hold public hearings that put Leslie's ethics into question. After he holds a series of hearings to drag out Leslie's ordeal, Leslie publicly stands up to Jamm and says that she's going to get back to work as a councilwoman and won't attend any more of the hearings. In the season six finale, Jamm is shown at the Pawnee/Eagleton unity concert leading a secession effort.\nJamm reappears in the Season 7 episode \"Ron and Jammy\", where he is revealed to be dating Tammy, Ron's second ex-wife. Leslie and Ron are feuding over the Newport land rights at this time, and Jamm is the swing vote on the issue. Leslie initially sees the relationship as an advantage, since Tammy would influence Jamm to vote against Ron; however, it becomes apparent that being with Tammy is detrimental to Jamm's physical and mental well-being. Leslie and Ron decide to put aside their differences and successfully coach Jamm into breaking up with her. Jamm then abstains from the land rights vote, leaving the issue deadlocked.\n\n===Fielding Milton===\nMilton ([[James Greene (American actor)|James Greene]]) is the longest-serving Pawnee Councilman, having been elected in 1948 as a [[Dixiecrat]] largely due to his commitment to de-integrating [[Major League Baseball]], as well as a plan to re-open a former WWII Japanese-American Internment Camp in Pawnee and get it back up to speed.<ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes |title=James Greene, 'Parks and Recreation' Actor and Broadway Veteran, Dies at 91 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-greene-dead-parks-recreation-actor-broadway-veteran-was-91-1161409 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2018-11-14 |accessdate=2018-12-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122093424/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-greene-dead-parks-recreation-actor-broadway-veteran-was-91-1161409|archivedate=2018-11-22 |url-status=live}}</ref> He is generally senile except on matters of racism and sexism, where his memory seems to be intact (he was able to calculate when Leslie Knope's next menstrual period would start during \"Women in Garbage\"), and he has generally\u2014though not always\u2014been on the other side of Leslie's initiatives.\n\n===Joe Fantringham===\n[[File:Kirk fox purple background.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stand-up comedian [[Kirk Fox]] portrays Joe Fantrigham, who works in the Pawnee sewage department.|alt=A man with brown hair and a brown mustache wearing a blue denim jacket looks directly ahead.]]\n\nJoe Fantringham ([[Kirk Fox]]), also sometimes called \"Sewage Joe\",<ref name=\"Busis0513\" /> works for the Pawnee sewer department, which he calls the \"Toilet Party\".<ref name=\"Fowler0421\">{{cite news|last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: \"Soulmates\" Review |work=IGN |date=April 21, 2011 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/04/22/parks-and-recreation-soulmates-review|accessdate=December 5, 2019 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zfh3lCZu?url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/116/1163086p1.html |archivedate=June 24, 2011}}</ref> Despite the nature of his department, Joe regularly hires supermodel-like interns.<ref name=\"Pierce1112\">{{cite news |last=Pierce |first=Leonard |title=Parks and Recreation: \"The Camel\" |work=[[The A.V.

In the final season, set in 2017, Perd Hapley announces Mayor Gunderson's death and an open-casket memorial is held in the city council chambers. In a video Gunderson assigned to be shown at his funeral, he remarks at how little attention he had been paying, and that he would take credit if any needed to be taken. He then points out that if there was any blame, it was the citizens' fault. His last statement is \"Goodbye forever.\" This posthumous appearance by Bill Murray as Gunderson, is the only time he is seen on ''Parks and Recreation'', although he had been mentioned in multiple episodes of the show. He was first mentioned in \"Christmas Scandal\", when the parks and recreation department held a satirical holiday skit full of inside jokes about Pawnee, and April declared, \"That's crazier than Mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus.\"<ref name=\"Pierce1211\" /> He is also mentioned in the episode \"[[Leslie's House]],\" when Mark asks everyone if they heard about the incident involving his dog, prompting Ron to say, \"Oh my god, it was a bloodbath.\" Mark later adds that as a result of the incident, someone from animal services would be fired.

Ann sets Chris and Leslie up on a [[Wikt:Blind date|blind date]] in \"The Set Up\", which goes extremely poorly.

As a compromise, she held a public meeting where she listened to all demands. Ultimately, when the citizens could not agree on anything, Leslie submitted a video tape of that very meeting, which she believed symbolizes the spirit and passion of Pawnee.<ref name=\"Sundermann0204\" />\n\n===Lawrence===\nLawrence ([[Eric Edelstein]]) is an Eagleton resident who has criticized the parks and recreation department's plans at public forums, which embodied a recurring ''Parks and Recreation'' theme that only citizens opposed to projects bother to attend town meetings.<ref name=\"SchurCanvasComm\">{{cite video | people=[[Michael Schur|Schur, Michael]]|date=2009|title=Parks and Recreation: Season One: \"Canvassing\" (Audio commentary) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> He first appeared in \"[[Canvassing (Parks and Recreation)|Canvassing]]\" at a forum Leslie held to raise support for her proposed park project.

He takes care of her, I guess. But whatever, he's a douchebag.\" He complained that Andy's music was \"loud, . . . abusive, and [was] waking up [his] birds,\" causing Lawrence to admit that he had \". . . nice, pretty, expensive birds . . .\" Lawrence was also the one who pointed out in the same meeting that [[April Ludgate]] had been planted by Leslie as a supporter for the park, having recognized her since she was at his door the day before.

One of Marcia's odd personality quirks is that she seems completely unaware of the fact that her husband, Marshall, is possibly gay or bisexual, as he has a flamboyant personality and speaks with an effeminate voice. Marshall's sexuality was never confirmed, but, when speaking to Chris Traeger, he smiles in a way that could be interpreted as attraction.\n\n===Newport family===\nThe Newport family are the owners of the Sweetums candy manufacturer in Pawnee and one of the city's richest and most prominent families. The company has operated and thrived in the city for years, as indicated in the episode \"[[Sweetums (Parks and Recreation)|Sweetums]]\", where Leslie screened 30-year-old video footage of a then-young Nick Newport, Sr. discussing how corn syrup was used to fatten cattle at farms.<ref name=\"Heisler0206\" /> By the time of ''Parks and Recreation'', Nick Newport, Sr. ([[Christopher Murray (actor)|Christopher Murray]]) is an elderly man in a wheelchair so senile he can barely speak,<ref name=\"Kandell0430\" /> and the company is run by his son Nick Newport, Jr. ([[Gary Weeks]]), who himself appears in Sweetums commercials along with his two children, Dakota (Harley Graham) and Denver (Ryan Hartwig).

Jessica made major alterations to the historic mansion, and Leslie unsuccessfully tried to intervene to stop her.<ref name=\"Kandell0430\" />\n\n===Bobby Newport===\nNewport ([[Paul Rudd]]) is Leslie's chief opponent in her fourth season campaign for City Council. Bobby would appear to be the second son of Nick Newport, Sr., who paid $250,000 to his campaign manager ([[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Jennifer Barkley|Jennifer Barkley]]) in order to get Bobby elected. Bobby Newport is friendly and [[superficially charming]], but extremely naive and clueless (he at times acts [[mentally handicapped]] despite the fact that he isn't), and has been completely spoiled by his privileged upbringing. When Leslie puts together a viral video that makes him look pathetic and stupid (in lieu of a nasty attack ad she ultimately refused to air), Bobby has a meeting where he complains she hurt his feelings, then asks her to drop out of the election and simply hand the office to him. He also tells Leslie he'll give her an invitation to his victory party, and even offers to let her do the job for him once he's elected. He spends much of the campaign away from Pawnee, and gets involved in a sex scandal while vacationing in [[Majorca]]. He returns to debate Leslie, and during their debate, Bobby first appears to be in the lead by saying short quips rather than longer speeches, but Leslie eventually attacks his character and wins the debate. Afterwards, Bobby congratulates her performance during the debate and asks her if she would like to come to his house for a party. After Leslie connects with him upon the death of his father, he tells reporters people who don't vote for him should definitely vote for her, and then says on TV that he's very relieved he lost the election to her. He is later considered a possible candidate for interim mayor after Mayor Gunderson dies. In the extended edition of the series finale, he is revealed to have married Shauna Malwae-Tweep.\n\n===Trish Ianetta===\nTrish Ianetta (April Marie Eden) is an attractive young woman who won the title Miss Pawnee in \"Beauty Pageant\". She gave unintelligent answers during the pageant and displayed no actual talent: during her talent portion, she did a [[baton twirling]] act that involved simply moving the baton around without twirling it.<ref name=\"Fog1002\" /><ref name=\"Heisler1020\" /> In describing herself, she says, \"I've been on [[YouTube]]. I love wearing bikinis at the beach with everyone there.\" Trish has been compared to [[Caitlin Upton]], the 2007 [[Miss South Carolina Teen USA]] who made an incoherent response during the [[Miss Teen USA 2007]] pageant. Based solely on her physical attractiveness, Trish was favored by the panel of judges, which included Tom Haverford and Jessica Wicks. Only Leslie objected to Trish and unsuccessfully argued for Susan, an intelligent and talented contestant who was less pretty.<ref name=\"Fog1002\" /> Trish made another appearance in \"The Master Plan\", where she was among the girls Tom tried to flirt with during a night at the Snakehole Lounge bar.<ref name=\"SchurrMPComm\" />\n\n===Greg Pikitis===\nGreg Pikitis ([[Cody Klop]]), a teenage boy living in [[Pawnee, Indiana]], is Leslie's mortal enemy. His first appearance is in \"[[Greg Pikitis]],\" in which Leslie is determined to put a stop to his yearly Halloween tee-peeing of a statue. In response, Greg sneaks into the Parks department and vandalizes the offices. After several intricate mind games and plans, Leslie and Dave catch him in the act, and he is given probation for his crimes. He reappears in \"Prom\" in season 6, where Leslie is horrified to learn that he is the boyfriend of a girl she has been mentoring.\n\n===Ron Dunn===\nRon Dunn ([[Sam Elliott]]) is the former director of Eagleton's parks department, the equivalent position of Ron Swanson's in Pawnee. In the Season 6 episode \"Doppelgangers\", he was brought over to the Pawnee offices along with other Eagleton employees when the towns merged. Swanson at first took a liking to Dunn, as the latter was mustachioed, taciturn and also named Ron. However, Dunn later revealed himself to be a [[hippie]] with [[New Age]] ideals, and Swanson found him insufferable.\nDunn was laid off along with most other Eagleton employees (excepting Craig), which he took in stride. He reappeared in \"Flu Season 2\", where Swanson and a drunk Ben encounter him at night, and he helps Ben overcome his anger at his parents' selling their vacation home. His final appearance is in the Season 7 episode \"Two Funerals\".\n\n===Tynnyfer===\nTynnyfer ([[June Diane Raphael]]) is a former employee of Eagleton's parks department whose position was the equivalent of April's. In the Season 6 episode \"Doppelgangers\", she was brought over during the Pawnee-Eagleton merger. She is a stereotypical vacuous, rich housewife. With the inevitability of one of them being laid off, April ingratiated herself to Tynnyfer by mirroring her personality and vocal inflections, and encouraged her to quit her job. Tynnyfer replied that she was planning on doing that anyway, as she wanted to move somewhere warmer while her husband served time in prison. April gave her an address in Miami that she claimed was hers, and said Tynnyfer was welcome to climb over the fence and stay there. April then revealed in a cutaway that the house belongs to [[Dwyane Wade]] and she got the address off the Internet.\n\n===Dr. Richard Nygard===\nDr. Richard Nygard is a character who is mentioned several times, but never appears on screen. He is first mentioned to be Chris's therapist, whom he sees near constantly. Chris's anxiety improves under his care. Later Leslie recommends Dr. Nygard to a troubled Malwae-Tweep, but then comments that she is not completely certain he isn't an imaginary creation of Chris's. Later, however, it is confirmed that he is a real person because he also acts as the off-screen therapist to Craig Middlebrooks.\n\n===Pete Disellio===\n\"Pistol Pete\" Disellio ([[Tuc Watkins]]) is a local celebrity, only remembered for his last-second game-winning dunk in the annual Pawnee-Eagleton high school basketball game in 1992. As a middle-aged man he resents the fact that everyone in town still sees him this way. He appears in three episodes across Seasons 4\u20136, during which Leslie secures his endorsement for City Council, Ann considers him as a sperm donor, and Pete refuses to endorse Sweetums' new sports drink.\n\n==People from outside Pawnee==\n\n===Dennis Feinstein===\n\nDennis ([[Jason Mantzoukas]]) is one of Pawnee's wealthiest citizens, the arrogant and unpleasant owner of a successful perfume company. He changed his original name, Dante Fiero, to something considered \"more exotic in Pawnee.\" First appearing in Season 3's \"Indianapolis\", Dennis Feinstein  is at The Snakehole Lounge for his \"Allergic\" cologne launch party. Tom Haverford attempts to pitch his cologne to Dennis while there. Dennis laughs at him when Tom sprays the cologne, telling him it smells terrible, and dismisses him. In season 7, Feinstein buys out JJ's Diner, completely unsympathetic to the townspeople's protests.\n\n===Detlef Schrempf===\n[[Detlef Schrempf]] is a real-life retired basketball player for the [[Indiana Pacers]] who portrays himself on ''Parks and Recreation''. He first appeared in \"Telethon\", where Leslie invited him to make a guest appearance on a 24-hour diabetes telethon. Tom picked him up from the airport, but first took him for a drink to the Snakehole Lounge, where Detlef proved so popular that bar owner Freddy would not let them leave.

She awed Leslie by appearing in a picture where she's sharing an egg salad with [[Colin Powell]]. Jennifer tells Leslie that she's bored and took this job for the money, not much caring who wins and finding Bobby to be stupid. While it appears she's being honest about this, she later trashes Leslie in a TV interview, edits Leslie's successful YouTube campaign ad to make her sound like an idiot, and swipes Leslie's building-ramp plan in favor of an electric lifts plan that leads Pawnee senior citizen powerbroker Ned Jones (played by Carl Reiner) to endorse Bobby. Leslie later confronts Jennifer at her favorite restaurant, where Jennifer says bluntly she likes Leslie but has been hired to defeat her. Jennifer then gives Leslie some genuinely good advice about upcoming decisions, and tells the camera that she is doing so because she has no one to play chess with and \"sometimes I need to play against myself\". Jennifer appears to keep her work and her personal feelings separate, given that she's able to relate to people when she's not working a campaign. When Leslie appears on Perd Hapley's show to reveal that Bobby Newport has been avoiding his hometown in favor of making out with a woman on a [[Majorca]] beach, Jennifer says that Bobby is in Europe to get business opportunities for Pawnee and the woman is an anti-landmine advocate. Afterwards, she tells Leslie and Ben that she \"mostly\" made all that up, then details how she'll be able to spin any outrage from them in Bobby's favor. Leslie and Ben are left completely stunned by Jennifer's mercenary brilliance. However, Leslie and Ben are finally able to knock her off balance a little bit after Jennifer goes on Perd's TV show and says Leslie ordered a pet shelter closed (after Leslie had asked a retiring Councilman to reverse a funding cut for the Parks Department); after she's overjoyed with Leslie's idea that the Newport family use their wealth to fund the shelter, Leslie explains that she'll accept the initial funding cut if Jennifer breaks a promise to stop airing \"puppy killer\" ads, and that she's fine with losing a week's news momentum because she's debating Bobby Newport after that and she's going to ruin him. Jennifer's expression makes it clear Leslie has finally scored some points against her. But after Leslie does score a huge victory over Bobby in the debate and pulls within 2 points of him in the polls, Jennifer strikes back by using the death of Nick Newport (and Leslie's comments, made before she learned he had died, that Nick was a jerk) to force Leslie into several embarrassing mistakes. However, Jennifer finds out that she might not get any of her promised quarter-million fee due to her handshake deal with Nick, and watches as Bobby manages to tell the press that Leslie is an awesome person. The campaign having ended, Jennifer seeks out Chris Traeger and invites him to have sex with her, and he accepts. On Election Night, she tries and fails to keep pro-Newport voting machines in place, and later is rebuffed when she doesn't want an automatic recount to be triggered by Bobby's initial 21-vote victory margin. Recognizing Ben's talent on Leslie's campaign, she offers Ben a job working with her on a Congressional campaign (he eventually accepts it) and has sex with Chris again but leaves Pawnee without saying goodbye to him. When that campaign successfully ends in Washington D.C., she offers Ben another campaign job for a governor candidate in Florida. She appears again in Season 6 (\"Second Chunce\") to convince Leslie (as a paid favor to Ben) not to run for Dexhart's seat in the city council, but to reach for the stars and to look for a more high-powered job. Leslie said it was the best present she could have received (from Ben).\nShe makes several more appearances in the seventh and final season, encouraging Ben to run for governor of Indiana.\n\n===Buddy Wood===\nBuddy Wood ([[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]]) is a journalist from [[Indianapolis]] that does an annual special where he profiles five political candidates from around Indiana. The candidates he profiles tend to get elected, causing him to be described as a \"lucky charm\" for people running for office. Buddy interviews Leslie, but this doesn't go well because she is drunk, and Wood tries to turn the story to Pawnee not being as great as it once was. Leslie and Ben consider him to be rude, but they still drive to Buddy Wood's house to beg him for either a second chance for an interview or for him to erase the negative footage; Buddy then sourly reveals that he never aired the interview because his bag was lost in Pawnee, unaware that one of the airport workers, who liked Leslie and was angered by Buddy's rude attitude, took the interview tape and threw it into a dumpster.<ref>{{cite web|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff |url=https://tv.avclub.com/parks-and-recreation-lucky-1798171911|title=Parks And Recreation: \"Lucky\"|work=The A.V.

Several of Poehler's past colleagues on the [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' have appeared on ''Parks and Recreation'', including [[Fred Armisen]], [[Will Forte]] and [[Andy Samberg]].\n\n== Main cast ==\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#7FFFD4|border=darkgray}} = Main (credited in opening title sequence)</small>\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#7FFFD4|border=darkgray}} = Starring (credited after the opening title sequence, with star billing)</small>\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#FFDDDD|border=darkgray}} = Recurring</small>\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#ADD8E6|border=darkgray}} = Guest</small>\n: <small>Key: {{Color box|#DDDDFF|border=darkgray}} = Special Guest</small>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Portrayed by\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"7\" | Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 4)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 5)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 6)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6.42%;\" | [[Parks and Recreation (season 7)|7]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Leslie Knope]]\n| [[Amy Poehler]]\n| colspan=\"7\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Ann Perkins]]\n| [[Rashida Jones]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| bgcolor=#DDDDFF colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| Special Guest\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Mark Brendanawicz]]\n| [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Tom Haverford]]\n| [[Aziz Ansari]]\n| colspan=\"7\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Ron Swanson]]\n| [[Nick Offerman]]\n| colspan=\"7\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[April Ludgate]]\n| [[Aubrey Plaza]]\n| colspan=\"7\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Andy Dwyer]]\n| [[Chris Pratt]]\n| colspan=\"1\" style=\"background:#fdd; text-align:center;\"| Recurring \n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Ben Wyatt (Parks and Recreation)|Ben Wyatt]]\n| [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]\n| {{N/A|}}\n| bgcolor=#ADD8E6 colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| Guest\n| colspan=\"5\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Chris Traeger]]\n| [[Rob Lowe]]\n| {{N/A|}}\n| bgcolor=#ADD8E6 colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| Guest\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| bgcolor=#DDDDFF colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| Special Guest\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Jerry Gergich]]\n| [[Jim O'Heir]]\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#fdd; text-align:center;\"| Recurring\n| colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|Starring}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Donna Meagle]]\n| [[Retta]]\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#fdd; text-align:center;\"| Recurring\n| colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|Starring}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Craig Middlebrooks]]\n| [[Billy Eichner]]\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" colspan=\"1\" | Recurring\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Starring}}\n|-\n|}\n\nEach of the following primary characters were played by members of the ''Parks and Recreation'' regular cast, rather than guest stars or non-regular supporting cast members.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stanley |first=Alessandra |author-link=Alessandra Stanley |title=Misguided, She Yearns to Guide |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 9, 2009 |url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/arts/television/09park.html |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406071940/http://tv.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/arts/television/09park.html |archivedate=April 6, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation Season 3 Cast Photo |website=Daemon's TV |date=November 8, 2010 |url=http://www.daemonstv.com/2010/11/08/parks-and-recreation-season-3-cast-photo/ |accessdate=December 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zQN60XwP?url=http://www.daemonstv.com/2010/11/08/parks-and-recreation-season-3-cast-photo |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Leslie Knope===\n{{main|Leslie Knope}}\n[[File:Amy Poehler (8894155873) (cropped).jpg|left|upright|thumb|alt=23|[[Amy Poehler]]]]\n\nLeslie Knope ([[Amy Poehler]]) is the deputy director of the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department, and the protagonist of ''Parks and Recreation''.

It was also revealed that he has a [[Leap Day]] birthday and is 64/16 years old. In contrast to his awkwardness at work, Jerry leads an idyllic family life with his gorgeous wife, Gayle (played by [[Christie Brinkley]]), and their children, as shown when he hosts a holiday party in the Season 5 episode \"Ron and Diane\". In season six, his coworkers take to permanently calling him Larry instead of Jerry. In a flash forward sequence in the season six finale, Jerry is shown working for Leslie at her new job three years in the future, with Leslie now calling him Terry.

In the episode \"Doppelgangers\", he and other Eagleton employees were brought in to Pawnee's offices after the Pawnee\u2013Eagleton city merger. Craig is the one former Eagleton Parks employee not laid off after the merger, and continues to work at the Pawnee offices under the title of \"Associate Administrator\". By 2017, he has replaced Ron Swanson as director of the Pawnee Parks department. Craig at first seemed to be the polar opposite to Donna's more laid-back personality (with layoffs imminent, Donna actually suggested to Leslie that Craig should have her job because he was much more passionate). The two of them bonded over their mutual love of the TV series ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]''. The overdramatic Craig often raises his voice to the point of shouting, and frequently blows things out of proportion, although he proves to be a highly efficient employee who is familiar with city politics and a strong negotiator.

She is also the former girlfriend of [[Tom Haverford]]. She is partly responsible for the opening of her father Dr. Saperstein's store which eventually runs [[Tom Haverford]]'s Rent-a-Swag store out of business. She first appeared in season 5 and continued to appear in the final two seasons (particularly Season 6) as an unreformed lunatic who frightened/terrorized anyone in her path. When she appears in Season 7 her father offers an embarrassed explanation for her insanity by telling Ben and April one word: \"pills.\"\n\n===Dr. Saperstein===\nDr. Saperstein ([[Henry Winkler]]), the father of Jean-Ralphio and Mona-Lisa, is a gynecologist in Pawnee who invests in several area businesses. Though he openly admits his two children are ne'er-do-well leeches, he loves them unconditionally anyway. After Tom and Mona-Lisa break up, Dr. Saperstein opens a store similar to Tom's Rent-a-Swag directly across the street for the express purpose of ruining Tom and forcing him to sell his store cheaply. He later relents a bit and offers Tom a deal that will let him break even as well as get a small portion of \"Tommy's Closet\" revenues going forward, which Tom glumly accepts. He is also the doctor whom Ann and Chris go to while the former is pregnant. In the season six finale, he shows up to the opening of Tom's Bistro (Tom is aghast to see him, but Mona-Lisa cluelessly followed up on Tom's request to bring in big names) and is happy when it appears the restaurant is going to flop. However, he later states the food is incredible and asks Tom if he can be a minority investor, to which Tom coolly replies that he will give Dr. Saperstein's offer some time and thought.\n\n===Orin===\nOrin (Eric Isenhower) is the creepy and intense friend of April Ludgate. He seldom speaks and often stares at people and makes them feel awkward. He first appeared in \"April and Andy's Fancy Party\", where he made Ben feel uncomfortable; at one point Ben said to him, \"No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die.

This marked the first time someone on the show directly let Orin know they didn't like him. When he applied for the job of Animal Control director in Season 5, his resume contained one word: his name, in regular font. Leslie told him to go away, and after April asked him what qualified him to work in animal control, and he responded, \"I studied zoology in college. And I can control animals with my mind\", to which Leslie curtly says he will not be hired and repeats that he needs to get lost, which he does. He appeared briefly in Season 6 twice, in the episode \"[[Ann and Chris]]\" dressed up as the Easter Bunny at Ann and Chris's going away party and in the episode \"[[Parks and Recreation (season 6)#ep108|Prom]]\" pretending to be April's mom when Andy picked her up to go to the senior [[prom]].\n\n===Tammy Swanson (Tammy I)===\n[[File:Patricia Clarkson 2009 Whatever Works portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Patricia Clarkson]]]]\n\nTammy Swanson ([[Patricia Clarkson]]) is the first ex-wife of Ron Swanson. Ron has been married to two different women, both named Tammy, and he hates and fears both of them. Ron explains that Tammy had been present throughout most of his young life: she delivered him as a baby, was his teacher, and she even took his virginity. Tammy returns as an [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] agent who arrives at the end of [[Parks and Recreation (season 3)|the third season]] (although she is not shown to the audience until [[I'm Leslie Knope|the fourth-season premiere]]) to audit Ron. Both Ron and his second wife named Tammy panic at the news of her arrival, and Ron attempts to flee before deciding to return to face her. Leslie then enlists Ron's eccentric mother (also named Tammy) in a drinking contest to drive Tammy I away once and for all. Since Tammy I's claim she was auditing Ron was a lie designed to let her search for his hidden gold, she ends up leaving with nothing, as Ron had deliberately put a tiny amount of gold out as a decoy, and was happy to sacrifice it in order to get rid of Tammy I.\n\n===Tammy Swanson (Tammy II)===\n[[File:Megan Mullally by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nick Offerman]]'s real-life wife [[Megan Mullally]] played Ron's ex-wife Tammy.]]\n\nTammy Swanson ([[Megan Mullally]]) is the second ex-wife of Ron Swanson.

She is a junior high school vice principal and a single mother of two young girls, Ivy (Sadie Salizar) and Zoey (Rylan Lee). Ron Swanson meets her when he goes to fix a [[pothole]] in front of her house (since the Department of Public Works had been ignoring her complaints, Ron decided to simply take the matter into his own hands). Diane is far from Ron's usual \"type\". She's not named \"Tammy\" and she has two small girls. Ron is not good with children, or more specifically, with little girls (Ron had previously taken teenage and pre-teen boys camping to teach them survival skills, and also coached a basketball team). After he fixes the pothole, Diane's girls put makeup on Ron and Andy's faces (Ron had taken Andy with him to help fix the pothole), and have a little girl's tea party with them, which Ron tolerates surprisingly well. Ron really likes Diane and in episode 5 of season 5 (\"Halloween Surprise\") begins a dating relationship with her, deciding that dealing with a single mother and her girls might help him to expand his life experience. Diane, in return, in the episode \"Ron and Diane\", shows an impressive level of patience and understanding at Tammy II's psychotic attempts to ruin her relationship with Ron. In a private conversation with Leslie, Diane admits that she feels more threatened by Leslie than by Tammy II, as she feels that Leslie knows Ron in a way that she never can. When she confesses this fear to Ron, he assures her that, while Leslie is a loyal friend and colleague, he could never have any romantic feelings towards her. Then, to prove his commitment to Diane, he reveals to her his Duke Silver identity (a night club saxophone player, something even Leslie didn't know), and he plays Diane a song, naming her as his \"duchess\". In the same episode, Leslie decides that Diane is a good guardian of Ron's well-being and a shield against the disruptive antics of Tammy II. Later, during the episode \"Women in Garbage\", Ron is babysitting her daughters in the office with Ann, and accidentally allows them to lock themselves in his office with the contents of Ann's medical bag. The girls cut each other's hair before Ron and Ann can stop them, which destroys their hairstyles. Ron and Ann are horrified by this, and when Ron considers Diane's potential reaction, he blurts out to Ann that he has fallen in love with Diane (a statement he immediately tries to take back). Diane, however, is understanding of the accident, saying that it was just kids being kids. She tells him that she is touched by how much he cared, and that she loves him. Ron sheepishly admits that he loves her as well. It is implied at the end of the fifth season that Diane may be pregnant. In the beginning of the first episode of the sixth season, Diane confirms her pregnancy and Ron proposes marriage to which she accepts under one condition: that the wedding be as plain as possible. With that in mind, the two head up to the fourth floor with Leslie and April in tow. Leslie is asked to be the matron of honour and April appoints herself as Ron's 'Best Man'. The two are married in an extremely fast-paced wedding filmed on April's phone and with highlighter pens acting as a bouquet. Later on in the episode where Leslie, Ron, April and Andy are in London, it is revealed that Diane suggested tagging along to make the trip hers and Ron's honeymoon; however, her morning sickness meant that she couldn't go and Ron had to take plenty of photos for her. Ron and Diane's baby, John Swanson, is born later in the season.\nAlthough Diane does not appear in Season 7, she is frequently mentioned as still being married to Ron.\n\n===Gayle Gergich===\nGayle Gergich ([[Christie Brinkley]]) is Jerry's inexplicably gorgeous wife, as well as the mother of their equally gorgeous daughters Millicent, Miriam, and Gladys. Gayle has a solid and overly-affectionate relationship with Jerry, puzzling to his coworkers. She is referenced until she makes an appearance in \"Ron and Diane\". She also appears again in \"Jerry's Retirement.\"\n\n===Millicent Gergich===\nMillicent \"Millie\" Gergich ([[Sarah Wright]]) is the gorgeous daughter of Gayle and Jerry. She was introduced in season 4 as Chris's love interest. In \"Bowling for Votes\", Chris mentions his plans to move in with Millicent, but she breaks up with him off screen that same episode. In \"Ron and Diane\" it's revealed that Millicent is engaged to a rafting instructor named Carl. She makes another appearance in \"Jerry's Retirement.\"\n\n===Gladys Gergich===\nGladys Gergich (Katie Gill) is one of Gayle and Jerry's other daughters. She first appears in \"Ron and Diane\", singing Christmas carols with her mother, father, and sister, Miriam. She also appears again in \"Jerry's Retirement.\"\n\n===Miriam Gergich===\nMiriam Gergich (Maliabeth Johnson) is one of Gayle and Jerry's other daughters. She first appears in \"Ron and Diane\", singing Christmas carols with her mother, father, and Gladys. She also appears again in \"Jerry's retirement.\"\n\n===Typhoon Montalban===\nNorman \"Typhoon\" Montalban ([[Rodney To]]) is a hairdresser in Pawnee who marries [[Craig Middlebrooks]] ([[Billy Eichner]]) in the flash forwards of the season finale. Typhoon was introduced in the 5th episode of Season 6 as Donna's hairdresser after she recommends him to Ron, following the passing of Ron's former regular barber. Ron is at first reluctant to take on a new stylist, but bonds with Typhoon over their shared hatred of Europe and bicycles. He appears again in the 7th episode of Season 7 as Donna's stylist for her wedding, and again in the final episode when he marries Craig. Ron is shown to be the best man at their wedding.\n\n==Elected officials and city employees==\n\n===Bill Dexhart===\n[[File:Kevin Symons 2.JPG|thumb|175 px|right|[[Kevin Symons]] portrays Pawnee Councilman Bill Dexhart.|alt=A brown-haired man wearing a brown fleece jacket looks directly ahead.]]\n\nBill Dexhart ([[Kevin Symons]]) is a Pawnee councilman who regularly participates in outrageous sex scandals with multiple partners.<ref name=\"Heisler1108\" /><ref name=\"Fowler1211\" /> His character was inspired by [[South Carolina]] [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Mark Sanford]] and his [[Mark Sanford disappearance and extramarital affair|2009 scandal]], in which he admitted to a long-time extramarital affair with an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] woman. Dexhart first appeared in \"Practice Date\", when he publicly admitted to having participated in a [[foursome (group sex)|foursome]] in a [[Brazil]] cave under the guise of building houses for the underprivileged.<ref name=\"Heisler1108\" /> Dexhart was featured prominently in \"Christmas Scandal\", which began with Leslie portraying him in a satirical holiday skit in which he discussed his an affair with multiple women that resulted in a love child. Unbeknownst to Leslie, Dexhart turned out to be involved in a sexual arrangement very similar to that one: four-way sex in a hospital room where he has just overseen the birth of his love child. When he confronted her about it, members of the media took pictures of Leslie and Dexhart together and speculated that the two of them were having an affair. Dexhart refused to deny the allegations, and even went so far as to confirm them, because the fictional affair was less scandalous than his actual sexual discretions. As proof of the affair, he claimed Leslie had a mole on her right buttock, but she publicly proved him wrong by dropping her pants on live television and revealing there is no mole. In Season 5 he was something of a swing vote for Leslie on the City Council because he was less likely to fully support her than Howser, but also less likely to thoughtlessly oppose her than either Milton or Jamm.<ref name=\"Fowler1211\" /><ref name=\"Pierce1211\" /> That has changed during the recall campaign against Leslie in Season 6, as Dexhart has cheerfully joined Jamm in blocking any initiatives by her and making it clear they both hope she is booted from office. In the episode \"Second Chunce\", Dexhart publicly confesses to \"texting, sexting and [[Tex-Mex]]ting\" approximately one hundred women under a series of implausible pseudonyms, parodying the [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandals]]. In fact, \"[[Anthony Weiner]]\" is the last in the list of pseudonyms Dexhart reads out at a press conference. Leslie briefly considers running for his seat after being impeached, but is dissuaded by Jennifer Barkley.\nThe district that Dexhart is in charge of is a run-down, crime-ridden part of town that he had promised to clean up, but his only action has been to rename it Beach View Terrace.\n\n===Carl Lorthner===\nCarl Lorthner ([[Andy Samberg]])<ref>{{cite news|last=Harris |first=Bill |title=Samberg reunites with former SNLer |date=March 17, 2010 |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/tv/2010/03/17/13266786.html |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xCmp6Jyl?url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/tv/2010/03/17/13266786.html |archivedate=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> is a [[park ranger]] and the head of outdoor security for Pawnee.

The chief agreed to Leslie's request that he release him to Leslie's custody. Ben feared Leslie cashing in this favor meant the chief would not agree to provide security for the upcoming harvest festival, but Chief Trumple agreed to do so anyway out of his respect for Leslie, telling Ben he will always do favors for Leslie because she is the kind of person who uses those favors to help people.<ref name=\"Sundermann0211\" /><ref name=\"Sepinwall0210\" /> The chief reappeared in the episode \"[[Eagleton (Parks and Recreation)|Eagleton]]\", where he arrested Leslie when she refused to apologize after getting in a fight with [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Lindsay Carlisle Shay|Lindsay Carlisle Shay]], her rival from the neighboring city of Eagleton.<ref name=\"Meslow0506\" /> Trumple retired as police chief in Season 4.\n\n===Jeremy Jamm===\nAn orthodontist by day, Jamm ([[Jon Glaser]]) is a member of the Pawnee City Council, and has made himself Leslie's major nemesis. He also appears to have a grudge against the entire Parks Department, angry over the fact that Leslie ruined his Paunch Burger plan. Tom shoved him into a swimming pool, Ann refused to sleep with him, and Ron punched him in the mouth. After fighting with Leslie over the use of her private bathroom for her office, he becomes a continual thorn in Leslie's side for any proposal she makes. His catch phrase, \"you just got Jammed,\" is used whenever he one-ups Leslie or any other adversary. He failed to turn Lot 48 into a new Paunch Burger restaurant when Leslie won over the city planning committee and got the Pawnee Commons park project approved, leading to him getting drunk and temporarily ruining Ben and Leslie's impromptu on-site wedding. Afterward, he was punched by Ron Swanson; both of them were thrown in jail but Ron was quickly released while Jamm was left to sober up in his cell, and the wedding took place at City Hall. He then sued Ron and it looked he would win, but Tom, Andy and April threatened a similarly bogus lawsuit that Jamm knew he would lose, so both sides backed off. When Leslie is under political pressure to resign, Jamm complicates Leslie's role on the council by teaming up with councilman Dexhart and voting down any proposal Leslie has, to spite her. When Donna Meagle accidentally sends a sexually suggestive tweet from the department [[Twitter]], Jamm uses this as an opportunity to hold public hearings that put Leslie's ethics into question. After he holds a series of hearings to drag out Leslie's ordeal, Leslie publicly stands up to Jamm and says that she's going to get back to work as a councilwoman and won't attend any more of the hearings. In the season six finale, Jamm is shown at the Pawnee/Eagleton unity concert leading a secession effort.\nJamm reappears in the Season 7 episode \"Ron and Jammy\", where he is revealed to be dating Tammy, Ron's second ex-wife. Leslie and Ron are feuding over the Newport land rights at this time, and Jamm is the swing vote on the issue. Leslie initially sees the relationship as an advantage, since Tammy would influence Jamm to vote against Ron; however, it becomes apparent that being with Tammy is detrimental to Jamm's physical and mental well-being. Leslie and Ron decide to put aside their differences and successfully coach Jamm into breaking up with her. Jamm then abstains from the land rights vote, leaving the issue deadlocked.\n\n===Fielding Milton===\nMilton ([[James Greene (American actor)|James Greene]]) is the longest-serving Pawnee Councilman, having been elected in 1948 as a [[Dixiecrat]] largely due to his commitment to de-integrating [[Major League Baseball]], as well as a plan to re-open a former WWII Japanese-American Internment Camp in Pawnee and get it back up to speed.<ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes |title=James Greene, 'Parks and Recreation' Actor and Broadway Veteran, Dies at 91 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-greene-dead-parks-recreation-actor-broadway-veteran-was-91-1161409 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2018-11-14 |accessdate=2018-12-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122093424/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-greene-dead-parks-recreation-actor-broadway-veteran-was-91-1161409|archivedate=2018-11-22 |url-status=live}}</ref> He is generally senile except on matters of racism and sexism, where his memory seems to be intact (he was able to calculate when Leslie Knope's next menstrual period would start during \"Women in Garbage\"), and he has generally\u2014though not always\u2014been on the other side of Leslie's initiatives.\n\n===Joe Fantringham===\n[[File:Kirk fox purple background.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stand-up comedian [[Kirk Fox]] portrays Joe Fantrigham, who works in the Pawnee sewage department.|alt=A man with brown hair and a brown mustache wearing a blue denim jacket looks directly ahead.]]\n\nJoe Fantringham ([[Kirk Fox]]), also sometimes called \"Sewage Joe\",<ref name=\"Busis0513\" /> works for the Pawnee sewer department, which he calls the \"Toilet Party\".<ref name=\"Fowler0421\">{{cite news|last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: \"Soulmates\" Review |work=IGN |date=April 21, 2011 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/04/22/parks-and-recreation-soulmates-review|accessdate=December 5, 2019 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zfh3lCZu?url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/116/1163086p1.html |archivedate=June 24, 2011}}</ref> Despite the nature of his department, Joe regularly hires supermodel-like interns.<ref name=\"Pierce1112\">{{cite news |last=Pierce |first=Leonard |title=Parks and Recreation: \"The Camel\" |work=[[The A.V.

In the final season, set in 2017, Perd Hapley announces Mayor Gunderson's death and an open-casket memorial is held in the city council chambers. In a video Gunderson assigned to be shown at his funeral, he remarks at how little attention he had been paying, and that he would take credit if any needed to be taken. He then points out that if there was any blame, it was the citizens' fault. His last statement is \"Goodbye forever.\" This posthumous appearance by Bill Murray as Gunderson, is the only time he is seen on ''Parks and Recreation'', although he had been mentioned in multiple episodes of the show. He was first mentioned in \"Christmas Scandal\", when the parks and recreation department held a satirical holiday skit full of inside jokes about Pawnee, and April declared, \"That's crazier than Mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus.\"<ref name=\"Pierce1211\" /> He is also mentioned in the episode \"[[Leslie's House]],\" when Mark asks everyone if they heard about the incident involving his dog, prompting Ron to say, \"Oh my god, it was a bloodbath.\" Mark later adds that as a result of the incident, someone from animal services would be fired. The mayor and his dog played a major part in the episode \"[[The Possum (Parks and Recreation)|The Possum]]\", when Mayor Gunderson's assistant ordered the parks department to capture an [[opossum]] that bit Rufus on a Pawnee golf course.<ref name=\"Pierce0311\">{{cite news |last=Pierce |first=Leonard |title=Parks and Recreation: \"The Possum\" |work=[[The A.V.

He became hospitalized, and Scott encouraged Leslie not to apologize or admit fault in the incident because it would risk Pawnee getting sued. Scott constantly admonished Leslie when she tries to apologize, at one point shouting, \"No miming!\" when she made a motion indicating how bad she feels.

In a flash-forward, Shauna is shown to have been left at the altar in 2018, crying on a park bench. Bobby Newport walks by and consoles her, and five hours later the two are happily married.

Unfortunately for Kim, Leslie and Donna find proof that Kim has illegally hacked into Leslie's e-mails, when Leslie sends a bait message about \"midichlorians\" in the soil near the Pawnee Commons project. Kim asks a question about the \"news\" only to have Leslie bluntly tell her that the substance in question is from ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' and she's just revealed that she's broken the law.

He idolizes Ben Wyatt, laughing raucously when Ben makes accounting puns and often calling in an unseen character named Ted to hear the pun after he laughs at it. In later seasons, he offers Ben a job at his accounting firm on multiple occasions, however, Ben develops a pattern of accepting the job and then almost immediately quitting due to outside circumstances.

One of Marcia's odd personality quirks is that she seems completely unaware of the fact that her husband, Marshall, is possibly gay or bisexual, as he has a flamboyant personality and speaks with an effeminate voice. Marshall's sexuality was never confirmed, but, when speaking to Chris Traeger, he smiles in a way that could be interpreted as attraction.\n\n===Newport family===\nThe Newport family are the owners of the Sweetums candy manufacturer in Pawnee and one of the city's richest and most prominent families. The company has operated and thrived in the city for years, as indicated in the episode \"[[Sweetums (Parks and Recreation)|Sweetums]]\", where Leslie screened 30-year-old video footage of a then-young Nick Newport, Sr. discussing how corn syrup was used to fatten cattle at farms.<ref name=\"Heisler0206\" /> By the time of ''Parks and Recreation'', Nick Newport, Sr. ([[Christopher Murray (actor)|Christopher Murray]]) is an elderly man in a wheelchair so senile he can barely speak,<ref name=\"Kandell0430\" /> and the company is run by his son Nick Newport, Jr. ([[Gary Weeks]]), who himself appears in Sweetums commercials along with his two children, Dakota (Harley Graham) and Denver (Ryan Hartwig).

Jessica made major alterations to the historic mansion, and Leslie unsuccessfully tried to intervene to stop her.<ref name=\"Kandell0430\" />\n\n===Bobby Newport===\nNewport ([[Paul Rudd]]) is Leslie's chief opponent in her fourth season campaign for City Council. Bobby would appear to be the second son of Nick Newport, Sr., who paid $250,000 to his campaign manager ([[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Jennifer Barkley|Jennifer Barkley]]) in order to get Bobby elected. Bobby Newport is friendly and [[superficially charming]], but extremely naive and clueless (he at times acts [[mentally handicapped]] despite the fact that he isn't), and has been completely spoiled by his privileged upbringing. When Leslie puts together a viral video that makes him look pathetic and stupid (in lieu of a nasty attack ad she ultimately refused to air), Bobby has a meeting where he complains she hurt his feelings, then asks her to drop out of the election and simply hand the office to him. He also tells Leslie he'll give her an invitation to his victory party, and even offers to let her do the job for him once he's elected. He spends much of the campaign away from Pawnee, and gets involved in a sex scandal while vacationing in [[Majorca]]. He returns to debate Leslie, and during their debate, Bobby first appears to be in the lead by saying short quips rather than longer speeches, but Leslie eventually attacks his character and wins the debate. Afterwards, Bobby congratulates her performance during the debate and asks her if she would like to come to his house for a party. After Leslie connects with him upon the death of his father, he tells reporters people who don't vote for him should definitely vote for her, and then says on TV that he's very relieved he lost the election to her. He is later considered a possible candidate for interim mayor after Mayor Gunderson dies. In the extended edition of the series finale, he is revealed to have married Shauna Malwae-Tweep.\n\n===Trish Ianetta===\nTrish Ianetta (April Marie Eden) is an attractive young woman who won the title Miss Pawnee in \"Beauty Pageant\". She gave unintelligent answers during the pageant and displayed no actual talent: during her talent portion, she did a [[baton twirling]] act that involved simply moving the baton around without twirling it.<ref name=\"Fog1002\" /><ref name=\"Heisler1020\" /> In describing herself, she says, \"I've been on [[YouTube]]. I love wearing bikinis at the beach with everyone there.\" Trish has been compared to [[Caitlin Upton]], the 2007 [[Miss South Carolina Teen USA]] who made an incoherent response during the [[Miss Teen USA 2007]] pageant. Based solely on her physical attractiveness, Trish was favored by the panel of judges, which included Tom Haverford and Jessica Wicks. Only Leslie objected to Trish and unsuccessfully argued for Susan, an intelligent and talented contestant who was less pretty.<ref name=\"Fog1002\" /> Trish made another appearance in \"The Master Plan\", where she was among the girls Tom tried to flirt with during a night at the Snakehole Lounge bar.<ref name=\"SchurrMPComm\" />\n\n===Greg Pikitis===\nGreg Pikitis ([[Cody Klop]]), a teenage boy living in [[Pawnee, Indiana]], is Leslie's mortal enemy. His first appearance is in \"[[Greg Pikitis]],\" in which Leslie is determined to put a stop to his yearly Halloween tee-peeing of a statue. In response, Greg sneaks into the Parks department and vandalizes the offices. After several intricate mind games and plans, Leslie and Dave catch him in the act, and he is given probation for his crimes. He reappears in \"Prom\" in season 6, where Leslie is horrified to learn that he is the boyfriend of a girl she has been mentoring.\n\n===Ron Dunn===\nRon Dunn ([[Sam Elliott]]) is the former director of Eagleton's parks department, the equivalent position of Ron Swanson's in Pawnee. In the Season 6 episode \"Doppelgangers\", he was brought over to the Pawnee offices along with other Eagleton employees when the towns merged. Swanson at first took a liking to Dunn, as the latter was mustachioed, taciturn and also named Ron. However, Dunn later revealed himself to be a [[hippie]] with [[New Age]] ideals, and Swanson found him insufferable.\nDunn was laid off along with most other Eagleton employees (excepting Craig), which he took in stride. He reappeared in \"Flu Season 2\", where Swanson and a drunk Ben encounter him at night, and he helps Ben overcome his anger at his parents' selling their vacation home. His final appearance is in the Season 7 episode \"Two Funerals\".\n\n===Tynnyfer===\nTynnyfer ([[June Diane Raphael]]) is a former employee of Eagleton's parks department whose position was the equivalent of April's. In the Season 6 episode \"Doppelgangers\", she was brought over during the Pawnee-Eagleton merger. She is a stereotypical vacuous, rich housewife. With the inevitability of one of them being laid off, April ingratiated herself to Tynnyfer by mirroring her personality and vocal inflections, and encouraged her to quit her job. Tynnyfer replied that she was planning on doing that anyway, as she wanted to move somewhere warmer while her husband served time in prison. April gave her an address in Miami that she claimed was hers, and said Tynnyfer was welcome to climb over the fence and stay there. April then revealed in a cutaway that the house belongs to [[Dwyane Wade]] and she got the address off the Internet.\n\n===Dr. Richard Nygard===\nDr. Richard Nygard is a character who is mentioned several times, but never appears on screen. He is first mentioned to be Chris's therapist, whom he sees near constantly. Chris's anxiety improves under his care. Later Leslie recommends Dr. Nygard to a troubled Malwae-Tweep, but then comments that she is not completely certain he isn't an imaginary creation of Chris's. Later, however, it is confirmed that he is a real person because he also acts as the off-screen therapist to Craig Middlebrooks.\n\n===Pete Disellio===\n\"Pistol Pete\" Disellio ([[Tuc Watkins]]) is a local celebrity, only remembered for his last-second game-winning dunk in the annual Pawnee-Eagleton high school basketball game in 1992. As a middle-aged man he resents the fact that everyone in town still sees him this way. He appears in three episodes across Seasons 4\u20136, during which Leslie secures his endorsement for City Council, Ann considers him as a sperm donor, and Pete refuses to endorse Sweetums' new sports drink.\n\n==People from outside Pawnee==\n\n===Dennis Feinstein===\n\nDennis ([[Jason Mantzoukas]]) is one of Pawnee's wealthiest citizens, the arrogant and unpleasant owner of a successful perfume company. He changed his original name, Dante Fiero, to something considered \"more exotic in Pawnee.\" First appearing in Season 3's \"Indianapolis\", Dennis Feinstein  is at The Snakehole Lounge for his \"Allergic\" cologne launch party. Tom Haverford attempts to pitch his cologne to Dennis while there. Dennis laughs at him when Tom sprays the cologne, telling him it smells terrible, and dismisses him. In season 7, Feinstein buys out JJ's Diner, completely unsympathetic to the townspeople's protests.\n\n===Detlef Schrempf===\n[[Detlef Schrempf]] is a real-life retired basketball player for the [[Indiana Pacers]] who portrays himself on ''Parks and Recreation''. He first appeared in \"Telethon\", where Leslie invited him to make a guest appearance on a 24-hour diabetes telethon. Tom picked him up from the airport, but first took him for a drink to the Snakehole Lounge, where Detlef proved so popular that bar owner Freddy would not let them leave. After Tom got drunk on two [[low alcohol beer|light beers]], Detlef took him to the telethon, where he made his scheduled appearance.<ref name=\"Fowler0506\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Kandell |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation Recap: Diabetes, Yuck! |work=Vulture|date=May 7, 2010 |url=https://www.vulture.com/2010/05/parks_and_recreation_telethon.html|accessdate=December 5, 2019|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xVSOD2uD?url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/05/parks_and_recreation_telethon.html |archivedate=March 27, 2011}}</ref> Detlef made another appearance in the third-season finale \"Li'l Sebastian\", where Tom and Jean-Ralphio hired him to work for their new entertainment company, Entertainment 720.

They had a two-week affair before going their separate ways.<ref name=\"Gallagher0213\" /> Decades later, Marlene shared the story of her long-lost love with Leslie, and Leslie's boyfriend Justin Anderson insisted they find Frank and surprise Marlene by reuniting the pair. Leslie was initially pleased with the idea, and together they tracked Frank to his new home in [[Illinois]].

Jhonny is very excited about [[April Ludgate]] ([[Aubrey Plaza]]). Jhonny tries to approach April and go out with her to know the city, besides showing her interest to invite her to travel with Jhonny to his city in Venezuela. Jhonny invites her to go with him to Venezuela, his country and attend her like a princess full of luxuries and acts. During his stay, one night Jhonny sends a car to April to pick her up and take her to be with him but she uses the car to go to the movies with her friends.<ref name=\"Fowler1016\" /><ref name=\"Havrilesky1104\"/>\n\n===Jennifer Barkley===\nJennifer Barkley ([[Kathryn Hahn]]) is an extremely successful political operative who has taken over the City Council campaign of Bobby Newport after being promised $250,000 by the Newport family. She awed Leslie by appearing in a picture where she's sharing an egg salad with [[Colin Powell]]. Jennifer tells Leslie that she's bored and took this job for the money, not much caring who wins and finding Bobby to be stupid. While it appears she's being honest about this, she later trashes Leslie in a TV interview, edits Leslie's successful YouTube campaign ad to make her sound like an idiot, and swipes Leslie's building-ramp plan in favor of an electric lifts plan that leads Pawnee senior citizen powerbroker Ned Jones (played by Carl Reiner) to endorse Bobby. Leslie later confronts Jennifer at her favorite restaurant, where Jennifer says bluntly she likes Leslie but has been hired to defeat her. Jennifer then gives Leslie some genuinely good advice about upcoming decisions, and tells the camera that she is doing so because she has no one to play chess with and \"sometimes I need to play against myself\". Jennifer appears to keep her work and her personal feelings separate, given that she's able to relate to people when she's not working a campaign. When Leslie appears on Perd Hapley's show to reveal that Bobby Newport has been avoiding his hometown in favor of making out with a woman on a [[Majorca]] beach, Jennifer says that Bobby is in Europe to get business opportunities for Pawnee and the woman is an anti-landmine advocate. Afterwards, she tells Leslie and Ben that she \"mostly\" made all that up, then details how she'll be able to spin any outrage from them in Bobby's favor. Leslie and Ben are left completely stunned by Jennifer's mercenary brilliance. However, Leslie and Ben are finally able to knock her off balance a little bit after Jennifer goes on Perd's TV show and says Leslie ordered a pet shelter closed (after Leslie had asked a retiring Councilman to reverse a funding cut for the Parks Department); after she's overjoyed with Leslie's idea that the Newport family use their wealth to fund the shelter, Leslie explains that she'll accept the initial funding cut if Jennifer breaks a promise to stop airing \"puppy killer\" ads, and that she's fine with losing a week's news momentum because she's debating Bobby Newport after that and she's going to ruin him. Jennifer's expression makes it clear Leslie has finally scored some points against her. But after Leslie does score a huge victory over Bobby in the debate and pulls within 2 points of him in the polls, Jennifer strikes back by using the death of Nick Newport (and Leslie's comments, made before she learned he had died, that Nick was a jerk) to force Leslie into several embarrassing mistakes. However, Jennifer finds out that she might not get any of her promised quarter-million fee due to her handshake deal with Nick, and watches as Bobby manages to tell the press that Leslie is an awesome person. The campaign having ended, Jennifer seeks out Chris Traeger and invites him to have sex with her, and he accepts. On Election Night, she tries and fails to keep pro-Newport voting machines in place, and later is rebuffed when she doesn't want an automatic recount to be triggered by Bobby's initial 21-vote victory margin. Recognizing Ben's talent on Leslie's campaign, she offers Ben a job working with her on a Congressional campaign (he eventually accepts it) and has sex with Chris again but leaves Pawnee without saying goodbye to him. When that campaign successfully ends in Washington D.C., she offers Ben another campaign job for a governor candidate in Florida. She appears again in Season 6 (\"Second Chunce\") to convince Leslie (as a paid favor to Ben) not to run for Dexhart's seat in the city council, but to reach for the stars and to look for a more high-powered job. Leslie said it was the best present she could have received (from Ben).\nShe makes several more appearances in the seventh and final season, encouraging Ben to run for governor of Indiana.\n\n===Buddy Wood===\nBuddy Wood ([[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]]) is a journalist from [[Indianapolis]] that does an annual special where he profiles five political candidates from around Indiana. The candidates he profiles tend to get elected, causing him to be described as a \"lucky charm\" for people running for office. Buddy interviews Leslie, but this doesn't go well because she is drunk, and Wood tries to turn the story to Pawnee not being as great as it once was. Leslie and Ben consider him to be rude, but they still drive to Buddy Wood's house to beg him for either a second chance for an interview or for him to erase the negative footage; Buddy then sourly reveals that he never aired the interview because his bag was lost in Pawnee, unaware that one of the airport workers, who liked Leslie and was angered by Buddy's rude attitude, took the interview tape and threw it into a dumpster.<ref>{{cite web|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff |url=https://tv.avclub.com/parks-and-recreation-lucky-1798171911|title=Parks And Recreation: \"Lucky\"|work=The A.V.

However, the university did not have the authority to grant degrees in theology, considered the senior faculty in the other three English universities. In medicine, the university was given the right to determine which medical schools provided sufficient medical training. In arts and law, by contrast, it would examine students from UCL, King's College, or any other school or college granted a royal warrant, effectively giving the government control of which colleges could affiliate to the university. Beyond the right to submit students for examination, there was no other connection between the affiliated colleges and the university.\n\nIn 1849 the university held its first graduation ceremony at [[Somerset House]] following a petition to the senate from the graduates, who had previously received their degrees without any ceremony. About 250 students graduated at this ceremony.

Following two [[royal commission]]s the University of London Act 1898 was passed, reforming the university and giving it a federal structure with responsibility for monitoring course content and academic standards within its institutions.

[[Regent's Park College]], which had affiliated in 1841, became an official divinity school of the university in 1901 (the new statutes having given London the right to award degrees in theology) and [[Richmond Theological College|Richmond (Theological) College]] followed as a divinity school of the university in 1902; [[Goldsmiths College, University of London|Goldsmiths College]] joined in 1904; [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] was founded in 1907; [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]] joined in 1915; the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] was founded in 1916; and [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], which was founded in 1823, joined in 1920.\n\nThe previous provision for colleges outside London was not abandoned on federation, instead London offered two routes to degrees: \"internal\" degrees offered by schools of the university and \"external\" degrees offered at other colleges (now the [[University of London (Worldwide)|University of London flexible and distance learning programmes]]).\n\nUCL and King's College, whose campaign for a teaching university in London had resulted in the university's reconstitution as a federal institution, went even further than becoming schools of the university and were actually merged into it. UCL's merger, under the 1905 University College London (Transfer) Act, happened in 1907. The charter of 1836 was surrendered and all of UCL's property became the University of London's. King's College followed in 1910 under the 1908 King's College London (Transfer) Act. This was a slightly more complicated case, as the theological department of the college (founded in 1846) did not merge into the university but maintained a separate legal existence under King's College's 1829 charter.<ref>{{cite book|title=University of London, the Historical Record: (1836\u20131912)|publisher=University of London|date=1912|pages=7\u201324|url=https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=vyPiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA7&focus=viewport&output=html}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the university's role meant that the Burlington Garden premises were insufficient, and in March 1900 it moved to the Imperial Institute in South Kensington.<ref name=\"google6\">{{cite book|title=The University of London, 1858-1900: The Politics of Senate and Convocation|author=Willson, F.M.G.|date=2004|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=9781843830658|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NOd3N6291CQC&pg=PA8|page=8|accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref> However, its continued rapid expansion meant that it had outgrown its new premises by the 1920s, requiring yet another move.

In the same period, UCL and King's College regained their legal independence via acts of parliament and the issuing of new royal charters. UCL was reincorporate in 1977, while King's College's new charter in 1980 reunited the main body of the college with the corporation formed in 1829.

Some of the larger colleges (most notably UCL, King's College, LSE and Imperial) periodically put forward the possibility of their departure from the university, although no steps were taken to actually putting this into action until the early 21st century.\n\n[[File:Imperial Institute.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute]] Building in South Kensington, home to the university from 1900 to 1937]]\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2002, [[Imperial College]] and [[University College London|UCL]] mooted the possibility of a merger, raising the question of the future of the University of London and the smaller colleges within it.

After over a year of high-profile strikes, protests and occupations, concessions were made by the university in terms of sick pay and holidays, however these improvements were nowhere near to the extent of what was being demanded by the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://3cosascampaign.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|date=24 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, after a student occupation in favour of ten demands, including fair pay for workers, a halt to privatisation of the university and an end to plans to shut down the university's student union [[ULU]], police were called, resulting in the violent eviction and arrests of over 60 students, as well as police violence towards students outside supporting the occupation.<ref>{{cite

gained national media attention after a video of university staff drilling shut a fire door to trap students in a room they had occupied, putting them at serious risk of harm, was viewed over 19,000 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/JusticeforUOLWorkers/videos/225038318236742/|title=University of London have sealed us into the Chancellor's Hall|via=www.facebook.com}}</ref> Video

Media|Vice]] that reported the militarisation of the university campus at Senate House, where over 25 extra security had been brought in, with students known to be involved in political campaigns being barred from using university facilities, as well as being verbally, physically and sexually assaulted by temporary security staff.<ref>{{cite

Union of Great Britain]] called for a boycott of events at the university's central administration buildings, including Senate House, with the aim of putting pressure on the University of London to bring outsourced cleaning, catering and security staff in-house by targeting a revenue stream worth around \u00a340 million per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Largest university in UK hit by boycott over

In medicine, the university was given the right to determine which medical schools provided sufficient medical training. In arts and law, by contrast, it would examine students from UCL, King's College, or any other school or college granted a royal warrant, effectively giving the government control of which colleges could affiliate to the university. Beyond the right to submit students for examination, there was no other connection between the affiliated colleges and the university.\n\nIn 1849 the university held its first graduation ceremony at [[Somerset House]] following a petition to the senate from the graduates, who had previously received their degrees without any ceremony.

UCL and KCL considered separating from the university to form a separate university, variously known as the Albert University, Gresham University and Westminster University. Following two [[royal commission]]s the University of London Act 1898 was passed, reforming the university and giving it a federal structure with responsibility for monitoring course content and academic standards within its institutions.

Many of the colleges in London became schools of the university, including UCL, King's College, [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]], [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] and the [[London School of Economics]]. [[Regent's Park College]], which had affiliated in 1841, became an official divinity school of the university in 1901 (the new statutes having given London the right to award degrees in theology) and [[Richmond Theological College|Richmond (Theological) College]] followed as a divinity school of the university in 1902; [[Goldsmiths College, University of London|Goldsmiths College]] joined in 1904; [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] was founded in 1907; [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]] joined in 1915; the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] was founded in 1916; and [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], which was founded in 1823, joined in 1920.\n\nThe previous provision for colleges outside London was not abandoned on federation, instead London offered two routes to degrees: \"internal\" degrees offered by schools of the university and \"external\" degrees offered at other colleges (now the [[University of London (Worldwide)|University of London flexible and distance learning programmes]]).\n\nUCL and King's College, whose campaign for a teaching university in London had resulted in the university's reconstitution as a federal institution, went even further than becoming schools of the university and were actually merged into it. UCL's merger, under the 1905 University College London (Transfer) Act, happened in 1907. The charter of 1836 was surrendered and all of UCL's property became the University of London's. King's College followed in 1910 under the 1908 King's College London (Transfer) Act.

In the same period, UCL and King's College regained their legal independence via acts of parliament and the issuing of new royal charters. UCL was reincorporate in 1977, while King's College's new charter in 1980 reunited the main body of the college with the corporation formed in 1829.

Some of the larger colleges (most notably UCL, King's College, LSE and Imperial) periodically put forward the possibility of their departure from the university, although no steps were taken to actually putting this into action until the early 21st century.\n\n[[File:Imperial Institute.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute]] Building in South Kensington, home to the university from 1900 to 1937]]\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2002, [[Imperial College]] and [[University College London|UCL]] mooted the possibility of a merger, raising the question of the future of the University of London and the smaller colleges within it.

After over a year of high-profile strikes, protests and occupations, concessions were made by the university in terms of sick pay and holidays, however these improvements were nowhere near to the extent of what was being demanded by the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://3cosascampaign.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|date=24 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, after a student occupation in favour of ten demands, including fair pay for workers, a halt to privatisation of the university and an end to plans to shut down the university's student union [[ULU]], police were called, resulting in the violent eviction and arrests of over 60 students, as well as police violence towards students outside supporting the occupation.<ref>{{cite

gained national media attention after a video of university staff drilling shut a fire door to trap students in a room they had occupied, putting them at serious risk of harm, was viewed over 19,000 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/JusticeforUOLWorkers/videos/225038318236742/|title=University of London have sealed us into the Chancellor's Hall|via=www.facebook.com}}</ref> Video

Media|Vice]] that reported the militarisation of the university campus at Senate House, where over 25 extra security had been brought in, with students known to be involved in political campaigns being barred from using university facilities, as well as being verbally, physically and sexually assaulted by temporary security staff.<ref>{{cite

Union of Great Britain]] called for a boycott of events at the university's central administration buildings, including Senate House, with the aim of putting pressure on the University of London to bring outsourced cleaning, catering and security staff in-house by targeting a revenue stream worth around \u00a340 million per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Largest university in UK hit by boycott over

Dion Georgiou, an academic supporting the boycott and a member of UCU, wrote a comment piece for The Guardian shortly before the vote, urging the congress to approve the motion and claiming that
