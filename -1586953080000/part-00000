It lies west of the junction of the [[Flinders Highway, South Australia|Flinders]] and [[Eyre Highway]]s around 786&nbsp;km northwest of the capital [[Adelaide]].  The port town/suburb of [[Thevenard, South Australia|Thevenard]] lies 3&nbsp;km to the west on Cape Thevenard.  It is in the [[District Council of Ceduna]], the federal [[Division of Grey]], and the state [[electoral district of Flinders]].\n\nThe name Ceduna is a corruption of the local [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] [[Wirangu language|Wirangu]] word ''Chedoona'' and is said to mean a place to sit down and rest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aussietowns.com.au/town/ceduna-sa |title=Ceduna, SA |work=Aussie Towns |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe town has played an important but minor role in Australia's overall development due to it being a fishing port and a railway hub.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thevenard during Oysterfest 2012.JPG|thumb|Murat Bay in Ceduna looking over to Thevenard during Oysterfest 2012]]\nCeduna is on land that was part of the traditional home of the [[Wirangu people|Wirangu]] people.\n\n[[Matthew Flinders]], on his voyage in the ''Investigator'', anchored in [[Fowlers Bay]] on 28 January 1802. He went on to explore the coast and named [[Denial Bay]], [[Smoky Bay]] and the islands of [[Nuyts Archipelago]]. He was disappointed to find no river and gave the name [[Denial Bay]] because they did not find fresh water.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nFrench expedition leader [[Nicolas Baudin]] visited [[Murat Bay]] after meeting with Flinders and named it after [[Joachim Murat]]. He also named the point of [[Thevenard, South Australia|Thevenard]] after the Admiral and Minister of Marine [[Antoine-Jean-Marie Thevenard]], and Decres Bay after [[Denis Decres]], duke of the [[First French Empire]].\n\nThe first European exploration of the hinterland was during August\u2013September 1839 by [[John Hill (explorer)|John Hill]] and [[Samuel Stephens (Colonial Manager)|Samuel Stephens]], using the chartered brig ''Rapid'' as a base. Hill reported to Governor Gawler that although the bay was 'valuable', the hinterland was 'waterless', thereby stalling European interest.<ref>''Register'', 26 October 1839, pp.5 and 17.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Secondary Towns Association, London|title=Secondary Towns Association, Formed for the Purchasing of One Or More Special Survey Or Surveys of Land in South Australia, for Sites for Secondary Towns: Statement of the Proceedings of the Directors for the Information of the Proprietors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wau4AAAAIAAJ|year=1843|publisher=J.C. Hailes}}</ref>\n\nThere was a [[whaling]] station on nearby [[St Peter Island (South Australia)|St Peter Island]] during the 1850s before settlement.\n\nThe Commissioner of Crown Lands, faced with widespread agitation to open West Coast lands for agricultural settlement, invited three farmers in July 1887 to inspect the lands between [[Streaky Bay]] and [[Western Australia]]. They were optimistic about the area and recommended that the necessary surveys be started at once. In 1889 the Government in Adelaide formalised the Far West with survey lines.\n\nIn June 1901, the town of Ceduna was proclaimed. For many years, locals called the township [[Murat Bay]] and it was not until the railways came and called the siding Ceduna in 1915 that locals adopted the name. The Ceduna Jetty was built in 1902.\n\nThe Tod Water pipeline was officially opened by Mr M McIntosh, Commissioner of Public Works, June 1928.\n\nCeduna was the site of a major satellite telecommunications facility operated by the [[Overseas Telecommunications Commission]]. It was a major employer in the town until made redundant by technological change. It was built in 1969 and by 1984 almost half of Australia's International telecommunication traffic passed through Ceduna's Earth Station.<ref>[http://www.ceduna.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=495#OTC Ceduna Business & Tourism Association > Places of interest > Ceduna OTC Earth Station] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120143753/http://www.ceduna.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=495#OTC#OTC |date=20 January 2017 }} Accessed 25 September 2015.</ref>\n\nOn 4 December 2002, Ceduna received international attention when the path of totality of a [[solar eclipse]] passed directly over the town. Though the day had at times been partly cloudy, and although mere kilometres away in Thevenard the view was still clouded over, the southwestern sky where the Sun and Moon were located was clear from Ceduna itself at the time of the total solar eclipse, late in the afternoon.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn the 2007/2008 State Budget, Premier Mike Rann (who had opened the new Ceduna TAFE campus in the early 1990s) announced a commitment of $36 million for Stage 1 of the Ceduna Hospital Redevelopment. It was opened in 2011.<ref>http://www.get {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806182905/http://get/ |date=6 August 2013 }} farming.com.au, 29 March 2011 \"More investment in country health.\"</ref>\n\nIn February 2010 Premier Rann opened the world's largest mineral sands mine, operated by Iluka Resources. The $390 million mine is located 200&nbsp;km north west of Ceduna.<ref>Australian Mining 10 February 2010</ref>\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]] of Population, there were 2,157 people in Ceduna.\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 16.4% of the population. \n* 79.2% of people were born in Australia and 82.1% of people spoke only English at home. \n* The most common response for religion was No Religion at 33.7%.<ref name=\"ABS\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe town is the last major settlement before crossing the [[Nullarbor Plain]] from east to west. It is set on Murat Bay and the sandy coves, sheltered bays and offshore islands of the bay make it a popular base for a beach holiday. The foreshore at Ceduna is lined with [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island pine]] trees. There is a jetty for walking, fishing and small boats.\n\n===Demographics===\nIn the {{CensusAU|2011}} the Ceduna urban area had a population of 2,289,<ref name=\"ABS\"/> and the Ceduna council area a population of 3,480.<ref name=\"ABS1\">{{Census 2011 AUS|id=LGA41010|name=Ceduna (DC)|accessdate= 3 May 2013|quick=on}}</ref><ref name=\"ceduna.net\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ceduna.net/site/page.cfm?u=282# |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412141858/http://www.ceduna.net/site/page.cfm?u=282# |archive-date=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nCeduna has a number of Indigenous homelands situated within 20\u201330 minutes of the town.  These are groupings of Indigenous families who have chosen to live together.  The council area has the highest percentage of Aboriginal people of all local government areas in South Australia, with the population currently standing at 24.8% (911) of the population.<ref name=\"ceduna.net\"/> A number of Aboriginal communities in adjacent unincorporated areas rely on the available services in Ceduna and use the town as a base for a variety of reasons.<ref name=\"ceduna.net\"/>\n\nVery few of the indigenous inhabitants of Ceduna continue to speak the [[Wirangu language]]. As the regional service town, Ceduna attracts indigenous people from many language groups in western South Australia. The Far West Languages Centre (FWLC) was established in 2006 to maintain three local Endangered languages including Wirangu, along with [[Mirning language|Mirning]] and [[Kokatha language|Kokatha]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fwlc.org.au/ |publisher=Far West Languages Centre |title=Far West Languages Centre |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nThe two schools in Ceduna are Crossways Lutheran School and Ceduna Area School (CAS).<ref>[http://www.cedunaas.sa.edu.au/ Ceduna Area School] Accessed 6 September 2011.</ref> Crossways has around 150 students from Reception to Year 10, approximately 80% of whom are Indigenous. CAS has approximately 600 students, from Reception to Year 12, with approximately 25% of Indigenous students.\n\n===Economic activity===\n[[Iluka Resources]] developed a [[Heavy mineral sands ore deposits|mineral sands]] mine at Jacinth- Ambrosia which relies on Ceduna as a service town.\nA major residential development called Ceduna Waters was developed by Carramatta Holdings, a significant South Australian property developer in early 2010. Ceduna Waters is approximately 3&nbsp;km from the town centre and is approximately 30% occupied as of May 2013.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nProspectively, the development was projected to result in the growth of the population of Ceduna by over 10%.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The development will allow for the provision of additional residential accommodation in Ceduna to meet the needs of workers at the Jacinth-Ambrosia mine.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Thevenard port of Ceduna is a high-frequency deep sea port which exports [[grain]], [[salt]], mineral sand and [[gypsum]], all which are found within the local region.\n\nAquaculture remains a major industry in Ceduna with [[pacific oyster]] growing a key activity in the region. In recent years deep sea fishing and tuna fishing have attracted industries from [[Port Lincoln]] to the region.<ref name=\"www.ceduna.net\">http://www.ceduna.net</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[BP]] commenced the ability to seek approval for oil drilling off the nearby [[Great Australian Bight]].

It was established in 1991.  Attracting over 6000 people,<ref>{{cite web|title=Oysterfest|url=http://www.ceduna.sa.gov.au/oysterfest|website=Ceduna, South Australia|publisher=District Council of Ceduna|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> it celebrates the oyster industry in the clean waters of SA's far-west coast, with a wide variety of activities, including a gala dinner, celebrity chefs, live concerts, children's amusements and a street parade. The finale is marked by a fireworks display.\n\n===In media===\n\nCeduna was used as a major filming location for the 1997 film ''[[Kiss or Kill (film)|Kiss or Kill]]'' starring [[Frances O'Connor]]. It was a key setting for the factual drama ''[[Black and White (2002 film)|Black and White]]'' although the township was not used as a filming location. In 2012 Ceduna was featured in the independent feature film ''[[Nullarbor Nymph]]'' which achieved [[cult film|cult status]] around the country.\n\nThe [[Cashless Welfare Card]] began a trial there in March 2016, attracting media attention.<ref>{{cite news|title=On the ground in Ceduna on day one of the Healthy Welfare Card trial|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/the-point-with-stan-grant/article/2016/03/15/ground-ceduna-day-one-healthy-welfare-card-trial|accessdate=20 November 2017|work=NITV|date=15 March 2016|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Ceduna jetty.jpg|thumb|Ceduna, South Australia jetty in autumn]]\nCeduna is known as the gateway to the [[Nullarbor Plain]] and being on the [[National Highway (Australia)|National Highway]] its traffic flow is over 240,000 vehicles a year.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The township has five caravan parks, four motels and one accommodating hotel.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The tourism industry is driven by the nearby conservation parks, beaches and fishing opportunities.\n\n==Environment==\n\n===Climate===\nCeduna has a [[semi-arid climate]] with hot, dry summers and cool, slightly wetter winters.<ref>[http://www.ceduna.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=619 District Council of Ceduna - weather] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328154250/http://www.ceduna.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=619 |date=28 March 2011 }}</ref> July is the wettest month.

[[South Australia]] located on the shores of [[Murat Bay]] on the west coast of [[Eyre Peninsula]]. It lies west of the junction of the [[Flinders Highway, South Australia|Flinders]] and [[Eyre Highway]]s around 786&nbsp;km northwest of the capital [[Adelaide]].  The port town/suburb of [[Thevenard, South Australia|Thevenard]] lies 3&nbsp;km to the west on Cape Thevenard.  It is in the [[District Council of Ceduna]], the federal [[Division of Grey]], and the state [[electoral district of Flinders]].\n\nThe name Ceduna is a corruption of the local [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] [[Wirangu language|Wirangu]] word ''Chedoona'' and is said to mean a place to sit down and rest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aussietowns.com.au/town/ceduna-sa |title=Ceduna, SA |work=Aussie Towns |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe town has played an important but minor role in Australia's overall development due to it being a fishing port and a railway hub.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thevenard during Oysterfest 2012.JPG|thumb|Murat Bay in Ceduna looking over to Thevenard during Oysterfest 2012]]\nCeduna is on land that was part of the traditional home of the [[Wirangu people|Wirangu]] people.\n\n[[Matthew Flinders]], on his voyage in the ''Investigator'', anchored in [[Fowlers Bay]] on 28 January 1802. He went on to explore the coast and named [[Denial Bay]], [[Smoky Bay]] and the islands of [[Nuyts Archipelago]]. He was disappointed to find no river and gave the name [[Denial Bay]] because they did not find fresh water.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nFrench expedition leader [[Nicolas Baudin]] visited [[Murat Bay]] after meeting with Flinders and named it after [[Joachim Murat]]. He also named the point of [[Thevenard, South Australia|Thevenard]] after the Admiral and Minister of Marine [[Antoine-Jean-Marie Thevenard]], and Decres Bay after [[Denis Decres]], duke of the [[First French Empire]].\n\nThe first European exploration of the hinterland was during August\u2013September 1839 by [[John Hill (explorer)|John Hill]] and [[Samuel Stephens (Colonial Manager)|Samuel Stephens]], using the chartered brig ''Rapid'' as a base. Hill reported to Governor Gawler that although the bay was 'valuable', the hinterland was 'waterless', thereby stalling European interest.<ref>''Register'', 26 October 1839, pp.5 and 17.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Secondary Towns Association, London|title=Secondary Towns Association, Formed for the Purchasing of One Or More Special Survey Or Surveys of Land in South Australia, for Sites for Secondary Towns: Statement of the Proceedings of the Directors for the Information of the Proprietors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wau4AAAAIAAJ|year=1843|publisher=J.C. Hailes}}</ref>\n\nThere was a [[whaling]] station on nearby [[St Peter Island]] during the 1850s before settlement.\n\nThe Commissioner of Crown Lands, faced with widespread agitation to open West Coast lands for agricultural settlement, invited three farmers in July 1887 to inspect the lands between [[Streaky Bay]] and [[Western Australia]]. They were optimistic about the area and recommended that the necessary surveys be started at once. In 1889 the Government in Adelaide formalised the Far West with survey lines.\n\nIn June 1901, the town of Ceduna was proclaimed. For many years, locals called the township [[Murat Bay]] and it was not until the railways came and called the siding Ceduna in 1915 that locals adopted the name. The Ceduna Jetty was built in 1902.\n\nThe Tod Water pipeline was officially opened by Mr M McIntosh, Commissioner of Public Works, June 1928.\n\nCeduna was the site of a major satellite telecommunications facility operated by the [[Overseas Telecommunications Commission]]. It was a major employer in the town until made redundant by technological change. It was built in 1969 and by 1984 almost half of Australia's International telecommunication traffic passed through Ceduna's Earth Station.<ref>[http://www.ceduna.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=495#OTC Ceduna Business & Tourism Association > Places of interest > Ceduna OTC Earth Station] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120143753/http://www.ceduna.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=495#OTC#OTC |date=20 January 2017 }} Accessed 25 September 2015.</ref>\n\nOn 4 December 2002, Ceduna received international attention when the path of totality of a [[solar eclipse]] passed directly over the town. Though the day had at times been partly cloudy, and although mere kilometres away in Thevenard the view was still clouded over, the southwestern sky where the Sun and Moon were located was clear from Ceduna itself at the time of the total solar eclipse, late in the afternoon.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn the 2007/2008 State Budget, Premier Mike Rann (who had opened the new Ceduna TAFE campus in the early 1990s) announced a commitment of $36 million for Stage 1 of the Ceduna Hospital Redevelopment. It was opened in 2011.<ref>http://www.get {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806182905/http://get/ |date=6 August 2013 }} farming.com.au, 29 March 2011 \"More investment in country health.\"</ref>\n\nIn February 2010 Premier Rann opened the world's largest mineral sands mine, operated by Iluka Resources. The $390 million mine is located 200&nbsp;km north west of Ceduna.<ref>Australian Mining 10 February 2010</ref>\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]] of Population, there were 2,157 people in Ceduna.\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 16.4% of the population. \n* 79.2% of people were born in Australia and 82.1% of people spoke only English at home. \n* The most common response for religion was No Religion at 33.7%.<ref name=\"ABS\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe town is the last major settlement before crossing the [[Nullarbor Plain]] from east to west. It is set on Murat Bay and the sandy coves, sheltered bays and offshore islands of the bay make it a popular base for a beach holiday. The foreshore at Ceduna is lined with [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island pine]] trees. There is a jetty for walking, fishing and small boats.\n\n===Demographics===\nIn the {{CensusAU|2011}} the Ceduna urban area had a population of 2,289,<ref name=\"ABS\"/> and the Ceduna council area a population of 3,480.<ref name=\"ABS1\">{{Census 2011 AUS|id=LGA41010|name=Ceduna (DC)|accessdate= 3 May 2013|quick=on}}</ref><ref name=\"ceduna.net\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ceduna.net/site/page.cfm?u=282# |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412141858/http://www.ceduna.net/site/page.cfm?u=282# |archive-date=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nCeduna has a number of Indigenous homelands situated within 20\u201330 minutes of the town.  These are groupings of Indigenous families who have chosen to live together.  The council area has the highest percentage of Aboriginal people of all local government areas in South Australia, with the population currently standing at 24.8% (911) of the population.<ref name=\"ceduna.net\"/> A number of Aboriginal communities in adjacent unincorporated areas rely on the available services in Ceduna and use the town as a base for a variety of reasons.<ref name=\"ceduna.net\"/>\n\nVery few of the indigenous inhabitants of Ceduna continue to speak the [[Wirangu language]]. As the regional service town, Ceduna attracts indigenous people from many language groups in western South Australia. The Far West Languages Centre (FWLC) was established in 2006 to maintain three local Endangered languages including Wirangu, along with [[Mirning language|Mirning]] and [[Kokatha language|Kokatha]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fwlc.org.au/ |publisher=Far West Languages Centre |title=Far West Languages Centre |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nThe two schools in Ceduna are Crossways Lutheran School and Ceduna Area School (CAS).<ref>[http://www.cedunaas.sa.edu.au/ Ceduna Area School] Accessed 6 September 2011.</ref> Crossways has around 150 students from Reception to Year 10, approximately 80% of whom are Indigenous. CAS has approximately 600 students, from Reception to Year 12, with approximately 25% of Indigenous students.\n\n===Economic activity===\n[[Iluka Resources]] developed a [[Heavy mineral sands ore deposits|mineral sands]] mine at Jacinth- Ambrosia which relies on Ceduna as a service town.\nA major residential development called Ceduna Waters was developed by Carramatta Holdings, a significant South Australian property developer in early 2010. Ceduna Waters is approximately 3&nbsp;km from the town centre and is approximately 30% occupied as of May 2013.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nProspectively, the development was projected to result in the growth of the population of Ceduna by over 10%.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The development will allow for the provision of additional residential accommodation in Ceduna to meet the needs of workers at the Jacinth-Ambrosia mine.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Thevenard port of Ceduna is a high-frequency deep sea port which exports [[grain]], [[salt]], mineral sand and [[gypsum]], all which are found within the local region.\n\nAquaculture remains a major industry in Ceduna with [[pacific oyster]] growing a key activity in the region. In recent years deep sea fishing and tuna fishing have attracted industries from [[Port Lincoln]] to the region.<ref name=\"www.ceduna.net\">http://www.ceduna.net</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[BP]] commenced the ability to seek approval for oil drilling off the nearby [[Great Australian Bight]].

It was established in 1991.  Attracting over 6000 people,<ref>{{cite web|title=Oysterfest|url=http://www.ceduna.sa.gov.au/oysterfest|website=Ceduna, South Australia|publisher=District Council of Ceduna|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> it celebrates the oyster industry in the clean waters of SA's far-west coast, with a wide variety of activities, including a gala dinner, celebrity chefs, live concerts, children's amusements and a street parade. The finale is marked by a fireworks display.\n\n===In media===\n\nCeduna was used as a major filming location for the 1997 film ''[[Kiss or Kill (film)|Kiss or Kill]]'' starring [[Frances O'Connor]]. It was a key setting for the factual drama ''[[Black and White (2002 film)|Black and White]]'' although the township was not used as a filming location.

Along with ex-Stormtrooper Finn, she helps the Resistance led by Leia fight the First Order commanded by [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and his pupil [[Kylo Ren]] (Han Solo and Leia's son).

Poe's droid [[BB-8]] escapes with the map, and encounters a scavenger girl, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]]. Kylo tortures Poe and learns of BB-8. A defecting stormtrooper, FN-2187, frees Poe, who dubs him \"[[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]]\", and both escape in a [[TIE fighter]]. Poe is seemingly killed in a crash-landing upon Jakku. Finn finds Rey and BB-8, as the First Order pursues them; they escape together in the impounded ''Millennium Falcon''. The ''Falcon'' is recaptured by Han Solo and Chewbacca, working as smugglers again. They agree to help deliver the map inside BB-8 to the Resistance.\n\nIn early 2013, Walt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm officially announced [[J. J.

Meanwhile, Leia leads Poe, Finn, [[Rose Tico]], BB-8, and the rest of the Resistance as they are pursued by the First Order, led by Snoke with Kylo as his second in command.

Though its geographical range has been severely reduced since European colonisation, the tammar remains common within its reduced range and is listed as \"[[Least Concern]]\" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). It has been introduced to New Zealand and reintroduced to some areas of Australia where it had been previously eradicated. Skull differences distinguish tammars from Western Australia, [[Kangaroo Island]] and mainland South Australia, making them distinct population groups or possibly different subspecies.\n\nThe tammar is among the smallest of the [[wallaby|wallabies]] in the genus ''[[Macropus]]''. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, [[colour vision]] and the ability to drink [[seawater]]. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in [[grassland]] habitat and daytime in [[shrubland]]. It is also very gregarious and has a [[Seasonal breeder|seasonal]], promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]] in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on [[marsupial]]s, and on [[mammals]] in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its [[genome]] sequenced.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe tammar wallaby was seen in the [[Houtman Abrolhos]] off [[Western Australia]] by survivors of the 1628 ''[[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]]'' [[shipwreck]], and recorded by [[Fran\u00e7ois Pelsaert]] in his 1629 ''Ongeluckige Voyagie''.<ref name=\"Pearson 2005\">{{cite book|author=Pearson, M. |year=2005 |title=Great Southern Land: The maritime exploration of Terra Australis |publisher=Department of the Environment and Heritage, Government of Australia |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/about/pubs/great-southern-land.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2007 |isbn=978-0-642-55185-6 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731035212/http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/about/pubs/great-southern-land.pdf |archivedate=31 July 2008 }}</ref>{{rp|53}} It was first described in 1817 by the French naturalist [[Anselme Ga\u00ebtan Desmarest]], who gave it the name ''eugenii'' based on where it was found; an island he knew as Ile Eugene in the [[Nuyts Archipelago]] off [[South Australia]] which is now known as [[St Peter Island (South Australia)|St Peter Island]].

Though its geographical range has been severely reduced since European colonisation, the tammar remains common within its reduced range and is listed as \"[[Least Concern]]\" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). It has been introduced to New Zealand and reintroduced to some areas of Australia where it had been previously eradicated. Skull differences distinguish tammars from Western Australia, [[Kangaroo Island]] and mainland South Australia, making them distinct population groups or possibly different subspecies.\n\nThe tammar is among the smallest of the [[wallaby|wallabies]] in the genus ''[[Macropus]]''. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, [[colour vision]] and the ability to drink [[seawater]]. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in [[grassland]] habitat and daytime in [[shrubland]]. It is also very gregarious and has a [[Seasonal breeder|seasonal]], promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]] in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on [[marsupial]]s, and on [[mammals]] in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its [[genome]] sequenced.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe tammar wallaby was seen in the [[Houtman Abrolhos]] off [[Western Australia]] by survivors of the 1628 ''[[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]]'' [[shipwreck]], and recorded by [[Fran\u00e7ois Pelsaert]] in his 1629 ''Ongeluckige Voyagie''.<ref name=\"Pearson 2005\">{{cite book|author=Pearson, M. |year=2005 |title=Great Southern Land: The maritime exploration of Terra Australis |publisher=Department of the Environment and Heritage, Government of Australia |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/about/pubs/great-southern-land.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2007 |isbn=978-0-642-55185-6 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731035212/http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/about/pubs/great-southern-land.pdf |archivedate=31 July 2008 }}</ref>{{rp|53}} It was first described in 1817 by the French naturalist [[Anselme Ga\u00ebtan Desmarest]], who gave it the name ''eugenii'' based on where it was found; an island he knew as Ile Eugene in the [[Nuyts Archipelago]] off [[South Australia]] which is now known as [[St Peter Island]].

With specimen signatures from Holmes' friends and clients provided by the boat-builder, Brady would [[Cheque_fraud|forge cheques for small amounts against their bank accounts that he and Smith then cashed]]. Police were later able to establish that Smith was [[Blackmail|blackmailing]]  Holmes.\n\n==Murder of James Smith==\n\nSmith was last seen drinking and playing cards with Patrick Francis Brady at the Cecil Hotel in the southern Sydney suburb of [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]] on 7 April 1935 after telling his wife he was going fishing.<ref>Whiticker, Alan ''Twelve Crimes That Shocked the Nation'' 2005</ref> Brady had rented a small [[cottage]] in Taloombi Street, Cronulla at the time Smith went missing. Police alleged that Smith was murdered at this cottage.

This caused problems for the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] when Brady was eventually brought to [[trial]].\n\nBrady was arrested on 16 May and charged with the murder of Smith. A [[Taxicab|taxi]] driver testified that he had taken Brady from Cronulla to Holmes' address at 3 Bay View Street, [[McMahons Point, New South Wales]], on the day Smith had gone missing, and that \"he was dishevelled, he had a hand in a pocket and wouldn't take it out... it was clear that [he] was frightened.\"<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/dimensions/dimensions_in_time/Transcripts/s546563.htm The Shark Arm Case - \"Dimensions in Time\" ABC radio transcript]</ref>\n\nInitially, Holmes denied any association with Brady but four days later, on May 20th 1935, the businessman went into his [[boatshed]] and attempted [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head with a [[.32_caliber|.32 calibre]] [[pistol]]. However, the bullet flattened against the bone of the forehead and he was merely stunned. Revived after falling into the water, he crawled into his [[Motorboat|speedboat]] and led two police launches on a chase around [[Sydney Harbour]] for several hours until he was finally caught and taken to hospital.<ref>Vince Kelly .''The Shark Arm Case''.  Angus & Robertson Publishers, Australia. 1963</ref>\n\nIn early June 1935, Holmes decided to cooperate with the police in investigating the murder of Smith. He told Detective Sergeant Frank Matthews that Brady had killed Smith, dismembered his body and stowed it into a trunk that he had then thrown into [[Gunnamatta Bay]]. He then claimed Brady had come to his home, showed him the severed arm and threatened Holmes with murder if he did not receive \u20a4500 immediately. Holmes also admitted that after Brady had left his home, he travelled to the Sydney coastal suburb of [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]] and discarded Smith's arm in the surf.<ref>Whiticker</ref>\n\n==Second murder==\n\nOn 11 June 1935, Holmes withdrew [[Pound_sign|\u00a3]]500 from his account and late in the evening left home, telling his wife he had to meet someone. He was also very cautious as he left his home, accompanied by his wife to the door of his Nash [[Sedan_(automobile)|sedan]].

Police were later able to establish that Smith was [[Blackmail|blackmailing]]  Holmes.\n\n==Murder of James Smith==\n\nSmith was last seen drinking and playing cards with Patrick Francis Brady at the Cecil Hotel in the southern Sydney suburb of [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]] on 7 April 1935 after telling his wife he was going fishing.<ref>Whiticker, Alan ''Twelve Crimes That Shocked the Nation'' 2005</ref> Brady had rented a small [[cottage]] in Taloombi Street, Cronulla at the time Smith went missing. Police alleged that Smith was murdered at this cottage. [[Port Hacking]] and [[Gunnamatta Bay]] were searched by the [[Royal_Australian_Navy|Navy]] and the [[Royal_Australian_Air_Force|Air Force]], but the rest of Smith's body was never found. This caused problems for the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] when Brady was eventually brought to [[trial]].\n\nBrady was arrested on 16 May and charged with the murder of Smith. A [[Taxicab|taxi]] driver testified that he had taken Brady from Cronulla to Holmes' address at 3 Bay View Street, [[McMahons Point, New South Wales]], on the day Smith had gone missing, and that \"he was dishevelled, he had a hand in a pocket and wouldn't take it out... it was clear that [he] was frightened.\"<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/dimensions/dimensions_in_time/Transcripts/s546563.htm The Shark Arm Case - \"Dimensions in Time\" ABC radio transcript]</ref>\n\nInitially, Holmes denied any association with Brady but four days later, on May 20th 1935, the businessman went into his [[boatshed]] and attempted [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head with a [[.32_caliber|.32 calibre]] [[pistol]]. However, the bullet flattened against the bone of the forehead and he was merely stunned. Revived after falling into the water, he crawled into his [[Motorboat|speedboat]] and led two police launches on a chase around [[Sydney Harbour]] for several hours until he was finally caught and taken to hospital.<ref>Vince Kelly .''The Shark Arm Case''.  Angus & Robertson Publishers, Australia. 1963</ref>\n\nIn early June 1935, Holmes decided to cooperate with the police in investigating the murder of Smith. He told Detective Sergeant Frank Matthews that Brady had killed Smith, dismembered his body and stowed it into a trunk that he had then thrown into [[Gunnamatta Bay]]. He then claimed Brady had come to his home, showed him the severed arm and threatened Holmes with murder if he did not receive \u20a4500 immediately. Holmes also admitted that after Brady had left his home, he travelled to the Sydney coastal suburb of [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]] and discarded Smith's arm in the surf.<ref>Whiticker</ref>\n\n==Second murder==\n\nOn 11 June 1935, Holmes withdrew [[Pound_sign|\u00a3]]500 from his account and late in the evening left home, telling his wife he had to meet someone. He was also very cautious as he left his home, accompanied by his wife to the door of his Nash [[Sedan_(automobile)|sedan]]. Early the next morning, he was found dead in his car at Hickson Road, [[Dawes Point, New South Wales|Dawes Point]]. He had been shot three times at close range.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald. \"MURDERED IN CAR - Principal Witness in Aquarium Mystery Inquest\". 12 June 1935.

Oram, the same day Holmes was found dead in his car with gunshot wounds to his chest. Although Holmes was the inquest's star witness, he was never offered [[Police#Protection_of_individuals|police protection]] before his testimony could be heard.

He is best known for his brief stint as a member of [[the Three Stooges]] in cinematic short subjects of 1957\u201359. He is also remembered for his television roles: Stinky, the bratty man-child in ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'', and Jillson, the maintenance man in ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nBesser was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], on August 12, 1907. He was the ninth child of Morris and Fanny Besser, [[Jew]]ish immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]]. He had seven older sisters, and an older brother Manny who was in show business, primarily as an [[ethnic]] Jewish comic. From an early age, Joe was fascinated with show business, especially the magic act of [[Howard Thurston]] that visited St. Louis annually. When Joe was 12, Thurston allowed him to be an audience plant. Besser was so excited by this, he sneaked into Thurston's train after the St. Louis run of the show was over, and was discovered the next day sleeping on top of the lion's cage in Detroit.\n\nThurston relented, informed Besser's parents of the situation, and trained him as an assistant. The first act involved pulling a rabbit out of a hat. The trick involved two rabbits, one hidden in a pocket of Thurston's cape. But young Besser was so nervous that he botched badly, pulling out the rabbit from the cape at the same time as the other rabbit was on display, before the trick had been performed. The audience roared with laughter, and Besser from then on was assigned \"comic mishap\" roles only.  Besser was placed by St. Louis juvenile authorities in a \"corrective school\" (reform school) at age 12.<ref>http://0-persi.heritagequestonline.com.iii.slcl.org/hqoweb/library/do/census/results/image?surname=besser&givenname=joseph&series=14&state=5&hitcount=2&p=1&urn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3Bcensus%3B14842165%3B105172537%3B14%3B5&searchtype=1&offset=0</ref>\n\n== Acting career ==\nBesser remained in show business and developed a unique comic character: a whiny, bratty, impish guy who was easily excitable and upset, throwing temper tantrums with little provocation. Besser, with his frequent outbursts of \"You crazy, ''youuuuu!''\" and \"Not so ''faaaaaast!''\" or \"Not so ''harrrrd!!''\" was so original and so outrageously silly that he became a vaudeville headliner, and movie and radio appearances soon followed.\n\nThe zany comedy team of [[Olsen and Johnson]], whose [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revues were fast-paced collections of songs and blackouts, hired Joe Besser to join their company. Besser's noisy intrusions were perfect for their anything-can-happen format. Besser's work caught the attention of the [[Shubert family|Shubert]] brothers, who signed Besser to a theatrical contract. [[Columbia Pictures]] hired Besser away from the Shuberts, and Besser relocated to Hollywood in 1944, where he brought his unique comic character to feature-length musical comedies like ''Hey, Rookie'' and ''[[Eadie Was a Lady]]'' (1945). On May 9, 1946 Besser appeared on the pioneer NBC television program ''[[Hour Glass (TV series)|Hour Glass]]'', performing his \"Army Drill\" routine with stage partner Jimmy Little. According to an article in the May 27, 1946 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, the show was seen by about 20,000 people on about 3,500 television sets, mostly in the New York City area.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEsEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q&f=false Life Magazine May 27, 1946]</ref> During this period, he appeared on the [[Jack Benny]] radio program in the episode entitled \"Jack Prepares For Carnegie Hall\" in June, 1943. Besser also starred in short-subject comedies for Columbia from 1949 to 1956. By this point, his persona was sufficiently well known that he was frequently caricatured in ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' animated shorts of the era. He appeared in the action film ''[[The Desert Hawk (1950 film)|The Desert Hawk]]'' (1950).\n\nBesser had substituted for Lou Costello on radio, opposite [[Bud Abbott]], and by the 1950s he was firmly established as one of the [[Abbott and Costello]] regulars. When the duo filmed ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'' for television, they hired Joe Besser to play Oswald \"Stinky\" Davis, a bratty, loudmouthed child dressed in an oversized [[Little Lord Fauntleroy]] outfit, shorts, and a flat top hat with overhanging brim. He appeared during the first season of ''The Abbott and Costello Show''. Besser was cast for the role of Yonkel, a chariot man in the low-budget [[Bible|biblical]] film ''[[Sins of Jezebel]]'' (1953) which starred [[Paulette Goddard]] as the titular wicked queen.\n\n===The Three Stooges===\nAfter [[Shemp Howard]] died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on November 22, 1955 at age 60, his brother [[Moe Howard|Moe]] suggested that he and teammate [[Larry Fine]] continue working as \"The Two Stooges\".{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Studio chief [[Harry Cohn]] rejected the proposal. Although Moe had legal approval to allow new members into the act, [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] executives had the final say about any actor who would appear in the studio's films, and insisted on a performer already under contract to Columbia, Joe Besser. At the time, Besser was one of a few comedians still making comedy shorts at the studio. He successfully renegotiated his contract, and was paid his former feature-film salary, which was more than the other Stooges earned.\n\nBesser refrained from imitating [[Curly Howard|Curly]] or Shemp. He continued to play the same whiny character he had developed over his long career. He had a clause in his contract prohibiting being hit excessively. Besser recalled, \"I usually played the kind of character who would hit others back\". He claimed that Larry volunteered to take the brunt of Moe's screen abuse. In a 2002 [[E!]] channel program which used file footage of Besser, the comic stated that the left side of [[Larry Fine]]'s face was noticeably coarser than the other side, which he attributed to Moe's slaps.\n\nAs a result of his whiny persona and lack of true slapstick punishment against him (the cornerstone of Stooge humor), Joe has been less popular with contemporary Stooge aficionados, so much so, that \"Stooge-a-Polooza\" TV host [[Rich Koz]] has even apologized on the air before showing Besser shorts; during the show's tenure he received more than a few letters from viewers expressing their outrage over his airing them. Besser does have his defenders, however. Columbia historians Edward Watz and [[Ted Okuda]] have written appreciatively of Besser bringing new energy to what was by then a flagging theatrical series.<ref name=\"Okuda\">{{cite book| last = Okuda| first = Ted | authorlink = Ted Okuda|author2=Watz, Edward | title = The Columbia Comedy Shorts| publisher = McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers| year = 1986| location = | pages =60\u2013102, 237\u2013239| id = | isbn = 0-89950-181-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Stooges shorts with Besser were filmed from the spring of 1956 to the end of 1957. His Stooge tenure ended when Columbia shut down the two-reel-comedy department on December 20, 1957. Producer-director [[Jules White]] had shot enough film for 16 comedies, which were released a few months apart until June 1959, with ''[[Sappy Bull Fighters]]'' being the final release.\n\nAfter Besser joined in, for the first time in their career, the Stooges did not go to any personal appearance during their lay-off season started from 1956.<ref>{{cite book| last = Feinberg| first = Morris Moe |author2= G.

In fact, Besser never made any personal appearances as a member of the Three Stooges.<ref>{{cite journal| last  =  Lassin| first  = Gary | date  = 2014| editor1-last = Lassin| editor1-first  = Gary| title  =  Three Stooges on Tour, The: 1957 - \"Say It Ain't So, Joe,\" The Besser Appearance That Wasn't | url = https://www.threestooges.net/journal/view/149 | journal = The Three Stooges Journal|volume= Spring 2014 | issue = 149 | pages = 8\u20139| access-date = March 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter their contract with Columbia ended, Moe Howard and Larry Fine discussed plans for a personal appearance tour, but Besser declined. His wife had suffered a heart attack in November 1957, and he was unwilling to leave without her. In later life, Besser praised Moe and Larry in a 1985 radio interview, of which a quote from said interview was aired on [[A&E Network]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''. Besser said:\n\n{{quote|text=... Moe and Larry, they were the best. I enjoyed every minute of it with them. In fact, to show you how wonderful they were, I never liked to be hit with anything. And Larry would always say to me, 'Don't worry Joe, I'll take it.' Now that's the kind of guys that they were ...}}\n\n===After the Stooges===\nBesser returned to films and television, most notably as the superintendent Jillson for four seasons (1961\u20131965) of ''[[Joey Bishop|The Joey Bishop Show]]''. He also made occasional appearances on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] late-night series, also called ''The Joey Bishop Show'' between 1967 and 1969. Besser also had roles on ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[The Good Guys (1968 TV series)|The Good Guys]]'', ''[[That Girl]]'', and ''[[Love, American Style]]''.<ref name=besser/> He provided the voice of the dragon on ''[[The Alvin Show]] (1961)\n\nBesser also provided voices for several [[Saturday Morning cartoon]] series in the 1970s. He voiced the character Putty Puss in ''[[The Houndcats]]'' (1972), bumbling genie Babu in ''[[Jeannie (TV series)|Jeannie]]'' (1973), (inspired by ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'') and ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'', and as Scare Bear in ''[[Yogi's Space Race]]'' (1978).<ref name=besser>{{cite book | last = Besser  | first = Joe | authorlink = |author2=Jeff Lenburg |author3=Greg Lenburg  | title = Not Just a Stooge | publisher = Excelsior Books| year = 1984 | location = [[Orange, California]]  | pages = 200\u2013201, 203\u2013205 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Not-Just-Stooge-Joe-Besser/dp/0918283000/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1388716575&sr=1-1&keywords=not+just+a+stooge | doi = | id =  | isbn = 978-0918283009}}</ref> Besser's career slowed somewhat after he suffered a minor [[stroke]] in 1979, resulting in considerable weight loss.<ref name=besser/>\n\nLater in life, Besser expressed some dismay that people only recognized him for his brief tenure with the Stooges. However, he eventually softened, realizing that the Stooges continued to bring him his greatest exposure.<ref name=besser/>\n\nIn 1984, Besser co-wrote with authors Jeff and Greg Lenburg his autobiography, ''Not Just a Stooge'', for Excelsior Books.<ref name=besser/> The book would be later retitled and re-published as ''Once a Stooge, Always a Stooge'' following his death in 1988.\n\nJoe Besser recalled his friendship with the Stooges in an emotional speech referring to \"the four boys [Moe, Larry, Curly, and Shemp] ... up in heaven\" looking down at the dedication of a star to The Three Stooges on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on August 30, 1983. Stooges co-actor [[Emil Sitka]] also spoke; the only other surviving Stooge, [[Joe DeRita]], was ill at the time, though he outlived Besser by five years.<ref name=besser/>\n\nIn the spring of 2000, ABC aired a made-for-television movie about the Stooges, with actor Laurence Coy appearing briefly as Besser. This depiction of Besser has been criticized as being unfairly negative.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1932, Besser married dancer Erna Kay (born Ernestine Dora Kretschmer), known as \"Ernie\". The couple had no children.  They were neighbors and friends of [[Lou Costello]], of the [[Abbott and Costello]] duo. Besser appeared in the Abbott and Costello movie ''[[Africa Screams]]'' (1949), which also featured [[Shemp Howard]] of [[the Three Stooges]]. Joe and Shemp were old friends, having met in 1932.\n\nHis cousin's grandson is [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] theater co-founder and improviser/comedian [[Matt Besser]].\n\n==Death==\nJoe Besser was found dead in his home on March 1, 1988. He was aged 80 and died of [[heart failure]]. His wife Erna died on July 1, 1989, from a heart attack at age 89.

He is best known for his brief stint as a member of [[the Three Stooges]] in cinematic short subjects of 1957\u201359. He is also remembered for his television roles: Stinky, the bratty man-child in ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'', and Jillson, the maintenance man in ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nBesser was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], on August 12, 1907. He was the ninth child of Morris and Fanny Besser, [[Jew]]ish immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]]. He had seven older sisters, and an older brother Manny who was in show business, primarily as an [[ethnic]] Jewish comic. From an early age, Joe was fascinated with show business, especially the magic act of [[Howard Thurston]] that visited St. Louis annually. When Joe was 12, Thurston allowed him to be an audience plant. Besser was so excited by this, he sneaked into Thurston's train after the St. Louis run of the show was over, and was discovered the next day sleeping on top of the lion's cage in Detroit.\n\nThurston relented, informed Besser's parents of the situation, and trained him as an assistant. The first act involved pulling a rabbit out of a hat. The trick involved two rabbits, one hidden in a pocket of Thurston's cape. But young Besser was so nervous that he botched badly, pulling out the rabbit from the cape at the same time as the other rabbit was on display, before the trick had been performed. The audience roared with laughter, and Besser from then on was assigned \"comic mishap\" roles only.  Besser was placed by St. Louis juvenile authorities in a \"corrective school\" (reform school) at age 12.<ref>http://0-persi.heritagequestonline.com.iii.slcl.org/hqoweb/library/do/census/results/image?surname=besser&givenname=joseph&series=14&state=5&hitcount=2&p=1&urn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3Bcensus%3B14842165%3B105172537%3B14%3B5&searchtype=1&offset=0</ref>\n\n== Acting career ==\nBesser remained in show business and developed a unique comic character: a whiny, bratty, impish guy who was easily excitable and upset, throwing temper tantrums with little provocation. Besser, with his frequent outbursts of \"You crazy, ''youuuuu!''\" and \"Not so ''faaaaaast!''\" or \"Not so ''harrrrd!!''\" was so original and so outrageously silly that he became a vaudeville headliner, and movie and radio appearances soon followed.\n\nThe zany comedy team of [[Olsen and Johnson]], whose [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revues were fast-paced collections of songs and blackouts, hired Joe Besser to join their company. Besser's noisy intrusions were perfect for their anything-can-happen format. Besser's work caught the attention of the [[Shubert family|Shubert]] brothers, who signed Besser to a theatrical contract. [[Columbia Pictures]] hired Besser away from the Shuberts, and Besser relocated to Hollywood in 1944, where he brought his unique comic character to feature-length musical comedies like ''Hey, Rookie'' and ''[[Eadie Was a Lady]]'' (1945). On May 9, 1946 Besser appeared on the pioneer NBC television program ''[[Hour Glass (TV series)|Hour Glass]]'', performing his \"Army Drill\" routine with stage partner Jimmy Little. According to an article in the May 27, 1946 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, the show was seen by about 20,000 people on about 3,500 television sets, mostly in the New York City area.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEsEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q&f=false Life Magazine May 27, 1946]</ref> During this period, he appeared on the [[Jack Benny]] radio program in the episode entitled \"Jack Prepares For Carnegie Hall\" in June, 1943. Besser also starred in short-subject comedies for Columbia from 1949 to 1956. By this point, his persona was sufficiently well known that he was frequently caricatured in ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' animated shorts of the era. He appeared in the action film ''[[The Desert Hawk (1950 film)|The Desert Hawk]]'' (1950).\n\nBesser had substituted for Lou Costello on radio, opposite [[Bud Abbott]], and by the 1950s he was firmly established as one of the [[Abbott and Costello]] regulars. When the duo filmed ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'' for television, they hired Joe Besser to play Oswald \"Stinky\" Davis, a bratty, loudmouthed child dressed in an oversized [[Little Lord Fauntleroy]] outfit, shorts, and a flat top hat with overhanging brim. He appeared during the first season of ''The Abbott and Costello Show''. Besser was cast for the role of Yonkel, a chariot man in the low-budget [[Bible|biblical]] film ''[[Sins of Jezebel]]'' (1953) which starred [[Paulette Goddard]] as the titular wicked queen.\n\n===The Three Stooges===\nAfter [[Shemp Howard]] died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on November 22, 1955 at age 60, his brother [[Moe Howard|Moe]] suggested that he and teammate [[Larry Fine]] continue working as \"The Two Stooges\".{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Studio chief [[Harry Cohn]] rejected the proposal. Although Moe had legal approval to allow new members into the act, [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] executives had the final say about any actor who would appear in the studio's films, and insisted on a performer already under contract to Columbia, Joe Besser. At the time, Besser was one of a few comedians still making comedy shorts at the studio. He successfully renegotiated his contract, and was paid his former feature-film salary, which was more than the other Stooges earned.\n\nBesser refrained from imitating [[Curly Howard|Curly]] or Shemp. He continued to play the same whiny character he had developed over his long career. He had a clause in his contract prohibiting being hit excessively. Besser recalled, \"I usually played the kind of character who would hit others back\". He claimed that Larry volunteered to take the brunt of Moe's screen abuse. In a 2002 [[E!]] channel program which used file footage of Besser, the comic stated that the left side of [[Larry Fine]]'s face was noticeably coarser than the other side, which he attributed to Moe's slaps.\n\nAs a result of his whiny persona and lack of true slapstick punishment against him (the cornerstone of Stooge humor), Joe has been less popular with contemporary Stooge aficionados, so much so, that \"Stooge-a-Polooza\" TV host [[Rich Koz]] has even apologized on the air before showing Besser shorts; during the show's tenure he received more than a few letters from viewers expressing their outrage over his airing them. Besser does have his defenders, however. Columbia historians Edward Watz and [[Ted Okuda]] have written appreciatively of Besser bringing new energy to what was by then a flagging theatrical series.<ref name=\"Okuda\">{{cite book| last = Okuda| first = Ted | authorlink = Ted Okuda|author2=Watz, Edward | title = The Columbia Comedy Shorts| publisher = McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers| year = 1986| location = | pages =60\u2013102, 237\u2013239| id = | isbn = 0-89950-181-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Stooges shorts with Besser were filmed from the spring of 1956 to the end of 1957. His Stooge tenure ended when Columbia shut down the two-reel-comedy department on December 20, 1957. Producer-director [[Jules White]] had shot enough film for 16 comedies, which were released a few months apart until June 1959, with ''[[Sappy Bull Fighters]]'' being the final release.\n\nAfter Besser joined in, for the first time in their career, the Stooges did not go to any personal appearance during their lay-off season started from 1956.<ref>{{cite book| last = Feinberg| first = Morris Moe |author2= G.

In fact, Besser never made any personal appearances as a member of the Three Stooges.<ref>{{cite journal| last  =  Lassin| first  = Gary | date  = 2014| editor1-last = Lassin| editor1-first  = Gary| title  =  Three Stooges on Tour, The: 1957 - \"Say It Ain't So, Joe,\" The Besser Appearance That Wasn't | url = https://www.threestooges.net/journal/view/149 | journal = The Three Stooges Journal|volume= Spring 2014 | issue = 149 | pages = 8\u20139| access-date = March 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter their contract with Columbia ended, Moe Howard and Larry Fine discussed plans for a personal appearance tour, but Besser declined. His wife had suffered a heart attack in November 1957, and he was unwilling to leave without her. In later life, Besser praised Moe and Larry in a 1985 radio interview, of which a quote from said interview was aired on [[A&E Network]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''. Besser said:\n\n{{quote|text=... Moe and Larry, they were the best. I enjoyed every minute of it with them. In fact, to show you how wonderful they were, I never liked to be hit with anything. And Larry would always say to me, 'Don't worry Joe, I'll take it.' Now that's the kind of guys that they were ...}}\n\n===After the Stooges===\nBesser returned to films and television, most notably as the superintendent Jillson for four seasons (1961\u20131965) of ''[[Joey Bishop|The Joey Bishop Show]]''. He also made occasional appearances on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] late-night series, also called ''The Joey Bishop Show'' between 1967 and 1969. Besser also had roles on ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[The Good Guys (1968 TV series)|The Good Guys]]'', ''[[That Girl]]'', and ''[[Love, American Style]]''.<ref name=besser/> He provided the voice of the dragon on ''[[The Alvin Show]] (1961)\n\nBesser also provided voices for several [[Saturday Morning cartoon]] series in the 1970s. He voiced the character Putty Puss in ''[[The Houndcats]]'' (1972), bumbling genie Babu in ''[[Jeannie (TV series)|Jeannie]]'' (1973), (inspired by ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'') and ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'', and as Scare Bear in ''[[Yogi's Space Race]]'' (1978).<ref name=besser>{{cite book | last = Besser  | first = Joe | authorlink = |author2=Jeff Lenburg |author3=Greg Lenburg  | title = Not Just a Stooge | publisher = Excelsior Books| year = 1984 | location = [[Orange, California]]  | pages = 200\u2013201, 203\u2013205 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Not-Just-Stooge-Joe-Besser/dp/0918283000/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1388716575&sr=1-1&keywords=not+just+a+stooge | doi = | id =  | isbn = 978-0918283009}}</ref> Besser's career slowed somewhat after he suffered a minor [[stroke]] in 1979, resulting in considerable weight loss.<ref name=besser/>\n\nLater in life, Besser expressed some dismay that people only recognized him for his brief tenure with the Stooges. However, he eventually softened, realizing that the Stooges continued to bring him his greatest exposure.<ref name=besser/>\n\nIn 1984, Besser co-wrote with authors Jeff and Greg Lenburg his autobiography, ''Not Just a Stooge'', for Excelsior Books.<ref name=besser/> The book would be later retitled and re-published as ''Once a Stooge, Always a Stooge'' following his death in 1988.\n\nJoe Besser recalled his friendship with the Stooges in an emotional speech referring to \"the four boys [Moe, Larry, Curly, and Shemp] ... up in heaven\" looking down at the dedication of a star to The Three Stooges on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on August 30, 1983. Stooges co-actor [[Emil Sitka]] also spoke; the only other surviving Stooge, [[Joe DeRita]], was ill at the time, though he outlived Besser by five years.<ref name=besser/>\n\nIn the spring of 2000, ABC aired a made-for-television movie about the Stooges, with actor Laurence Coy appearing briefly as Besser. This depiction of Besser has been criticized as being unfairly negative.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1932, Besser married dancer Erna Kay (born Ernestine Dora Kretschmer), known as \"Ernie\". The couple had no children.  They were neighbors and friends of [[Lou Costello]], of the [[Abbott and Costello]] duo. Besser appeared in the Abbott and Costello movie ''[[Africa Screams]]'' (1949), which also featured [[Shemp Howard]] of [[the Three Stooges]]. Joe and Shemp were old friends, having met in 1932.\n\nHis cousin's grandson is [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] theater co-founder and improviser/comedian [[Matt Besser]].\n\n==Death==\nJoe Besser was found dead in his home on March 1, 1988. He was aged 80 and died of [[heart failure]]. His wife Erna died on July 1, 1989, from a heart attack at age 89. Both spouses are buried in the same plot in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]], in [[Glendale, California]]. Joe's marker reads, \"Joe Besser / August 12, 1907-March 1, 1988 / He Brought the World Love and Laughter\", while Erna's reads, \"Ernestine Besser / March 14, 1900-July 1, 1989 / In Loving Memory.\" Besser's Stooge partner [[Larry Fine]] is in a crypt at the Freedom Mausoleum, which is a short distance away from the tomb.\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Theatrical===\n\n====Features====\n*''[[Hot Steel]]'' (1940) \u2013 Siggie\n*''[[Hey, Rookie]]'' (1944) \u2013 Pendelton\n*''Eadie Was a Lady'' (1945) \u2013 Professor Dingle\n*''Talk About a Lady'' (1946) \u2013 Roly Q.

The map is somewhat careless with the scale, however; Edels Land to Lewins Land are shown adjacent, while in reality they are some 1000&nbsp;km apart, while the sweep of the Great Australian Bight, from Cape Leeuwin, Australia's south-westerly point to the [[Maatsuyker Islands]], off the southern tip of [[Tasmania]], is over 3000&nbsp;km.\n\nGulliver describes the land as \"divided by long rows of trees, not regularly planted but naturally growing\", with a \"great plenty of grass, and several fields of oats\".<ref>GT Pt IV, ch 1: OWC p208</ref>\n\nThe Houyhnhnms are rational [[equine]] beings and are masters of the land, contrasting strongly with the [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]], savage [[humanoid]] creatures who are no better than  beasts of burden, or livestock. Whereas the Yahoos represent all that is bad about humans, Houyhnhnms have a settled, calm, reliable and rational society. Gulliver much prefers the Houyhnhnms' company to the Yahoos', even though the latter are biologically closer to him.\n\n==Interpretation==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}\n[[File:The Servants Drive a Herd of Yahoos into the Field, from Gulliver's Travels.jpg|thumb|Houyhnhnms driving a herd of [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n[[File:Gulliver-taking-his-final-leave-of-the-land-of-the-houyhnhnms-sawrey-gilpin.jpg|thumb|''Gulliver Taking His Final Leave of the Land of the Houyhnhnms'', [[Sawrey Gilpin]], 1769]]\nIt is possible to interpret the Houyhnhnms in a number of different ways.  One might possibly, for example, regard them as a veiled criticism by Swift of the [[British Empire]]'s treatment of non-whites as lesser humans, or one could regard Gulliver's preference (and his immediate division of Houyhnhnms into color-based hierarchies) as absurd and the sign of his self-deception. In a modern context the story might be seen as presenting an early example of [[animal rights]] concerns, especially in Gulliver's account of how horses are cruelly treated in his society and the reversal of roles. The story is a possible inspiration for [[Pierre Boulle]]'s novel ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]''.\n\nBook IV of ''Gulliver's Travels'' is the keystone, in some ways, of the entire work,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} and critics have traditionally answered the question whether Gulliver is insane (and thus just another victim of Swift's satire) by questioning whether or not the Houyhnhnms are truly admirable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Gulliver loves the land and is obedient to a race that is not like his own. The Houyhnhnm society is based upon reason, and only upon [[logic|reason]], and therefore the horses practice [[eugenics]] based on their analyses of benefit and cost. They have no religion and their sole morality is the defence of reason, and so they are not particularly moved by pity or a belief in the intrinsic value of life. Gulliver himself, in their company, builds the sails of his skiff from \"Yahoo skins\". The Houyhnhnms' lack of passion surfaces during the scheduled visit of \"a friend and his family\" to the home of Gulliver's master \"upon some affair of importance\". On the day of the visit, the mistress of his friend and her children arrive very late. She made no excuses \"first for her husband\" who had passed just that morning and she had to remain to make the proper arrangements for a \"convenient place where his body should be laid\". Gulliver remarked that \"she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as the rest\". A further example of the lack of humanity and emotion in the Houyhnhnms is that their laws reason that each couple produce two children, one male and one female. In the event that a marriage produced two offspring of the same sex, the parents would take their children to the annual meeting and trade one with a couple who produced two children of the opposite sex. This was viewed as his spoofing and or criticising the notion that the \"ideal\" family produces children of both sexes. [[George Orwell]] viewed the Houyhnhnm society as one whose members try to be as close to dead as possible while alive and matter as little as possible in life and death.<ref>George Orwell: ''[http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/swift/english/e_swift Politics vs. Literature \u2014 An examination of Gulliver's travels]''</ref>\n\nOn one hand, the Houyhnhnms have an orderly and peaceful society. They have philosophy and a language that is entirely free of political and ethical nonsense. They have no word for a ''lie'' (and must substitute a circumlocution: \"to say a thing which is not\"). They also have a form of art that is derived from nature. Outside ''Gulliver's Travels'', Swift had expressed longstanding concern over the corruption of the English language, and he had proposed language reform. He had also, in ''[[Battle of the Books]]'' and in general in ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'', expressed a preference for the Ancients (Classical authors) because their art was based directly upon nature, and not upon other art.\n\nOn the other hand, Swift was profoundly mistrustful of attempts at reason that resulted in either [[hubris]] (for example, the Projectors satirised in ''A Tale of a Tub'' or in Book III of ''Gulliver's Travels'') or immorality (such as the speaker of ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', who offers an entirely logical and wholly immoral proposal for [[cannibalism]]). The Houyhnhnms embody both the good and the bad side of reason, for they have the pure language Swift wished for and the amorally rational approach to solving the problems of humanity (Yahoos); the extirpation of the Yahoo population by the horses is very like the speaker of ''A Modest Proposal''.\n\nIn the shipping lanes he is rescued by a [[Pedro de Mendez|Portuguese sea captain]], a level-headed individual albeit full of concern for others, whose temperament at one level appears intermediate between the calm, rational Houyhnhnms of Houyhnhnmland and the norm of corrupt, European humanity, which Gulliver no longer distinguishes from Houyhnhnmland's wild Yahoos. Gulliver can speak with him, and though now disaffected from all humanity, he began to tolerate his company. Gulliver is returned to his English home and family, finds their smell and look intolerable and all his countrymen no better than \"Yahoos\", purchases and converses with two stabled horses, tolerating the stable boy, and assures the reader of his account's utter veracity.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* [[Brobdingnag]]\n* [[Lilliput and Blefuscu]]\n* [[Struldbrug]]\n* [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Cite NIE|wstitle=Houyhnhnms|short=x}}\n\n{{Gulliver's Travels}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional horses]]\n[[Category:Gulliver's Travels]]\n[[Category:Fictional island countries]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{refimprove|date=August 2009}} \n[[File:Gulliver u Hvajninim\u016f - Grandville.jpg|thumb|Gulliver in discussion with Houyhnhnms (1856 lllustration by [[J.J.
