Shelby became interested in the potential of the [[AC Ace]] chassis, especially after [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] stopped building automobile engines, and the sales with the [[Ford Zephyr engine]] were declining in September 1961.  Shelby contacted Charles Hurlock of AC, who agreed to provide the chassis on credit.  Dave Evans of [[Ford Motor Company]], agreed to provide on credit, the 221-cubic-inch and 260-cubic-inch V8 engines with transmissions.  The new car, called the Carroll Shelby Experimental or CSX0001, would be marketed as the Shelby AC Cobra, then [[AC Cobra]], and eventually, the [[Ford Cobra]].  Production began in March 1962, and 75 cars were sold by the end of the year.  A 100 cars had been built by April 1963, the first 75 with the 260-cubic-inch engine, followed by a 289-cubic-inch engine.  The 427 Cobra prototype was built in Oct. 1964.<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|172\u2013183,190,195}}\n\nShelby started racing his creation in October 1962 at Riverside, with Billy Krause driving the CSX0002.  Racing experience from 1963 indicated that further modifications were necessary to make the Cobra competitive with the Ferrari GT cars; in particular, the AC roadster body needed to be replaced with a lower-drag enclosed coupe body for high-speed circuits.  The result was the [[Shelby Daytona]] Coupe, which took three GT class wins on the 1964 [[World Sportscar Championship]] GT circuit, including Le Mans and the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, plus the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[United States Road Racing Championship|U.S. GT Championship]].  Then in 1965, Shelby American Cobra won the [[World Sportscar Championship|International Championship for GT Manufacturers]].<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|180,202,208\u2013210,213\u2013214,217,221}}\n\nAfter success with the Daytona Coupe in 1964, Shelby-American became more heavily involved in Ford's [[Ford GT40|GT40]] Sports Prototype racing program, which had experienced disappointing results.  Shelby made changes to running gear, particularly transmissions, to improve reliability, and designed their GT40 Mark II variant around Ford's 7.0-liter engine.  The results paid off spectacularly in 1966, with the Mark II bringing Ford the overall Constructors' title in the World Sportscar Championship, clinched with their 1-2-3 finish at Le Mans.  But Ford could not rest on its laurels in light of Ferrari's determined efforts, and was developing a radical new prototype with a lightweight chassis based on aluminum honeycomb panels.  Shelby was brought in to finalize development of the car after the project experienced setbacks in 1966.  The Mark IV was introduced for the 1967 [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and won handily, then was prepared for Le Mans.  Various misfortunes took Ford out of realistic contention for a repeat title, but the Shelby-American team delivered another record-breaking statement win at Le Mans.  An exclamation point was added to that statement when [[Dan Gurney]] shook and sprayed champagne on the podium, starting a tradition.  The Mark IV was Shelby's last prototype racer, as new limits on engine displacement for that class took all of Ford's high-performance engines out of eligibility.\n\nShelby's early racing successes led to a joint effort of Ford and Shelby-American to produce the Mustang-based [[Shelby GT350]], starting in 1965, then the [[Shelby GT500]], starting in 1967. Shelby produced those cars through 1968, then subsequent cars with the Shelby GT brand were produced in-house by Ford.\n\nAfter parting with Ford, Shelby moved on to help develop performance cars with divisions of the two other [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big 3]] American companies: [[Dodge]], and [[Oldsmobile]].\n\nIn the intervening years, Shelby had a series of ventures start and stop relating to production of \"completion\" Cobras&nbsp;\u2014 cars that were allegedly built using \"leftover\" parts and frames. In the 1960s, the [[FIA]] required entrants (Shelby, Ford, Ferrari, etc.) to produce at least 100 cars for [[homologated]] classes of racing. Shelby simply ordered an insufficient number of cars and skipped a large block of [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s, to create the illusion the company had imported large numbers of cars. Decades later in the 1990s, Carroll alleged that he had found the \"left over\" frames, and began selling cars which were supposedly finally \"completed\". After it was discovered the cars were built from scratch in collaboration with McCluskey, Ltd., they were re-termed \"continuation\" Cobras. The cars are still built to this day, known as the current CSX4000 series of Cobras.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1991, the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/carroll-shelby.html Carroll Shelby] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 1992, the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1992,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319205857/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/carroll-shelby/126/ Automotive Hall of Fame]</ref> and the [[Diecast Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

In 2004, a new '''[[Ford Shelby Cobra Concept]]''' was shown off at U.S. car shows. Built with a retro body mimicking the 1960s [[AC Cobra|Cobras]] mixed with modern touches, it was based on the [[Ford GT]] chassis (reworked for [[front engine]]/[[rear wheel drive]]) powered with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] that produced 605&nbsp;hp (451&nbsp;kW). It received overwhelmingly positive press reviews and has won the \"Best In Show\" award at Detroit International Auto Show.\n\nA coupe version of the Shelby Cobra roadster was introduced the following year. The '''[[Ford Shelby GR-1]]''' concept car of 2005. While sporting a completely modern design, it showed a nod to the 1960s [[Shelby Daytona]]. The GR-1, like the Cobra, is based on the GT's chassis. Press reviews for the GR-1 have been positive. The car was featured on the cover of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''[[Car Magazine]]''. The Ford Shelby GR-1 could possibly be built, taking over the [[Ford GT]]'s production line after its production comes to an end.\n\nIn 2005, Carroll Shelby built his first modern Masterpiece, the CSM #00001 V6 Shelby Mustang CS6, to prove to Ford that he could still build high-performance cars, and that he did, with the V6 putting out 380HP it made the V6 Shelby faster than Ford's V8 300HP. Because Ford thought the CS6 would hurt Ford Mustang V8 sales, Ford told Shelby to go with the V8 instead. Few CS6 Shelbys were made by Shelby; consequently these are among the rarest Shelbys in the world.\n\nThe [[Shelby Mustang|Shelby GT500]] was revealed at the [[New York International Auto Show]], and became available in the summer of 2006 as part of the model year 2007 lineup. It was powered by a 5.4 Liter Modular V8, with four-valves-per-cylinder heads borrowed from the $150K Ford GT supercar, an Eaton M122 [[Roots-type supercharger]] and is rated by Ford at {{convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|480|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. It boasts a [[Tremec]] T-6060 [[manual transmission]], reworked [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] geometry, 18-inch wheels, functional aerodynamic body kit, and still retains the [[Live axle|solid rear axle]]. The GT500 starts at an MSRP of $40,930 for the coupe, and $45,755 for the convertible version. Although Carroll Shelby had no hands-on involvement in the design of the car, he did provide Ford and SVT (Special Vehicle Team) input on what would make the car better and convinced Ford to enlist wider rear tires (from 255&nbsp;mm wide to 285&nbsp;mm wide).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nShelby, in cooperation with the [[Hertz Corporation]], produced 500 cars named \"Shelby GT-H\" in 2006. This was a special-edition Ford Mustang GT, available for rental from Hertz. A Ford Racing Performance Group FR1 Power Pack increased the GT's 4.6 L V8 engine to {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The cars included a custom Shelby hood and black and gold body styling, incorporating a gold-plated \"Hertz\" nameplate on both sides.\n\nA consumer version of the Shelby GT-H was available from Shelby through Ford dealers, called the Shelby GT. There were 5,682 vehicles for 2007 and 2,300 for 2008 were built. They had the same engine as the GT-H, but more suspension, appearance and drivetrain upgrades and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also. An available upgrade from the Shelby factory in Las Vegas were a few different superchargers. It then was called a Shelby GT/SC. All Shelby GTs are shipped with the Shelby serial number (CSM) on the dashboard badge and in the engine compartment, such as 07SGT0001 or 08SGT0001.\n\n==Non-Ford projects==\nIn his later years, Shelby brought several lawsuits against companies making copies of the Cobra body for use on kit cars&nbsp;\u2013 ostensibly for copyright, trademark and patent violations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Despite the litigation, the Cobra kit car industry continues to thrive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne of the lawsuits involved the Superformance Brock Coupe, a copy of the original Shelby Daytona Coupe. The Superformance Brock Coupe was designed by [[Pete Brock]], who had also designed the original Daytona Coupe for Shelby. Shelby American sued Superformance after the company had developed and begun production of the Superformance Brock Coupe. Eventually, the litigation was settled, though the terms of the settlement have never been released to the public. As a result of the agreement between the two companies, the product is now known as the Shelby Daytona Coupe, despite being neither designed nor built by Shelby American.

Like most Ferrari repairs, this was not going to be a cheap, simple fix. At the time, Laughlin was an active participant in the American sports car racing scene and was a close acquaintance of many of the key figures, including fellow Texan Shelby. The two had witnessed a number of V8-powered home-built specials challenge, and often defeat, the best that Europe had to offer. The idea developed that they should build a dual-purpose car based on the solid mechanicals of the Chevrolet Corvette. European-style alloy coachwork could help the chassis finally realize its potential. By chance, Laughlin owned a few Chevrolet dealerships and had a particularly valuable friend in Peter Coltrin, an automotive journalist who had gained an \u201cin\u201d with the influential Italians. Laughlin met with Jim Hall and Carroll Shelby to begin discussing what form their new Italian-American hybrid would take. The general consensus was that they should create a car that offered the best of both worlds \u2013 a Corvette with the distinction, performance and style of a Ferrari, but with the power and reliability of a Chevrolet. The aim was to create a genuine high-performance GT with enough leg and headroom to meet American expectations. Once this was decided, Coltrin put Laughlin in touch with Sergio Scaglietti. With the help of Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole, three 1959 Corvette chassis were discreetly acquired from the St. Louis Corvette plant before bodies could be fitted \u2013 one was specified with a \u201cfuelie\u201d and a four-speed, the others came with twin four barrels and automatics. During one of his frequent trips through Europe, Laughlin met with Sergio Scaglietti who agreed to produce a small run of bodies for the Corvette chassis. At the time, Scaglietti was busy turning out Ferrari's Tour de France and purpose-built racing cars. The Scaglietti Corvette would follow the lines of the Tour de France, albeit lines adapted to fit the Corvette's larger footprint. In an effort to impress, or perhaps, appease GM management, Laughlin specified a proper Corvette grille. The interior would be similarly hybridized with an intriguing combination of Americana \u2013 Stewart Warner gauges, T-handle parking brake, Corvette shift knob; and classic Italian GT \u2013 a purposeful crackle-finish dashboard, deeply bolstered leather seats and exquisite door hardware. \n[[File:ScagliettiCorvette.JPG|thumb|240px|right|1959 [[Scaglietti]] Corvette]]\nThe completed car arrived in Texas in the fall of 1960, almost 18 months after the chassis had been obtained. It proved to be the only one of the three to be finished in Italy and shipped back to the United States as a complete car. When Laughlin received the car, the fit and finish were not quite what he was expecting, especially as the project had taken nearly three years from conception to completion. Enzo Ferrari would have been quite unhappy to hear that his exclusive coach builder was working on side projects for a group of Texans, so, to Scaglietti's credit, the car was largely a prototype and the work was executed in a shroud of secrecy. Towards the end of the project, Carroll Shelby, who by then was living in Italy, received a late-night phone call from Ed Cole. Cole had been chastised by GM management and was told to drop the project. It was poor timing. American car companies were under pressure to cut down on their high-performance and racing programs. They simply could not deal with the repercussions of a GM-backed Italian bodied Corvette. The remaining cars were shipped to Houston in a partially completed state. Jim Hall took delivery of one. Shelby, who had helped conceive the project, ended up declining the remaining car and it was promptly sold.\n\n==Other projects==\nCarroll Shelby's name is associated with a chili fixings kit.

The memoir describes his days as a race car driver, the challenges, the victories, and the crashes \u2014 the worst of which he describes as an \u201cexplosion.\u201d The memoir also discusses the genesis for the revolutionary car he created, the [[Shelby Cobra]].\n\n==Shelby the constructor==\n{{main|Shelby American vehicles}}\n[[File:Blue Cobra by Blue Pacific.JPG|thumb|right|1965 [[AC Cobra]] 427 (North America)]]\nShelby states in his book, The Carroll Shelby Story, \"...the longer I went on racing and was around the limited-production factories in Europe, the more I realized that America was missing a big bet, a winning bet...that winning bet I'm talking about was the design and production of an all-purpose, all-American sports or grand touring car that you could drive to market and also race during the weekend...\"  In particular, Shelby wanted to put a 300 [[horsepower|brake horsepower]] [[V8]] on an Austin Healey type [[chassis]], so that it weighed less than 2600 pounds.<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|90\u201393}}\n\nAfter retiring from driving in October 1959 for health reasons,<ref>\"Automobiles\", episode about Ford Motor Company, History Channel</ref> Shelby opened a high-performance driving school and the [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American]] performance equipment and customization company in the Los Angeles area. Shelby became interested in the potential of the [[AC Ace]] chassis, especially after [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] stopped building automobile engines, and the sales with the [[Ford Zephyr engine]] were declining in September 1961.  Shelby contacted Charles Hurlock of AC, who agreed to provide the chassis on credit.  Dave Evans of [[Ford Motor Company]], agreed to provide on credit, the 221-cubic-inch and 260-cubic-inch V8 engines with transmissions.  The new car, called the Carroll Shelby Experimental or CSX0001, would be marketed as the Shelby AC Cobra, then [[AC Cobra]], and eventually, the [[Ford Cobra]].  Production began in March 1962, and 75 cars were sold by the end of the year.  A 100 cars had been built by April 1963, the first 75 with the 260-cubic-inch engine, followed by a 289-cubic-inch engine.  The 427 Cobra prototype was built in Oct. 1964.<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|172\u2013183,190,195}}\n\nShelby started racing his creation in October 1962 at Riverside, with Billy Krause driving the CSX0002.  Racing experience from 1963 indicated that further modifications were necessary to make the Cobra competitive with the Ferrari GT cars; in particular, the AC roadster body needed to be replaced with a lower-drag enclosed coupe body for high-speed circuits.  The result was the [[Shelby Daytona]] Coupe, which took three GT class wins on the 1964 [[World Sportscar Championship]] GT circuit, including Le Mans and the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, plus the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[United States Road Racing Championship|U.S. GT Championship]].  Then in 1965, Shelby American Cobra won the [[World Sportscar Championship|International Championship for GT Manufacturers]].<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|180,202,208\u2013210,213\u2013214,217,221}}\n\nAfter success with the Daytona Coupe in 1964, Shelby-American became more heavily involved in Ford's [[Ford GT40|GT40]] Sports Prototype racing program, which had experienced disappointing results.  Shelby made changes to running gear, particularly transmissions, to improve reliability, and designed their GT40 Mark II variant around Ford's 7.0-liter engine.  The results paid off spectacularly in 1966, with the Mark II bringing Ford the overall Constructors' title in the World Sportscar Championship, clinched with their 1-2-3 finish at Le Mans.  But Ford could not rest on its laurels in light of Ferrari's determined efforts, and was developing a radical new prototype with a lightweight chassis based on aluminum honeycomb panels.  Shelby was brought in to finalize development of the car after the project experienced setbacks in 1966.  The Mark IV was introduced for the 1967 [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and won handily, then was prepared for Le Mans.  Various misfortunes took Ford out of realistic contention for a repeat title, but the Shelby-American team delivered another record-breaking statement win at Le Mans.  An exclamation point was added to that statement when [[Dan Gurney]] shook and sprayed champagne on the podium, starting a tradition.  The Mark IV was Shelby's last prototype racer, as new limits on engine displacement for that class took all of Ford's high-performance engines out of eligibility.\n\nShelby's early racing successes led to a joint effort of Ford and Shelby-American to produce the Mustang-based [[Shelby GT350]], starting in 1965, then the [[Shelby GT500]], starting in 1967. Shelby produced those cars through 1968, then subsequent cars with the Shelby GT brand were produced in-house by Ford.\n\nAfter parting with Ford, Shelby moved on to help develop performance cars with divisions of the two other [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big 3]] American companies: [[Dodge]], and [[Oldsmobile]].\n\nIn the intervening years, Shelby had a series of ventures start and stop relating to production of \"completion\" Cobras&nbsp;\u2014 cars that were allegedly built using \"leftover\" parts and frames. In the 1960s, the [[FIA]] required entrants (Shelby, Ford, Ferrari, etc.) to produce at least 100 cars for [[homologated]] classes of racing. Shelby simply ordered an insufficient number of cars and skipped a large block of [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s, to create the illusion the company had imported large numbers of cars. Decades later in the 1990s, Carroll alleged that he had found the \"left over\" frames, and began selling cars which were supposedly finally \"completed\". After it was discovered the cars were built from scratch in collaboration with McCluskey, Ltd., they were re-termed \"continuation\" Cobras. The cars are still built to this day, known as the current CSX4000 series of Cobras.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1991, the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/carroll-shelby.html Carroll Shelby] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 1992, the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1992,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319205857/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/carroll-shelby/126/ Automotive Hall of Fame]</ref> and the [[Diecast Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

All other Shelbys were re-engineered models produced by other manufacturers and then modified by Shelby.\n\nPrior to production of the Series 1, significant costs were incurred in testing and certification required to conform to 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Once completed, a total of 249 production Series 1 cars were constructed by Shelby American as model year 1999 cars.\n\nDuring production, Venture Corporation purchased Shelby American, Inc.

Included in the asset purchase were enough components to produce several more complete Series 1s.\n\nBecause the 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards certificate had expired, and the cost to re-certify the car was prohibitive, all Series 1's produced after that date were completed as \"component cars\" and delivered with no engine or transmission.  Those \"component car\" models built in 2005 are identified with a seven-digit vehicle identification number (VIN) and were designated with a CSX5000 series serial number. The original 249 were production cars with a seventeen-digit VIN.\n\nThe Series 1 was produced in both supercharged and normally aspirated versions. Supercharged cars were also outfitted by the factory with larger brakes and a heavy duty clutch. Performance is near \"supercar\" category with a [[0 to 60 mph]] time at 4.1 seconds for the supercharged version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.caranddriver.com/files/shelby-series-1.pdf |title=Shelby Series 1 |publisher=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref>  Nicely optioned, Series 1 had power steering, power disc brakes, factory air conditioning, power windows, and an AM/FM/CD audio system.

In 2004, a new '''[[Ford Shelby Cobra Concept]]''' was shown off at U.S. car shows. Built with a retro body mimicking the 1960s [[AC Cobra|Cobras]] mixed with modern touches, it was based on the [[Ford GT]] chassis (reworked for [[front engine]]/[[rear wheel drive]]) powered with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] that produced 605&nbsp;hp (451&nbsp;kW). It received overwhelmingly positive press reviews and has won the \"Best In Show\" award at Detroit International Auto Show.\n\nA coupe version of the Shelby Cobra roadster was introduced the following year. The '''[[Ford Shelby GR-1]]''' concept car of 2005. While sporting a completely modern design, it showed a nod to the 1960s [[Shelby Daytona]]. The GR-1, like the Cobra, is based on the GT's chassis. Press reviews for the GR-1 have been positive. The car was featured on the cover of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''[[Car Magazine]]''. The Ford Shelby GR-1 could possibly be built, taking over the [[Ford GT]]'s production line after its production comes to an end.\n\nIn 2005, Carroll Shelby built his first modern Masterpiece, the CSM #00001 V6 Shelby Mustang CS6, to prove to Ford that he could still build high-performance cars, and that he did, with the V6 putting out 380HP it made the V6 Shelby faster than Ford's V8 300HP. Because Ford thought the CS6 would hurt Ford Mustang V8 sales, Ford told Shelby to go with the V8 instead. Few CS6 Shelbys were made by Shelby; consequently these are among the rarest Shelbys in the world.\n\nThe [[Shelby Mustang|Shelby GT500]] was revealed at the [[New York International Auto Show]], and became available in the summer of 2006 as part of the model year 2007 lineup. It was powered by a 5.4 Liter Modular V8, with four-valves-per-cylinder heads borrowed from the $150K Ford GT supercar, an Eaton M122 [[Roots-type supercharger]] and is rated by Ford at {{convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|480|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. It boasts a [[Tremec]] T-6060 [[manual transmission]], reworked [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] geometry, 18-inch wheels, functional aerodynamic body kit, and still retains the [[Live axle|solid rear axle]]. The GT500 starts at an MSRP of $40,930 for the coupe, and $45,755 for the convertible version. Although Carroll Shelby had no hands-on involvement in the design of the car, he did provide Ford and SVT (Special Vehicle Team) input on what would make the car better and convinced Ford to enlist wider rear tires (from 255&nbsp;mm wide to 285&nbsp;mm wide).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nShelby, in cooperation with the [[Hertz Corporation]], produced 500 cars named \"Shelby GT-H\" in 2006. This was a special-edition Ford Mustang GT, available for rental from Hertz. A Ford Racing Performance Group FR1 Power Pack increased the GT's 4.6 L V8 engine to {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The cars included a custom Shelby hood and black and gold body styling, incorporating a gold-plated \"Hertz\" nameplate on both sides.\n\nA consumer version of the Shelby GT-H was available from Shelby through Ford dealers, called the Shelby GT. There were 5,682 vehicles for 2007 and 2,300 for 2008 were built. They had the same engine as the GT-H, but more suspension, appearance and drivetrain upgrades and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also. An available upgrade from the Shelby factory in Las Vegas were a few different superchargers. It then was called a Shelby GT/SC. All Shelby GTs are shipped with the Shelby serial number (CSM) on the dashboard badge and in the engine compartment, such as 07SGT0001 or 08SGT0001.\n\n==Non-Ford projects==\nIn his later years, Shelby brought several lawsuits against companies making copies of the Cobra body for use on kit cars&nbsp;\u2013 ostensibly for copyright, trademark and patent violations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Despite the litigation, the Cobra kit car industry continues to thrive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne of the lawsuits involved the Superformance Brock Coupe, a copy of the original Shelby Daytona Coupe. The Superformance Brock Coupe was designed by [[Pete Brock]], who had also designed the original Daytona Coupe for Shelby. Shelby American sued Superformance after the company had developed and begun production of the Superformance Brock Coupe. Eventually, the litigation was settled, though the terms of the settlement have never been released to the public. As a result of the agreement between the two companies, the product is now known as the Shelby Daytona Coupe, despite being neither designed nor built by Shelby American. Nearly 150 of these new Shelby Daytona Coupes have been built as of February 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 2002, Unique Performance, a company of Farmers Branch, Texas, purchased a license from Carroll Shelby Enterprises to place his name on a series of continuation vintage vehicles. This company specialized in recreating 1960s-style Shelby Mustangs. They purchased used Mustangs and installed updated versions of the Shelby 325-horsepower 302-cubic-inch V8 engine. They also use modern five-speed manual transmissions, brakes, steering, suspension, interiors and entertainment systems.

Like most Ferrari repairs, this was not going to be a cheap, simple fix. At the time, Laughlin was an active participant in the American sports car racing scene and was a close acquaintance of many of the key figures, including fellow Texan Shelby. The two had witnessed a number of V8-powered home-built specials challenge, and often defeat, the best that Europe had to offer. The idea developed that they should build a dual-purpose car based on the solid mechanicals of the Chevrolet Corvette. European-style alloy coachwork could help the chassis finally realize its potential. By chance, Laughlin owned a few Chevrolet dealerships and had a particularly valuable friend in Peter Coltrin, an automotive journalist who had gained an \u201cin\u201d with the influential Italians. Laughlin met with Jim Hall and Carroll Shelby to begin discussing what form their new Italian-American hybrid would take. The general consensus was that they should create a car that offered the best of both worlds \u2013 a Corvette with the distinction, performance and style of a Ferrari, but with the power and reliability of a Chevrolet. The aim was to create a genuine high-performance GT with enough leg and headroom to meet American expectations. Once this was decided, Coltrin put Laughlin in touch with Sergio Scaglietti. With the help of Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole, three 1959 Corvette chassis were discreetly acquired from the St. Louis Corvette plant before bodies could be fitted \u2013 one was specified with a \u201cfuelie\u201d and a four-speed, the others came with twin four barrels and automatics. During one of his frequent trips through Europe, Laughlin met with Sergio Scaglietti who agreed to produce a small run of bodies for the Corvette chassis. At the time, Scaglietti was busy turning out Ferrari's Tour de France and purpose-built racing cars. The Scaglietti Corvette would follow the lines of the Tour de France, albeit lines adapted to fit the Corvette's larger footprint. In an effort to impress, or perhaps, appease GM management, Laughlin specified a proper Corvette grille. The interior would be similarly hybridized with an intriguing combination of Americana \u2013 Stewart Warner gauges, T-handle parking brake, Corvette shift knob; and classic Italian GT \u2013 a purposeful crackle-finish dashboard, deeply bolstered leather seats and exquisite door hardware. \n[[File:ScagliettiCorvette.JPG|thumb|240px|right|1959 [[Scaglietti]] Corvette]]\nThe completed car arrived in Texas in the fall of 1960, almost 18 months after the chassis had been obtained. It proved to be the only one of the three to be finished in Italy and shipped back to the United States as a complete car. When Laughlin received the car, the fit and finish were not quite what he was expecting, especially as the project had taken nearly three years from conception to completion. Enzo Ferrari would have been quite unhappy to hear that his exclusive coach builder was working on side projects for a group of Texans, so, to Scaglietti's credit, the car was largely a prototype and the work was executed in a shroud of secrecy. Towards the end of the project, Carroll Shelby, who by then was living in Italy, received a late-night phone call from Ed Cole. Cole had been chastised by GM management and was told to drop the project. It was poor timing. American car companies were under pressure to cut down on their high-performance and racing programs. They simply could not deal with the repercussions of a GM-backed Italian bodied Corvette. The remaining cars were shipped to Houston in a partially completed state. Jim Hall took delivery of one. Shelby, who had helped conceive the project, ended up declining the remaining car and it was promptly sold.\n\n==Other projects==\nCarroll Shelby's name is associated with a chili fixings kit.

The character George was inspired by the story of [[Tarzan]] and a cartoon characterization of [[George Eiferman]] (Mr. America, Mr. Universe, IFBB Hall of Famer) drawn by a cook on his [[minesweeper|mine sweeper]] in the Navy during [[World War II]]. It ran for 17 episodes on [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday mornings]] from September 9 to December 30, 1967, on the American [[television network]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=237-238}}</ref>\n\n==Program format==\nEach episode featured three segments in the form of three unrelated cartoons: ''George of the Jungle'', ''[[Tom Slick (TV series)|Tom Slick]]'', and ''[[Super Chicken]]''.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool |url-access=registration |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/117 117]-119}}</ref> Each of the cartoons ended with a strike on the Tympani (Kettledrum), which changed to an ascending tone, following a bad pun.\n\nUnlike previous Ward series, the animation production was done in Hollywood using veteran animators Phil Duncan, [[Rod Scribner]], and [[Rudy Zamora]], among others. Each segment's theme song was written by the team of Stan Worth and [[Sheldon Allman]], though the cartoons themselves had little or no music scoring, as with ''Bullwinkle''. Ward mainstays [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]], [[June Foray]],  [[Paul Frees]], and [[Daws Butler]] provided most of the character voices over all three segments.\n\nThe cartoons are technically more advanced than the rather crude animation in Ward's earlier series, which originated from Gamma Productions, a Mexican studio sponsored by Ward. He was so pleased with ''George of the Jungle'' that he allowed production to go over-budget, which resulted in considerable financial loss, ultimately limiting the series to 17 episodes.\n\nThe complete series is available now on DVD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/George-Jungle-Complete-Series-Box-Art/8647 |title=Box Art for George of the Jungle \u2013 The Complete Series |accessdate=2008-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124050346/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/George-Jungle-Complete-Series-Box-Art/8647 |archivedate=2008-01-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Theme song lyrics==\n<br>\nGeorge, George, George of the Jungle,<br>\nStrong as he can be.<br>\n(''[[Tarzan yell]]'') Watch out for that tree!<br>\n<br>\nGeorge, George, George of the Jungle<br>\nLives a life that's free.<br>\n(''Tarzan yell'') Watch out for that tree!<br>\n<br>\nWhen he gets in a scrape,<br>\nHe makes his escape<br>\nWith the help of his friend,<br>\nAn ape named Ape.<br>\nThen away he'll [[Yiddish words used in English#S|schlep]] on his elephant Shep<br>\nWhile Fella and Ursula stay in step...<ref>This line was often misheard as \"Bella and Ursula,\" causing puzzlement to viewers as to the non-appearance of \"Bella\" in the series, as in this quotation from ''Animation World Update'': {{cite web| url= http://www.awn.com/animationworld/george-jungle-hey-watch-out-revamp | title='George of the Jungle': Hey, Watch Out for that Revamp|first=Joe|last= Strike |date=January 18, 2008 |accessdate= January 16, 2017| publisher=[[Animation World Network]]| | quote= Still, the Riddle of Bella and Ursula remains unsolved.

George (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]) is a dim-witted but big-hearted \"ape man\" who is always called upon by District Commissioner Alistair (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]) to save inhabitants of the [[Jungle (terrain)|jungle]] territory of [[M'bwebwe|Mbwebwe]] Province in Africa from various threats.\n\nIn the opening title, George is depicted swinging on vines, repeatedly slamming face-first into [[tree]]s or other obstacles even as theme-song singers warn him to \"watch out for that tree!\" Another running gag is that George keeps forgetting that he lives in a treehouse, falling to the ground every time he leaves home.\n\nGeorge's \"beloved mate\" is Ursula (voiced by [[June Foray]]), a [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]]-like character far brighter than George, whom George refers to as \"Fella\" (the phrase in the title song ''\"[W]hile Fella and Ursula stay in step...\"'' is meant to show that they are the same person). George's closest friend is an [[ape]] named Ape (voiced by [[Paul Frees]] impersonating [[Ronald Colman]]{{cn|date=August 2016}}) who, like Ursula, is far more intelligent than George. George has a pet [[elephant]] named Shep, who behaves like a [[lap dog]], or, as George refers to him, a \"great big [[peanut]]-lovin' poochie,\" and who George thinks is a dog. Also of note is the Tooky Tooky (or Tookie Tookie) [[bird]] famous for his call: \"Ah ah ee ee tooky tooky!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UGUgtebFVQE|title=Tookie Tookie Bird - George Of The Jungle|first=|last=Tooki39|date=5 February 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nGeorge's two most frequent foes are a pair of stereotypical [[White hunter|hunters]] named \"Tiger\" Titheridge (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and \"Weevil\" Plumtree (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]). Tiger, the taller of the two, wears a [[pith helmet]] and [[khakis]], has a pencil [[moustache]], and speaks in a poncy [[Received Pronunciation|Oxford accent]], while Weevil [[West Country English#Social stigma and future of West Country dialect|talks like a pirate]] and wears a white t-shirt and shorts with a [[Slouch hat|bush hat]]. Another one of George's recurring enemies is a [[mad scientist]] named Dr. Chicago (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]).\n\nGeorge, though hopelessly unintelligent, possesses substantial strength and jungle instincts that allow him to track down enemies. When trapped in a seemingly hopeless situation, he carries a miniature [[phrase book]] with numerous animal calls to summon help\u2014although he usually gives the wrong call.\n\n===''Tom Slick''===\n{{main|Tom Slick (TV series)}}\n\n''Tom Slick'' features the title character (voiced by Bill Scott), a racecar driver who competes in races with his trusty vehicle, the Thunderbolt Greaseslapper. He is accompanied by his girlfriend Marigold (voiced by [[June Foray]]), and his elderly [[mechanic]] Gertie Growler (also voiced by Bill Scott). Tom's chief antagonists are Baron Otto Matic (voiced by Paul Frees) and his lackey Clutcher (voiced by [[Daws Butler]] impersonating [[Frank Fontaine]] as \"Crazy Guggenheim\"), whom the Baron often hits across the head with a [[monkey wrench]] when he messes up Otto's plots.\n\n===''Super Chicken''===\n{{main|Super Chicken}}\n\n''Super Chicken'' features the title character (voiced by Bill Scott in a [[Mid-Atlantic accent|Boston Brahmin accent]]), a superhero (who, in \"real life\", is wealthy [[Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.|Henry Cabot Henhouse III]]) with a lion sidekick named Fred (voiced by Paul Frees impersonating [[Ed Wynn]]). Super Chicken usually begins their adventures with the battle cry, \"To the Super [[Coup\u00e9|Coop]], Fred!\" and when Fred comments on his latest injury, responds with a variation of the theme, \"You knew the job was dangerous when you took it, Fred!\"  Following his own mistakes, Super Chicken remarks, \"I'm glad no one was here to see that!\"\n\n==Episodes==\nEach of the following episodes consists of a George of the Jungle cartoon, a [[Super Chicken]] cartoon, and a [[Tom Slick (TV series)|Tom Slick]] cartoon.\n\n{{Episode table |background=#FFA500 |overall= |title= |airdate= |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = The Sultan's Pearl / The Zipper / The Bigg Race\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1967|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary = * ''The Sultan's Pearl'': The Sultan's most priceless treasure, a 300 pound pearl, has been stolen by \"Tiger\" Titherage and \"Weevil\" Plumtree and George tries to get it back.\n* ''The Zipper'': The elusive fiend dubbed the Zipper plans to blow up the world.

The character George was inspired by the story of [[Tarzan]] and a cartoon characterization of [[George Eiferman]] (Mr. America, Mr. Universe, IFBB Hall of Famer) drawn by a cook on his [[minesweeper|mine sweeper]] in the Navy during [[World War II]]. It ran for 17 episodes on [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday mornings]] from September 9 to December 30, 1967, on the American [[television network]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=237-238}}</ref>\n\n==Program format==\nEach episode featured three segments in the form of three unrelated cartoons: ''George of the Jungle'', ''[[Tom Slick (cartoon)|Tom Slick]]'', and ''[[Super Chicken]]''.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool |url-access=registration |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/117 117]-119}}</ref> Each of the cartoons ended with a strike on the Tympani (Kettledrum), which changed to an ascending tone, following a bad pun.\n\nUnlike previous Ward series, the animation production was done in Hollywood using veteran animators Phil Duncan, [[Rod Scribner]], and [[Rudy Zamora]], among others. Each segment's theme song was written by the team of Stan Worth and [[Sheldon Allman]], though the cartoons themselves had little or no music scoring, as with ''Bullwinkle''. Ward mainstays [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]], [[June Foray]],  [[Paul Frees]], and [[Daws Butler]] provided most of the character voices over all three segments.\n\nThe cartoons are technically more advanced than the rather crude animation in Ward's earlier series, which originated from Gamma Productions, a Mexican studio sponsored by Ward. He was so pleased with ''George of the Jungle'' that he allowed production to go over-budget, which resulted in considerable financial loss, ultimately limiting the series to 17 episodes.\n\nThe complete series is available now on DVD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/George-Jungle-Complete-Series-Box-Art/8647 |title=Box Art for George of the Jungle \u2013 The Complete Series |accessdate=2008-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124050346/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/George-Jungle-Complete-Series-Box-Art/8647 |archivedate=2008-01-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Theme song lyrics==\n<br>\nGeorge, George, George of the Jungle,<br>\nStrong as he can be.<br>\n(''[[Tarzan yell]]'') Watch out for that tree!<br>\n<br>\nGeorge, George, George of the Jungle<br>\nLives a life that's free.<br>\n(''Tarzan yell'') Watch out for that tree!<br>\n<br>\nWhen he gets in a scrape,<br>\nHe makes his escape<br>\nWith the help of his friend,<br>\nAn ape named Ape.<br>\nThen away he'll [[Yiddish words used in English#S|schlep]] on his elephant Shep<br>\nWhile Fella and Ursula stay in step...<ref>This line was often misheard as \"Bella and Ursula,\" causing puzzlement to viewers as to the non-appearance of \"Bella\" in the series, as in this quotation from ''Animation World Update'': {{cite web| url= http://www.awn.com/animationworld/george-jungle-hey-watch-out-revamp | title='George of the Jungle': Hey, Watch Out for that Revamp|first=Joe|last= Strike |date=January 18, 2008 |accessdate= January 16, 2017| publisher=[[Animation World Network]]| | quote= Still, the Riddle of Bella and Ursula remains unsolved.

George (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]) is a dim-witted but big-hearted \"ape man\" who is always called upon by District Commissioner Alistair (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]) to save inhabitants of the [[Jungle (terrain)|jungle]] territory of [[M'bwebwe|Mbwebwe]] Province in Africa from various threats.\n\nIn the opening title, George is depicted swinging on vines, repeatedly slamming face-first into [[tree]]s or other obstacles even as theme-song singers warn him to \"watch out for that tree!\" Another running gag is that George keeps forgetting that he lives in a treehouse, falling to the ground every time he leaves home.\n\nGeorge's \"beloved mate\" is Ursula (voiced by [[June Foray]]), a [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]]-like character far brighter than George, whom George refers to as \"Fella\" (the phrase in the title song ''\"[W]hile Fella and Ursula stay in step...\"'' is meant to show that they are the same person). George's closest friend is an [[ape]] named Ape (voiced by [[Paul Frees]] impersonating [[Ronald Colman]]{{cn|date=August 2016}}) who, like Ursula, is far more intelligent than George. George has a pet [[elephant]] named Shep, who behaves like a [[lap dog]], or, as George refers to him, a \"great big [[peanut]]-lovin' poochie,\" and who George thinks is a dog. Also of note is the Tooky Tooky (or Tookie Tookie) [[bird]] famous for his call: \"Ah ah ee ee tooky tooky!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UGUgtebFVQE|title=Tookie Tookie Bird - George Of The Jungle|first=|last=Tooki39|date=5 February 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nGeorge's two most frequent foes are a pair of stereotypical [[White hunter|hunters]] named \"Tiger\" Titheridge (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and \"Weevil\" Plumtree (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]). Tiger, the taller of the two, wears a [[pith helmet]] and [[khakis]], has a pencil [[moustache]], and speaks in a poncy [[Received Pronunciation|Oxford accent]], while Weevil [[West Country English#Social stigma and future of West Country dialect|talks like a pirate]] and wears a white t-shirt and shorts with a [[Slouch hat|bush hat]]. Another one of George's recurring enemies is a [[mad scientist]] named Dr. Chicago (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]).\n\nGeorge, though hopelessly unintelligent, possesses substantial strength and jungle instincts that allow him to track down enemies. When trapped in a seemingly hopeless situation, he carries a miniature [[phrase book]] with numerous animal calls to summon help\u2014although he usually gives the wrong call.\n\n===''Tom Slick''===\n{{main|Tom Slick (TV series)}}\n\n''Tom Slick'' features the title character (voiced by Bill Scott), a racecar driver who competes in races with his trusty vehicle, the Thunderbolt Greaseslapper. He is accompanied by his girlfriend Marigold (voiced by [[June Foray]]), and his elderly [[mechanic]] Gertie Growler (also voiced by Bill Scott). Tom's chief antagonists are Baron Otto Matic (voiced by Paul Frees) and his lackey Clutcher (voiced by [[Daws Butler]] impersonating [[Frank Fontaine]] as \"Crazy Guggenheim\"), whom the Baron often hits across the head with a [[monkey wrench]] when he messes up Otto's plots.\n\n===''Super Chicken''===\n{{main|Super Chicken}}\n\n''Super Chicken'' features the title character (voiced by Bill Scott in a [[Mid-Atlantic accent|Boston Brahmin accent]]), a superhero (who, in \"real life\", is wealthy [[Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.|Henry Cabot Henhouse III]]) with a lion sidekick named Fred (voiced by Paul Frees impersonating [[Ed Wynn]]). Super Chicken usually begins their adventures with the battle cry, \"To the Super [[Coup\u00e9|Coop]], Fred!\" and when Fred comments on his latest injury, responds with a variation of the theme, \"You knew the job was dangerous when you took it, Fred!\"  Following his own mistakes, Super Chicken remarks, \"I'm glad no one was here to see that!\"\n\n==Episodes==\nEach of the following episodes consists of a George of the Jungle cartoon, a [[Super Chicken]] cartoon, and a [[Tom Slick (TV series)|Tom Slick]] cartoon.\n\n{{Episode table |background=#FFA500 |overall= |title= |airdate= |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = The Sultan's Pearl / The Zipper / The Bigg Race\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1967|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary = * ''The Sultan's Pearl'': The Sultan's most priceless treasure, a 300 pound pearl, has been stolen by \"Tiger\" Titherage and \"Weevil\" Plumtree and George tries to get it back.\n* ''The Zipper'': The elusive fiend dubbed the Zipper plans to blow up the world.

Poor Clutcher gets hit on the head four times with a monkey wrench. The Stanley Steamer was shot down with the starting gun, Clutcher popped the Tokyo Teensy and Falinni Scalapinni tried to eat the Flying Salami. After some British racing luck, Clutcher and Gertie row like they have never rowed before to catch up with the Baron.

Its Council is based in [[Camberley]].  Much of the area is within the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St Saviour's Church, Valley End, Surrey.jpg|thumb|St Saviour's Church, Valley End, Windlesham]]\nThe district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], as a merger of [[Frimley and Camberley]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]], and Bagshot Rural District.\nThe [[Borough]] acquired its name because it includes extensive areas of [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] and woodland including [[Chobham Common]] and [[Lightwater]] Country Park.\n\n===Bagshot Rural District===\nBagshot Rural District formed the largest part of Surrey Heath. The villages and hamlets in Bagshot rural district comprised [[Lightwater]], [[Bagshot]], [[Windlesham]], [[Chobham, Surrey|Chobham]] including [[West End, Surrey|West End]] and [[Bisley, Surrey|Bisley]].\n\nThe [[motto]] for the district was ''Festina Prudenter'' granted on 20 July 1960.\n \nOn the crest, the gold and white background was from the arms of [[Chertsey Abbey]], which owned and is connected with the history of much of the district - Bagshot was included in a grant to the [[Chertsey Abbey|Abbey]] as early as 933. The [[stag]]'s head on the crest refers to [[Bagshot Park]], a royal [[demesne]] since [[Normans|Norman]] times and hunting ground of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings, and also to the fact that much of the area was formerly part of [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor Forest]]. The grenade on the crest refers to the area's military associations, in particular the former [[military camp]] at [[Chobham, Surrey|Chobham]] and the lion recalls the area's royal links. The fir cones and mound of [[heathland]] refers to [[Bagshot Heath]], and the [[falcon]] is derived from the supporters of the [[Earl of Onslow|Earls of Onslow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/surrey_ob.html|title=CIVIC HERALDRY OF ENGLAND AND WALES-SURREY (OBSOLETE)|website=www.civicheraldry.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe Surrey Heath community have been recognised for one of the most organised volunteer initiatives to the COVID-19 outbreak through their Surrey Heath Prepared organisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bylinetimes.com/2020/04/17/the-coronavirus-crisis-keeping-faith-with-nhs-volunteers-while-community-initiatives-blossom/|title=The Coronavirus Crisis: Keeping Faith with NHS Volunteers While Community Initiatives Blossom|last=Times <info@bylinetimes.com> (https://bylinetimes.com/)|first=Byline|date=2020-04-17|website=Byline Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe Borough is governed by Surrey Heath Borough Council.\nParish councils in Surrey Heath are in [[Bisley, Surrey|Bisley]] with the chairman being Cllr Barry Woodhead; [[Chobham, Surrey|Chobham]] with the chairman being Cllr Ian AC Taylor; [[West End, Surrey|West End]] with the chairman being Cllr David Elliott and [[Windlesham]] (which includes [[Lightwater]] and [[Bagshot]]) where the chairman is Cllr Keith Hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/council/councillorsrepresentatives/parishes.htm|title=Surrey Heath Councillors|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nFor detailed election results see [[Surrey Heath Borough Council elections]].\n\nIn 2014, the British Election Study named Surrey Heath as the most [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] constituency in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-30129990|title=Strange reasons why people vote|last=Wheeler|first=Brian|date=1 December 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 the Conservative council approved the \u00a3110 million purchase of the Square Shopping centre in Camberley, through the purchase of an offshore trust based in Jersey (a condition of the vendor), whilst Surrey Heath Borough Council owns the trust, it has no direct control over the asset and depends on unknown trustees to manage the assets of the trust.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.propertyweek.com/markets/surrey-heath-stands-by-110m-purchase-of-camberley-centre/5099706.article|title=Surrey Heath stands by \u00a3110m purchase of Camberley centre|last=Parker|first=Graham|date=9 Nov 2018|work=Property Week|access-date=26 Jan 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/sites/default/files/DRAFT%20Statement%20of%20Accounts%201819%20v3.pdf|title=Surrey Heath Borough Council Financial Statements 2018-9 (draft) page 13|last=|first=|date=31 May 2019|website=Surrey Heath Borough Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 Jan 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2016 Conservative Councillor Daniel Robert Adams attended court for non-payment of council tax,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/five-surrey-councillors-including-deputy-14029355|title=Five councillors summonsed to court for not paying council tax|last=Dobinson|first=Isabel|date=2017-12-12|website=getsurrey|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> in the same financial year he received two allowances (a basic and a special allowance) totalling \u00a36400.40 from Surrey Heath Council.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/council/committees-councillors/20162017MunicipalYrAllowances.pdf|title=Surrey Heath Borough Council member allowances paid in FY 16-17|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 Mar 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the council's accounts report property investment assets valued at \u00a383 million, a reported loss of \u00a327 million.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2019 it was revealed the Chief Executive, Karen Whelan had her pay increased by over 30% to \u00a3158,000 making it higher than the then PM [[Theresa May]], the increase was authorised by the Conservative Council leader Moira Gibson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/surrey-heath-borough-councils-chiefs-16686042|title=Council's chief's pay packet sky rockets 30%|last=Jubert|first=Jamie|date=2019-08-02|website=getsurrey|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\nThe 2 May 2019 borough elections produced 18 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], 10 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], 4 Independent councillors, 2 [[Green Party (UK)|Green]] and 1 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], leaving the Conservatives with a majority of one, their smallest ever.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=Surreyheath|number=1124348107884511232?s=20|title=All results for the Borough Elections have now been declared.

Its Council is based in [[Camberley]].  Much of the area is within the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St Saviour's Church, Valley End, Surrey.jpg|thumb|St Saviour's Church, Valley End, Windlesham]]\nThe district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], as a merger of [[Frimley and Camberley]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]], and Bagshot Rural District.\nThe [[Borough]] acquired its name because it includes extensive areas of [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] and woodland including [[Chobham Common]] and [[Lightwater]] Country Park.\n\n===Bagshot Rural District===\nBagshot Rural District formed the largest part of Surrey Heath. The villages and hamlets in Bagshot rural district comprised [[Lightwater]], [[Bagshot]], [[Windlesham]], [[Chobham, Surrey|Chobham]] including [[West End, Surrey|West End]] and [[Bisley, Surrey|Bisley]].\n\nThe [[motto]] for the district was ''Festina Prudenter'' granted on 20 July 1960.\n \nOn the crest, the gold and white background was from the arms of [[Chertsey Abbey]], which owned and is connected with the history of much of the district - Bagshot was included in a grant to the [[Chertsey Abbey|Abbey]] as early as 933. The [[stag]]'s head on the crest refers to [[Bagshot Park]], a royal [[demesne]] since [[Normans|Norman]] times and hunting ground of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings, and also to the fact that much of the area was formerly part of [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor Forest]]. The grenade on the crest refers to the area's military associations, in particular the former [[military camp]] at [[Chobham, Surrey|Chobham]] and the lion recalls the area's royal links. The fir cones and mound of [[heathland]] refers to [[Bagshot Heath]], and the [[falcon]] is derived from the supporters of the [[Earl of Onslow|Earls of Onslow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/surrey_ob.html|title=CIVIC HERALDRY OF ENGLAND AND WALES-SURREY (OBSOLETE)|website=www.civicheraldry.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe Surrey Heath community have been recognised for one of the most organised volunteer initiatives to the COVID-19 outbreak through their Surrey Heath Prepared organisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bylinetimes.com/2020/04/17/the-coronavirus-crisis-keeping-faith-with-nhs-volunteers-while-community-initiatives-blossom/|title=The Coronavirus Crisis: Keeping Faith with NHS Volunteers While Community Initiatives Blossom|last=Times <info@bylinetimes.com> (https://bylinetimes.com/)|first=Byline|date=2020-04-17|website=Byline Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe Borough is governed by Surrey Heath Borough Council.\nParish councils in Surrey Heath are in [[Bisley, Surrey|Bisley]] with the chairman being Cllr Barry Woodhead; [[Chobham, Surrey|Chobham]] with the chairman being Cllr Ian AC Taylor; [[West End, Surrey|West End]] with the chairman being Cllr David Elliott and [[Windlesham]] (which includes [[Lightwater]] and [[Bagshot]]) where the chairman is Cllr Keith Hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/council/councillorsrepresentatives/parishes.htm|title=Surrey Heath Councillors|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nFor detailed election results see [[Surrey Heath Borough Council elections]].\n\nIn 2014, the British Election Study named Surrey Heath as the most [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] constituency in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-30129990|title=Strange reasons why people vote|last=Wheeler|first=Brian|date=1 December 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 the Conservative council approved the \u00a3110 million purchase of the Square Shopping centre in Camberley, through the purchase of an offshore trust based in Jersey (a condition of the vendor), whilst Surrey Heath Borough Council owns the trust, it has no direct control over the asset and depends on unknown trustees to manage the assets of the trust.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.propertyweek.com/markets/surrey-heath-stands-by-110m-purchase-of-camberley-centre/5099706.article|title=Surrey Heath stands by \u00a3110m purchase of Camberley centre|last=Parker|first=Graham|date=9 Nov 2018|work=Property Week|access-date=26 Jan 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/sites/default/files/DRAFT%20Statement%20of%20Accounts%201819%20v3.pdf|title=Surrey Heath Borough Council Financial Statements 2018-9 (draft) page 13|last=|first=|date=31 May 2019|website=Surrey Heath Borough Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 Jan 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2016 Conservative Councillor Daniel Robert Adams attended court for non-payment of council tax<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/five-surrey-councillors-including-deputy-14029355|title=Five councillors summonsed to court for not paying council tax|last=Dobinson|first=Isabel|date=2017-12-12|website=getsurrey|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>, in the same financial year he received two allowances (a basic and a special allowance) totalling \u00a36400.40 from Surrey Heath Council.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/council/committees-councillors/20162017MunicipalYrAllowances.pdf|title=Surrey Heath Borough Council member allowances paid in FY 16-17|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 Mar 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the council's accounts report property investment assets valued at \u00a383 million, a reported loss of \u00a327 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2019 it was revealed the Chief Executive, Karen Whelan had her pay increased by over 30% to \u00a3158,000 making it higher than the then PM [[Theresa May]], the increase was authorised by the Conservative Council leader Moira Gibson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/surrey-heath-borough-councils-chiefs-16686042|title=Council's chief's pay packet sky rockets 30%|last=Jubert|first=Jamie|date=2019-08-02|website=getsurrey|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\nThe 2 May 2019 borough elections produced 18 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], 10 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], 4 Independent councillors, 2 [[Green Party (UK)|Green]] and 1 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], leaving the Conservatives with a majority of one, their smallest ever.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=Surreyheath|number=1124348107884511232?s=20|title=All results for the Borough Elections have now been declared.

His father, [[Mauriciu Blank]], an [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] and naturalized [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jew]], was manager of the [[Marmorosch Blank Bank]] (BMB), a major financial enterprise. Aristide took up jobs within the same company, and, after seeing action in the [[Second Balkan War]] and [[Romania in World War I|World War I]], began expanding its investments, branching out into maritime transport and founding [[CFRNA|CIDNA/CFRNA]] airlines. This period witnessed his attempt at setting up a press empire around the twin dailies ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'' and ''[[Diminea\u021ba]]'', and his brief engagement with ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]''.\n\nInheriting his father's position at the BMB, Blank expanded its activities and expenditures, setting aside money for [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and allowing his staff to engage in [[accounting fraud]]. By 1923, he was also engaged in [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalist]] politics, sponsoring propaganda writings and working alongside historians [[Nicolae Iorga]] and [[Vasile P\u00e2rvan]]. He set up his own publishing house, [[Editura Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103|Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103]], and a literary agency, which was for a while managed by philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]]\u2014ultimately sacked by Blank upon the discovery of embezzlement. Blank, who allegedly alternated mainstream politics with support for the far-left, found himself pitted against the antisemitic far-right, being brutalized by the [[National Christian Defense League]] and marked for retribution by the [[Iron Guard]].\n\nBeginning in the early 1920s, Blank cultivated Crown Prince [[Carol II of Romania|Carol]], who took over as [[King of the Romanians]] after a 1930 coup. Emerging as Carol's economic adviser, Blank joined the resulting ''[[camarilla]]'', an affiliation which shielded him from the consequences of BMB mismanagement. The enterprise crashed in 1931, unable to absorb the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Blank was removed from his managerial position following intervention by the [[National Bank of Romania]], but used political channels to preserve some measure of control, and was instrumental in toppling National Bank Governor [[Mihail Manoilescu]], who did not wish to refinance the BMB. His influence fluctuated for the remainder of Carol's reign; still unable to fully control the BMB, he still owned Discom, a lucrative retailer for products of state monopolies.\n\nPublic antisemitism and fascism took the forefront during the late years of Carlism and the [[Romania in World War II|early years of World War II]]. This period saw Blank marginalized, and resulted in additional scrutiny of the BMB affair, at the end of which he was sentenced to pay 600 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] in damages. Blank reemerged as BMB manager after [[King Michael's Coup]] of 1944, but he and his business were finally repressed by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] from 1948. In 1953, he was sentenced to 20 years for high treason, but managed to have that verdict overturned in 1955. After international pressures, he was allowed to emigrate in 1958, and lived his final months in [[Paris]]. His children from his successive marriages and affairs include American soldier Milenko Blank and French press magnate Patrice-Aristide Blank.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn in [[Bucharest]] on the first day of 1883<ref name=\"csec1\">Claudiu Seca\u0219iu, \"Biografia lui Aristide Blank (I)\", in ''[[Realitatea Evreiasc\u0103]]'', Issues 520\u2013521 (1320\u20131321), July\u2013August 2018, p. 15</ref> ([[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]: January 13), Aristide was the son of [[Mauriciu Blank]].

In January 1925, Codreanu's student organizations again alleged that Blank was trafficking in influence through the Romanian universities, and used this issue as a rally call for a student strike.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2011), pp. 122\u2013123</ref> As part of their conflict with Iorga, ''[[L\u0103ncieri]]'' youths openly confronted him, asking him why had \"sold himself to banker Blank\"; details about such contacts were popularized by LANC leader [[A.

Their Paris wedding was attended by numerous figures in politics and social life, including the then-Yugoslav Premier [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]], Maharajah [[Jagatjit Singh]], diplomat [[Nicolae Titulescu]], banker [[Robert de Rothschild]], and writers such as [[Marcel Pr\u00e9vost]] and [[Elena V\u0103c\u0103rescu]]. A LANC newspaper covered the event, noting: \"Blank must be reminded that this international and Jewified society does not impose itself on the Romanian public, who still feels the same way about him as those students who pummeled him out [...] in late March 1924.\"<ref>\"C\u0103s\u0103toria 'regelui' finan\u021bei rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti.

A Council of Regents oversaw matters relating to the court; one of its members was [[Gheorghe Buzdugan]], who, in 1929, declared having \"particular high esteem for Aristide Blank, the banker who is a remarkable personality, a man with a big heart and a philanthopist.\"<ref>[http://pdfs.jta.org/1929/1929-06-19_1393.pdf \"Roumanian Statesmen and Leaders Declare Their Views on Current Jewish Question\"], in the ''Jewish Daily Bulletin'', June 19, 1929, p. 1</ref>\n\nMauriciu, who had withdrawn from active participation at the BMB,<ref name=\"jmmillio\"/> died at [[Vienna]] in November 1929, with Aristide organizing the funeral ceremony.<ref>Mucenic, p. 348</ref> Blank Jr was by then head of the BMB, allegedly because Mauriciu had overestimated his son's business acumen.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 70\u201371, 270</ref> According to Argetoianu, he went on to severely weaken the company with a project to destroy the National Liberals' influence in high finance, as well as with unwise investments\u2014such as opening a BMB subsidiary on [[Place Vend\u00f4me]].<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 70\u201371</ref> From 1923, the group had three additional international offices\u2014in Istanbul, Vienna, and [[New York City]].<ref name=\"Waldman & Ciuciu, p. 120\"/> Sitting on the BMB's steering board, Argetoianu claimed to have observed the company having engaged virtually all of its available funds in investment schemes.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 269\u2013270</ref> Another issue hindering the bank's activities was the growing rivalry between Blank and his associate Richard de S\u00f6pk\u00e9z, with both engaged in drawing up capital on their respective side. According to Argetoianu, they each took at least 13.5 million lei in yearly stipends, while also collecting dividends from companies credited by the BMB, and through which Blank defrauded associates such as [[Ion G. Duca]] and [[George II of Greece]].<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 270\u2013272</ref> A later investigation suggested that Blank had used large sums of money for [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and that his staff was engaged in [[accounting fraud]].<ref name=\"jmmillio\"/><ref name=\"mo&al38\"/>\n\n===BMB crash and royal protection===\nA September 1929 review in ''Revista Economic\u0103'' pointed out \"conundrums\" (''buclucuri'') having to do with the BMB's investments in industry. It also noted that Blank was spreading rumors that the state bank for industry, Creditul Industrial, needed to be restructured; allegations emerged that this was a deliberate attempt create market panic, so that a new Creditul could then refinance Blank's own projects.<ref>Remizier, \"Situa\u021bia\", in ''Revista Economic\u0103'', Vol. XXXI, Issue 39, September 1929, pp. 341\u2013342</ref> By 1930, the BMB had [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] after registering 1.6 million lei in deficit.<ref name=\"fmtunuri\">Florin Mihai, \"'Tunurile' Suveranului\", in ''[[Jurnalul Na\u021bional]]'', August 8, 2008</ref> The enterprise went bankrupt in October 1931, immediately after being exposed to the consequences of the [[Great Depression]]\u2014though, Argetoianu notes, the world crisis only served to obscure the effects of Blank's own managerial \"insanity\".<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 70, 268</ref> This crash sparked a national scandal, after allegations that some investors had [[market moving information]], allowing them to withdraw deposits in advance. Blank himself argued that withdrawals were made possible by rumors of a looming war between Romania and the [[Soviet Union]], but his explanation failed to convince the general public.<ref name=\"jmmillio\"/> According to Argetoianu, Blank also complained that the investors' walkout was facilitated by the [[National Bank of Romania]], whose Governor, [[Costin Stoicescu]], was a disgruntled BMB employee. He believes that this claim was credible, in that Stoicescu always opposed state intervention in favor of the BMB.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 272\u2013273</ref>\n\nShortly before the BMB's crash, Carol returned home abruptly, deposing his son and taking over as King. As a result, Blank made his way into the ''[[camarilla]]'', a secretive para-legal circle which decided on political and financial matters.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 67sqq; Opri\u021bescu ''et al.'', p. 38; Ornea, pp. 17, 265</ref> Also frequenting this circle, Argetoianu noted that Blank was a second-wave inductee into the ''camarilla'', arriving in at the same time as Tabacovici and \"the pimp\" [[Alexandru Mavrodi]]; but also that, during the first year of Carol's reign, he became his most influential adviser, to the point of \"ruling over Romania\".<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 67, 71\u201372</ref> The same memoirist further contends that Blank and Carol shared a psychological pathology, namely \"hyperacute sexual excitement\" and \"[[erotomania]]\", which prevented them for going through with any project.<ref name=\"Argetoianu 1997, p. 69\"/> He notes that Blank's vice, which required him to spend large sums for the sexual favors of \"women who are into money and luxuries\", ended with him going destitute and \"half insane\".<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nA doctrinaire on economic matters, Blank served as a trustee of the Academy of Economic Studies (1929\u20131939), and also oversaw a committee for the administration of penal facilities (1930\u20131935).<ref name=\"csec1\"/> He continued to write newspaper articles, studies and memorials on Romania's postwar situation. His books include ''{{lang|ro|Contribu\u021biuni la rezolvarea crizei economice}}'' (\"Contributions to Solving the Economic Crisis\", 1922), ''La crise economique en Roumanie'' (\"The Romanian Economic Crisis\", 1922), ''Economice'' (\"Economic Writings\", 1932), ''Literare'' (\"Literary Writings\", 1932) and ''{{lang|ro|Problema monetar\u0103 \u00een raport cu creditul public \u0219i privat}}'' (\"The Monetary Issue as Relates to Public and Private Credit\").<ref name=\"cajal\"/> Argetoianu describes such contributions as \"childish inventions\" and \"theoretical jugglery\", noting that \"not even Tabacovici would read them\"\u2014but also that Carol was highly impressed, for being \"entirely ignorant on financial and economic matters.\"<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 69, 71</ref> The monarch also recognized Blank's achievements in the transportation, inducting him into ''Meritul Aeronautic'' order of chivalry.<ref name=\"cajal\"/>\n\nAs Argetoianu claims, the king eventually grew aware that Blank was not fully competent, but continued to seek his advice. Argetoianu argues that this was because Blank had since earned the confidence of Carol's lover [[Magda Lupescu]], buying her a villa and making it so that she would befriend Tabacovici and Wieder.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 71\u201372</ref> Reportedly, the only ''camarilla'' businessman who could still mitigate his influence at the court was [[Nicolae Malaxa]].<ref>Argetoianu (1997), p. 73</ref> Like Malaxa and [[Max Auschnitt]], Blank belonged to Me\u0219terul Manole Lodge, a branch of [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]] which was intimately involved in sponsoring cultural projects by fellow Masons.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 231 & (2011), p. 477</ref> In 1930, however, Blank gave up on his main investment in the cultural field, allowing Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103 to be acquired by the State Printers and ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]''.<ref>Waldman & Ciuciu, p. 120. See also Opri\u021bescu ''et al.'', p. 39</ref> An anonymous report of the period claims that this liquidation resulted in massive payoffs for all the stakeholders, including Crainic and [[Puiu Dumitrescu]].<ref name=\"mo&al39\">Opri\u021bescu ''et al.'', p. 39</ref> Two years later, Blank's CIDNA was taken over by the French state and became a component of the state carrier, [[Air France]].<ref name=\"Waldman & Ciuciu, p. 120\"/>\n\nArgetoianu and Blank were instrumental in helping Carol reach a settlement with his former wife, [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Queen Helen]].<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 123\u2013124</ref> In January 1931, Argetoianu also sent Blank to approach Titulescu in [[St. Moritz]], hoping to ensure his own political survival as part of a Titulescu cabinet.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 130, 133, 142, 173, 198, 201</ref> A rumor circulating at the time alleged that Titulescu owed 14 million lei to the BMB.<ref>Potra, p. 389</ref> The cabinet, which was never sworn in, was to include Blank as one of the ministers.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), p. 166</ref> In addition to endorsing Carol, Blank was going public as a critic of PN\u021a governments in matters of economic policy. According to [[Grigore Gafencu]], he was using ''Adev\u0103rul'' and the Carlist newspaper ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'' to criticize attempts at contracting a new loan in France.

Under his management, this business never produced an actual profit for the state, as most surpluses were drawn into covering BMB losses.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 274\u2013276</ref> Carol also intervened to get Discom a share from the Alcohol Monopoly, as well as control over [[Loteria Rom\u00e2n\u0103|Loteria de Stat]]; through the king's pressures, the [[General Council of Bucharest]] also spent 500 million lei on acquiring Blank's allotment in [[Otopeni]].<ref name=\"fmtunuri\"/>\n\nIn June 1931, Blank was dispatched to [[Berlin]], kicking off trade negotiations between Romania and [[Weimar Germany]].<ref>[http://pdfs.jta.org/1931/1931-06-15_135.pdf \"Famous Roumanian Jewish Banker Aristide Blanc Representing Roumanian Government in Berlin\"], in ''Daily News Bulletin Issued by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency'', June 15, 1931, p. 6</ref> By then, the BMB affair had presented an opportunity for Manoilescu, also a ''camarilla'' man, who became Governor of the National Bank that same year. Manoilescu claimed that Argetoianu's demands for a bailout were feudal in nature, and could only serve to demolish whatever remained functional of Romania's industry and agriculture.<ref name=\"csec1\"/><ref name=\"mo&al38,40\">Opri\u021bescu ''et al.'', pp. 38, 40</ref> According to Argetoianu, Manoilescu was \"determined to destroy Aristide\", unaware that the king had issued orders to protect Blank at all cost.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 300\u2013305, 311</ref> The point is underscored by Pandrea, who also notes that a resentful Nae Ionescu played a part in forcing Manoilescu to push for Blank's bankruptcy.<ref>Pandrea, p. 356</ref>\n\nIn that context, Premier Iorga took Carol's side, writing in ''[[Neamul Rom\u00e2nesc]]'' that the state had a moral duty to rescue Blank's business.<ref name=\"mo&al40\">Opri\u021bescu ''et al.'', p. 40</ref> As a BMB associate, [[Grigore Filipescu]] openly asked Manoilescu to refinance Blank's enterprise. Once his request was denied, he publicized Manoilescu's [[conflict of interest]] and pushed for an audit. Manoilescu sued him, alleging forgery, but failed to make his case in court.<ref>Popescu, p. 36</ref> This parallel scandal continued to 1937, when Filipescu was able to demonstrate in front of a jury that Manoilescu, despite being publicly antisemitic, had been bribed by Jewish finance.<ref>Crax., \"Dou\u0103 achit\u0103ri cu t\u00e2lc resun\u0103tor\", in ''Rom\u00e2nul.

As he reports, his fall was made possible by a businessmen's coalition, which included Manoilescu and \"even the right honorable Aristide Blank\";<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 297\u2013298</ref> the most vocal opposition came from smaller banks, which were threatened with liquidation.<ref name=\"mo&al40\"/> In 1932\u20131933, the National Bank refinanced the BMB, though the latter had to concede its shares in Discom; this operation failed to keep the enterprise afloat, and it was finally liquidated in 1936.<ref name=\"jmmillio\"/> According to Mourat, Blank \"does not seem to have been seriously compromised\" by BMB scandals, and continued to be credited by foreign investors, \"keen on learning about the 'immense potential' of his rich country.\"<ref name=\"jmmillio\"/> Blank also preserved his standing in literary circles. He entertained and dined cultural figures, including writers [[Scarlat Froda]] and [[Mihail Sebastian]]\u2014in his diaries, the latter refers to Blank as a \"poser\".<ref>Sebastian, pp. 12\u201313</ref> According to Sebastian, Blank and Froda had threesomes with actress [[Leny Caler]].<ref>Sebastian, p. 98</ref> Sebastian also claims to have had a sexual encounter with Blank's daughter Dorina, who \"offered herself\" to him.<ref>Sebastian, pp. 23, 27, 268</ref>\n\n===Return and marginalization===\nAs argued by Opri\u021bescu, the \"political dimension\" of the BMB crash showed that Blank was in a position to blackmail Romania's elite, but also that Carol \"grew tired of bankers\".<ref name=\"mo&al40\"/> If Blank slowly lost his influence at the court, it was also because he no longer had enough funds left for sponsoring Carol's enrichment schemes.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), p. 361</ref> He focused on philanthropic work, and, in 1933, opened up Caritas Hospital with a ceremony attended by Carol.<ref name=\"csec1\"/> Reportedly, he still had leverage in February 1935, when he obtained the sacking of [[Ministry of Public Finance (Romania)|Finance Minister]] [[Victor Sl\u0103vescu]].<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 10\u201312, 234, 303; Iulian Oncescu, Andrei Tudorache, \"Victor Sl\u0103vescu \u2014 ministru de finan\u021be (1934\u20131935)\", in ''Analele Universit\u0103\u021bii din Craiova.

In his diaries, Argetoianu referred to his contribution as \"intelligent, though occasionally veering into utopia.\"<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 10</ref> The two were again on friendly terms, since, as Argetoianu argued, \"it's better to have him on my side then against me.\"<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 11</ref> He heard Blank's \"interesting plan\" for developing [[tourism in Romania]].<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 22</ref> Blank also expressed an interest in funding [[Haig Acterian]]'s project to pioneer [[television in Romania]], then supported creating an Italo\u2013Romanian film company under [[Cines]], but ultimately withdrew from both.<ref>Cernat, pp. 45\u201347</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Grigore Traian Pop, in 1934 Blank and [[Victor Iamandi]] also worked to undermine Carol's protege Auschnitt, by depicting him as a sponsor of the Iron Guard; Pop sees the allegation as false.<ref>Pop, p. 43</ref> Argetoianu noted that Blank's political agenda involved keeping a low profile, but also that he was regaining his influence on Lupescu, even as Wieder was losing his.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 22, 42, 120, 197, 200, 269</ref> He reports that Carol's sister, [[Elisabeth of Romania|Elisabeth Charlotte]], detested Blank and Malaxa, asking her brother to remove them from his entourage; Carol allegedly replied that he had a set of obligations toward Blank.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 198</ref> Also according to Argetoianu, Blank's intrigues also resulted in [[Miti\u021b\u0103 Constantinescu]]'s appointment as Governor of the National Bank, who then proceeded to persecute investor Oskar Kaufmann, Elisabeth's alleged lover.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 130, 197\u2013198</ref> Constantinescu and Blank formed a clique which opposed Sl\u0103vescu's attempts to regain control of credit institutions, and obtained conditional support from Premier [[Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu]]. This conflict reflected splits inside the PNL, between T\u0103t\u0103rescu and [[Dinu Br\u0103tianu]]'s factions (the latter of which included Sl\u0103vescu).<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 205\u2013206, 233\u2013235, 238</ref> At the time, Argetoianu claimed to have discovered Blank's actual stake in such affairs\u2014namely, that he hoped Constantinescu would allow the BMB to survive by returning it control over Discom, which had remained profitable.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 234\u2013235, 269</ref>\n\nArgetoianu looked back on 1935 as the worst year in Romanian history, only similar to the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion over the [[Danubian Principalities]]: \"It would still appear as the better alternative to be trampled on by the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Padishah]] than by that Yid Aristid Blank or the alms-giver Malaxa.\"<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 200</ref> As reported to Argetoianu by Elisabeth's lover, Sandi Scanavi, Blank was deemed \"public enemy number 1\" by the conservative establishment, with Malaxa a close second.<ref>Argetoianu (2003), pp. 300\u2013301</ref> In early 1936, Argetoianu claims, Blank was the \"real master of this Romanian land\", but had also registered a defeat when Sl\u0103vescu returned to the National Bank leadership.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 238, 259</ref> When Kaufmann began a legal battle against journalist [[Alfred Hefter]], Argetoianu argued that the latter was being paid to calumny by Blank.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 301\u2013303, 327\u2013328, 337\u2013338</ref> As he noted: \"that the bankrupt Blank has enough money on him to get Hefter moving, that is after all his own business, and at most something that would interest the prosecutor's office. The plot thickens and the issue turns messy because Miti\u021b\u0103 Constantinescu also gets involved ''into this personal conflict'', and that the wheeler-dealer Aristid goes out of his way to also involve the King\" (emphasis in the original).<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 301</ref>\n\nOn the night of May 4\u20135, 1936, an Iron Guard youth narrowly missed a chance to assassinate Blank outside Hefter's editorial offices, and, out of frustration, physically assaulted Hefter himself; in the aftermath, Blank spread rumors that the attempt was a [[false flag]] operation by Kaufmann's own clique.<ref name=\"Argetoianu 1998, p. 303\"/> A month later, he and \u0218eicaru reacted against their rival Ionescu, who had been identified as an agent of influence for [[Nazi Germany]]. They presented Carol with a copy of the incriminating letter, which Carlist [[Ion S\u00e2n-Giorgiu]] allegedly took to Berlin \"and showed it to a number of ministers there.\"<ref>Sebastian, p. 56</ref> By August, Blank was reportedly attempting to gather support for a \"strongman government\" that would quell Guardist agitation, and proposed either Argetoianu or [[Alexandru Averescu]] for the premiership.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 432</ref> In January 1937, British plenipotentiary [[Reginald Hoare]] left comments on Blank's newfound enthusiasm for regaining control of the BMB, as well as on his limited competence.<ref name=\"csec2\"/> Also according to Argetoianu, Vota had left Aristide, and, in October 1936, was living with Radu Polizu in [[Monaco]]. An inveterate gambler, Polizu allegedly relied on her for money.<ref>Argetoianu (2003), p. 283</ref>\n\nBy 1939, the National Bank had taken over the BMB's patrimony.<ref>Waldman & Ciuciu, p. 125</ref> Blank also lost his father's home on Dionisie Street, which was bought by [[Eduard Mirto]], and then leased to the American Legation.<ref>Argetoianu (2003), p. 67; Waldman & Ciuciu, pp. 135</ref> Following [[1937 Romanian general election|national elections in December 1937]], Carol allowed the fascist [[National Christian Party]], a successor of the LANC, to form government; Blank's erstwhile friend, [[Octavian Goga]], took over as Premier. As reported by Sebastian, the passage of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic legislation]] was played down by Blank, who argued that the \"continuation of the Goga government\" was in then Jews' best interest, since \"what would come after it would be infinitely worse.\"<ref>Sebastian, p. 144</ref>\n\n===Outcast and hostage===\n''Adev\u0103rul'' was finally banned on Goga's orders.<ref name=\"ftzbucium\"/><ref>Ornea, pp. 392, 402</ref> After Carol engineered a self-coup and formed the [[National Renaissance Front]], Blank made attempts to regain his standing in political life. He followed Carol on his final trip to Britain in November 1938, and was registered with the royal retinue at [[Claridge's]] of London. This prompted Argetoianu to comment that Carol was still unable to renounce his \"gang of tricksters\", comprising Blank, Hefter, and [[Eugen Titeanu]].<ref>Argetoianu (2002), p. 204</ref> He reports meeting the \"all-too-serene\" Blank visiting the [[Wallace Collection]] alongside diplomat Dimitrie N. Ciotori: \"I never asked him why he was in London: I don't doubt for a moment that he's here to pick up scraps from the table that's being set for King Carol\".<ref>Argetoianu (2002), p. 207</ref>\n\nIn Romania, the outbreak of World War II saw the generalization of antisemitic laws, followed in 1940 the ascendancy of hardliner [[Ion Gigurtu]]. As reported by Sebastian, news of his ascendancy struck his \"millionaire friends\" Blank and [[A. L. Zissu]], who were \"terrified and cracking up\", but who still pestered him with \"abstract conversations.\"<ref>Sebastian, p. 293</ref> Such radicalization was followed in September by Carol's ouster, and afterward by the establishment of an Iron Guard-led \"[[National Legionary State]]\". This new regime blocked all of Blank's Romanian assets in October 1940, and instituted a special commission for re-litigating the BMB affair. This body resumed work after the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Iron Guard's ouster in early 1941]], and determined that Blank owed the Romanian state 600 million lei.<ref name=\"csec1\"/> Frequenting the left-wing journalist [[Tudor Teodorescu-Brani\u0219te]] in April 1941, Blank expressed confidence that Germany would lose in its [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|war with Yugoslavia]].<ref>Sebastian, pp. 342, 357\u2013358</ref> Both he and his host resigned themselves by June, when Blank also circulated rumors about Romania's imminent participation in the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Soviet territory]]. He still owned a paper mill, which was ordered to prepare for distribution in [[Bessarabia]].<ref>Sebastian, p. 369</ref> According to Sebastian, Blank argued in late 1941 that the war would only last for two more years, but was then \"disgusted at the British lack of seriousness [[Siege of Tobruk|in Libya]].\"<ref>Sebastian, pp. 369, 446, 456</ref>\n\nBlank had by then sent his son to study in the United States.

His father, [[Mauriciu Blank]], an [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] and naturalized [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jew]], was manager of the [[Marmorosch Blank Bank]] (BMB), a major financial enterprise. Aristide took up jobs within the same company, and, after seeing action in the [[Second Balkan War]] and [[Romania in World War I|World War I]], began expanding its investments, branching out into maritime transport and founding [[CFRNA|CIDNA/CFRNA]] airlines. This period witnessed his attempt at setting up a press empire around the twin dailies ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'' and ''[[Diminea\u021ba]]'', and his brief engagement with ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]''.\n\nInheriting his father's position at the BMB, Blank expanded its activities and expenditures, setting aside money for [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and allowing his staff to engage in [[accounting fraud]]. By 1923, he was also engaged in [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalist]] politics, sponsoring propaganda writings and working alongside historians [[Nicolae Iorga]] and [[Vasile P\u00e2rvan]]. He set up his own publishing house, [[Editura Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103|Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103]], and a literary agency, which was for a while managed by philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]]\u2014ultimately sacked by Blank upon the discovery of embezzlement. Blank, who allegedly alternated mainstream politics with support for the far-left, found himself pitted against the antisemitic far-right, being brutalized by the [[National Christian Defense League]] and marked for retribution by the [[Iron Guard]].\n\nBeginning in the early 1920s, Blank cultivated Crown Prince [[Carol II of Romania|Carol]], who took over as [[King of the Romanians]] after a 1930 coup. Emerging as Carol's economic adviser, Blank joined the resulting ''[[camarilla]]'', an affiliation which shielded him from the consequences of BMB mismanagement. The enterprise crashed in 1931, unable to absorb the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Blank was removed from his managerial position following intervention by the [[National Bank of Romania]], but used political channels to preserve some measure of control, and was instrumental in toppling National Bank Governor [[Mihail Manoilescu]], who did not wish to refinance the BMB. His influence fluctuated for the remainder of Carol's reign; still unable to fully control the BMB, he still owned Discom, a lucrative retailer for products of state monopolies.\n\nPublic antisemitism and fascism took the forefront during the late years of Carlism and the [[Romania in World War II|early years of World War II]]. This period saw Blank marginalized, and resulted in additional scrutiny of the BMB affair, at the end of which he was sentenced to pay 600 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] in damages. Blank reemerged as BMB manager after [[King Michael's Coup]] of 1944, but he and his business were finally repressed by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] from 1948. In 1953, he was sentenced to 20 years for high treason, but managed to have that verdict overturned in 1955. After international pressures, he was allowed to emigrate in 1958, and lived his final months in [[Paris]]. His children from his successive marriages and affairs include American soldier Milenko Blank and French press magnate Patrice-Aristide Blank.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn in [[Bucharest]] on the first day of 1883<ref name=\"csec1\">Claudiu Seca\u0219iu, \"Biografia lui Aristide Blank (I)\", in ''[[Realitatea Evreiasc\u0103]]'', Issues 520\u2013521 (1320\u20131321), July\u2013August 2018, p. 15</ref> ([[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]: January 13), Aristide was the son of [[Mauriciu Blank]].

Carol used Blank in his attempts to earn support from [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Alexandru Averescu]].

Iorga viewed it as a superior work of art, but noted that its selection of prints displayed \"banality\" and a \"lack of familiarity with all newer discoveries regarding Romania's past\". After reading his comments, Blank employed Iorga as his editorial adviser.<ref>\u021aurlea, p. 133</ref> The following year, he sponsored French editions from Iorga's own works: ''Histoire des Roumains et de leur civilisation'' and ''Anthologie de la litt\u00e9rature roumaine''.<ref>\u021aurlea, p. 134.

According to Argetoianu, they each took at least 13.5 million lei in yearly stipends, while also collecting dividends from companies credited by the BMB, and through which Blank defrauded associates such as [[Ion G.

Blank himself argued that withdrawals were made possible by rumors of a looming war between Romania and the [[Soviet Union]], but his explanation failed to convince the general public.<ref name=\"jmmillio\"/> According to Argetoianu, Blank also complained that the investors' walkout was facilitated by the [[National Bank of Romania]], whose Governor, [[Costin Stoicescu]], was a disgruntled BMB employee. He believes that this claim was credible, in that Stoicescu always opposed state intervention in favor of the BMB.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 272\u2013273</ref> \n\nShortly before the BMB's crash, Carol returned home abruptly, deposing his son and taking over as King. As a result, Blank made his way into the ''[[camarilla]]'', a secretive para-legal circle which decided on political and financial matters.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 67sqq; Opri\u021bescu ''et al.'', p. 38; Ornea, pp. 17, 265</ref> Also frequenting this circle, Argetoianu noted that Blank was a second-wave inductee into the ''camarilla'', arriving in at the same time as Tabacovici and \"the pimp\" [[Alexandru Mavrodi]]; but also that, during the first year of Carol's reign, he became his most influential adviser, to the point of \"ruling over Romania\".<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 67, 71\u201372</ref> The same memoirist further contends that Blank and Carol shared a psychological pathology, namely \"hyperacute sexual excitement\" and \"[[erotomania]]\", which prevented them for going through with any project.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), p. 69</ref> He notes that Blank's vice, which required him to spend large sums for the sexual favors of \"women who are into money and luxuries\", ended with him going destitute and \"half insane\".<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nA doctrinaire on economic matters, Blank served as a trustee of the Academy of Economic Studies (1929\u20131939), and also oversaw a committee for the administration of penal facilities (1930\u20131935).<ref name=\"csec1\"/> He continued to write newspaper articles, studies and memorials on Romania's postwar situation. His books include ''{{lang|ro|Contribu\u021biuni la rezolvarea crizei economice}}'' (\"Contributions to Solving the Economic Crisis\", 1922), ''La crise economique en Roumanie'' (\"The Romanian Economic Crisis\", 1922), ''Economice'' (\"Economic Writings\", 1932), ''Literare'' (\"Literary Writings\", 1932) and ''{{lang|ro|Problema monetar\u0103 \u00een raport cu creditul public \u0219i privat}}'' (\"The Monetary Issue as Relates to Public and Private Credit\").<ref name=\"cajal\"/> Argetoianu describes such contributions as \"childish inventions\" and \"theoretical jugglery\", noting that \"not even Tabacovici would read them\"\u2014but also that Carol was highly impressed, for being \"entirely ignorant on financial and economic matters.\"<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 69, 71</ref> The monarch also recognized Blank's achievements in the transportation, inducting him into ''Meritul Aeronautic'' order of chivalry.<ref name=\"cajal\"/> \n\nAs Argetoianu claims, the king eventually grew aware that Blank was not fully competent, but continued to seek his advice. Argetoianu argues that this was because Blank had since earned the confidence of Carol's lover [[Magda Lupescu]], buying her a villa and making it so that she would befriend Tabacovici and Wieder.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 71\u201372</ref> Reportedly, the only ''camarilla'' businessman who could still mitigate his influence at the court was [[Nicolae Malaxa]].<ref>Argetoianu (1997), p. 73</ref> Like Malaxa and [[Max Auschnitt]], Blank belonged to Me\u0219terul Manole Lodge, a branch of [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]] which was intimately involved in sponsoring cultural projects by fellow Masons.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 231 & (2011), p. 477</ref> In 1930, however, Blank gave up on his main investment in the cultural field, allowing Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103 to be acquired by the State Printers and ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]''.<ref>Waldman & Ciuciu, p. 120.

According to [[Grigore Gafencu]], he was using ''Adev\u0103rul'' and the Carlist newspaper ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'' to criticize attempts at contracting a new loan in France. Blank and his colleagues described these as a sure path to economic enslavement.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Daniel Apostol, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190911120743/https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/foto-statul-cheltuieste-banul-public-in-dezmat \"Marea Criz\u0103 din 1929\u20131933 \u00een presa rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 a vremii: Statul cheltuie\u0219te banul public \u00een dezm\u0103\u021b!\"], in ''Historia'', June 2010</ref> According to PN\u021a man [[Ioan Hudi\u021b\u0103]], Gafencu was in fact Blank's man inside both party and government.

Under his management, this business never produced an actual profit for the state, as most surpluses were drawn into covering BMB losses.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 274\u2013276</ref> Carol also intervened to get Discom a share from the Alcohol Monopoly, as well as control over [[Loteria Rom\u00e2n\u0103|Loteria de Stat]]; through the king's pressures, the [[General Council of Bucharest]] also spent 500 million lei on acquiring Blank's allotment in [[Otopeni]].<ref name=\"fmtunuri\"/>\n\nIn June 1931, Blank was dispatched to [[Berlin]], kicking off trade negotiations between Romania and [[Weimar Germany]].<ref>[http://pdfs.jta.org/1931/1931-06-15_135.pdf \"Famous Roumanian Jewish Banker Aristide Blanc Representing Roumanian Government in Berlin\"], in ''Daily News Bulletin Issued by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency'', June 15, 1931, p. 6</ref> By then, the BMB affair had presented an opportunity for Manoilescu, also a ''camarilla'' man, who became Governor of the National Bank that same year. Manoilescu claimed that Argetoianu's demands for a bailout were feudal in nature, and could only serve to demolish whatever remained functional of Romania's industry and agriculture.<ref name=\"csec1\"/><ref name=\"mo&al38,40\">Opri\u021bescu ''et al.'', pp. 38, 40</ref> According to Argetoianu, Manoilescu was \"determined to destroy Aristide\", unaware that the king had issued orders to protect Blank at all cost.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 300\u2013305, 311</ref> The point is underscored by Pandrea, who also notes that a resentful Nae Ionescu played a part in forcing Manoilescu to push for Blank's bankruptcy.<ref>Pandrea, p. 356</ref>\n\nIn that context, Premier Iorga took Carol's side, writing in ''[[Neamul Rom\u00e2nesc]]'' that the state had a moral duty to rescue Blank's business.<ref name=\"mo&al40\">Opri\u021bescu ''et al.'', p. 40</ref> As a BMB associate, [[Grigore Filipescu]] openly asked Manoilescu to refinance Blank's enterprise. Once his request was denied, he publicized Manoilescu's [[conflict of interest]] and pushed for an audit. Manoilescu sued him, alleging forgery, but failed to make his case in court.<ref>Popescu, p. 36</ref> This parallel scandal continued to 1937, when Filipescu was able to demonstrate in front of a jury that Manoilescu, despite being publicly antisemitic, had been bribed by Jewish finance.<ref>Crax., \"Dou\u0103 achit\u0103ri cu t\u00e2lc resun\u0103tor\", in ''Rom\u00e2nul.

He \"had poor Aristide grilled and spinning over burning coals\",<ref>Argetoianu (1997), p. 292</ref> finally obtaining Blank's resignation and replacement with S\u00f6pk\u00e9z. His shares in the company were then handed in as a loan collateral to the Romanian state.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 292\u2013293, 298, 313\u2013314, 316\u2013326</ref> As claimed by Argetoianu, Blank continued to defraud his own bank by cashing in a check for 43 million lei, which he then deposited for safekeeping with Blanche Ulman-Vesni\u0107, his mother-in-law.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 298</ref> He and Argetoianu, working together, collected a dossier showing Manoilescu's own history in illegal trading.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 326\u2013327</ref> Reassured by Carol's support, Blank was ultimately victorious and, as a result, Manoilescu lost his ''camarilla'' privileges in November 1931.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 328\u2013335; Ornea, p. 265</ref>\n\nArgetoianu himself was eventually replaced after proposing that the BMB merge with other credit enterprises into a single private entity supervised by the National Bank. As he reports, his fall was made possible by a businessmen's coalition, which included Manoilescu and \"even the right honorable Aristide Blank\";<ref>Argetoianu (1997), pp. 297\u2013298</ref> the most vocal opposition came from smaller banks, which were threatened with liquidation.<ref name=\"mo&al40\"/> In 1932\u20131933, the National Bank refinanced the BMB, though the latter had to concede its shares in Discom; this operation failed to keep the enterprise afloat, and it was finally liquidated in 1936.<ref name=\"jmmillio\"/> According to Mourat, Blank \"does not seem to have been seriously compromised\" by BMB scandals, and continued to be credited by foreign investors, \"keen on learning about the 'immense potential' of his rich country.\"<ref name=\"jmmillio\"/> Blank also preserved his standing in literary circles. He entertained and dined cultural figures, including writers [[Scarlat Froda]] and [[Mihail Sebastian]]\u2014in his diaries, the latter refers to Blank as a \"poser\".<ref>Sebastian, pp. 12\u201313</ref> According to Sebastian, Blank and Froda had threesomes with actress [[Leny Caler]].<ref>Sebastian, p. 98</ref> Sebastian also claims to have had a sexual encounter with Blank's daughter Dorina, who \"offered herself\" to him.<ref>Sebastian, pp. 23, 27, 268</ref>\n\n===Return and marginalization===\nAs argued by Opri\u021bescu, the \"political dimension\" of the BMB crash showed that Blank was in a position to blackmail Romania's elite, but also that Carol \"grew tired of bankers\".<ref name=\"mo&al40\"/> If Blank slowly lost his influence at the court, it was also because he no longer had enough funds left for sponsoring Carol's enrichment schemes.<ref>Argetoianu (1997), p. 361</ref> He focused on philanthropic work, and, in 1933, opened up Caritas Hospital with a ceremony attended by Carol.<ref name=\"csec1\"/> Reportedly, he still had leverage in February 1935, when he obtained the sacking of [[Ministry of Public Finance (Romania)|Finance Minister]] [[Victor Sl\u0103vescu]].<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 10\u201312, 234, 303; Iulian Oncescu, Andrei Tudorache, \"Victor Sl\u0103vescu \u2014 ministru de finan\u021be (1934\u20131935)\", in ''Analele Universit\u0103\u021bii din Craiova. Seria Istorie'', Vol. XVII, Issue 1, 2012, p. 114</ref> In preparation for this intervention, Blank had published an [[op ed]] in ''[[Universul]]'' of January 28, detailing his own solutions to economic problems. In his diaries, Argetoianu referred to his contribution as \"intelligent, though occasionally veering into utopia.\"<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 10</ref> The two were again on friendly terms, since, as Argetoianu argued, \"it's better to have him on my side then against me.\"<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 11</ref> He heard Blank's \"interesting plan\" for developing [[tourism in Romania]].<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 22</ref> Blank also expressed an interest in funding [[Haig Acterian]]'s project to pioneer [[television in Romania]], then supported creating an Italo\u2013Romanian film company under [[Cines]], but ultimately withdrew from both.<ref>Cernat, pp. 45\u201347</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Grigore Traian Pop, in 1934 Blank and [[Victor Iamandi]] also worked to undermine Carol's protege Auschnitt, by depicting him as a sponsor of the Iron Guard; Pop sees the allegation as false.<ref>Pop, p. 43</ref> Argetoianu noted that Blank's political agenda involved keeping a low profile, but also that he was regaining his influence on Lupescu, even as Wieder was losing his.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 22, 42, 120, 197, 200, 269</ref> He reports that Carol's sister, [[Elisabeth of Romania|Elisabeth Charlotte]], detested Blank and Malaxa, asking her brother to remove them from his entourage; Carol allegedly replied that he had a set of obligations toward Blank.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 198</ref> Also according to Argetoianu, Blank's intrigues also resulted in [[Miti\u021b\u0103 Constantinescu]]'s appointment as Governor of the National Bank, who then proceeded to persecute investor Oskar Kaufmann, Elisabeth's alleged lover.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 130, 197\u2013198</ref> Constantinescu and Blank formed a clique which opposed Sl\u0103vescu's attempts to regain control of credit institutions, and obtained conditional support from Premier [[Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu]]. This conflict reflected splits inside the PNL, between T\u0103t\u0103rescu and [[Dinu Br\u0103tianu]]'s factions (the latter of which included Sl\u0103vescu).<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 205\u2013206, 233\u2013235, 238</ref> At the time, Argetoianu claimed to have discovered Blank's actual stake in such affairs\u2014namely, that he hoped Constantinescu would allow the BMB to survive by returning it control over Discom, which had remained profitable.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 234\u2013235, 269</ref>\n\nArgetoianu looked back on 1935 as the worst year in Romanian history, only similar to the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion over the [[Danubian Principalities]]: \"It would still appear as the better alternative to be trampled on by the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Padishah]] than by that Yid Aristid Blank or the alms-giver Malaxa.\"<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 200</ref> As reported to Argetoianu by Elisabeth's lover, Sandi Scanavi, Blank was deemed \"public enemy number 1\" by the conservative establishment, with Malaxa a close second.<ref>Argetoianu (2003), pp. 300\u2013301</ref> In early 1936, Argetoianu claims, Blank was the \"real master of this Romanian land\", but had also registered a defeat when Sl\u0103vescu returned to the National Bank leadership.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 238, 259</ref> When Kaufmann began a legal battle against journalist [[Alfred Hefter]], Argetoianu argued that the latter was being paid to calumny by Blank.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), pp. 301\u2013303, 327\u2013328, 337\u2013338</ref> As he noted: \"that the bankrupt Blank has enough money on him to get Hefter moving, that is after all his own business, and at most something that would interest the prosecutor's office. The plot thickens and the issue turns messy because Miti\u021b\u0103 Constantinescu also gets involved ''into this personal conflict'', and that the wheeler-dealer Aristid goes out of his way to also involve the King\" (emphasis in the original).<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 301</ref> \n\nOn the night of May 4\u20135, 1936, an Iron Guard youth narrowly missed a chance to assassinate Blank outside Hefter's editorial offices, and, out of frustration, physically assaulted Hefter himself; in the aftermath, Blank spread rumors that the attempt was a [[false flag]] operation by Kaufmann's own clique.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 303</ref> A month later, he and \u0218eicaru reacted against their rival Ionescu, who had been identified as an agent of influence for [[Nazi Germany]]. They presented Carol with a copy of the incriminating letter, which Carlist [[Ion S\u00e2n-Giorgiu]] allegedly took to Berlin \"and showed it to a number of ministers there.\"<ref>Sebastian, p. 56</ref> By August, Blank was reportedly attempting to gather support for a \"strongman government\" that would quell Guardist agitation, and proposed either Argetoianu or [[Alexandru Averescu]] for the premiership.<ref>Argetoianu (1998), p. 432</ref> In January 1937, British plenipotentiary [[Reginald Hoare]] left comments on Blank's newfound enthusiasm for regaining control of the BMB, as well as on his limited competence.<ref name=\"csec2\"/> Also according to Argetoianu, Vota had left Aristide, and, in October 1936, was living with Radu Polizu in [[Monaco]]. An inveterate gambler, Polizu allegedly relied on her for money.<ref>Argetoianu (2003), p. 283</ref>\n\nBy 1939, the National Bank had taken over the BMB's patrimony.<ref>Waldman & Ciuciu, p. 125</ref> Blank also lost his father's home on Dionisie Street, which was bought by [[Eduard Mirto]], and then leased to the American Legation.<ref>Argetoianu (2003), p. 67; Waldman & Ciuciu, pp. 135</ref> Following [[1937 Romanian general election|national elections in December 1937]], Carol allowed the fascist [[National Christian Party]], a successor of the LANC, to form government; Blank's erstwhile friend, [[Octavian Goga]], took over as Premier. As reported by Sebastian, the passage of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic legislation]] was played down by Blank, who argued that the \"continuation of the Goga government\" was in then Jews' best interest, since \"what would come after it would be infinitely worse.\"<ref>Sebastian, p. 144</ref>\n\n===Outcast and hostage===\n''Adev\u0103rul'' was finally banned on Goga's orders.<ref name=\"ftzbucium\"/><ref>Ornea, pp. 392, 402</ref> After Carol engineered a self-coup and formed the [[National Renaissance Front]], Blank made attempts to regain his standing in political life. He followed Carol on his final trip to Britain in November 1938, and was registered with the royal retinue at [[Claridge's]] of London. This prompted Argetoianu to comment that Carol was still unable to renounce his \"gang of tricksters\", comprising Blank, Hefter, and [[Eugen Titeanu]].<ref>Argetoianu (2002), p. 204</ref> He reports meeting the \"all-too-serene\" Blank visiting the [[Wallace Collection]] alongside diplomat Dimitrie N. Ciotori: \"I never asked him why he was in London: I don't doubt for a moment that he's here to pick up scraps from the table that's being set for King Carol\".<ref>Argetoianu (2002), p. 207</ref>\n\nIn Romania, the outbreak of World War II saw the generalization of antisemitic laws, followed in 1940 the ascendancy of hardliner [[Ion Gigurtu]]. As reported by Sebastian, news of his ascendancy struck his \"millionaire friends\" Blank and [[A. L. Zissu]], who were \"terrified and cracking up\", but who still pestered him with \"abstract conversations.\"<ref>Sebastian, p. 293</ref> Such radicalization was followed in September by Carol's ouster, and afterward by the establishment of an Iron Guard-led \"[[National Legionary State]]\". This new regime blocked all of Blank's Romanian assets in October 1940, and instituted a special commission for re-litigating the BMB affair. This body resumed work after the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Iron Guard's ouster in early 1941]], and determined that Blank owed the Romanian state 600 million lei.<ref name=\"csec1\"/> Frequenting the left-wing journalist [[Tudor Teodorescu-Brani\u0219te]] in April 1941, Blank expressed confidence that Germany would lose in its [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|war with Yugoslavia]].<ref>Sebastian, pp. 342, 357\u2013358</ref> Both he and his host resigned themselves by June, when Blank also circulated rumors about Romania's imminent participation in the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Soviet territory]]. He still owned a paper mill, which was ordered to prepare for distribution in [[Bessarabia]].<ref>Sebastian, p. 369</ref> According to Sebastian, Blank argued in late 1941 that the war would only last for two more years, but was then \"disgusted at the British lack of seriousness [[Siege of Tobruk|in Libya]].\"<ref>Sebastian, pp. 369, 446, 456</ref> \n\nBlank had by then sent his son to study in the United States.

In October 1945, she allowed him to access BMB funds, with Blank promising that he was going to fully repay his creditors.<ref name=\"csec2\"/> However, Blank also protected his family from the communist threat, sending Vota to live with Milenko in the United States; he visited them there in 1946, but opted to return to Romania in January 1947.<ref name=\"csec2\"/> One of his final activities at Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103 was putting out the first edition of [[Pavel Chihaia]]'s novel, ''Blocada'', which was immediately removed from bookshops by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20190917185759/https://arhiva.romlit.ro/index.pl/destinul_unui_rezistent_pavel_chihaia \"Destinul unui rezistent: Pavel Chihaia\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Issue 41/2001</ref> The publishing house was shut down that same year.<ref name=\"csec1\"/> \n\nBlank himself was eventually singled out for retribution after having maintained contacts with British and American diplomats.<ref name=\"csec2\" /> He witnessed the proclamation of a [[Communist Romania|communist republic]] in 1948, by which time he had lost touch with his Western backers.<ref name=\"csec2\"/> That year, the BMB was [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalized]] (though it continued to exist as a separate entity, under state management, to 1951); the company's former offices, a granite building on Doamnei Street, were taken by Romania's new secret police, the [[Securitate]].<ref>Waldman & Ciuciu, pp. 120, 135</ref> Blank himself was arrested as a spy on April 18, 1952, and put on trial for high treason with his meeting with foreigners and some of his papers used as evidence, then sentenced to a 20-year imprisonment in May 1953.<ref name=\"csec2\"/> At the time, his rival Manoilescu had also been identified as an enemy of the communist regime, and was sent to the labor colony of [[Ocnele Mari]]. Here, he met Pandrea, who recalls: \"I made him recount the Blank bankruptcy, as a way of entertaining xenophobic inmates\".<ref>Pandrea, p. 144</ref>\n\nMemoirist [[Ion Ioanid]], who was held with Blank in [[Jilava prison]] for a while in 1954, recalls that the financier was well groomed, and still wearing a two-piece suit. According to Ioanid, Blank missed his son Milenko, whom he believed he would never see again, but resented him for choosing a career in the army: \"I feel like a hen that's been hatching a duck's egg!\"<ref name=\"ioanid\"/> Children from his other marriages had stayed behind in Romania. Reportedly, one of his daughters, Tina St\u0103nescu, had married a mayor of [[Buz\u0103u]], and was still living at [[Sinaia]] in the late 1940s, shunning all relations with less assimilated Jews.<ref>Emil Simiu, \"Anii de ucenicie\", in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Vol. XXII, Issue 11, 2011, p. 18</ref> Novelist [[Matei C\u0103linescu]] remembers that one of Blank's former wives was living at a part-nationalized villa in [[Floreasca]] in 1954, alongside her daughter, Helen Blank-Bogdan, and two granddaughters, Mab and Manola.

His visits brought him attention by Securitate operatives, and he was placed under surveillance.<ref name=\"csec2\"/> Throughout the late 1950s, Blank made several requests for an emigration visa to France, supported in this by the French government and [[Zionism|Zionist]] groups responding to Vota's appeals; in 1956, a delegation of the [[National Assembly (French Fourth Republic)|French National Assembly]] visited him in Bucharest.<ref name=\"csec2\"/> Blank was also assisted by his other son Patrice,<ref>Vartic, p. 8</ref> who returned to publishing after making and losing a fortune in the trade of [[precious metal]]s.<ref>Drancourt, p. 74</ref> All of his father's applications for emigration were denied by the Romanian side until March 1958,<ref name=\"csec2\"/> when he was finally allowed to leave for Paris.

Like his friend [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]], he spoke out against the French economic mainstream, advocating [[right-libertarianism]]; this agenda was promoted by his own magazine, ''Liaisons Sociales'', as well as by ''[[Commentaire]]'' journal and [[Saint-Simon Foundation]], both of which he financed.<ref>Drancourt, ''passim''</ref> His parallel advocacy for the [[United States of Europe]] brought him into conflict with [[Charles de Gaulle]], but also ensured support from [[Joseph Rovan]].<ref>Drancourt, pp. 73\u201374</ref> As noted by lawyer Jacques Sinard, Patrice was also a promoter of [[common-law marriage]] from a [[Europeanism|Europeanist]] and liberal perspective.<ref>\"D\u00e9clarations des candidats\", in ''Le Bulletin du Barreau de Paris'', November 2003, p. 23</ref> \n\nPatrice Blank was still active in publishing into the 1990s, as owner of the Liaisons group; he sold it to [[Wolters Kluwer]] in 1996.<ref name=\"pabmonde\"/><ref>Drancourt, p. 76</ref> He died in Paris, aged 73, on October 14, 1998,<ref name=\"pabmonde\"/> having just inaugurated a new libertarian magazine, ''Soci\u00e9tal''.<ref>Drancourt, p. 76</ref> He enjoys a posthumous fame as a central figure in conspiracy theories about the death of [[Robert Boulin]] in October 1979. According to these, Boulin was killed by his colleagues in the [[Rally for the Republic]], because he had compromising information regarding party finances; Blank Jr is depicted as having absconded with Boulin's personal files just after his death was announced.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20190926135832/https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/le-zoom-de-la-redaction/le-zoom-de-la-redaction-19-avril-2007 ''Dans les coulisses d'une affaire d'Etat: l'affaire Boulin''], [[France Inter]], April 19, 2007; Beno\u00eet Collombat, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190926140241/https://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/622297/affaire-boulin--suicide-ou-assassinat-l-ombre-de-jacques-chirac-dans-les-deux-cas--benoit-collombat ''Guerre des droites.
