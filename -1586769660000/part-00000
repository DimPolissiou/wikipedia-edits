The Ducks traded [[Dave Karpa]] and a 2000 4th round pick to the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] for Kevin Haller and Stu Grimson on June 18. Two months later they acquired Jim Mckenzie for [[Jean-Francois Jomphe]] on August 11. They signed veteran Fredrik Olausson, who was with the Ducks before, to give the team scoring from the blue line, and Pascal Trepanier. Rookies Antti Aalto and Johan Davidsson made the roster while Mike Crowley who played very well last season would see more ice time with the parent team.\n\nFor the first time since the Ducks traded [[Ron Tugnutt]] to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in 1994 the team saw just their second change in net, losing [[Mikhail Shtalenkov]] to the Nashville Predators in the [[1998 NHL Expansion Draft]]. That left them with Prospects [[Patrick Lalime]] and [[Chris Mason (ice hockey)|Chris Mason]] for the back up position. \nJust before the season started the Ducks acquired Dominic Roussel from the Nashville Predators for Chris Mason and [[Marc Moro]] on October 5, 1998 which gave the team more experience in case Hebert would be sidelined like last season. Days later they sent [[Doug Houda]] to Detroit on October 9.\n\n==Regular season==\n\nThe season was much more consistent than last season. Anaheim started off slow, losing their first three games and scoring only one goal but was unbeaten the next six games. On October 27, 1998 they added Marty McInnes, a key player who gave them more scoring depth for the team's upcoming success and dominating Powerplay. On November 8 Tomas Sandstrom suffered a broken left wrist which kept him sidelined until late December thus relying more on their star players and hoping for others to fill the void. The team managed to comeback a few times after going winless some games and even put up winning streaks like in early December (4-0-2) and early February (4-0-0). January turned out to be the very tough going 4-9-1 and winless (0-5-1) a second time since late November. Overall the Ducks were hovering around the .500 mark fighting to go to the post season.\n\nIn February the team pushed themselves into the Play Off as the Mighty Ducks went 13-3-1 from February 3 until March 10 including a team record seven game winning streak. The Ducks finished the season 6 in the west as the team was unable to maintain their amazing run.\nThe Blues only lost 1 game in their last nine games where as the Ducks only won one game out of their last seven, ironically against the Coyotes, missing out on 5th place facing Phoenix rather than the Red Wings.\n\nDuring that winning-streak the team only allowed 1 goal in each of those games, highlighting the great goaltending of Guy Hebert, who had career year and his best season since 1996/97. Dominic Roussel also enjoyed a stellar comeback in the NHL as the team's backup. Both goalies provided excellent goaltending for the Ducks, each posting a save percentage above .920 as well as a superb GAA. Those great numbers were supported by their Defense as the team allowed 55 goals less than last year. Offensively the Ducks only scored 10 goals more than last season but relied heavily on their first line ( Kariya - Rucchin - Selanne ) combining for 109 goals. Additional scoring was only provided by Marty McInnes (17 goals), Fredrik Olausson (16 goals) and Tomas Sandstrom (15 goals), who missed 24 games due to injury. Matt Cullen enjoyed a good second season, tallying 11 goals which was almost double than last year while Travis Green only scored 13 goals and 30 points which was below expectation.\n\nThe Mighty Ducks finished the regular season with the most power-play goals, 83, and the best power-play percentage, 21.96% (83 for 378) in the NHL.<ref>https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1999.html</ref>\n\n===Final standings===\n{{1998\u201399 NHL Pacific Division standings|team=ANA}}\n{{1998\u201399 NHL Western Conference

The Ducks traded [[Dave Karpa]] and a 2000 4th round pick to the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] for Kevin Haller and Stu Grimson on June 18. Two months later they acquired Jim Mckenzie for [[Jean-Francois Jomphe]] on August 11. They signed veteran Fredrik Olausson, who was with the Ducks before, to give the team scoring from the blue line, and Pascal Trepanier. Rookies Antti Aalto and Johan Davidsson made the roster while Mike Crowley who played very well last season would see more ice time with the parent team.\n\nFor the first time since the Ducks traded [[Ron Tugnutt]] to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in 1994 the team saw just their second change in net, losing [[Mikhail Shtalenkov]] to the Nashville Predators in the [[1998 NHL Expansion Draft]]. That left them with Prospects [[Patrick Lalime]] and [[Chris Mason (ice hockey)|Chris Mason]] for the back up position. \nJust before the season started the Ducks acquired Dominic Roussel from the Nashville Predators for Chris Mason and [[Marc Moro]] on October 5, 1998 which gave the team more experience in case Hebert would be sidelined like last season. Days later they sent [[Doug Houda]] to Detroit on October 9.\n\n==Regular season==\n\nThe season was much more consistent than last season. Anaheim started off slow, losing their first three games and scoring only one goal but was unbeaten the next six games. On October 27, 1998 they added Marty McInnes, a key player who gave them more scoring depth for the teams upcoming success and dominating Powerplay. On November 8 Tomas Sandstrom suffered a broken left wrist which kept him sidelined until late December thus relying more on their star players and hoping for others to fill the void. The team managed to comeback a few times after going winless some games and even put up winning streaks like in early December (4-0-2) and early February (4-0-0). January turned out to be the very tough going 4-9-1 and winless (0-5-1) a second time since late November. Overall the Ducks were hovering around the .500 mark fighting to go to the post season.\n\nIn February the team pushed themselves into the Play Off as the Mighty Ducks went 13-3-1 from February 3 until March 10 including a team record seven game winning streak. The Ducks finished the season 6 in the west as the team was unable to maintain their amazing run.\nThe Blues only lost 1 game in their last nine games where as the Ducks only won one game out of their last seven, ironically against the Coyotes, missing out on 5th place facing Phoenix rather than the Red Wings.\n\nDuring that winning-streak the team only allowed 1 goal in each of those games, highlighting the great goaltending of Guy Hebert, who had career year and his best season since 1996/97. Dominic Roussel also enjoyed a stellar comeback in the NHL as the teams backup. Both goalies provided excellent goaltending for the Ducks, each posting a save percentage above .920 as well as a superb GAA. Those great numbers were supported by their Defense as the team allowed 55 goals less than last year. Offensively the Ducks only scored 10 goals more than last season but relied heavily on their first line ( Kariya - Rucchin - Selanne ) combining for 109 goals. Additional scoring was only provided by Marty McInnes (17 goals), Fredrik Olausson (16 goals) and Tomas Sandstrom (15 goals), who missed 24 games due to injury. Matt Cullen enjoyed a good second season, tallying 11 goals which was almost double than last year while Travis Green only scored 13 goals and 30 points which was below expectation. \n\nThe Mighty Ducks finished the regular season with the most power-play goals, 83, and the best power-play percentage, 21.96% (83 for 378) in the NHL.<ref>https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1999.html</ref>\n\n===Final standings===\n{{1998\u201399 NHL Pacific Division standings|team=ANA}}\n{{1998\u201399 NHL Western Conference

His job is to salvage valuables from the clothing of the dead, drag bodies from the [[gas chambers]] and scrub the chambers before the next group arrives to be gassed. He works stoically, seemingly having been numbed by the daily horrors. Among the dead after a gassing is a boy who is still barely alive, and Saul witnesses a Nazi physician suffocate the boy and call for an autopsy. Saul steps forth and insists on carrying the body himself to the prison doctor, Mikl\u00f3s, a fellow Hungarian prisoner and a forced assistant to Josef Mengele. He asks Mikl\u00f3s to not cut up the boy, so he can give him a proper Jewish burial. Mikl\u00f3s declines, but says he can have five minutes alone with the boy tonight, before the cremation. Saul goes in search of a Rabbi to perform the funeral ritual. He goes to Rabbi Frankel in the crematorium, who dismisses Saul's concern and suggests that Saul perform the burial himself.\n\nSaul overhears ''Sonderkommando'' Abraham, talk about an uprising against the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-guards with ''[[Oberkapo]]'' Biedermann ([[Urs Rechn]]). Biedermann first wants to photograph the camp's atrocities using a camera collected from the clothing of an earlier gassed caravan, and smuggle the pictures outside to attract attention and help. Saul asks for another rabbi and Abraham tells him of \"the Renegade,\" a Greek Rabbi who has lost his faith. Saul in return offers his assistance in their plan and is instructed to go with a prisoner (Katz) to repair a shack; he is given a piece of jewellery for use as a bribe in case he's caught. When Saul and Katz arrive at the shack, Saul pretends to fix the front door's lock, while Katz takes out a camera from inside the shack and starts to take pictures of the cremation. Saul hears the guards and hides the camera outside in a drain. The guards search the shack, only to find nothing.\n\nSaul then sneaks onto a truck for another ''Sonderkommando'' unit, heading to a nearby riverbank, where the ashes from the crematoria are dumped into the river. Saul finds the Renegade, who refuses to help him. Saul then threatens to alert the ''Oberkapo'' of the unit, Mietek, that the Renegade is a rabbi by reciting the ''[[Kaddish]]''. When the Renegade refuses yet again Saul throws the man's shovel into the water.  The rabbi jumps into the river to retrieve the shovel or drown himself. Saul, who can't swim, manages to bring the Renegade back to the riverbank and both are then taken to the SS-commandant of the unit. After an interrogation, the Renegade is executed and Saul is allowed to go back to the unit.\n\nSaul is then confronted by Mietek, who realizes that he is from another unit. To mollify Mietek, Saul gives him the piece of jewellery. Back at the camp, following roll call, Saul sneaks into Mikl\u00f3s's office where he is caught by a group of Nazi officers. One of them pushes Saul around like a puppet and makes a mockery of [[Jewish dances]], finally forcing him out of the room. After searching in vain for the boy's body, Saul confronts Mikl\u00f3s, who assures him that he has hidden it from the other doctors for safety. Saul sneaks into the autopsy room and takes the body back to his own barrack in a sack.\n\nThat night Saul is summoned to clean the dinner tables by SS-commandant Moll. Biedermann walks in and is ordered to write up a list of seventy names. This leads Biedermann to believe that his unit will soon be gassed. Biedermann discloses the information to Abraham, who instructs Saul to head to the women's camp, where he will pick up a smuggled package of gunpowder from a prisoner named Ella. When Saul finds himself face to face with Ella, he clearly knows her. She calls him by name, clasps his hand, but he withdraws. After collecting the package, Saul deliberately falls into a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into the woods for execution. Saul again looks for a rabbi among the arrivals. A Frenchman named Braun approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun as a member of the ''Sonderkommando'' and sneaks him into the camp. When Saul arrives at the camp he is confronted by Abraham and realizes that during the turmoil in the woods he has lost the package. On further questioning, he says that the dead boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true.\n\nThe next morning during roll call, Mikl\u00f3s finds Saul and tells him that he needs a replacement body, similar to the one Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the ''[[Kaddish]]''. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the [[Home Army|Polish resistance]]. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with a smile. The boy runs away, and makes it a short distance before an SS officer grabs and silences him as guards run past in the direction of the shed. When they have all passed, the officer releases him, and the camera follows the boy into the woods, as the sound of gunfire echoes behind him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[G\u00e9za

His job is to salvage valuables from the clothing of the dead, drag bodies from the [[gas chambers]] and scrub the chambers before the next group arrives to be gassed. He works stoically, seemingly having been numbed by the daily horrors. Among the dead after a gassing is a boy who is still barely alive, and Saul witnesses a Nazi physician suffocate the boy and call for an autopsy. Saul steps forth and insists on carrying the body himself to the prison doctor, Mikl\u00f3s, a fellow Hungarian prisoner and a forced assistant to Josef Mengele. He asks Mikl\u00f3s to not cut up the boy, so he can give him a proper Jewish burial. Mikl\u00f3s declines, but says he can have five minutes alone with the boy tonight, before the cremation. Saul goes in search of a Rabbi to perform the funeral ritual. He goes to Rabbi Frankel in the crematorium, who dismisses Saul's concern and suggests that Saul perform the burial himself.\n\nSaul overhears ''Sonderkommando'' Abraham, talk about an uprising against the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-guards with ''[[Oberkapo]]'' Biedermann ([[Urs Rechn]]). Biedermann first wants to photograph the camp's atrocities using a camera collected from the clothing of an earlier gassed caravan, and smuggle the pictures outside to attract attention and help. Saul asks for another rabbi and Abraham tells him of \"the Renegade,\" a Greek Rabbi who has lost his faith. Saul in return offers his assistance in their plan and is instructed to go with a prisoner (Katz) to repair a shack; he is given a piece of jewellery for use as a bribe in case he's caught. When Saul and Katz arrive at the shack, Saul pretends to fix the front door's lock, while Katz takes out a camera from inside the shack and starts to take pictures of the cremation. Saul hears the guards and hides the camera outside in a drain. The guards search the shack, only to find nothing.\n\nSaul then sneaks onto a truck for another ''Sonderkommando'' unit, heading to a nearby riverbank, where the ashes from the crematoria are dumped into the river. Saul finds the Renegade, who refuses to help him. Saul then threatens to alert the ''Oberkapo'' of the unit, Mietek, that the Renegade is a rabbi by reciting the ''[[Kaddish]]''. When the Renegade refuses yet again Saul throws the man's shovel into the water.  The rabbi jumps into the river to retrieve the shovel or drown himself. Saul, who can't swim, manages to bring the Renegade back to the riverbank and both are then taken to the SS-commandant of the unit. After an interrogation, the Renegade is executed and Saul is allowed to go back to the unit.\n\nSaul is then confronted by Mietek, who realizes that he is from another unit. To mollify Mietek, Saul gives him the piece of jewellery. Back at the camp, following roll call, Saul sneaks into Mikl\u00f3s's office where he is caught by a group of Nazi officers. One of them pushes Saul around like a puppet and makes a mockery of [[Jewish dances]], finally forcing him out of the room. After searching in vain for the boy's body, Saul confronts Mikl\u00f3s, who assures him that he has hidden it from the other doctors for safety. Saul sneaks into the autopsy room and takes the body back to his own barrack in a sack.\n\nThat night Saul is summoned to clean the dinner tables by SS-commandant Moll. Biedermann walks in and is ordered to write up a list of seventy names. This leads Biedermann to believe that his unit will soon be gassed. Biedermann discloses the information to Abraham, who instructs Saul to head to the women's camp, where he will pick up a smuggled package of gunpowder from a prisoner named Ella. When Saul finds himself face to face with Ella, he clearly knows her. She calls him by name, clasps his hand, but he withdraws. After collecting the package, Saul deliberately falls into a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into the woods for execution. Saul again looks for a rabbi among the arrivals. A Frenchman named Braun approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun as a member of the ''Sonderkommando'' and sneaks him into the camp. When Saul arrives at the camp he is confronted by Abraham and realizes that during the turmoil in the woods he has lost the package. On further questioning, he says that the dead boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true.\n\nThe next morning during roll call, Mikl\u00f3s finds Saul and tells him that he needs a replacement body, similar to the one Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the ''[[Kaddish]]''. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the [[Home Army|Polish resistance]]. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with a smile. The boy runs away, and makes it a short distance before an SS officer grabs and silences him as guards run past in the direction of the shed. When they have all passed, the officer releases him, and the camera follows the boy into the woods, as the sound of gunfire echoes behind him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[G\u00e9za

Many of the cultural highlights of Egypt are also featured in the film, such as the [[Great Pyramids]], the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]], and temples at [[Abu Simbel]] and [[Karnak]], even though the locations are not in sequence. The boat trip starts in [[Aswan]], follows to Karnak and then to Abu Simbel which is upstream from Aswan.  Furthermore, it was never possible to go by boat from Aswan to Abu Simbel, even before the [[Aswan Low Dam|Aswan Dam]] was built because of the cataracts near Aswan.\n\n''Death on the Nile'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] at the [[51st Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nJacqueline \"Jackie\" de Bellefort asks her close friend, wealthy heiress Linnet Ridgeway, to hire her fianc\u00e9, Simon Doyle since he is broke. Jackie is initially pleased when Linnet agrees, but Linnet and Simon soon start a whirlwind affair and end up marrying. While honeymooning in Egypt, they are continually hounded by the jilted Jackie. In an attempt to get away, the Doyles pretend to go to the Cairo railway station before backtracking to board their booked cruise on a Nile paddle steamer, the S.S. ''Karnak''.\n\nWhen the passengers venture on-shore to examine the nearby temple of Karnak, a large stone is pushed off a pillar and narrowly misses the Doyles. They are shocked when Jackie finds them and joins the cruise, having ignored the warnings of detective Hercule Poirot to stay away and having revealed that she carries a small automatic pistol in her handbag. That night, Jackie confronts Simon in a drunken rage and shoots him in the leg. The next morning, Linnet is found dead from a gunshot wound to the head. A \"J\" written in blood on the wall above her bed appears to implicate Jackie, but she has a solid alibi as Miss Bowers sedated her with morphia and stayed with her all night.\n\nPoirot and his friend, Colonel Race, investigate. They discover that numerous passengers had reasons to kill Linnet: Louise Bourget, Linnet's maid, was bitter due to her mistress' refusal to grant her a promised dowry; Andrew Pennington, Linnet's American trustee, was anxious to prevent her from discovering that he embezzled from her; Mrs. van Schuyler, an elderly American socialite suffering from kleptomania, displayed a great interest in Linnet's pearl necklace; van Schuyler's nurse, Miss Bowers, blamed Linnet's father for forcing her own father into financial ruin; Salome Otterbourne, a romance novelist, was being sued for libel due to a likeness between Linnet and one of her characters; Mrs. Otterbourne's daughter, Rosalie, was anxious to protect her mother from financial ruin; Jim Ferguson, an outspoken Communist, resented Linnet's affluent lifestyle; and Dr. Ludwig Bessner, a Swiss psychiatrist, faced exposure by Linnet concerning his unorthodox methods involving one of Linnet's past friends.\n\nSoon a bundle is found in the Nile. The missing pistol is wrapped in Mrs. van Schuyler's stole, which has a small bullet hole in it. A handkerchief was also included, stained with blood, and a marble ashtray to make sure it would sink to the bottom of the Nile. They later discover that Linnet's pearls are missing, and Mrs. van Schuyler denies ever having touched them. Soon after, the pearls are found on Linnet's body, so Poirot deduces Mrs van Schuyler has \"returned\" them.\n\nWhile Poirot and Race conduct their investigation, Louise Bourget is murdered. Her throat has been cut with one of Dr. Bessner's scalpels and a fragment of a [[banknote]] is found in her hand. Poirot deduces she saw the murderer coming out of Linnet's cabin and attempted to extort money for her silence. Salome Otterbourne claims to have seen Louise's murderer and is about to tell Poirot and Race when she is shot in the head through an open cabin door with Pennington's revolver, too large to have been used on Linnet.\n\nPoirot gathers everyone in the saloon and reveals that Simon is responsible for Linnet's murder, with Jackie working as his accomplice. She pretended to shoot Simon, drawing attention to herself. After running to Linnet's cabin and shooting her in the head, Simon shot himself in the leg, using Mrs. van Schuyler's stole as a silencer and replaced one of the empty cartridges with a new one should the gun ever be found. He then wrapped the gun in the stole along with a marble ashtray and the supposed blood stained handkerchief and threw them out the open window; hoping they would sink into the Nile. Jackie later killed Louise, who was blackmailing Simon because she witnessed him enter Linnet's cabin, then killed Mrs. Otterbourne, who saw Jackie exiting Louise's cabin. The plan was that Simon would marry then kill Linnet, inherit her money, and at a later date, marry his old love.\n\nWhen Simon points out that Poirot has no proof, Poirot reveals that the police will simply do a gunshot residue test known as a moulage test on both him and Jacqueline. Realizing they are caught, Jacqueline confesses before embracing Simon. Poirot suddenly realizes she has taken back her pistol, but is unable to prevent her from shooting Simon in the head before killing herself.\n\nThe passengers depart when the boat next docks, while Poirot is thoroughly congratulated for his work.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Hercule Poirot]]\n* [[Jane Birkin]] as Louise Bourget\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Linnet Ridgeway Doyle\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Marie Van Schuyler\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Jacqueline de Bellefort\n* [[Jon Finch]] as James Ferguson\n* [[Olivia Hussey]] as Rosalie Otterbourne\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Andrew Pennington\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Salome Otterbourne\n* [[Simon MacCorkindale]] as Simon Doyle\n* [[David Niven]] as Colonel Race\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Miss Bowers\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Dr. Bessner\n* [[I.

The movie was made during a period of expansion for [[EMI Films]] under Michael Deeley and Barry Spikings, who were increasingly aiming at the international market with films like ''The Deer Hunter'' and ''Convoy''. ''Death on the Nile'' was a more traditionally British film.<ref>{{cite news|title=British money is suddenly big in Hollywood,'right up with Fox and Warne r.'|author=Mills, Bart|work=The Guardian|location=London (UK)|date=2 Sep 1977|page=8}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAlbert Finney played [[Hercule Poirot]] in ''Orient Express'' but was unable to reprise his role in the follow up.

Four weeks filming were on the steamer ''Karnak'' (the historic ship SS ''Memnon'' \u2192 see the ship [[PS Sudan]] in service since 1921) and the rest at places such as [[Aswan]], [[Abu Simbel]], [[Luxor]], and [[Cairo]]. Desert filming required makeup call at 4 a.m. and shooting at 6 a.m. to accommodate a two-hour delay around noon when temperatures hovered near 54&nbsp;\u00b0C (130&nbsp;\u00b0F). Bette Davis wryly commented, \"In the older days, they'd have built the Nile for you. Nowadays, films have become travelogues and actors, stuntmen.\"<ref name=Bedside>''The New Bedside, Bathtub, & Armchair Companion to Agatha Christie'', Riley, Dick and Pam McAllister, ed.

They were subsequently shifted from hotel to hotel, sometimes on a daily basis. Director Guillermin was never allowed to see the [[dailies|rushes]]. By order of the producers, footage was sent directly to them in London. A lighter moment occurred during a love scene between Chiles and MacCorkindale, when a hostile desert fly landed on Chiles's teeth. The actors carried on as best they could, but the crew burst out laughing when Guillermin thankfully called \"cut\" and ordered another take.<ref name=Bedside/>\n\nGuillermin found the shoot logistically tricky because of the heat and the boat, which sometimes ran aground. But he enjoyed the cast:\n{{bquote|The more experienced people created a very generous atmosphere. They were not impatient at all. I have never worked with Bette Davis before and was told she was professional but not communicative. Well, she was an absolute bastion of support and enthusiasm. During the breaks, the cast would often sit to one side engaged in terrific conversation. There was Ustinov's great wit and Niven's dry humour. Jack Warden is a very funny man and Mia Farrow is a very funny woman. This was a bunch of people who could relax.<ref name=\"john\"/>}}\n\n\"Poirot can be a cold fish, but here we made him more humanistic and warm, interested in young people for instance\", said the director. \"Peter Ustinov was able to bring that out.\"<ref name=\"john\"/>\nCostume designer [[Anthony Powell (designer)|Anthony Powell]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]], his second. Among his touches were shoes for Chiles that featured diamond studded heels that came from a millionaire's collection and shoes worn by Davis made from the scales of twenty-six [[Pythonidae|python]]s.<ref name=Bedside/>\n\nCinematographer Jack Cardiff says he and Guillermin decided to give the film \"an old fashioned 30s look\".<ref name=\"john\"/>\n\nThe choreography for the tango scene was provided by British dancer [[Wayne Sleep]].\n\nIn early 1978 David Niven's daughter was seriously injured in a car accident. Niven would fly from London to Switzerland on weekends during filming to sit by her bedside.<ref>MOVIES: DAVID NIVEN LIKES LIVING IN LUXURY\nMann, Roderick.

Many of the cultural highlights of Egypt are also featured in the film, such as the [[Great Pyramids]], the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]], and temples at [[Abu Simbel]] and [[Karnak]], even though the locations are not in sequence. The boat trip starts in [[Aswan]], follows to Karnak and then to Abu Simbel which is upstream from Aswan.  Furthermore, it was never possible to go by boat from Aswan to Abu Simbel, even before the [[Aswan Low Dam|Aswan Dam]] was built because of the cataracts near Aswan.\n\n''Death on the Nile'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] at the [[51st Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nJacqueline \"Jackie\" de Bellefort asks her close friend, wealthy heiress Linnet Ridgeway, to hire her fianc\u00e9, Simon Doyle since he is broke. Jackie is initially pleased when Linnet agrees, but Linnet and Simon soon start a whirlwind affair and end up marrying. While honeymooning in Egypt, they are continually hounded by the jilted Jackie. In an attempt to get away, the Doyles pretend to go to the Cairo Railway Station before backtracking to board their booked cruise on a Nile paddle steamer, the S.S. ''Karnak''.\n\nWhen the passengers venture on-shore to examine a nearby temple, a large stone is pushed off a pillar and narrowly misses the Doyles. They are shocked when Jackie finds them and joins the cruise, having ignored the warnings of detective Hercule Poirot to stay away and having revealed that she carries a small automatic pistol in her handbag. That night, Jackie confronts Simon in a drunken rage and shoots him in the leg. The next morning, Linnet is found dead from a gunshot wound to the head. A \"J\" written in blood on the wall above her bed appears to implicate Jackie, but she has a solid alibi as Miss Bowers sedated her with morphia and stayed with her all night.\n\nPoirot and his friend, Colonel Race, investigate. They discover that numerous passengers had reasons to kill Linnet: Louise Bourget, Linnet's maid, was bitter due to her mistress' refusal to grant her a promised dowry; Andrew Pennington, Linnet's American trustee, was anxious to prevent her from discovering that he embezzled from her; Mrs. van Schuyler, an elderly American socialite suffering from kleptomania, displayed a great interest in Linnet's pearl necklace; van Schuyler's nurse, Miss Bowers, blamed Linnet's father for forcing her own father into financial ruin; Salome Otterbourne, a romance novelist, was being sued for libel due to a likeness between Linnet and one of her characters; Mrs. Otterbourne's daughter, Rosalie, was anxious to protect her mother from financial ruin; Jim Ferguson, an outspoken Communist, resented Linnet's affluent lifestyle; and Dr. Ludwig Bessner, a Swiss psychiatrist, faced exposure by Linnet concerning his unorthodox methods involving one of Linnet's past friends.\n\nSoon a bundle is found in the Nile. The missing pistol is wrapped in Mrs. van Schuyler's stole, which has a small bullet hole in it. A handkerchief was also included, stained with blood, and a marble ashtray to make sure it would sink to the bottom of the Nile. They later discover that Linnet's pearls are missing, and Mrs. van Schuyler denies ever having touched them. Soon after, the pearls are found on Linnet's body, so Poirot deduces Mrs van Schuyler has \"returned\" them.\n\nWhile Poirot and Race conduct their investigation, Louise Bourget is murdered. Her throat has been cut with one of Dr. Bessner's scalpels and a fragment of a [[banknote]] is found in her hand. Poirot deduces she saw the murderer coming out of Linnet's cabin and attempted to extort money for her silence. Salome Otterbourne claims to have seen Louise's murderer and is about to tell Poirot and Race when she is shot in the head through an open cabin door with Pennington's revolver, too large to have been used on Linnet.\n\nPoirot gathers everyone in the saloon and reveals that Simon is responsible for Linnet's murder, with Jackie working as his accomplice. She pretended to shoot Simon, drawing attention to herself. After running to Linnet's cabin and shooting her in the head, Simon shot himself in the leg, using Mrs. van Schuyler's stole as a silencer and replaced one of the empty cartridges with a new one should the gun ever be found. He then wrapped the gun in the stole along with a marble ashtray and the supposed blood stained handkerchief and threw them out the open window; hoping they would sink into the Nile. Jackie later killed Louise, who was blackmailing Simon because she witnessed him enter Linnet's cabin, then killed Mrs. Otterbourne, who saw Jackie exiting Louise's cabin. The plan was that Simon would marry then kill Linnet, inherit her money, and at a later date, marry his old love.\n\nWhen Simon points out that Poirot has no proof, Poirot reveals that the police will simply do a gunshot residue test known as a moulage test on both him and Jacqueline. Realizing they are caught, Jacqueline confesses before embracing Simon. Poirot suddenly realizes she has taken back her pistol, but is unable to prevent her from shooting Simon in the head before killing herself.\n\nThe passengers depart when the boat next docks, while Poirot is thoroughly congratulated for his work.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Hercule Poirot]]\n* [[Jane Birkin]] as Louise Bourget\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Linnet Ridgeway Doyle\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Marie Van Schuyler\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Jacqueline de Bellefort\n* [[Jon Finch]] as James Ferguson\n* [[Olivia Hussey]] as Rosalie Otterbourne\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Andrew Pennington\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Salome Otterbourne\n* [[Simon MacCorkindale]] as Simon Doyle\n* [[David Niven]] as Colonel Race\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Miss Bowers\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Dr. Bessner\n* [[I.

The movie was made during a period of expansion for [[EMI Films]] under Michael Deeley and Barry Spikings, who were increasingly aiming at the international market with films like ''The Deer Hunter'' and ''Convoy''. ''Death on the Nile'' was a more traditionally British film.<ref>{{cite news|title=British money is suddenly big in Hollywood,'right up with Fox and Warne r.'|author=Mills, Bart|work=The Guardian|location=London (UK)|date=2 Sep 1977|page=8}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAlbert Finney played [[Hercule Poirot]] in ''Orient Express'' but was unable to reprise his role in the follow up.

Four weeks filming were on the steamer ''Karnak'' (the historic ship SS ''Memnon'' \u2192 see the ship [[PS Sudan]] in service since 1921) and the rest at places such as [[Aswan]], [[Abu Simbel]], [[Luxor]], and [[Cairo]]. Desert filming required makeup call at 4 a.m. and shooting at 6 a.m. to accommodate a two-hour delay around noon when temperatures hovered near 54&nbsp;\u00b0C (130&nbsp;\u00b0F). Bette Davis wryly commented, \"In the older days, they'd have built the Nile for you. Nowadays, films have become travelogues and actors, stuntmen.\"<ref name=Bedside>''The New Bedside, Bathtub, & Armchair Companion to Agatha Christie'', Riley, Dick and Pam McAllister, ed.

They were subsequently shifted from hotel to hotel, sometimes on a daily basis. Director Guillermin was never allowed to see the [[dailies|rushes]]. By order of the producers, footage was sent directly to them in London. A lighter moment occurred during a love scene between Chiles and MacCorkindale, when a hostile desert fly landed on Chiles's teeth. The actors carried on as best they could, but the crew burst out laughing when Guillermin thankfully called \"cut\" and ordered another take.<ref name=Bedside/>\n\nGuillermin found the shoot logistically tricky because of the heat and the boat, which sometimes ran aground. But he enjoyed the cast:\n{{bquote|The more experienced people created a very generous atmosphere. They were not impatient at all. I have never worked with Bette Davis before and was told she was professional but not communicative. Well, she was an absolute bastion of support and enthusiasm. During the breaks, the cast would often sit to one side engaged in terrific conversation. There was Ustinov's great wit and Niven's dry humour. Jack Warden is a very funny man and Mia Farrow is a very funny woman. This was a bunch of people who could relax.<ref name=\"john\"/>}}\n\n\"Poirot can be a cold fish, but here we made him more humanistic and warm, interested in young people for instance\", said the director. \"Peter Ustinov was able to bring that out.\"<ref name=\"john\"/>\nCostume designer [[Anthony Powell (designer)|Anthony Powell]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]], his second.

Such bounds are widely used for [[root-finding algorithm]]s for polynomials, either for tuning them, or for computing their [[computational complexity]]\n\nSome other properties are probabilistic, such as the expected number of real roots of a random polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}} with real coefficients, which is less than  <math> 1+\\frac 2\\pi \\ln (n) </math> for {{mvar|n}} sufficiently large.\n\nIn this article, a polynomial that is considered is always denoted \n:<math>\n  p(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n,\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0, \\dots, a_n</math> are real or complex numbers and <math>a_n \\neq 0</math>; thus {{mvar|n}} is the degree of the polynomial.\n\n==Continuous dependence on coefficients==\nThe {{math|''n''}} roots of a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} depend [[continuous function|continuously]] on the coefficients. For simple roots, this results immediately from the [[implicit function theorem]]. This is true also for multiple roots, but some care is needed for the proof.\n\nA small change of coefficients may induce a dramatic change of the roots, including the change of a real root into a complex root with a rather large imaginary part (see [[Wilkinson's polynomial]]). A consequence is that, for classical numeric [[root-finding algorithm]]s, the problem of approximating the roots given the coefficients is [[ill-conditioned]].\n\n==Conjugation==\n\nThe [[complex conjugate root theorem]] states that if the coefficients\nof a polynomial are real, then the non-real roots appear in pairs of the form  {{math|(''a'' + ''ib'', ''a'' \u2013 ''ib'')}}.\n\nIt follows that the roots of a polynomial with real coefficients are [[reflection symmetry|mirror-symmetric]] with respect to the real axis.\n\nThis can be extended to [[algebraic conjugate|algebraic conjugation]]: the roots of a polynomial with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients are ''conjugate'' (that is, invariant) under the action of the [[Galois group]] of the polynomial. However, this symmetry can rarely be interpreted geometrically.\n\n==Bounds on all roots==\nUpper bounds on the absolute values of polynomial roots are widely used for [[root-finding algorithm]]s, either for limiting the regions where roots should be searched, or for the computation of the [[computational complexity]] of these algorithms. \n\nMany such bounds have been given, and the sharper one depends generally of the specific sequence of coefficient that are considered. Most bounds are greater or equal to one, and are thus not sharp for a polynomial which have only roots of absolute values lower than one. However, such polynomials are very rare, as shown below.\n\nAny upper bound on the absolute values of roots provides a corresponding lower bound. In fact, if <math>a_n\\ne 0,</math> and {{mvar|U}} is an upper bound of the absolute values of the roots of \n:<math>\na_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n,\n</math>\nthen {{math|1/''U''}} is a lower bound of the absolute values of \n:<math>\na_n + a_{n-1} x + \\cdots + a_0 x^n,\n</math>\nsince the roots of either polynomial are the multiplicative inverses of the roots of the other. ''Therefore, in the remainder of the article lower bounds will not be given explicitly''.\n\n===Lagrange's and Cauchy's bounds===\n[[Lagrange]] and [[Cauchy]] were the firsts to provide upper bounds on all complex roots.<ref name=Hirst1997>{{cite journal |first=Holly P. |last=Hirst |first2=Wade T. |last2=Macey |title=Bounding the Roots of Polynomials |journal=[[The College Mathematics Journal]] |volume=28 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=292\u2013295 |jstor=2687152 }}</ref> Lagrange's bound is<ref>Lagrange J\u2013L (1798) Trait\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations num\u00e9riques.

This is relatively rare in practice, and explains why Cauchy's bound is more widely used than Lagrange's.\n\nBoth bounds result from the [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] applied to the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial and its [[transpose]]. They can also be proved by elementary methods.\n\n{{cot|Proof of Lagrange's and Cauchy's bounds}}\nIf {{mvar|z}} is a root of the polynomial, and {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}} \u2265 1}} one has \n:<math>|a_n||z^n| = \\left|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_iz^i\\right|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_iz^i|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_i||z|^{n-1}.\n</math>\n\nDividing by <math>|a_n||z|^{n-1},</math> one gets \n:<math>|z|\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\frac{|a_i|}{|a_n|},</math>\nwhich is Lagrange's bound when there is at least one root of absolute value larger than 1. Otherwise, 1 is a bound on the roots, and is not larger than Lagrange's bound.\n\nSimilarly, for Cauchy's bound, one has, if {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}} \u2265 1}},\n:<math>|a_n||z^n| = \\left|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_iz^i\\right|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_iz^i|\n\\le \\max |a_i|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|z|^i\n= \\frac{|z|^n-1}{|z|-1}\\max |a_i|\n\\le  \\frac{|z|^n}{|z|-1}\\max |a_i|.\n</math>\nThus \n:<math>\n|a_n|(|z|-1) \\le \\max |a_i|.\n</math>\nSolving in {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}}, one gets Cauchy's bound if there is a root of absolute value larger than 1. Otherwise the bound is also correct, as Cauchy's bound is larger than 1.\n{{cob}}\n\nThese bounds are not invariant by scaling. That is, the roots of the polynomial {{math|''p''(''sx'')}} are the quotient by {{mvar|s}} of the root of {{mvar|p}}, and the bounds given for the roots of {{math|''p''(''sx'')}} are not the quotient by {{mvar|s}} of the bounds of {{mvar|p}}.

As this number is {{mvar|k}}, the result is proved.\n{{cob}}\n\nThe above result may be applied if the polynomial\n:<math>h_k(x)=|a_0| +\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| x^{k-1}-|a_k|x^k+|a_{k+1}| x^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| x^n.</math>\ntakes a negative value for some positive real value of {{mvar|x}}.\n\nIn the remaining of the section, with suppose that {{math|''a''<sub>''0''</sub> \u2260 0}}. If it is not the case, zero is a root, and the localization of the other roots may be studied by dividing the polynomial by a power of the indeterminate, for getting a polynomial with a nonzero constant term.\n\nFor {{math|1=''k'' = 0}} and {{math|1=''k'' = ''n''}}, [[Descartes' rule of signs]] shows that the polynomial has exactly one positive real root. If <math>R_0</math> and <math>R_n</math> are these root, the above result shows that all the roots verifies \n:<math>R_0\\le |z| \\le R_1.</math>\nA these inequalities apply also to <math>h_0</math> and <math>h_n,</math> these bounds are optimal for polynomials with a given sequence of the absolute values of their coefficients. They are thus sharper than all bounds given in the preceding sections.\n\nFor {{math|0 < ''k'' < ''n''}}, Descartes' rule of signs implies that <math>h_k(x)</math> either has two positive real roots that are not multiple, or is nonnegative for every positive value of {{mvar|x}}. So, the above result may be applied only in the first case. If <math>R_{k,1}<R_{k,2}</math> are these two roots, the above result implies that\n:<math>|z| \\le R_{k,1}</math> \nfor {{mvar|k}} roots of {{mvar|p}}, and that \n:<math>|z| \\ge R_{k,2}</math> \nfor the {{math|''n'' \u2013 ''k''}} other roots.\n\nInstead of computing explicitly <math>R_{k,1}</math> and <math>R_{k,2},</math> it is generally sufficient to compute a value <math>R_k</math> such that <math>h_k(R_k)<0</math> (necessarily <math>R_{k,1}<R_k<R_{k,2}</math>). These  <math>R_k</math> have the property of separating roots in terms of their absolute values: if, for {{math|''h'' < ''k''}}, both <math>R_h</math> and <math>R_k</math> exist, there are exactly {{math|''k'' \u2013 ''h''}} roots {{mvar|z}} such that <math>R_h < |z| < R_k.</math>\n\nFor computing <math>R_k,</math> one can use that <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> is a [[convex function]] (its second derivative is positive). Thus <math>R_k</math> exists if and only if <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> is negative at its unique minimum. For computing this minimum, one can use any [[optimization]] method, or, alternatively, [[Newton's method]] for computing the unique positive zero of the derivative of <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> (it converges rapidly, as the derivative is a [[monotonic function]]).\n\nOne can increase the number of existing <math>R_k</math>'s by applying the root squaring operation of the [[Graeffe's method|Dandelin\u2013Graeffe iteration]]. If the roots have distinct absolute values, one can eventually separate completely the roots in terms of their absolute values, that is compute {{math|''n'' + 1}} positive numbers <math>R_0 < R_1 <\\dots <R_n</math> such there is exactly one root with an absolute value in the open interval <math>(R_{k-1},R_k),</math> for {{math|1=''k'' = 1, ..., ''n''}}.\n\n===From Gershgorin circle theorem ===\nThe [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] applied the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial on a basis related to [[Lagrange interpolation]] provides discs centered at the interpolation points and each containing a root of the polynomial; see {{slink|Durand\u2013Kerner method|Root inclusion via Gerschgorin's circles}} for details.\n\nIf the interpolation points are close to the roots of the roots of the polynomial, the radiuses of the discs are small, and this is a key ingredient of Durand\u2013Kerner method for computing polynomial roots.\n\n==Bounds of real roots==\n\nFor polynomials with real coefficients, it is often useful to bound only the real roots. It suffices to bound the positive roots, as the negative roots of {{math|''p''(''x'')}} are the positive roots of {{math|''p''(\u2013''x'')}}.\n\nClearly, every bound of all roots applies also for real roots. But in some contexts, tighter bounds of real roots are useful. For example, the efficiency of the [[Real-root isolation#Method of continued fractions|method of continued fractions]] for [[real-root isolation]] strongly depends on tightness of a bound of positive roots. This has led to establish new bounds that are tighter than the general bounds of all roots. These bounds are generally expressed not only in terms of the absolute values of the coefficients, but also in terms of their signs.\n\nOther bounds apply only to polynomials whose all roots are reals (see below).\n\n===Bounds of positive real roots===\n\nFor giving a bound of the positive roots, one can suppose <math>a_n >0</math> without loss of generality, as changing the signs of all coefficients does not change the roots.\n\nEvery upper bound of the positive roots of \n:<math>q(x)=a_nx^n + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\min(0,a_i)x^i</math>\nis also a bound  for the real zeros of \n:<math>p(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i</math>. \nIn fact, if {{mvar|B}} is such a bound, for all {{math|''x'' > ''B''}}, one has\n{{math|''p''(''x'') \u2265 ''q''(''x'') > 0}}.\n\nApplied to Cauchy's bound, this gives the upper bound \n:<math>1+{\\textstyle\\max_{i=0}^{n-1}} \\frac{-a_i}{a_n}</math>\nfor the real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients. If this bound is not greater than {{val|1}}, this means that all nonzero coefficients have the same sign, and that there is no positive root.\n\nSimilarly, another upper bound of the positive roots is \n:<math>2\\,{\\max_{a_ia_n<0}}\\left(\\frac{-a_i}{a_n}\\right)^{\\frac 1{n-i}}.</math>\nIf all nonzero coefficients have the same sign, there is no positive root, and the maximum must be defined as being zero.\n\nOther bounds have been recently developed, mainly for the need of the [[Real-root isolation#Method of continued fractions|method of continued fractions]] for [[real-root isolation]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Akritas |first=Alkiviadis G. |first2=A.

In fact, the root separation determines the precision of number representation that is needed for being sure of distinguishing different roots. Also, for [[real-root isolation]], it allows bounding the number of interval divisions that are needed for isolating all roots.\n\nFor polynomials with real or complex coefficients is not possible to express a lower bound of the root separation in terms of the degree and the absolute values of the coefficients only, because a small change on a single coefficient transforms a polynomial with multiple roots in a [[square-free polynomial]] with a small root separation, and essentially the same absolute values of the coefficient. However, involving the [[discriminant]] of the polynomial allows a lower bound.\n\nFor square-free polynomials with integer coefficients, the discriminant is an integer, and has thus an absolute value  that is not lower than {{val|1}}. This allows lower bounds for root separation that are independent from the discriminant.\n\nMignotte's separation bound is<ref>{{harvnb|Yap|2000|loc=\u00a7 VI.7, Proposition 29}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=George E.|last=Collins|authorlink=George E.

They form a set of {{mvar|n}} points in the [[complex plane]]. This article concerns the '''geometry''' of these points, that is the information about their localization in the complex plane that can be deduced from the degree and the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nSome of these geometrical properties are related to a single polynomial, such as upper bounds on the absolute values of the roots, which define a disk containing all roots, or lower bounds on the distance between two roots. Such bounds are widely used for [[root-finding algorithm]]s for polynomials, either for tuning them, or for computing their [[computational complexity]]\n\nSome other properties are probabilistic, such as the expected number of real roots of a random polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}} with real coefficients, which is less than  <math> 1+\\frac 2\\pi \\ln (n) </math> for {{mvar|n}} sufficiently large.\n\nIn this article, a polynomial that is considered is always denoted \n:<math>\n  p(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n,\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0, \\dots, a_n</math> are real or complex numbers and <math>a_n \\neq 0</math>; thus {{mvar|n}} is the degree of the polynomial.\n\n==Continuous dependence on coefficients==\nThe {{math|''n''}} roots of a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} depend [[continuous function|continuously]] on the coefficients. For simple roots, this results immediately from the [[implicit function theorem]]. This is true also for multiple roots, but some care is needed for the proof.\n\nA small change of coefficients may induce a dramatic change of the roots, including the change of a real root into a complex root with a rather large imaginary part (see [[Wilkinson's polynomial]]). A consequence is that, for classical numeric [[root-finding algorithm]]s, the problem of approximating the roots given the coefficients is [[ill-conditioned]].\n\n==Conjugation==\n\nThe [[complex conjugate root theorem]] states that if the coefficients\nof a polynomial are real, then the non-real roots appear in pairs of the form  {{math|(''a'' + ''ib'', ''a'' \u2013 ''ib'')}}.\n\nIt follows that the roots of a polynomial with real coefficients are [[reflection symmetry|mirror-symmetric]] with respect to the real axis.\n\nThis can be extended to [[algebraic conjugate|algebraic conjugation]]: the roots of a polynomial with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients are ''conjugate'' (that is, invariant) under the action of the [[Galois group]] of the polynomial. However, this symmetry can rarely be interpreted geometrically.\n\n==Bounds on all roots==\nUpper bounds on the absolute values of polynomial roots are widely used for [[root-finding algorithm]]s, either for limiting the regions where roots should be searched, or for the computation of the [[computational complexity]] of these algorithms. \n\nMany such bounds have been given, and the sharper one depends generally of the specific sequence of coefficient that are considered. Most bounds are greater or equal to one, and are thus not sharp for a polynomial which have only roots of absolute values lower than one. However, such polynomials are very rare, as shown below.\n\nAny upper bound on the absolute values of roots provides a corresponding lower bound. In fact, if <math>a_n\\ne 0,</math> and {{mvar|U}} is an upper bound of the absolute values of the roots of \n:<math>\na_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n,\n</math>\nthen {{math|1/''U''}} is a lower bound of the absolute values of \n:<math>\na_n + a_{n-1} x + \\cdots + a_0 x^n,\n</math>\nsince the roots of either polynomial are the multiplicative inverses of the roots of the other. ''Therefore, in the remainder of the article lower bounds will not be given explicitly''.\n\n===Lagrange's and Cauchy's bounds===\n[[Lagrange]] and [[Cauchy]] were the firsts to provide upper bounds on all complex roots.<ref name=Hirst1997>{{cite journal |first=Holly P. |last=Hirst |first2=Wade T. |last2=Macey |title=Bounding the Roots of Polynomials |journal=[[The College Mathematics Journal]] |volume=28 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=292\u2013295 |jstor=2687152 }}</ref> Lagrange's bound is<ref>Lagrange J\u2013L (1798) Trait\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations num\u00e9riques.

This is relatively rare in practice, and explains why Cauchy's bound is more widely used than Lagrange's.\n\nBoth bounds result from the [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] applied to the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial and its [[transpose]]. They can also be proved by elementary methods.\n\n{{cot|Proof of Lagrange's and Cauchy's bounds}}\nIf {{mvar|z}} is a root of the polynomial, and {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}} \u2265 1}} one has \n:<math>|a_n||z^n| = \\left|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_iz^i\\right|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_iz^i|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_i||z|^{n-1}.\n</math>\n\nDividing by <math>|a_n||z|^{n-1},</math> one gets \n:<math>|z|\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\frac{|a_i|}{|a_n|},</math>\nwhich is Lagrange's bound when there is at least one root of absolute value larger than 1. Otherwise, 1 is a bound on the roots, and is not larger than Lagrange's bound.\n\nSimilarly, for Cauchy's bound, one has, if {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}} \u2265 1}},\n:<math>|a_n||z^n| = \\left|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_iz^i\\right|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_iz^i|\n\\le \\max |a_i|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|z|^i\n= \\frac{|z|^n-1}{|z|-1}\\max |a_i|\n\\le  \\frac{|z|^n}{|z|-1}\\max |a_i|.\n</math>\nThus \n:<math>\n|a_n|(|z|-1) \\le \\max |a_i|.\n</math>\nSolving in {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}}, one gets Cauchy's bound if there is a root of absolute value larger than 1. Otherwise the bound is also correct, as Cauchy's bound is larger than 1.\n{{cob}}\n\nThese bounds are not invariant by scaling. That is, the roots of the polynomial {{math|''p''(''sx'')}} are the quotient by {{mvar|s}} of the root of {{mvar|p}}, and the bounds given for the roots of {{math|''p''(''sx'')}} are not the quotient by {{mvar|s}} of the bounds of {{mvar|p}}.

This inequality, discovered in 1905 by [[Edmund Landau]]<ref>E. Landeau, Sur quelques th&or&mes de M. Petrovic relatifs aux z\u00e9ros des fonctions analytiques, ''Bull. Sot. Math. France'' 33 (1905), 251-261.</ref> has been forgotten and rediscovered at least three times during the 20th century.<ref>M. Mignotte. An inequality about factors of polynomials, ''Math.

This bound is even exactly equal to one of the bounds that are obtained [[#Using H\u00f6lder's inequality|using H\u00f6lder's inequality]].\n\nThis bound is also useful to bound the coefficients of a divisor of a polynomial with integer coefficients:<ref>Mignotte, M.

More precisely, if there is a positive real number {{mvar|''R''}} and an integer {{math|0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n''}} such that\n:<math>|a_k| R^k > |a_0|+\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| R^{k-1}+|a_{k+1}| R^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| R^n,</math>\nthen there are exactly {{math|''k''}} roots, counted with multiplicity, of absolute value less than {{math|''R''}}. \n{{cot|Proof}}\nIf <math>|z|=R,</math> then\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n|a_0 &+\\cdots+a_{k-1}z^{k-1}+a_{k+1} z^{k+1}+\\cdots+a_n z^n|\\\\\n&\\le |a_0|+\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| R^{k-1}+|a_{k+1}| R^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| R^n\\\\\n&\\le |a_k| R^k \\le |a_k z^k|.\n\\end{align}</math>\nBy Rouch\u00e9's theorem, this implies directly that <math>p(z)</math> and <math>z^k</math> have the same number of roots of absolute values less than {{mvar|R}}, counted with multiplicities. As this number is {{mvar|k}}, the result is proved.\n{{cob}}\n\nThe above result may be applied if the polynomial\n:<math>h_k(x)=|a_0| +\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| x^{k-1}-|a_k|x^k+|a_{k+1}| x^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| x^n.</math>\ntakes a negative value for some positive real value of {{mvar|x}}.\n\nIn the remaining of the section, with suppose that {{math|''a''<sub>''0''</sub> \u2260 0}}. If it is not the case, zero is a root, and the localization of the other roots may be studied by dividing the polynomial by a power of the indeterminate, for getting a polynomial with a nonzero constant term.\n\nFor {{math|1=''k'' = 0}} and {{math|1=''k'' = ''n''}}, [[Descartes' rule of signs]] shows that the polynomial has exactly one positive real root. If <math>R_0</math> and <math>R_n</math> are these root, the above result shows that all the roots verifies \n:<math>R_0\\le |z| \\le R_1.</math>\nA these inequalities apply also to <math>h_0</math> and <math>h_n,</math> these bounds are optimal for polynomials with a given sequence of the absolute values of their coefficients. They are thus sharper than all bounds given in the preceding sections.\n\nFor {{math|0 < ''k'' < ''n''}}, Descartes' rule of signs implies that <math>h_k(x)</math> either has two positive real roots that are not multiple, or is nonnegative for every positive value of {{mvar|x}}. So, the above result may be applied only in the first case. If <math>R_{k,1}<R_{k,2}</math> are these two roots, the above result implies that\n:<math>|z| \\le R_{k,1}</math> \nfor {{mvar|k}} roots of {{mvar|p}}, and that \n:<math>|z| \\ge R_{k,2}</math> \nfor the {{math|''n'' \u2013 ''k''}} other roots.\n\nInstead of computing explicitly <math>R_{k,1}</math> and <math>R_{k,2},</math> it is generally sufficient to compute a value <math>R_k</math> such that <math>h_k(R_k)<0</math> (necessarily <math>R_{k,1}<R_k<R_{k,2}</math>). These  <math>R_k</math> have the property of separating roots in terms of their absolute values: if, for {{math|''h'' < ''k''}}, both <math>R_h</math> and <math>R_k</math> exist, there are exactly {{math|''k'' \u2013 ''h''}} roots {{mvar|z}} such that <math>R_h < |z| < R_k.</math>\n\nFor computing <math>R_k,</math> one can use that <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> is a [[convex function]] (its second derivative is positive). Thus <math>R_k</math> exists if and only if <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> is negative at its unique minimum. For computing this minimum, one can use any [[optimization]] method, or, alternatively, [[Newton's method]] for computing the unique positive zero of the derivative of <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> (it converges rapidly, as the derivative is a [[monotonic function]]).\n\nOne can increase the number of existing <math>R_k</math>'s by applying the root squaring operation of the [[Graeffe's method|Dandelin\u2013Graeffe iteration]]. If the roots have distinct absolute values, one can eventually separate completely the roots in terms of their absolute values, that is compute {{math|''n'' + 1}} positive numbers <math>R_0 < R_1 <\\dots <R_n</math> such there is exactly one root with an absolute value in the open interval <math>(R_{k-1},R_k),</math> for {{math|1=''k'' = 1, ..., ''n''}}.\n\n===From Gershgorin circle theorem ===\nThe [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] applied the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial on a basis related to [[Lagrange interpolation]] provides discs centered at the interpolation points and each containing a root of the polynomial; see {{slink|Durand\u2013Kerner method|Root inclusion via Gerschgorin's circles}} for details.\n\nIf the interpolation points are close to the roots of the roots of the polynomial, the radiuses of the discs are small, and this is a key ingredient of Durand\u2013Kerner method for computing polynomial roots.\n\n==Bounds of real roots==\n\nFor polynomials with real coefficients, it is often useful to bound only the real roots. It suffices to bound the positive roots, as the negative roots of {{math|''p''(''x'')}} are the positive roots of {{math|''p''(\u2013''x'')}}.\n\nClearly, every bound of all roots applies also for real roots. But in some contexts, tighter bounds of real roots are useful. For example, the efficiency of the [[Real-root isolation#Method of continued fractions|method of continued fractions]] for [[real-root isolation]] strongly depends on tightness of a bound of positive roots. This has led to establish new bounds that are tighter than the general bounds of all roots. These bounds are generally expressed not only in terms of the absolute values of the coefficients, but also in terms of their signs.\n\nOther bounds apply only to polynomials whose all roots are reals (see below).\n\n===Bounds of positive real roots===\n\nFor giving a bound of the positive roots, one can suppose <math>a_n >0</math> without loss of generality, as changing the signs of all coefficients does not change the roots.\n\nEvery upper bound of the positive roots of \n:<math>q(x)=a_nx^n + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\min(0,a_i)x^i</math>\nis also a bound  for the real zeros of \n:<math>p(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i</math>. \nIn fact, if {{mvar|B}} is such a bound, for all {{math|''x'' > ''B''}}, one has\n{{math|''p''(''x'') \u2265 ''q''(''x'') > 0}}.\n\nApplied to Cauchy's bound, this gives the upper bound \n:<math>1+{\\textstyle\\max_{i=0}^{n-1}} \\frac{-a_i}{a_n}</math>\nfor the real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients. If this bound is not greater than {{val|1}}, this means that all nonzero coefficients have the same sign, and that there is no positive root.\n\nSimilarly, another upper bound of the positive roots is \n:<math>2\\,{\\max_{a_ia_n<0}}\\left(\\frac{-a_i}{a_n}\\right)^{\\frac 1{n-i}}.</math>\nIf all nonzero coefficients have the same sign, there is no positive root, and the maximum must be defined as being zero.\n\nOther bounds have been recently developed, mainly for the need of the [[Real-root isolation#Method of continued fractions|method of continued fractions]] for [[real-root isolation]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Akritas |first=Alkiviadis G. |first2=A.

In fact, the root separation determines the precision of number representation that is needed for being sure of distinguishing different roots. Also, for [[real-root isolation]], it allows bounding the number of interval divisions that are needed for isolating all roots.\n\nFor polynomials with real or complex coefficients is not possible to express a lower bound of the root separation in terms of the degree and the absolute values of the coefficients only, because a small change on a single coefficient transforms a polynomial with multiple roots in a [[square-free polynomial]] with a small root separation, and essentially the same absolute values of the coefficient. However, involving the [[discriminant]] of the polynomial allows a lower bound.\n\nFor square-free polynomials with integer coefficients, the discriminant is an integer, and has thus an absolute value  that is not lower than {{val|1}}. This allows lower bounds for root separation that are independent from the discriminant.\n\nMignotte's separation bound is<ref>{{harvnb|Yap|2000|loc=\u00a7 VI.7, Proposition 29}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=George E.|last=Collins|authorlink=George E.

In particular, the real roots are mostly located near {{math|\u00b11}}, and, moreover, their expected number is, for a large degree, less than the [[natural logarithm]] of the degree.\n\nIf the coefficients are [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian distributed]] with a mean of zero and [[variance]] of ''\u03c3'' then the mean density of real roots is given by the Kac formula<ref name=Kac1943>{{cite journal |last=Kac |first=M. |authorlink=Mark Kac |year=1943 |title=On the average number of real roots of a random algebraic equation |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=314\u2013320 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1943-07912-8 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=Kac1948>{{cite journal |last=Kac |first=M. |year=1948 |title=On the Average Number of Real Roots of a Random Algebraic Equation (II) |journal=[[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]] |series=Second Series |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=390\u2013408 |doi=10.1112/plms/s2-50.5.390 }}</ref>\n\n: <math> m( x ) = \\frac { \\sqrt{ A( x ) C( x ) - B( x )^2 }} {\\pi A( x )} </math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math> \\begin{align}\nA(x) &= \\sigma \\sum x^{2i} = \\sigma \\frac{x^{2n} - 1}{x-1}, \\\\\nB(x) &= \\frac 1 2 \\frac{ d } { dx } A( x ), \\\\\nC(x) &= \\frac 1 4 \\frac{d^2} {dx^2} A(x) + \\frac 1 { 4x } \\frac d {dx} A(x).\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nWhen the coefficients are Gaussian distributed with a non-zero mean and variance of ''\u03c3'', a similar but more complex formula is known.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Real roots===\nFor large {{math|''n''}}, the mean density of real roots near {{mvar|x}} is asymptotically\n\n: <math> m( x ) = \\frac{ 1 } { \\pi | 1 - x^2 | } </math>\nif <math>x^2-1\\ne 0,</math>\nand\n: <math> m(\\pm 1) = \\frac 1 \\pi \\sqrt {\\frac{n^2 - 1}{12}} </math>\n\nIt follows that the expected number of real roots is, using [[big O notation|big {{mvar|O}} notation]]\n: <math> N_n = \\frac 2 \\pi \\ln n + C + \\frac 2 {\\pi n} +O( n^{ -2 } ) </math>\nwhere {{math|''C''}} is a constant approximately equal to {{val|0.6257358072}}.<ref name=ek>{{cite journal|last1=Edelman|first1=Alan|last2=Kostlan|first2=Eric|title=How many zeros of a random polynomial are real?| journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|year=1995|volume=32|pp=1-37|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1995-00571-9 |issue=1|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1995-32-01/S0273-0979-1995-00571-9/S0273-0979-1995-00571-9.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn other words, ''the expected number of real roots of a random polynomial of high degree is lower than the [[natural logarithm]] of the degree''.\n\nKac, Erd\u00f6s and others have shown that these results are insensitive to the distribution of the coefficients, if they are independent and have the same distribution with mean zero.
