He played 350 games, with the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] (1980\u20131983) and [[Bulldogs Rugby League Football Club|Canterbury]] (1984\u20131996). Lamb was known for his support of the ball-carrier - his ability to be in the right place at the right time netted him 164 [[Try (rugby)|tries]]. This earned him the moniker of \"The Back-up Man\". He also kicked 386 [[Goal (sport)#Rugby football|goal]]s and 44 [[drop goal|field goal]]s, for 1,442 points in first grade. He played for [[New South Wales]] in [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]]. Lamb holds the distinction of being the only player to appear in every match of a [[Kangaroo Tour]].\n\n==Junior career==\nLamb grew up in [[Chester Hill, New South Wales|Chester Hill]], a suburb in the [[City of Bankstown|Bankstown]] area and attended [[Sefton High School]]. Lamb played all his junior rugby league for the Chester Hill Hornets club during the years 1967&ndash;1979 where he won multiple Best and Fairest awards. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} He only played in one Grand Final when he filled in for a side above his age group. Lamb is the only International to come from the Chester Hill Hornets club and the ground is now named the [[Terry Lamb Complex]] in his honour. Lamb represented Canterbury in junior representative sides, but signed his first professional contract with [[Western Suburbs Magpies]].\n\n==Western Suburbs Magpies career==\nLamb was a non-playing reserve for the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] Third Grade side in 1979 and was hopeful of a contract with his junior side in 1980. Lamb was told the best he could hope for was a position in the Presidents Cup (Under 21s) side. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn 18 May [[1980 NSWRFL season|1980]], Lamb made his first grade premiership debut for [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] against [[Balmain Tigers]] at [[Lidcombe Oval]]. Lamb scored two tries in the Magpies' comprehensive 26-4<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/games/1980/198005180324.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007193818/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/games/1980/198005180324.html |archivedate=7 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> victory. Lamb scored 9 tries in his debut season and was edged out for the inaugural Dally M Rookie of the Year award by teammate [[Jim Leis]] who would go on the Australian 1980 Tour of New Zealand. Lamb formed a great scrumbase combination that season with [[Alan Neil]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nLamb's form in the early stages of the [[1981 NSWRFL season|1981 season]] was outstanding and he was selected in the [[New South Wales state rugby league team|NSW State of Origin side]]. Lamb was called in at the last moment for a very ill [[Mick Pattison]] {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and only arrived in [[Brisbane]] on the day of the match (when Pattison took ill, NSW coach [[Ted Glossop]] initially wanted to move [[Steve Rogers (rugby league)|Steve Rogers]] from the centres to five-eighth and play whoever the league gave him as a replacement back from the bench but was overruled by the [[NSWRL]]. Lamb, who at the time worked as a linesman for [[Telstra|Telecom]], was literally found up a telegraph pole and had to make a rushed flight to Brisbane). {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Lamb met his halves partner, young [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] halfback [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], for the first time only two hours before kickoff. Lamb made his Origin debut at [[Lang Park]] playing opposite another young player on the rise, [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] captain [[Wally Lewis]] who had made his test debut against [[France national rugby league team|France]] only a few weeks earlier. NSW led 15-5 at half time mostly due to the Parramatta connection of Sterling, [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]], [[Michael Cronin (rugby league)|Michael Cronin]] and [[Eric Grothe Sr.|Eric Grothe]] who picked up a loose [[Greg Conescu]] pass to race 90 metres to score in the first half. But the Maroons, led by Lewis and man of the match [[Chris Close]], came back strong in the second half to win 22-15.\n\nThe [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982 season]] was a successful one for Wests and Lamb where his end of season form caught the eyes of the [[Australian Rugby League|Australian]] selectors and he was selected for the [[1982 Kangaroo tour]]. Lamb ruled himself out of the tour as he already planned to marry his partner Kim. [[Australian Kangaroos|The Kangaroos]] swept all before them on the tour going through undefeated for the first time and becoming known as \"[[The Invincibles (rugby league)|The Invincibles]]\".\n\nLamb's final season with Wests was in [[1983 NSWRFL season|1983]] where the Magpies won the dreaded [[Australian rugby league wooden spooners|wooden spoon]] prize. In spite of this, he was awarded the [[Dally M Player of the Year Award]]. His prize winnings of $9,000 that night was $500 more than his contract that season. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nTerry Lamb made 88 appearances for Wests, Lamb was later named as halfback in the Western Suburbs Magpies Team of the Eighties.<ref>{{cite web|title=VEST, KEATO, COGGER ALL HONOURED|url=http://www.weststigers.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=30925&title=vest,-keato,-cogger-all-honoured|accessdate=30 September 2010|website=weststigers.com.au|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227200942/http://www.weststigers.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=30925&title=vest%2C-keato%2C-cogger-all-honoured|archivedate=27 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Joining the Bulldogs and early success==\nThe news that Lamb's Dally M winnings was more than his contract ensured that he would be in hot demand from the richer Sydney clubs now that he was out of contract and that [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] were at first expelled from the premiership. [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] and [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] both showed interest but eventually Lamb chose the Bulldogs, joining in 1984.<ref name = \"Bulldogs\" >[http://thebulldogs.com.au/sportal.php?page=player&id=477 Bulldogs.com.au - Terry Lamb]</ref>\n\nLamb settled nicely into Canterbury under the coaching of [[Warren Ryan]] and playing outside [[Steve Mortimer]]. Lamb's arrival did cause initial controversy when long-serving five-eighth [[Garry Hughes]] was dropped to reserve grade in what was to be his final season. Lamb's ability to back up the ball-carrier came to the fore as he was the Sydney Premiership's joint leading tryscorer with 17.<ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/NSWRL_1984/summary.html</ref> Lamb won a recall to the [[New South Wales Rugby League|New South Wales]] [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] side for the 2nd match. He played well enough to be retained for the 3rd match despite the Blues losing, but withdrew due to injury. Lamb never won a junior premiership and he was closing in on one at senior level when the Bulldogs made the 1984 Grand Final against arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] who were looking to win their fourth successive title. Canterbury took out the Grand Final 6\u20134 in a bruising game of football. Lamb was replaced with five minutes remaining due to a nasty gash above his eye.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/league_of_legends/100_years_of_the_game/slideshow_11_4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201112051/http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/league_of_legends/100_years_of_the_game/slideshow_11_4.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Lamb played 22 games for the Bulldogs, but was forced to miss the 1985 Grand Final due to a groin injury. [[Michael Hagan]] was named as his replacement.<ref>http://thebulldogs.com.au/sportal.php?page=player&id=477</ref> Canterbury defeated [[St. George Dragons]] 7\u20136 to make it back-to-back titles.\n\n1986 was an eventful year for Lamb. He played much of the opening rounds at halfback with captain [[Steve Mortimer]] suspended, and was recalled to the [[New South Wales Rugby League|New South Wales]] [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] side. He was selected in all three matches from the bench and went on to be selected in the [[Australian national rugby league team|Australian]] Test side for the opening match against New Zealand. Lamb came on from the bench as a replacement for [[Dale Shearer]]. Lamb got more time in the 3rd Test when he came as a replacement for the injured [[Wayne Pearce]] playing lock forward. His good form at Canterbury continued with the Bulldogs making a third successive Grand Final, once again playing [[Parramatta Eels]]. Lamb was the leading pointscorer for the season, and he would end up scoring 210 points.<ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/NSWRL_1986/summary.html</ref> However, he missed a difficult penalty goal attempt in the final three minutes of the 1986 Grand Final. The Eels won 4-2. Lamb was then selected to go on the [[Kangaroo Tour]].\n\nIn March 1987, Lamb scored all of Canterbury's 26 points as they beat Wests 26-16 in round 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/players/T/Terry_Lamb.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204013207/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/players/T/Terry_Lamb.html |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Lamb's points haul were made up of four tries and five goals.

Lamb played a very important role in Canterbury's season as former captain [[Steve Mortimer]] missed a large chunk of the season due to injuries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Hanley incident and the World Cup==\nCanterbury played the 1988 Grand Final against [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]], a game which the Bulldogs won 24-12. As well as scoring a try, Terry Lamb was involved in a first-half tackle, along with [[Andrew Farrar]], which resulted in the concussion of influential Balmain star, [[Ellery Hanley]]. Hanley was sent to the head bin, and although he managed to return to the field before half-time, he did not appear fully aware of his surroundings, and was replaced at half-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/south-west/nrl-grand-final-top-5-grand-final-moments-for-canterbury-bulldogs/news-story/2c7fb1748fad22e5b177c4dc92a0daaa |title=NRL grand final: Top 5 grand final moments for Canterbury Bulldogs |last=Murray |first=Oliver |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 September 2014 |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref> Lamb says that there was no malice, and Hanley was not deliberately targeted.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Peter Sterling (Presenter) |date=July 24, 2016 |title=On the Couch with Sterlo |medium=Documentary |location=Sydney |publisher=Fox Sports}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1988 World Cup Final against New Zealand, Lamb was named as a substitute. He was called into action in the first half after [[Wally Lewis]] broke his arm in a tackle.\n\n==Captain of the Bulldogs==\nOne of the first jobs that new coach [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] did was appoint Lamb as captain ahead of [[Paul Langmack]] and [[Andrew Farrar]], who were commonly the deputies when [[Peter Tunks]] (who joined [[Penrith Panthers]] in 1990) was unavailable.\n\nThe Bulldogs lost Paul Langmack, Andrew Farrar, [[David Gillespie]] and [[Joe Thomas (rugby league)|Joe Thomas]] to [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] under former dual premiership-winning coach [[Warren Ryan]]. The club also lost [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]] to [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] and Jason Alchin to [[St. George Dragons|St George]].\n\nLamb made himself unavailable for the [[1990 Kangaroo Tour]] despite the controversial omission of [[Wally Lewis]]. Cliff Lyons and Kevin Walters were both selected once Lamb confirmed his unavailability. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nA chronic groin injury would dog Lamb for the next few seasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=9468 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405153005/http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=9468 |archivedate=5 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Lamb would be a week-to-week proposition throughout the 1990s.\n\nDespite the departures from Canterbury at the end of the season, in 1991 they qualified in equal 5th position but went down 19-14 against arch-rivals [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]]. The club under the leadership of Lamb developed as a competitive force. Lamb  was captain to a new generation of players coming through the club who would play a big part in the club's successful years ahead including [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Dean Pay]], Simon Gillies, Matthew Ryan and 1991 Rothmans Medal Winner [[Ewan McGrady]]. The 1991 season was the only time Lamb would be suspended throughout his career when he was sent off for an alleged headbutt on [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly's]] [[Geoff Toovey]]. He received four weeks for the offence. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLamb missed the first five matches in 1992 but when he returned he enjoyed one of his finest individual seasons where Canterbury started to be tagged a 'one-man team'. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Lamb lifted the Bulldogs to the brink of the semi-finals before once again making himself unavailable as the 1992 World Cup loomed. Lamb came 2nd in the Dally M Awards for 1992.\n\nA new wave of signings joined the Bulldogs in 1993 and the team that Lamb and [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Anderson]] moulded was coming to fruition. The Bulldogs won the Minor Premiership with Lamb making it a hat-trick of Dally M Five-Eighth of the Year awards and Anderson winning Dally M Coach of the Year. Canterbury crashed out in the semi-finals but it was a great effort by the club to get to a position of strength after being warm favourites for the 1991 Wooden Spoon.\n\nLamb broke his arm in 1994 when playing his 299th first grade match against [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]]. Lamb would return to play his 300th match against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Souths]] playing at Concord Oval and wearing the No.55 jumper. Concord was only used for three League games and Lamb wore No.55 as he was a late inclusion into the side. Lamb broke the record previously held by [[Geoff Gerard]] in the final round, which ironically was against his former club [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] at Campbelltown with both [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] jointly celebrating the occasion. Canterbury with their victory in Lamb's 304th first grade game won the Minor Premiership and defeated [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] in the Major Semi-Final. The Raiders however won the Grand Final 36-12.\n\n==1995 Grand Final==\nThe 1995 season was to be Lamb's last season and the Bulldogs were keen to send him out a winner but it all went wrong early when the Bulldogs were caught up in the firing line of the [[Super League War]]. Lamb's strength and character as a captain shone through when he held the club together and rallied everyone (bar one) in the latter half of the season. Canterbury qualified in 6th position for the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] Finals Series. The Bulldogs defeated [[St. George Dragons|St George]], [[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane]] and defending premiers [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] to make the Grand Final against [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]].\n\nCanterbury were never headed in the Grand Final defeating [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] 17-4 in the decider with Lamb plotting a crucial drop-goal to give them a seven-point lead. Lamb spent 10 minutes in the sin bin {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} but that didn't stop his performance as he steered Canterbury to an impressive victory.\n\nIt was a sweet moment for Lamb and coach [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] after five years of planning went into this moment. The 1995 Grand Final was also the swansong for Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] who retired from his post after 26 years of service. Moore would remain a member of the [[Canterbury Leagues Club]] board until 1998.\n\nLamb's planned retirement was shelved as he helped his beloved club for one more season to get through a sudden player departure caused by the [[Super League War]]. Lamb didn't seek the captaincy with Simon Gillies taking on that role and when Gillies was injured for the second half of the season, Lamb again opted not to be captain with [[Darren Britt]] taking the reins (in a sign of things to come). Lamb's career wound down on 25 August 1996, when Canterbury defeated [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]] 50-22 at [[Belmore Sports Ground]]. Lamb scored two tries an that the start and end of his career saw him score a double.\n\nThe finest support player the game has seen played a record 350 first grade games (88 at [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]], 262 at [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]]). He also scored 164 first grade tries, a mark bettered only by [[Andrew Ettingshausen]] (165), [[Steve Menzies]] (180) and [[Ken Irvine]] (212).\n\nIn a strange twist, with [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] having reached (and won) the 2008 [[NRL Grand Final]], Menzies ended his career in Australia having equalled Lamb's league record of 349 games in his last match. The 34-year-old veteran of 15 NRL seasons then signed a contract to play the 2009 season and beyond with [[Super League]] club, the [[Bradford Bulls]].\n\nIn anticipation of equalling Lamb's record with his final appearance, Manly was reported to have made Menzies an offer to make a cameo appearance in 2009 to break the record. Menzies' response confirmed his and Lamb's standing among the greats:\n\n\"I wouldn't consider coming back for one game and cheapening the record or anything,\" said Menzies.\n\n\"If I fell one short or equalled it or whatever then that's my career and the way it finishes.\n\n\"(Lamb) was such a great player ... I'm very honoured to stand next to him.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/sport/beaver-happy-to-leave-tied-with-lamb-20080929-4qbc.html| work=The Sydney Morning Herald| first1=Todd| last1=Balym| first2=Cameron| last2=Tomarchio| title=Beaver happy to leave tied with Lamb| date=29 September 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522042819/http://news.smh.com.au/sport/beaver-happy-to-leave-tied-with-lamb-20080929-4qbc.html| archivedate=22 May 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nLamb set many records at Canterbury with the last one, a landmark of 123 tries being broken by winger [[Hazem El Masri]], against the [[Newcastle Knights]] in 2006.\n\nLamb would be acknowledged in 2004 as the Canterbury {{rlp|fe}} and captain in their 70-years greatest side. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==349 or 350?==\nIn August 2011, [[Darren Lockyer]] played his 350th game and was awarded with breaking the record (349 games, jointly held by Lamb, according to the NRL) for most games played. However a website which compiles player and team statistics, [http://www.rugbyleagueproject.com RugbyLeagueProject] has checked the list of games played and found that while the numbers for Wests tally, it appears that Lamb played an additional game in 1986 in Round 1, where he came off the bench to play. Official records in those days were erratic regarding interchange players and it was this match that had been overlooked. After working with the NRL, [http://www.rugbyleagueproject.com RugbyLeagueProject] submitted all their evidence and the official record was changed to show that Lamb had indeed become the first player to reach 350 Premiership games.\n\n==Coaching career==\n{{Expand section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:TERRY LAMB (former rugby league footballer and coach).jpg|thumb|right|Lamb in 2012]]\n\n==Achievements and Honours==\n*1983 Dally M Player of the Year (1st Runner Up in 1984, 1987, 1992. 2nd Runner Up in 1986)\n*1984 Rothmans Medal Best & Fairest Winner\n*Three times winner of the Dally M Players Player of the Year (1984, 1986, 1995)\n*Record seven times Dally M Five-Eighth of the Year Award (1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1991, 1992, 1993)\n*Won a record total of 18 Dally M Awards.\n*NSWRL Premiership Leading Tryscorer in 1984 (17) and 1987 (16)\n*NSWRL Premiership Leading Pointscorer in 1986 (210)\n*Member of 1984, 1988 and 1995 Canterbury Premiership Winning Teams\n*1995 Canterbury Premiership Winning Captain\n*Only player to play every match on a full [[Kangaroo Tour]].

He played 350 games, with the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] (1980\u20131983) and [[Bulldogs Rugby League Football Club|Canterbury]] (1984\u20131996). Lamb was known for his support of the ball-carrier - his ability to be in the right place at the right time netted him 164 [[Try (rugby)|tries]]. This earned him the moniker of \"The Back-up Man\". He also kicked 386 [[Goal (sport)#Rugby football|goal]]s and 44 [[drop goal|field goal]]s, for 1,442 points in first grade. He played for [[New South Wales]] in [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]]. Lamb holds the distinction of being the only player to appear in every match of a [[Kangaroo Tour]].\n\n==Junior career==\nLamb grew up in [[Chester Hill, New South Wales|Chester Hill]], a suburb in the [[City of Bankstown|Bankstown]] area and attended [[Sefton High School]]. Lamb played all his junior rugby league for the Chester Hill Hornets club during the years 1967&ndash;1979 where he won multiple Best and Fairest awards. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} He only played in one Grand Final when he filled in for a side above his age group. Lamb is the only International to come from the Chester Hill Hornets club and the ground is now named the [[Terry Lamb Complex]] in his honour. Lamb represented Canterbury in junior representative sides, but signed his first professional contract with [[Western Suburbs Magpies]].\n\n==Western Suburbs Magpies career==\nLamb was a non-playing reserve for the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] Third Grade side in 1979 and was hopeful of a contract with his junior side in 1980. Lamb was told the best he could hope for was a position in the Presidents Cup (Under 21s) side. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn 18 May [[1980 NSWRFL season|1980]], Lamb made his first grade premiership debut for [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] against [[Balmain Tigers]] at [[Lidcombe Oval]]. Lamb scored two tries in the Magpies' comprehensive 26-4<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/games/1980/198005180324.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007193818/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/games/1980/198005180324.html |archivedate=7 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> victory. Lamb scored 9 tries in his debut season and was edged out for the inaugural Dally M Rookie of the Year award by teammate [[Jim Leis]] who would go on the Australian 1980 Tour of New Zealand. Lamb formed a great scrumbase combination that season with [[Alan Neil]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nLamb's form in the early stages of the [[1981 NSWRFL season|1981 season]] was outstanding and he was selected in the [[New South Wales state rugby league team|NSW State of Origin side]]. Lamb was called in at the last moment for a very ill [[Mick Pattison]] {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and only arrived in [[Brisbane]] on the day of the match (when Pattison took ill, NSW coach [[Ted Glossop]] initially wanted to move [[Steve Rogers (rugby league)|Steve Rogers]] from the centres to five-eighth and play whoever the league gave him as a replacement back from the bench but was overruled by the [[NSWRL]]. Lamb, who at the time worked as a linesman for [[Telstra|Telecom]], was literally found up a telegraph pole and had to make a rushed flight to Brisbane). {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Lamb met his halves partner, young [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] halfback [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], for the first time only two hours before kickoff. Lamb made his Origin debut at [[Lang Park]] playing opposite another young player on the rise, [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] captain [[Wally Lewis]] who had made his test debut against [[France national rugby league team|France]] only a few weeks earlier. NSW led 15-5 at half time mostly due to the Parramatta connection of Sterling, [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]], [[Michael Cronin (rugby league)|Michael Cronin]] and [[Eric Grothe Sr.|Eric Grothe]] who picked up a loose [[Greg Conescu]] pass to race 90 metres to score in the first half. But the Maroons, led by Lewis and man of the match [[Chris Close]], came back strong in the second half to win 22-15.\n\nThe [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982 season]] was a successful one for Wests and Lamb where his end of season form caught the eyes of the [[Australian Rugby League|Australian]] selectors and he was selected for the [[1982 Kangaroo tour]]. Lamb ruled himself out of the tour as he already planned to marry his partner Kim. [[Australian Kangaroos|The Kangaroos]] swept all before them on the tour going through undefeated for the first time and becoming known as \"[[The Invincibles (rugby league)|The Invincibles]]\".\n\nLamb's final season with Wests was in [[1983 NSWRFL season|1983]] where the Magpies won the dreaded [[Australian rugby league wooden spooners|wooden spoon]] prize. In spite of this, he was awarded the [[Dally M Player of the Year Award]]. His prize winnings of $9,000 that night was $500 more than his contract that season. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nTerry Lamb made 88 appearances for Wests, Lamb was later named as halfback in the Western Suburbs Magpies Team of the Eighties.<ref>{{cite web|title=VEST, KEATO, COGGER ALL HONOURED|url=http://www.weststigers.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=30925&title=vest,-keato,-cogger-all-honoured|accessdate=30 September 2010|website=weststigers.com.au|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227200942/http://www.weststigers.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=30925&title=vest%2C-keato%2C-cogger-all-honoured|archivedate=27 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Joining the Bulldogs and early success==\nThe news that Lamb's Dally M winnings was more than his contract ensured that he would be in hot demand from the richer Sydney clubs now that he was out of contract and that [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] were at first expelled from the premiership. [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] and [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] both showed interest but eventually Lamb chose the Bulldogs, joining in 1984.<ref name = \"Bulldogs\" >[http://thebulldogs.com.au/sportal.php?page=player&id=477 Bulldogs.com.au - Terry Lamb]</ref>\n\nLamb settled nicely into Canterbury under the coaching of [[Warren Ryan]] and playing outside [[Steve Mortimer]]. Lamb's arrival did cause initial controversy when long-serving five-eighth [[Garry Hughes]] was dropped to reserve grade in what was to be his final season. Lamb's ability to back up the ball-carrier came to the fore as he was the Sydney Premiership's joint leading tryscorer with 17.<ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/NSWRL_1984/summary.html</ref> Lamb won a recall to the [[New South Wales Rugby League|New South Wales]] [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] side for the 2nd match. He played well enough to be retained for the 3rd match despite the Blues losing, but withdrew due to injury. Lamb never won a junior premiership and he was closing in on one at senior level when the Bulldogs made the 1984 Grand Final against arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] who were looking to win their fourth successive title. Canterbury took out the Grand Final 6\u20134 in a bruising game of football. Lamb was replaced with five minutes remaining due to a nasty gash above his eye.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/league_of_legends/100_years_of_the_game/slideshow_11_4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201112051/http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/league_of_legends/100_years_of_the_game/slideshow_11_4.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Lamb played 22 games for the Bulldogs, but was forced to miss the 1985 Grand Final due to a groin injury. [[Michael Hagan]] was named as his replacement.<ref>http://thebulldogs.com.au/sportal.php?page=player&id=477</ref> Canterbury defeated [[St. George Dragons]] 7\u20136 to make it back-to-back titles.\n\n1986 was an eventful year for Lamb. He played much of the opening rounds at halfback with captain [[Steve Mortimer]] suspended, and was recalled to the [[New South Wales Rugby League|New South Wales]] [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] side. He was selected in all three matches from the bench and went on to be selected in the [[Australian national rugby league team|Australian]] Test side for the opening match against New Zealand. Lamb came on from the bench as a replacement for [[Dale Shearer]]. Lamb got more time in the 3rd Test when he came as a replacement for the injured [[Wayne Pearce]] playing lock forward. His good form at Canterbury continued with the Bulldogs making a third successive Grand Final, once again playing [[Parramatta Eels]]. Lamb was the leading pointscorer for the season, and he would end up scoring 210 points.<ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/NSWRL_1986/summary.html</ref> However, he missed a difficult penalty goal attempt in the final three minutes of the 1986 Grand Final. The Eels won 4-2. Lamb was then selected to go on the [[Kangaroo Tour]].\n\nIn March 1987, Lamb scored all of Canterbury's 26 points as they beat Wests 26-16 in round 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/players/T/Terry_Lamb.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204013207/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/players/T/Terry_Lamb.html |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Lamb's points haul were made up of four tries and five goals.

Lamb played a very important role in Canterbury's season as former captain [[Steve Mortimer]] missed a large chunk of the season due to injuries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Hanley incident and the World Cup==\nCanterbury played the 1988 Grand Final against [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]], a game which the Bulldogs won 24-12. As well as scoring a try, Terry Lamb was involved in a first-half tackle, along with [[Andrew Farrar]], which resulted in the concussion of influential Balmain star, [[Ellery Hanley]]. Hanley was sent to the head bin, and although he managed to return to the field before half-time, he did not appear fully aware of his surroundings, and was replaced at half-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/south-west/nrl-grand-final-top-5-grand-final-moments-for-canterbury-bulldogs/news-story/2c7fb1748fad22e5b177c4dc92a0daaa |title=NRL grand final: Top 5 grand final moments for Canterbury Bulldogs |last=Murray |first=Oliver |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 September 2014 |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref> Lamb says that there was no malice, and Hanley was not deliberately targeted.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Peter Sterling (Presenter) |date=July 24, 2016 |title=On the Couch with Sterlo |medium=Documentary |location=Sydney |publisher=Fox Sports}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1988 World Cup Final against New Zealand, Lamb was named as a substitute. He was called into action in the first half after [[Wally Lewis]] broke his arm in a tackle.\n\n==Captain of the Bulldogs==\nOne of the first jobs that new coach [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] did was appoint Lamb as captain ahead of [[Paul Langmack]] and [[Andrew Farrar]], who were commonly the deputies when [[Peter Tunks]] (who joined [[Penrith Panthers]] in 1990) was unavailable.\n\nThe Bulldogs lost Paul Langmack, Andrew Farrar, [[David Gillespie]] and [[Joe Thomas (rugby league)|Joe Thomas]] to [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] under former dual premiership-winning coach [[Warren Ryan]]. The club also lost [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]] to [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] and Jason Alchin to [[St. George Dragons|St George]].\n\nLamb made himself unavailable for the [[1990 Kangaroo Tour]] despite the controversial omission of [[Wally Lewis]]. Cliff Lyons and Kevin Walters were both selected once Lamb confirmed his unavailability. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nA chronic groin injury would dog Lamb for the next few seasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=9468 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405153005/http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=9468 |archivedate=5 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Lamb would be a week-to-week proposition throughout the 1990s.\n\nDespite the departures from Canterbury at the end of the season, in 1991 they qualified in equal 5th position but went down 19-14 against arch-rivals [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]]. The club under the leadership of Lamb developed as a competitive force. Lamb  was captain to a new generation of players coming through the club who would play a big part in the club's successful years ahead including [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Dean Pay]], Simon Gillies, Matthew Ryan and 1991 Rothmans Medal Winner [[Ewan McGrady]]. The 1991 season was the only time Lamb would be suspended throughout his career when he was sent off for an alleged headbutt on [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly's]] [[Geoff Toovey]]. He received four weeks for the offence. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLamb missed the first five matches in 1992 but when he returned he enjoyed one of his finest individual seasons where Canterbury started to be tagged a 'one-man team'. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Lamb lifted the Bulldogs to the brink of the semi-finals before once again making himself unavailable as the 1992 World Cup loomed. Lamb came 2nd in the Dally M Awards for 1992.\n\nA new wave of signings joined the Bulldogs in 1993 and the team that Lamb and [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Anderson]] moulded was coming to fruition. The Bulldogs won the Minor Premiership with Lamb making it a hat-trick of Dally M Five-Eighth of the Year awards and Anderson winning Dally M Coach of the Year. Canterbury crashed out in the semi-finals but it was a great effort by the club to get to a position of strength after being warm favourites for the 1991 Wooden Spoon.\n\nLamb broke his arm in 1994 when playing his 299th first grade match against [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]]. Lamb would return to play his 300th match against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Souths]] playing at Concord Oval and wearing the No.55 jumper. Concord was only used for three League games and Lamb wore No.55 as he was a late inclusion into the side. Lamb broke the record previously held by [[Geoff Gerard]] in the final round, which ironically was against his former club [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] at Campbelltown with both [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] jointly celebrating the occasion. Canterbury with their victory in Lamb's 304th first grade game won the Minor Premiership and defeated [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] in the Major Semi-Final. The Raiders however won the Grand Final 36-12.\n\n==1995 Grand Final==\nThe 1995 season was to be Lamb's last season and the Bulldogs were keen to send him out a winner but it all went wrong early when the Bulldogs were caught up in the firing line of the [[Super League War]]. Lamb's strength and character as a captain shone through when he held the club together and rallied everyone (bar one) in the latter half of the season. Canterbury qualified in 6th position for the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] Finals Series. The Bulldogs defeated [[St. George Dragons|St George]], [[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane]] and defending premiers [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] to make the Grand Final against [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]].\n\nCanterbury were never headed in the Grand Final defeating [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] 17-4 in the decider with Lamb plotting a crucial drop-goal to give them a seven-point lead. Lamb spent 10 minutes in the sin bin {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} but that didn't stop his performance as he steered Canterbury to an impressive victory.\n\nIt was a sweet moment for Lamb and coach [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] after five years of planning went into this moment. The 1995 Grand Final was also the swansong for Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] who retired from his post after 26 years of service. Moore would remain a member of the [[Canterbury Leagues Club]] board until 1998.\n\nLamb's planned retirement was shelved as he helped his beloved club for one more season to get through a sudden player departure caused by the [[Super League War]]. Lamb didn't seek the captaincy with Simon Gillies taking on that role and when Gillies was injured for the second half of the season, Lamb again opted not to be captain with [[Darren Britt]] taking the reins (in a sign of things to come). Lamb's career wound down on 25 August 1996, when Canterbury defeated [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]] 50-22 at [[Belmore Sports Ground]]. Lamb scored two tries an that the start and end of his career saw him score a double.\n\nThe finest support player the game has seen played a record 350 first grade games (88 at [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]], 262 at [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]]). He also scored 164 first grade tries, a mark bettered only by [[Andrew Ettingshausen]] (165), [[Steve Menzies]] (180) and [[Ken Irvine]] (212).\n\nIn a strange twist, with [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] having reached (and won) the 2008 [[NRL Grand Final]], Menzies ended his career in Australia having equalled Lamb's league record of 349 games in his last match.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Anil Kapoor]], [[Shefali Shah]], [[Priyanka Chopra]], [[Ranveer Singh]], [[Anushka Sharma]] and [[Farhan Akhtar]], with a voice-over performance by [[Aamir Khan]] as the family dog Pluto, the narrator of the film. The supporting cast also includes [[Rahul Bose]], [[Zarina Wahab]], [[Vikrant Massey]], [[Pawan Chopra]], [[Parmeet Sethi]], [[Dolly Minhas|Dolly Mattdo]] and [[Manoj Pahwa]]. The film tells the story of the Mehras, a dysfunctional [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] family who invite their family and friends on a cruise trip to celebrate the parents' 30th wedding anniversary and later reconcile.\n\nAkhtar conceived the film as a family drama centred on a brother-sister relationship. She wanted to depict a more realistic sibling relationship in contrast to the dubious and over-the-top portrayal for which [[Bollywood]] is known. Akhtar later co-wrote the screenplay with her friend and longtime collaborator [[Reema Kagti]]. Much of the [[principal photography]] was done on [[Pullmantur Cruises]]' ship [[MS Sovereign|MS ''Sovereign'']] while sailing across the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Europe]], and on land in France, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and Italy.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by the trio [[Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy]], with lyrics by [[Javed Akhtar]]. The film was released worldwide on 5 June 2015 to positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Kapoor, Shah, Chopra and Singh, who portrayed the members of the Mehra family, as well as Akhtar's direction, cinematography and costumes. The film grossed {{INR}}1.45 billion at the box office against a budget of {{INR}}830&nbsp;million, and earned a [[List of accolades received by Dil Dhadakne Do|number of accolades]]. It received five [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare]] nominations, winning [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Kapoor. ''Dil Dhadakne Do'' also received nine nominations at the 2016 [[Screen Awards]], including [[Screen Award for Best Film|Best Film]], and won two, [[Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Kapoor and [[Screen Awards|Best Ensemble Cast]].\n\n== Plot ==\n\nKamal Mehra is a millionaire businessman who owns AyKa, a company on the verge of bankruptcy. He has a troubled relationship with his wife Neelam, daughter Ayesha and son Kabir. The Mehra family also includes their pet dog, Pluto. Ayesha owns a successful business but is unhappy with her marriage to Manav Sangha, a controlling, narcissistic husband who, together with his mother Smita hates Ayesha's family. Kabir, who yearns to become a pilot, unwillingly participates in the family business. Kamal and Neelam invite their family and friends for a ten-day cruise across the Mediterranean to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. Their guests include the Sood family, consisting of businessman Lalit Sood, his wife Naina and their daughter Noori. Kamal and Neelam plan to get Kabir married to Noori in exchange for Lalit investing in AyKa.\n\nThe Mehra family and all of their guests board the cruise ship in Italy. Kabir meets Farah, a dancer, and begins a relationship with her. Noori is in love with Rana Khanna, the son of Vinod and Vandana. The Khannas, however, are sworn enemies of the Soods, so Kabir and Noori decide to manipulate their parents into believing they are dating each other while continuing with their respective relationships. Ayesha considers divorcing her husband, whom she believes is incompatible with her. Her parents are staunchly against it, believing it will dishonour the family. Meanwhile, Sunny Gill, the son of Kamal's manager Amrish, arrives on the ship. Sunny and Ayesha dated each other as teenagers. Kamal, who was unhappy with their relationship, arranged and paid for Sunny's [[Yale University]] tuition to separate him from Ayesha. Ayesha realises that she still harbours feelings for Sunny, now a successful journalist. Unlike Manav, Sunny appreciates Ayesha's strong personality and believes in female empowerment.\n\nNeelam sees Kamal flirting with one of the female guests and wonders why she did not divorce him despite his past infidelities. Ayesha confronts Sunny about his sudden departure and kisses him, which she later regrets because she is married. Meanwhile, Farah hears that Kabir is planning to marry Noori and ends their relationship. Elsewhere, Kamal sees Noori making out with Rana and has a fit, after which he is rushed to the onboard emergency room. At the clinic, Kamal tells Kabir he saw Noori with Rana and asks him to end his relationship with her. Kabir tells his family he knew about the couple's relationship and that he is in love with Farah. He also tells them he intends to leave the family business and asks them to consider Ayesha, who is actually interested in business. He also tries to persuade them to let her proceed with her divorce as she is unhappy with the marriage, but Kamal and Neelam still refuse, believing marriages are lifelong commitments. Infuriated, Kabir tells Kamal that he, Neelam and Ayesha were all aware of his adultery and that Neelam has been bearing his infidelities and suffering silently to save the family. Kamal asks Neelam why she had not divorced him; she reveals she had no choice because her family would not accept her back due to their fear of dishonour. Kamal realises his mistake, asks for Neelam's forgiveness and consoles her. Later, while trying to reconcile Manav and Ayesha, Kamal sees how Manav mistreats his daughter and asks him and Smita to leave. He agrees to the divorce and asks Ayesha for forgiveness.\n\nKabir tries to persuade Farah to forgive him for lying to her, but she is dismissed from her job for being involved with a passenger and is told to leave the ship. Kabir learns about her dismissal after the ship has set sail from the port where it had docked for some time. Seeing no other option, Kabir, aided by Sunny, jumps off the ship, hoping his family will rescue him and help him get ashore. Kamal, Neelam, Ayesha, and Pluto eventually find a lifeboat to rescue him. While leaving, Ayesha asks Sunny if he would wait for her, to which he replies \"forever\". The family rescue Kabir and head towards the shore while being chased by the ship's crew. The Mehra family is seen happy in each other's presence for the first time.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast is listed below:<ref name=\"cast&crew\" />\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Anil Kapoor]] as Kamal Mehra\n* [[Shefali Shah]] as Neelam Mehra\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Ayesha Sangha\n* [[Ranveer Singh]] as Kabir Mehra\n* [[Anushka Sharma]] as Farah Ali\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Sunny Gill\n* [[Aamir Khan]] in a [[voice-over]] as Pluto Mehra/[[Narrator]]\n* [[Rahul Bose]] as Manav Sangha\n* [[Zarina Wahab]] as Smita Sangha\n* [[Vikrant Massey]] as Ranjeev \"Rana\" Khanna\n* Ridhima Sud as Noorie Sood\n* [[Pawan Chopra]] as Prem Mehra\n* Ayesha Raza Mishra as Indu Mehra\n* [[Parmeet Sethi]] as Lalit Sood\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Naina Sood\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Vinod Khanna\n* Preeti Mamgain as Vandana Khanna\n* Shireesh Sharma as Jamaal Hashmi\n* [[Divya Seth]] as Saira Hashmi\n* Ikhlaque Khan as Amrish Gill\n* Vandana Sajnani as Anju Chopra\n* Sarah Hashmi as Divya Mehra\n* [[Khushi Dubey]] as Putlu Mehra\n* [[Ivan Sylvester Rodrigues]] as Dharmapala Sr.\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Zoya at audio release of Talaash.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of Zoya Akhtar smiling, looking towards the camera|[[Zoya Akhtar]] had always intended to make a family drama with a brother-sister relationship as its core narrative]]\n\nWhen [[Excel Entertainment]] announced its upcoming films in March 2012, one of them was Zoya Akhtar's next film following ''[[Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara]]'' (2011).

[[Ritesh Sidhwani]] and [[Farhan Akhtar]]. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Anil Kapoor]], [[Shefali Shah]], [[Priyanka Chopra]], [[Ranveer Singh]], [[Anushka Sharma]] and [[Farhan Akhtar]], with a voice-over performance by [[Aamir Khan]] as the family dog Pluto, the narrator of the film. The supporting cast also includes [[Rahul Bose]], [[Zarina Wahab]], [[Vikrant Massey]], [[Pawan Chopra]], [[Parmeet Sethi]], [[Dolly Minhas|Dolly Mattdo]] and [[Manoj Pahwa]]. The film tells the story of the Mehras, a dysfunctional [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] family who invite their family and friends on a cruise trip to celebrate the parents' 30th wedding anniversary and later reconcile.\n\nAkhtar conceived the film as a family drama centred on a brother-sister relationship. She wanted to depict a more realistic sibling relationship in contrast to the dubious and over-the-top portrayal for which [[Bollywood]] is known. Akhtar later co-wrote the screenplay with her friend and longtime collaborator [[Reema Kagti]]. Much of the [[principal photography]] was done on [[Pullmantur Cruises]]' ship [[MS Sovereign|MS ''Sovereign'']] while sailing across the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Europe]], and on land in France, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and Italy.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by the trio [[Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy]], with lyrics by [[Javed Akhtar]]. The film was released worldwide on 5 June 2015 to positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Kapoor, Shah, Chopra and Singh, who portrayed the members of the Mehra family, as well as Akhtar's direction, cinematography and costumes. The film grossed {{INR}}1.45 billion at the box office against a budget of {{INR}}830&nbsp;million, and earned a [[List of accolades received by Dil Dhadakne Do|number of accolades]]. It received five [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare]] nominations, winning [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Kapoor. ''Dil Dhadakne Do'' also received nine nominations at the 2016 [[Screen Awards]], including [[Screen Award for Best Film|Best Film]], and won two, [[Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Kapoor and [[Screen Awards|Best Ensemble Cast]].\n\n== Plot ==\n\nKamal Mehra is a millionaire businessman who owns AyKa, a company on the verge of bankruptcy. He has a troubled relationship with his wife Neelam, daughter Ayesha and son Kabir. The Mehra family also includes their pet dog, Pluto. Ayesha owns a successful business but is unhappy with her marriage to Manav Sangha, a controlling, narcissistic husband who, together with his mother Smita hates Ayesha's family. Kabir, who yearns to become a pilot, unwillingly participates in the family business. Kamal and Neelam invite their family and friends for a ten-day cruise across the Mediterranean to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. Their guests include the Sood family, consisting of businessman Lalit Sood, his wife Naina and their daughter Noori. Kamal and Neelam plan to get Kabir married to Noori in exchange for Lalit investing in AyKa.\n\nThe Mehra family and all of their guests board the cruise ship in Italy. Kabir meets Farah, a dancer, and begins a relationship with her. Noori is in love with Rana Khanna, the son of Vinod and Vandana. The Khannas, however, are sworn enemies of the Soods, so Kabir and Noori decide to manipulate their parents into believing they are dating each other while continuing with their respective relationships. Ayesha considers divorcing her husband, whom she believes is incompatible with her. Her parents are staunchly against it, believing it will dishonour the family. Meanwhile, Sunny Gill, the son of Kamal's manager Amrish, arrives on the ship. Sunny and Ayesha dated each other as teenagers. Kamal, who was unhappy with their relationship, arranged and paid for Sunny's [[Yale University]] tuition to separate him from Ayesha. Ayesha realises that she still harbours feelings for Sunny, now a successful journalist. Unlike Manav, Sunny appreciates Ayesha's strong personality and believes in female empowerment.\n\nNeelam sees Kamal flirting with one of the female guests and wonders why she did not divorce him despite his past infidelities. Ayesha confronts Sunny about his sudden departure and kisses him, which she later regrets because she is married. Meanwhile, Farah hears that Kabir is planning to marry Noori and ends their relationship. Elsewhere, Kamal sees Noori making out with Rana and has a fit, after which he is rushed to the onboard emergency room. At the clinic, Kamal tells Kabir he saw Noori with Rana and asks him to end his relationship with her. Kabir tells his family he knew about the couple's relationship and that he is in love with Farah. He also tells them he intends to leave the family business and asks them to consider Ayesha, who is actually interested in business. He also tries to persuade them to let her proceed with her divorce as she is unhappy with the marriage, but Kamal and Neelam still refuse, believing marriages are lifelong commitments. Infuriated, Kabir tells Kamal that he, Neelam and Ayesha were all aware of his adultery and that Neelam has been bearing his infidelities and suffering silently to save the family. Kamal asks Neelam why she had not divorced him; she reveals she had no choice because her family would not accept her back due to their fear of dishonour. Kamal realises his mistake, asks for Neelam's forgiveness and consoles her. Later, while trying to reconcile Manav and Ayesha, Kamal sees how Manav mistreats his daughter and asks him and Smita to leave. He agrees to the divorce and asks Ayesha for forgiveness.\n\nKabir tries to persuade Farah to forgive him for lying to her, but she is dismissed from her job for being involved with a passenger and is told to leave the ship. Kabir learns about her dismissal after the ship has set sail from the port where it had docked for some time. Seeing no other option, Kabir, aided by Sunny, jumps off the ship, hoping his family will rescue him and help him get ashore.

{"title_page": "Sounds Like Sunset", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=March 2018}}\n{{Cleanup-PR|article|date=May 2019}}\n'''Sounds Like Sunset''' are a band based in Sydney, Australia. The group formed in 1997 and as of 2019 have released 3 albums, ''Saturdays'' in 2001, ''Invisible'' in 2005 and ''We Could Leave Tonight'' in 2014 as well as various other releases on cassettes, 7\" and compilations. ''We Could Leave Tonight'' was released on vinyl 22 July 2014 through Tym Records, and on CD and digitally on 22 August 2014 through Simon Tahiti Records.\n\n==Early days==\n\nThe band formed initially as a side-project with David Challinor (guitar), David Hobson (bass) and Rohan Geddes (drums) in a recently vacated room in Challinor's moldy and more or less condemned share house in [[Pennant Hills]] in Sydney's north west in August 1997. Challinor had been mostly busy playing guitar in the Sydney indie band Sal Paradise ([[Tooth & Nail Records]]) since early 1996, and Hobson had been playing bass in Sydney punk/hardcore act Ceasefire since around 1994. Early Sounds Like Sunset tape recordings and gigs showed the band in similar sonic territory as inspiring home-recording-band influences [[Flying Saucer Attack]] and other [[Drone music|drone]]/[[Noise music|noise]]/[[post-rock]] instrumental bands of the time - however this was something the band quickly distanced themselves from in the hope of melding all the noise & feedback into more concise, hummable melodic pop arrangements.\n\n==Music==\n\nThe band are often filed under [[Shoegazing|shoegazer]] and [[Noise pop|noise-pop]] music. The group's influences and inspiration range from the Beatles, Beach Boys, The Kinks, Velvet Underground and Love, through to more recent artists [[You Am I]], [[Dinosaur Jr]], [[Sebadoh]], [[Spacemen3]], [[Stereolab]], [[Bailter Space]], [[Flying Saucer Attack]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[The Cure]], [[My_Bloody_Valentine_(band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and the [[Jesus and Mary Chain]].\n\nThe members' teenage/formative years share a collective love of [[Punk rock|punk]] & [[Death metal]] - which occasionally resurfaces, some might say at odds with the delicate melodic nature of the band's current output. Live shows are generally loud, densely layered and orchestrated guitar assaults.\n\n==PRL==\n\nUntil recently the band regularly fielded a team aptly named \"The S\u00f6unds Like Sunset Singlet\u00f6nes\" in the PRL (Pretend Rugby League) competition, formed during the early 2000s by Chief [[Robert F Cranny]] of numerous celebrated indie bands including [[Sarah Blasko]], [[Gersey]] and [[78 Saab]].  The PRL was formed from a number of the community of Sydney indie bands who rehearsed at the beloved and now defunct Troy Horse Studios in [[Alexandria,_New_South_Wales|Alexandria]]. The team's PRL career began in 2003 during an alcohol-fuelled player auction event at the [[Zetland,_New_South_Wales|Zetland]] Hotel where the mostly ambivalent Challinor/Hobson auction representatives quickly exceeded the $100 salary cap and were outrageously docked competition points before a ball had even been kicked. \n\nIts career highlight was coming Div 1 runners-up in the 2006 season, followed by a Div1 3rd place in the 2007 season with a team selected entirely by Travis Baird of cult Sydney indie instrumental band Founder. Baird was recruited to select a squad when everyone in Sounds Like Sunset once again forgot to attend the player auction. \n\nIn 2008 the band shocked the PRL community by again failing to attend the 2008 PRL player auction, a move that did not go unnoticed by the PRL hierarchy and the band were forced to relinquish their coveted spot in Div1 of the PRL altogether.\n\nThe band hope to be eligible to re-register with PRL in 2020 (after again forgetting to attend the 2019 player auction) and aim to start climbing their way back through the lower leagues until again finding PRL glory in Div1. As [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] can often be quoted saying (though perhaps not in direct reference to the Singlet\u00f6nes) \"dismiss them at your peril\".\n\n==Recent Activity==\n\nPhil Usher (drums) joined the band in late 2018. Phil has an extensive background in music performance and composition, and currently teaches percussion full time in his hometown of Brisbane. Phil also writes, sings and plays guitar in Brisbane psych act Sacred Shrines, and played the same role in his previous band [[Grand Atlantic]]. Phil is also the current drummer for the legendary Brisbane act [[Screamfeeder]]. Phil has toured the US extensively in various bands since the mid-90s, and was even at one time called upon to play drums for [[Barry Manilow]] for a live stadium performance. Phil has been a dear friend of and enthusiastic advocate of Sounds Like Sunset for many years since watching the band's first ever live performance in 1997, and has arranged numerous Brisbane shows for the band as well as regularly providing booze, smokes, general good vibes and a floor for the routinely intoxicated and/or hungover band to sleep on.\n\nTobey Doctor (drums) has played in various jazz, punk and defiantly \"unlistenable\" DIY sludge bands since the late 80s and early 90s. Tobey initially befriended the band when booking SLS for shows at The Phonenix Club, a small underground venue in Darlinghurst before joining Sounds Like Sunset after Vig kind of went missing after a while in the early 2000s. Tobey is arguably the most well known drummer of Sounds Like Sunset, and appeared on the band's second album ''Invisible'' and third album ''We Could Leave Tonight''. Tobey provided the loose, wild, energetic Keith-Moon-like wildcard element both on and off the field for what was probably the most cohesive and well-known SLS lineup of Challinor/Hobson/Fevre/Doctor, and continues to be a dear friend and collaborator even years after his departure. Originally from [[Manly,_New_South_Wales|Manly]], Tobey made a sudden decision to move from [[Bondi Beach]] to the Melbourne suburb of [[Heidelberg,_Victoria|Heidelberg]] in late 2016, and after spending a short time away from music and adjusting to life in a new city, he has recently been jamming with a number of Melbourne indie bands including the prolific artist/indie music mover & shaker JMS Harrison. \n\nJoseph Dews (drums) has played in a number of Sydney indie acts over the years including Founder, MachineMachine and The Woods Themselves, as well as his own ongoing solo projects. He currently plays guitar and sings in the band Peter Fonda, which also features current SLS member Travis Baird. \n\nAndrew Fevre (guitar) 1997 - 2008 left Sydney and spent a year traveling Europe before returning to Sydney and moving in with Tobey Doctor in Bondi Beach. Despite living with Tobey, he only rejoined SLS for a very short time before mostly abandoning music altogether and becoming a chef within the empire of celebrity chef [[Bill Granger]]. Andrew remains a dear friend of SLS. He is one of the very first childhood friends of David Hobson, and taught Hobson his first ever swear words. During Fevre's European absence the band played on with various friends dropping into the lineup for a number of shows, including: \n* Scott Meikle (guitar) of Ben Aylward's post-[[Swirl_(band)|Swirl]] band [http://www.myspace.com/beautifulworldband Beautiful World]\n* Pete Farley (guitar) of the bands [[Gelbison]] and [[Toni Collette & the Finish|Toni Collette & The Finish]], and\n* Travis Baird (guitar, keys) of the bands Founder, Melodie Nelson, El Mopa and The Woods Themselves, as well his ongoing solo project AFXJM which includes [[Patrick Matthews]] of Community Radio, [[Youth Group]] and (ex of) [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]]. \n\nCurrent band members now live in an area spread as far afield as [[Tempe,_New_South_Wales|Tempe]], [[Collaroy Plateau]], Concord (Sydney), [[Paddington,_Queensland|Paddington]] (Brisbane) and the NSW Central Coast suburb of [[Wyoming,_New_South_Wales|Wyoming]].\n\n==Band members==\n'''Current lineup''' (current as of March 2019)\n\n* David Challinor - vocals, guitar\n* David Hobson - bass\n* Ben White - guitar\n* Travis Baird - guitar\n* Phil Usher - drums\n\n'''Past Members'''\n\n* Joe Dews - drums\n* Tobey Doctor - drums (''Invisible'', ''We Could Leave Tonight'') \n* Pete Farley - guitar\n* Scott Meikle - guitar\n* Andrew Fevre - guitar\n* Matt Bonson - drums (''Saturdays'')\n* David \"Vig\" Virgilio - drums\n* Josh Thompson - guitar\n* Rohan Geddes - drums\n\n'''Recording & Mixing Engineers'''\n* [[Wayne Connolly]] (''Saturdays'', ''We Could Leave Tonight'') \n* Anthony The (''Invisible'') \n* Jon Gardner a.k.a Jonboyrock (''Invisible'') \n* Chris Townend (''Saturdays'') \n\n'''Sound Engineers'''\n* Toby Baldwin (early/mid 2000s-present)\n* Al Cousins (early-mid 2000s-present)\n* Anthony The (early-mid 2000s)\n* Jon Gardner a.k.a Jonboyrock (late 1990s-mid 2000s)\n* Clay Segelov (early-mid 2000s)\n* Dave Springer (early 2000s)\n* Pete Kelly (late 1990s)\n* Jorden Brebach (late 1990s)\n\nIt can also a curious fact that as of March 2019 none of the 7 Sounds Like Sunset drummers past or present have any biological children between them.\n\n==Discography==\n* ''We Could Leave Tonight'' LP 2014 [http://www.tym-records.com Tym records]\n* ''Invisible'' LP 2005 [http://www.architecturelabel.com Architecture Label]\n* ''Saturdays'' LP 2001 ([[Modular Recordings]])\n* ''Before it Blows/Promise Ring'' split 7\" 2000 (Quietly Suburban Recordings) - a split release with Los Angeles indie band [[The Lassie Foundation]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soundslikesunset.com.au Sounds Like Sunset official website]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Australian rock music groups]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=March 2018}}\n{{Cleanup-PR|article|date=May 2019}}\n'''Sounds Like Sunset''' are a band based in Sydney, Australia.

The estate was then {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of excellent land, the revenue at the time: \u00a33000 per annum.

He sold Haltoun House to the [[Earl of Morton]] in 1870, whose son Lord Aberdour sold it to James McKelvie in 1898. In 1915 it was sold to William Whitelaw, chairman of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] company.\n\n==Haltoun House==\n\nThe first Lauders built a massive Pele Tower at Haltoun before 1400, which Hannan refers to as \"an '''L'''-shaped castle with walls of a uniform thickness of about {{convert|10|ft|m}}.\" Sir William Lauder of Haltoun was a confidant of both King [[James II of Scotland|James II]] and the Earl of Douglas. In 1452 he was the King's personal messenger, sent to escort Douglas to [[Stirling Castle]] on a Royal promise of absolute safety, whereupon the Earl was murdered by the King. Haltoun Tower was subsequently besieged by King James and during that siege, Sir William Lauder died. The tower and battlements were subsequently restored to good condition by the King, at Exchequer expense.\n\nThe castle became the nucleus of the subsequent greater country house which was built onto and around it. On the east face of the south-east angle tower was a sundial with the monogram \"C.M.E.L\" for Charles Maitland & his wife Elizabeth Lauder, the monogram being divided by the date 1664, the year in which Maitland commenced dramatic new extensions to the old castle. His son John added the east front in a [[Renaissance]] style in 1696 and 1704. It was restored in 1859 and in 1870 the windows were altered.\n\nThe interiors were entered through a small entrance hall, panelled in [[oak]] brought from [[Letheringham]] Abbey, [[Suffolk]], into the main hall, {{convert|50|ft|m}} by 20, panelled also with a magnificent finely-made [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] plaster ceiling. Other rooms included a morning room, situated between the library and dining room (both also panelled in oak). On the first floor the saloon and drawing rooms were fitted out with [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] pine panelling, greatly used in Scottish country houses at the time.  'Lord Jeffrey's study' in the tower, was a nine-sided decorative room, with much gilt. The centre of the ceiling was a painting of a man flying away with a lightly clothed female - a classical motif.\n\nHaltoun House was approached by an original avenue, half a mile long, abutted by tall [[elm]]s and [[beech]]es, [[lime tree]]s, [[hollies]], [[taxus|Yews]], and [[rhododendron]]s. The principal entrance was at the east through massive gate pillars.\n\nIn 1952 the house caught fire, and was demolished in 1955, during a period when many other country houses suffered a similar fate. All that remains are the terraces along the south side of the house with a two-story pavilion at each end.\n\nThe grounds currently support rare habitats for greater-crested newts, tree moles, bats and land puffins; all protected species.\n\nA number of structures survive on the estate.

An athletic {{rlp|lk}} for the [[Balmain Tigers]], he was affectionately known as 'Junior'. Pearce represented [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]] in the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin Series]] as well as the [[Australian national rugby league team]].\n\nPearce was captain of the [[Balmain Tigers]] rugby league club from 1982\u20131990. A local junior from the Balmain Police Boys club, he made his debut in [[NSWRFL season 1980|1980]] and was quickly marked as a future star.\n\nPearce's son, [[Mitchell Pearce|Mitchell]] is a half-back previously for the [[Sydney Roosters]] and currently for the [[Newcastle Knights]]\n\n==Captaincy==\nPearce's captaincy proved critical in elevating Balmain from also-rans to a force of the 1980s, in concert with [[Steve Roach (rugby league footballer)|Steve Roach]], [[Benny Elias]] and later [[Paul Sironen]]. Along with fullback [[Garry Jack]], they drove Balmain to the semi-finals in [[NSWRFL season 1983|1983]] and every year from 1985 to Pearce's retirement. Pearce won the Rothman's Medal for the best-and-fairest player in 1985.\n\nIn 1986 Pearce captained the [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales Blues]] to their first ever [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] clean-sweep, but in the following two years there was to be a rapid decline, with Queensland easily winning every match in 1988. After this, Pearce stood down from representative rugby league, despite pressure for him to return after Queensland won even more easily in 1989. In 1988 he was awarded the Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] \"for service to rugby league\".  Pearce was also the inaugural winner of the [[Ken Stephen Medal]] for Community Service by a professional [[rugby league]] footballer. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nPearce also made an appearance the 1988 Australian television movie ''[[The First Kangaroos]]'', which depicted the [[1908\u201309 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]].<ref>{{Cite news \n| last = John Robinson and Garrett Jones\n| title = Family fights to clear League Hero's Name\n| work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n| place = Australia\n| page = 74\n| date = 8 June 1988\n| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eq8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XOQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3217,6447980\n| accessdate = 20 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nPearce captained the Balmain Tigers to two successive grand finals in 1988 and 1989, both of which they lost. In 1990, Pearce could not play a full match until the seventeenth round, but for the rest of the season he was at his best, seen clearly in the play-off for fifth with Newcastle, when he scored a crucial try from a [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]] and carted the ball forward as fearlessly as ever. The following week, though, proved to be his last match as Balmain lost 0\u201316, sparking a major decline in the club's fortunes after Pearce's retirement.\n\n==Coaching career==\nPearce took over as Balmain coach in 1994 from the departing Alan Jones as the club finished with the wooden spoon at seasons end.  Pearce coached Balmain for another five seasons before they merged with the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]].  In 2000, Pearce became the inaugural coach of the [[Wests Tigers]] but stepped down after one season.  Pearce also coached New South Wales for three seasons and in 2000 led New South Wales to a clean sweep winning the series 3\u20130 with the blues winning game 3 by a then record margin of 40 points.  The match was also remembered for Bryan Fletcher's infamous hand grenade try celebration.  In 2001, Pearce coached NSW in what would prove to be his last series.  His last game in charge was the widely remembered victory by Queensland who defeated NSW 40\u201314 where [[Allan Langer]] who had been playing over in England was phoned by Maroons coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] in an urgent SOS call to return to Australia for the match.

An athletic {{rlp|lk}} for the [[Balmain Tigers]], he was affectionately known as 'Junior'. Pearce represented [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]] in the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin Series]] as well as the [[Australian national rugby league team]].\n\nPearce was captain of the [[Balmain Tigers]] rugby league club from 1982\u20131990. A local junior from the Balmain Police Boys club, he made his debut in [[NSWRFL season 1980|1980]] and was quickly marked as a future star.\n\nPearce's son, [[Mitchell Pearce|Mitchell]] is a half-back previously for the [[Sydney Roosters]] and currently for the [[Newcastle Knights]]\n\n==Captaincy==\nPearce's captaincy proved critical in elevating Balmain from also-rans to a force of the 1980s, in concert with [[Steve Roach (rugby league footballer)|Steve Roach]], [[Benny Elias]] and later [[Paul Sironen]]. Along with fullback [[Garry Jack]], they drove Balmain to the semi-finals in [[NSWRFL season 1983|1983]] and every year from 1985 to Pearce's retirement. Pearce won the Rothman's Medal for the best-and-fairest player in 1985.\n\nIn 1986 Pearce captained the [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales Blues]] to their first ever [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] clean-sweep, but in the following two years there was to be a rapid decline, with Queensland easily winning every match in 1988. After this, Pearce stood down from representative rugby league, despite pressure for him to return after Queensland won even more easily in 1989. In 1988 he was awarded the Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] \"for service to rugby league\".  Pearce was also the inaugural winner of the [[Ken Stephen Medal]] for Community Service by a professional [[rugby league]] footballer. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nPearce also made an appearance the 1988 Australian television movie ''[[The First Kangaroos]]'', which depicted the [[1908\u201309 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]].<ref>{{Cite news \n| last = John Robinson and Garrett Jones\n| title = Family fights to clear League Hero's Name\n| work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n| place = Australia\n| page = 74\n| date = 8 June 1988\n| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eq8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XOQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3217,6447980\n| accessdate = 20 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nPearce captained the Balmain Tigers to two successive grand finals in 1988 and 1989, both of which they lost. In 1990, Pearce could not play a full match until the seventeenth round, but for the rest of the season he was at his best, seen clearly in the play-off for fifth with Newcastle, when he scored a crucial try from a [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]] and carted the ball forward as fearlessly as ever. The following week, though, proved to be his last match as Balmain lost 0\u201316, sparking a major decline in the club's fortunes after Pearce's retirement.\n\n==Coaching career==\nPearce took over as Balmain coach in 1994 from the departing Alan Jones as the club finished with the wooden spoon at seasons end.  Pearce coached Balmain for another five seasons before they merged with the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]].  In 2000, Pearce became the inaugural coach of the [[Wests Tigers]] but stepped down after one season.  Pearce also coached New South Wales for three seasons and in 2000 led New South Wales to a clean sweep winning the series 3\u20130 with the blues winning game 3 by a then record margin of 40 points.  The match was also remembered for Bryan Fletcher's infamous hand grenade try celebration.  In 2001, Pearce coached NSW in what would prove to be his last series.  His last game in charge was the widely remembered victory by Queensland who defeated NSW 40\u201314 where [[Allan Langer]] who had been playing over in England was phoned by Maroons coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] in an urgent SOS call to return to Australia for the match.

He is currently the development squad manager at [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], after leaving a similar post at [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]].\n\nDuring his long career, Millen played primarily as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]], [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]], [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]] and [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]].\n\nHe continued to play for [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] in the [[Scottish Premier League]] aged 42. Millen played for [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] in the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Scottish Third Division]], aged 45.\n\n==Career==\n\nEarly in his playing career, Millen won the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] twice with [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton]]. During his spell with [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] he won a [[Scotland B national football team|Scotland B]] cap against [[Wales B national football team|Wales B]].<ref>[http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=528 SCOTLAND B INTERNATIONALS], [[Scottish Football Association]].</ref>\n\nMillen earned fame later in his career for continuing to play at a senior level despite his advanced professional age. When he played for [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on 5 May 2007 at [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]], he became the oldest player to play in the [[Scottish Premier League]].<ref name = \"SPL oldest\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/st_mirren/6656301.stm |title=Millen confirmed as SPL's oldest |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> He broke the record set by [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]] [[Jim Leighton]], who was aged 41 years and 302 days when he last played in the SPL.<ref name = \"SPL oldest\"/> [[Gus MacPherson]] argued that Millen's record is more notable because Millen played in the more physical role of an outfield player.<ref name = \"SPL oldest\"/>\n\nMillen took control of the St Mirren team for a match against [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] in November 2007, after a family bereavement prevented [[Gus MacPherson]] from attending the match, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nMillen announced his intention to retire from first team football in June 2008.<ref name = \"Millen hangs up boots\"/> During his time with St Mirren, he won the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] and the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] in the [[2005\u201306 in Scottish football|2005\u201306 season]].<ref name = \"Millen hangs up boots\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/st_mirren/7470759.stm |title=Millen hangs up boots for Buddies |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=24 June 2008}}</ref> Millen's last league appearance was against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] on 15 March 2008, which meant that he set the [[Scottish Premier League#SPL records|SPL record]] for oldest player at 42 years and 279 days, almost a whole year more than the previous record.\n\nMillen continued working as assistant manager to Gus MacPherson after retiring as a player. After [[Danny Lennon]] was appointed as manager, however, Millen left the club to allow Lennon to appoint his own backroom staff.<ref>{{cite

He is often called \"The Voice of Rugby League\". Warren also used to call Australian [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] team events and the FINA World Championships until Nine lost the rights to these events in 2008 and in 2012 participated in Nine's coverage of the London Olympics. \n\nOn Saturday mornings, he is a member of the panel on [[Triple M]] [[Sydney]]'s radio Saturday morning sports program [[Dead Set Legends]]. Warren's nickname is '''\"Rabbits\"''', as in a rabbit's warren.  \n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Junee, New South Wales]] on 11 June 1943,<ref name=\"smh050924\">{{cite news|first=Philip|last=Derriman|title=Warren still going full scream ahead|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/warren-still-going-full-scream-ahead/2005/09/23/1126982232457.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2005-09-24|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> Warren initially followed in the footsteps of his brother by joining the police force. He initially joined the NSW Police Cadets on 5 December 1960<ref>http://www.expolicecadets.asn.au/personality.php?id=35</ref> and then transferred to the ACT Police in Canberra in 1964.<ref>https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/19627725?q&versionId=23066027</ref>  Warren stated he served a total of three years in the ACT Police during the Channel 9 broadcast of the NRL Round 23 Canberra Raiders vs Sydney Roosters match on 19 August 2018.<ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/08/20/full-match-replay-raiders-v-roosters---round-23-2018/</ref> It was during his stint in uniform he got a phone call as a result of all the door-knocking he had done at various radio stations as a teenager.  Ray took the job offered to him at 2LF Young, New South Wales as a sales representative, trotting commentator and rugby league commentator - a move which started his career in broadcasting.\n\nHe began commentating on television through the [[Amco Cup]] on [[Network Ten|Channel Ten]] with [[Keith Barnes]] in 1974. In 1980, Ten approached Warren to call the [[Melbourne Cup]], the first of three Cups he would call for the network.<ref>Webster, Andrew \"[http://www.insidesport.com.au/is/index?pg=adrenalin&spg=drinks/drinks_ray_warren.htm A few drinks with Ray Warren ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920141012/http://www.insidesport.com.au/is/index?pg=adrenalin&spg=drinks%2Fdrinks_ray_warren.htm |date=20 September 2009 }}\", ''[[Inside Sport]]'' magazine, April 2004</ref> He also became Network Ten's chief Rugby League caller in 1983.<ref name=diagnosed>{{cite news|last1=AAP|title=Ray Warren diagnosed with prostate cancer|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/ray-warren-diagnosed-with-prostate-cancer-20110611-1fxtf.html|accessdate=8 September 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=11 June 2011}}</ref> In 1984 he was to head up Ten's commentary for the Los Angeles Olympics but refused to take the mission. As a nervous flyer, Warren had grave reservations about the trans-Pacific haul and suddenly realised he could not get onto the plane. In 1986, Warren was fired by the network, primarily because it wanted to replace him as its chief rugby league commentator with former international player [[Rex Mossop]].<ref name=\"smh050924\"/>\n\nOver the next six years, Warren would also travel many miles to call horse races. In 1988 he was recruited by the [[Nine Network]] to commentate on the 1988 Rugby League World Cup final and the 1989 state of origin series alongside [[Darrell Eastlake]] and [[Balmain Tigers]] coach [[Warren Ryan]], 1989 Trans-Tasman test series alongside [[Darrell Eastlake]] again and [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]] and to be part of its team to broadcast swimming at the 1990 [[Commonwealth Games]] with Norman May. The television rights for rugby league were bought by Nine for the 1991 State of Origin Series, [[1992 NSWRL season|1992 season]] and onwards and he has been calling the game for them ever since. Warren has gradually overcome his fear of flying, though he does still have some fear as evidenced by a well publicised helicopter flight to a game on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in 2012 made necessary due to a delayed flight from Sydney to the Gold Coast. Overcoming his fear has seen him travel to [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]] and [[Canada]] for the network's swimming or rugby league coverage.\n\nRay Warren is known for his passionate commentary (often getting into good-natured arguments with fellow commentator [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] about a player or the rules of rugby league during games), and has often been parodied by [[The Twelfth Man]].

He is often called \"The Voice of Rugby League\". Warren also used to call Australian [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] team events and the FINA World Championships until Nine lost the rights to these events in 2008 and in 2012 participated in Nine's coverage of the London Olympics. \n\nOn Saturday mornings, he is a member of the panel on [[Triple M]] [[Sydney]]'s radio Saturday morning sports program [[Dead Set Legends]]. Warren's nickname is '''\"Rabbits\"''', as in a rabbit's warren.  \n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Junee, New South Wales]] on 11 June 1943,<ref name=\"smh050924\">{{cite news|first=Philip|last=Derriman|title=Warren still going full scream ahead|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/warren-still-going-full-scream-ahead/2005/09/23/1126982232457.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2005-09-24|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> Warren initially followed in the footsteps of his brother by joining the police force. He initially joined the NSW Police Cadets on 5 December 1960<ref>http://www.expolicecadets.asn.au/personality.php?id=35</ref> and then transferred to the ACT Police in Canberra in 1964.<ref>https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/19627725?q&versionId=23066027</ref>  Warren stated he served a total of three years in the ACT Police during the Channel 9 broadcast of the NRL Round 23 Canberra Raiders vs Sydney Roosters match on 19 August 2018.<ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/08/20/full-match-replay-raiders-v-roosters---round-23-2018/</ref> It was during his stint in uniform he got a phone call as a result of all the door-knocking he had done at various radio stations as a teenager.  Ray took the job offered to him at 2LF Young, New South Wales as a sales representative, trotting commentator and rugby league commentator - a move which started his career in broadcasting.\n\nHe began commentating on television through the [[Amco Cup]] on [[Network Ten|Channel Ten]] with [[Keith Barnes]] in 1974. In 1980, Ten approached Warren to call the [[Melbourne Cup]], the first of three Cups he would call for the network.<ref>Webster, Andrew \"[http://www.insidesport.com.au/is/index?pg=adrenalin&spg=drinks/drinks_ray_warren.htm A few drinks with Ray Warren ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920141012/http://www.insidesport.com.au/is/index?pg=adrenalin&spg=drinks%2Fdrinks_ray_warren.htm |date=20 September 2009 }}\", ''[[Inside Sport]]'' magazine, April 2004</ref> He also became Network Ten's chief Rugby League caller in 1983.<ref name=diagnosed>{{cite news|last1=AAP|title=Ray Warren diagnosed with prostate cancer|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/ray-warren-diagnosed-with-prostate-cancer-20110611-1fxtf.html|accessdate=8 September 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=11 June 2011}}</ref> In 1984 he was to head up Ten's commentary for the Los Angeles Olympics but refused to take the mission. As a nervous flyer, Warren had grave reservations about the trans-Pacific haul and suddenly realised he could not get onto the plane. In 1986, Warren was fired by the network, primarily because it wanted to replace him as its chief rugby league commentator with former international player [[Rex Mossop]].<ref name=\"smh050924\"/>\n\nOver the next six years, Warren would also travel many miles to call horse races. In 1988 he was recruited by the [[Nine Network]] to commentate on the 1988 Rugby League World Cup final and the 1989 state of origin series alongside [[Darrell Eastlake]] and [[Balmain Tigers]] coach [[Warren Ryan]], 1989 Trans-Tasman test series alongside [[Darrell Eastlake]] again and [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]] and to be part of its team to broadcast swimming at the 1990 [[Commonwealth Games]] with Norman May. The television rights for rugby league were bought by Nine for the 1991 State of Origin Series, [[1992 NSWRL season|1992 season]] and onwards and he has been calling the game for them ever since. Warren has gradually overcome his fear of flying, though he does still have some fear as evidenced by a well publicised helicopter flight to a game on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in 2012 made necessary due to a delayed flight from Sydney to the Gold Coast. Overcoming his fear has seen him travel to [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]] and [[Canada]] for the network's swimming or rugby league coverage.\n\nRay Warren is known for his passionate commentary (often getting into good-natured arguments with fellow commentator [[Phil Gould]] about a player or the rules of rugby league during games), and has often been parodied by [[The Twelfth Man]].
