After vanquishing the Liao, the Jurchen Jin launched an [[Jin\u2013Song Wars|over hundred-year struggles]] against the Chinese [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), which was based in southern China. Over the course of their rule, the Jurchens of Jin quickly [[Sinicization|adapted to Chinese customs]], and even [[History of the Great Wall of China|fortified the Great Wall]] against the rising Mongols. Domestically, the Jin oversaw a number of cultural advancements, such as the revival of [[Confucianism]].\n\nAfter spending centuries as vassals of the Jin, the Mongols invaded under Genghis Khan in 1211 and inflicted catastrophic defeats on the Jin armies. After numerous defeats, revolts, defections, and coups, they succumbed to [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Mongol conquest]] 23 years later in 1234.\n\n== Name ==\n{{Main|Names of China}}\n\nThe Jin dynasty was officially known as the \"Great Jin\" at that time. Furthermore, the Jin emperors referred to their state as China, ''Zhongguo'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e2d\u570b}}), just as some other non-Han dynasties.{{sfn|Zhao|2006|p=7}} Non-Han rulers expanded the definition of \"China\" to include non-Han peoples in addition to Han people whenever they ruled China.{{sfn|Zhao|2006|p=6}} Jin documents indicate that the usage of \"China\" by dynasties to refer to themselves began earlier than previously thought.{{sfn|Zhao|2006|p=24}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Jin\u2013Song Wars}}\n{{see also|Timeline of the Jurchens}}\n\nThe Jin dynasty was created in modern [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]] by the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribal chieftain [[Emperor Taizu of Jin|Aguda]] in 1115. According to tradition, Aguda was a descendant of [[Hanpu]]. Aguda adopted the term for \"gold\" as the name of his state, itself a translation of \"Anchuhu\" River, which meant \"golden\" in [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]].{{sfn|Franke|1994|p=221}} This river known as Alachuke in Chinese, was a tributary of the [[Songhua River]] east of [[Harbin]].<ref>Twitchett, Franke, & Fairbank (1994), p. 221</ref> The Jurchens' early rulers were the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-led [[Liao dynasty]], which had held sway over modern [[Northern and southern China|north]] and [[Northeast China|northeast]] China and [[Mongolia]], for several centuries. Before the Jurchens overthrew the Khitan, married Jurchen women and Jurchen girls were raped by Liao Khitan envoys as a custom which caused resentment by the Jurchens against the Khitan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tillman |first1=Hoyt Cleveland |editor1-last=Tillman |editor1-first=Hoyt Cleveland |editor2-last=West |editor2-first=Stephen H. |title=China Under Jurchen Rule: Essays on Chin Intellectual and Cultural History |date=1995 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0791422739 |page=27 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdYGiGan4o8C&pg=PA27}}</ref> Song princesses committed suicide to avoid rape or were killed for resisting rape by the Jin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ebrey |first1=Patricia Buckley |title=Emperor Huizong |date=2014 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674726420 |page=468 |edition=illustrated, reprint |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XfRAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA468}}</ref> In 1121, the Jurchens entered into the [[Alliance Conducted at Sea]] with the [[Han Chinese]]-led [[Northern Song dynasty]] and agreed to jointly invade the Liao dynasty.

In 1125, after the death of Aguda, the Jin dynasty broke its alliance with the Song dynasty and invaded north China.

In 1149 he was murdered by a cabal of relatives and nobles, who made his cousin [[Wanyan Liang]] the next Jin emperor.

Wanyan Liang had to withdraw Jin troops from southern China to quell the uprisings. The Jin forces were defeated by Song forces in the [[Battle of Caishi]] and [[Battle of Tangdao]]. With a depleted military force, Wanyan Liang failed to make headway in his attempted invasion of the Southern Song dynasty.

Other Khitan and [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] cavalry units had been incorporated into the Jin army.

The [[Treaty of Longxing]] (\u9686\u8208\u548c\u8b70) was signed in 1164 and ushered in more than 40 years of peace between the two empires.\n\nIn the early 1180s, Emperor Shizong instituted a restructuring of 200 ''meng'an'' units to remove tax abuses and help Jurchens. Communal farming was encouraged. The Jin Empire prospered and had a large surplus of grain in reserve. Although learned in [[Chinese classics]], Emperor Shizong was also known as a promoter of [[Jurchen language]] and culture; during his reign, a number of Chinese classics were translated into Jurchen, the Imperial Jurchen Academy was founded, and the [[imperial examination]]s started to be offered in the Jurchen language.<ref name=tao69>Tao (1976), Chapter 6. \"The Jurchen Movement for Revival\", Pages 69\u201383.</ref> Emperor Shizong's reign (1161\u20131189) was remembered by the posterity as the time of comparative peace and prosperity, and the emperor himself was compared to the mythological rulers [[Yao (ruler)|Yao]] and [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]].<ref name=\"tao69\" />\n\nEmperor Shizong's grandson, [[Emperor Zhangzong of Jin|Emperor Zhangzong]] (r. 1189\u20131208), venerated Jurchen values, but he also immersed himself in Han Chinese culture and married an ethnic Han Chinese woman.

[[Genghis Khan]] first led the Mongols into [[Western Xia]] territory in 1205 and ravaged it four years later. In 1211 about 50,000 Mongol horsemen invaded the Jin Empire and began absorbing Khitan and Jurchen rebels. The Jin had a large army with 150,000 cavalry but abandoned the \"western capital\" [[Datong]] (see also the [[Battle of Yehuling]]). The next year the Mongols went north and looted the Jin \"eastern capital\", and in 1213 they besieged the \"central capital\", [[Zhongdu]] (present-day [[Beijing]]). In 1214 the Jin made a humiliating treaty but retained the capital. That summer, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]] abandoned the central capital and moved the government to the \"southern capital\" [[Kaifeng]], making it the official seat of the Jin dynasty's power.\n\nIn 1216, a hawkish faction in the Jin imperial court persuaded Emperor Xuanzong to attack the Song dynasty, but in 1219 they were defeated at the same place by the [[Yangtze River]] where [[Wanyan Liang]] had been defeated in 1161. The Jin dynasty now faced a two front war that they could not afford. Furthermore, [[Emperor Aizong of Jin|Emperor Aizong]] won a succession struggle against his brother and then quickly ended the war and went back to the capital. He made peace with the [[Tangut people|Tanguts]] of Western Xia, who had been allied with the Mongols.\n\nMany [[Han Chinese]] and Khitans defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin dynasty.

Groups of fifty households known as ''p'u-li-yen'' were grouped together as a ''mou-k'o'', while seven to ten ''mou-k'o'' formed a ''meng-an'', and several ''meng-an'' were grouped into a ''wanhu'', Chinese for Ten Thousand Households. This was not only a military structure but also grouped all Jurchen households for economic and administrative functions. Khitans and Han Chinese soldiers who had defected to the Jin dynasty were also assigned into their own ''meng-an''. All male members of the households were required to serve in the military; the servants of the household would serve as auxiliaries to escort their masters in battle.

Jin scholars put more emphasis on the work of northern Song scholar and poet [[Su Shi]] (1037\u20131101) than on [[Zhu Xi]]'s (1130\u20131200) scholarship, which constituted the foundation of the Learning of the Way.{{sfn|Tillman|1995|pp=71\u2013114}}\n\nA significant branch of [[Taoism]] called the [[Quanzhen School]] was founded under the Jin by [[Wang Zhe]] (1113\u20131170), a [[Han Chinese]] man who founded formal congregations in 1167 and 1168. Wang took the nickname of [[Wang Chongyang]] (Wang \"Double Yang\") and the disciples he took were retrospectively known as the \"seven patriarchs of Quanzhen\". The flourishing of [[Ci (poetry)|''ci'' poetry]] that characterized Jin literature was tightly linked to Quanzhen, as two-thirds of the ''ci'' poetry written in Jin times was composed by Quanzhen Taoists.\n\n[[File:Kin Dynasty (1115-1234) fresco in Ch'ung-fu Temple, Shuo-chou 1.jpg|thumb|Jin dynasty [[fresco]] of a [[Bodhisattva]] from Chongfu Temple (\u5d07\u798f\u5bfa), [[Shuozhou]], [[Shanxi]].]]\n\nThe Jin state sponsored an edition of the [[Taoist Canon]] that is known as the ''Precious Canon of the Mysterious Metropolis of the Great Jin'' (''Da Jin Xuandu baozang'' \u5927\u91d1\u7384\u90fd\u5bf6\u85cf). Based on a smaller version of the Canon printed by [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] (r. 1100\u20131125) of the [[Song dynasty]], it was completed in 1192 under the direction and support of [[Emperor Zhangzong]] (r. 1190\u20131208).{{sfn|Boltz|2008|p=291}} In 1188, Zhangzong's grandfather and predecessor [[Emperor Shizong of Jin|Shizong]] (r. 1161\u20131189) had ordered the woodblocks for the Song Canon transferred from Kaifeng (the former Northern Song capital that had now become the Jin \"Southern Capital\") to the Central Capital's \"Abbey of Celestial Perpetuity\" or Tianchang guan \u5929\u9577\u89c0, on the site of what is now the [[White Cloud Temple]] in [[Beijing]].{{sfn|Boltz|2008|p=291}} Other Daoist writings were also moved there from another abbey in the Central Capital.{{sfn|Boltz|2008|p=291}} Zhangzong instructed the abbey's superintendent Sun Mingdao \u5b6b\u660e\u9053 and two civil officials to prepare a complete Canon for printing.{{sfn|Boltz|2008|p=291}} After sending people on a \"nationwide search for scriptures\" (which yielded 1,074 fascicles of text that was not included in the Huizong edition of the Canon) and securing donations for printing, in 1192 Sun Mingdao proceeded to cut the new woodblocks.{{sfn|Boltz|2008|pp=291\u201392}} The final print consisted of 6,455 fascicles.{{sfn|Boltz|2008|p=292}} Though the Jin emperors occasionally offered copies of the ''Canon'' as gifts, not a single fragment of it has survived.{{sfn|Boltz|2008|p=292}}\n\nA [[Buddhist Canon]] or \"Tripitaka\" was also produced in Shanxi, the same place where an enhanced version of the Jin-sponsored Taoist Canon would be reprinted in 1244.{{sfnm|Yao|1995|1p=174|Goossaert|2008|2p=916 (both Buddhist Canon and Daoist Canon printed in Shanxi)}} The project was initiated in 1139 by a Buddhist nun named Cui Fazhen, who swore (and allegedly \"broke her arm to seal the oath\") that she would raise the necessary funds to make a new official edition of the Canon printed by the Northern Song.{{sfn|Yao|1995|p=174}} Completed in 1173, the Jin Tripitaka counted about 7,000 fascicles, \"a major achievement in the history of Buddhist private printing.\"{{sfn|Yao|1995|p=174}} It was further expanded during the Yuan.{{sfn|Yao|1995|p=174}}\n\nBuddhism thrived during the Jin, both in its relation with the imperial court and in society in general.{{sfn|Yao|1995|p=173}} Many sutras were also carved on stone tablets.{{sfn|Yao|1995|=175}} The donors who funded such [[inscription]]s included members of the Jin imperial family, high officials, common people, and Buddhist priests.{{sfn|Yao|1995|=175}} Some sutras have only survived from these carvings, which are thus highly valuable to the study of Chinese Buddhism.{{sfn|Yao|1995|=175}} At the same time, the Jin court sold monk certificates for revenue. This practice was initiated in 1162 by [[Emperor Shizong of Jin|Shizong]] to fund his wars, and stopped three years later when war was over.{{sfn|Yao|1995|p=161}} His successor Zhanzong used the same method to raise military funds in 1197 and one year later to raise money to fight famine in the Western Capital.{{sfn|Yao|1995|p=161}} The same practice was used again in 1207 (to fight the Song and more famine) as well as under the reigns of emperors [[Prince Shao of Wei|Weishao]] (r. 1209\u20131213) and [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Xuanzong]] (r. 1213\u20131224) to fight the Mongols.{{sfn|Yao|1995|pp=161\u201362}}\n\n== List of emperors == <!--linked from list of emperors of the Jin dynasty & Jurchen emperors-->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sovereigns of the Jin dynasty 1115\u20131234\n|-\n![[Temple name]]\n![[Posthumous name]]<sup>1</sup>\n!Jurchen name\n!Chinese name\n!Years of reign\n![[Chinese era name|Era name(s)]] and Years\n|-\n|[[Emperor Taizu of Jin|Taizu]] ({{zh|t=\u592a\u7956| labels=no}})\n| Wuyuan ({{zh|t=\u6b66\u5143| labels=no}})\n|Aguda ({{zh|t=\u963f\u9aa8\u6253| labels=no}})\n|Min ({{zh|t=\u65fb| labels=no}})\n|1115\u20131123\n|Shouguo ({{zh|t=\u6536\u570b| labels=no}};

After vanquishing the Liao, the Jurchen Jin launched an [[Jin\u2013Song Wars|over hundred-year struggles]] against the Chinese [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), which was based in southern China. Over the course of their rule, the Jurchens of Jin quickly [[Sinicization|adapted to Chinese customs]], and even [[History of the Great Wall of China|fortified the Great Wall]] against the rising Mongols. Domestically, the Jin oversaw a number of cultural advancements, such as the revival of [[Confucianism]].\n\nAfter spending centuries as vassals of the Jin, the Mongols invaded under Genghis Khan in 1211 and inflicted catastrophic defeats on the Jin armies. After numerous defeats, revolts, defections, and coups, they succumbed to [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Mongol conquest]] 23 years later in 1234.\n\n== Name ==\n{{Main|Names of China}}\n\nThe Jin dynasty was officially known as the \"Great Jin\" at that time.

Following the fall of Bianjing, the succeeding [[Southern Song dynasty]] continued to fight the Jin dynasty for over a decade, eventually signing the [[Treaty of Shaoxing]] in 1141, which called for the cession of all Song territories north of the [[Huai River]] to the Jin dynasty and the execution of Song general [[Yue Fei]] in return for peace.

After [[Emperor Taizong of Jin|Emperor Taizong]] died in 1135, the next three Jin emperors were grandsons of [[Emperor Taizu of Jin|Aguda]] by three different princes. [[Emperor Xizong of Jin|Emperor Xizong]] (r. 1135\u20131149) studied the classics and wrote Chinese poetry. He adopted Han Chinese cultural traditions, but the Jurchen nobles had the top positions.\n\nLater in life, Emperor Xizong became an alcoholic and executed many officials for criticising him. He also had Jurchen leaders who opposed him murdered, even those in the Wanyan clan. In 1149 he was murdered by a cabal of relatives and nobles, who made his cousin [[Wanyan Liang]] the next Jin emperor. Because of the brutality of both his domestic and foreign policy, Wanyan Liang was posthumously demoted from the position of emperor. Consequently, historians have commonly referred to him by the [[posthumous name]] \"Prince of Hailing\".<ref name=\"multiref1\">[http://www.san.beck.org/AB3-China.html#9 Ethics of China 7 BC To 1279 by Sanderson Beck<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Rebellions in the north===\nHaving usurped the throne, [[Wanyan Liang]] embarked on the program of legitimising his rule as an emperor of China. In 1153, he moved the empire's main capital from [[Huining Prefecture]] (south of present-day Harbin) to the former Liao capital, Yanjing (present-day [[Beijing]]).<ref name=\"multiref1\" /><ref name=tao44>Tao (1976), p. 44</ref> Four years later, in 1157, to emphasise the permanence of the move, he razed the nobles' residences in Huining Prefecture.<ref name=\"multiref1\" /><ref name=\"tao44\" /> Wanyan Liang also reconstructed the former Song capital, Bianjing (present-day [[Kaifeng]]), which had been sacked in 1127, making it the Jin's southern capital.<ref name=\"multiref1\" />\n\nWanyan Liang also tried to suppress dissent by killing Jurchen nobles, executing 155 princes.<ref name=\"multiref1\" /> To fulfil his dream of becoming the ruler of all China, Wanyan Liang attacked the [[Southern Song dynasty]] in 1161. Meanwhile, two simultaneous rebellions erupted in [[Balin Zuo Qi|Shangjing]], at the Jurchens' former power base: led by Wanyan Liang's cousin, soon-to-be crowned [[Emperor Shizong of Jin|Wanyan Yong]], and the other of Khitan tribesmen. Wanyan Liang had to withdraw Jin troops from southern China to quell the uprisings. The Jin forces were defeated by Song forces in the [[Battle of Caishi]] and [[Battle of Tangdao]]. With a depleted military force, Wanyan Liang failed to make headway in his attempted invasion of the Southern Song dynasty. Finally he was assassinated by his own generals in December 1161, due to his defeats. His son and heir was also assassinated in the capital.<ref name=\"multiref1\" />\n\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|China, 1142}}]]\n\nAlthough crowned in October, [[Emperor Shizong of Jin|Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong)]] was not officially recognised as emperor until the murder of Wanyan Liang's heir.<ref name=\"multiref1\" /> The Khitan uprising was not suppressed until 1164; their horses were confiscated so that the rebels had to take up farming. Other Khitan and [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] cavalry units had been incorporated into the Jin army. Because these internal uprisings had severely weakened the Jin's capacity to confront the Southern Song militarily, the Jin court under Emperor Shizong began negotiating for peace. The [[Treaty of Longxing]] (\u9686\u8208\u548c\u8b70) was signed in 1164 and ushered in more than 40 years of peace between the two empires.\n\nIn the early 1180s, Emperor Shizong instituted a restructuring of 200 ''meng'an'' units to remove tax abuses and help Jurchens. Communal farming was encouraged. The Jin Empire prospered and had a large surplus of grain in reserve. Although learned in [[Chinese classics]], Emperor Shizong was also known as a promoter of [[Jurchen language]] and culture; during his reign, a number of Chinese classics were translated into Jurchen, the Imperial Jurchen Academy was founded, and the [[imperial examination]]s started to be offered in the Jurchen language.<ref name=tao69>Tao (1976), Chapter 6. \"The Jurchen Movement for Revival\", Pages 69\u201383.</ref> Emperor Shizong's reign (1161\u20131189) was remembered by the posterity as the time of comparative peace and prosperity, and the emperor himself was compared to the mythological rulers [[Yao (ruler)|Yao]] and [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]].<ref name=\"tao69\" />\n\nEmperor Shizong's grandson, [[Emperor Zhangzong of Jin|Emperor Zhangzong]] (r. 1189\u20131208), venerated Jurchen values, but he also immersed himself in Han Chinese culture and married an ethnic Han Chinese woman. The ''[[Taihe Code of law]]'' was promulgated in 1201 and was based mostly on the [[Tang Code]]. In 1207, the Southern Song dynasty attempted an invasion, but the Jin forces effectively repulsed them. In the peace agreement, the Song dynasty had to pay higher annual indemnities and behead [[Han Tuozhou]], the leader of the hawkish faction in the Song imperial court.<ref>[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song-event.html Chinese History \u2013 Song dynasty \u5b8b event history (www.chinaknowledge.de)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=== Fall of Jin ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n[[File:Jade ornament grapes jin dynasty shanghai museum 2004 07 22.jpg|thumb|[[Jade]] ornament with flower design, Jin dynasty, [[Shanghai Museum]].]]\n\nStarting from the early 13th century, the Jin dynasty began to feel the pressure of Mongols from the north. [[Genghis Khan]] first led the Mongols into [[Western Xia]] territory in 1205 and ravaged it four years later. In 1211 about 50,000 Mongol horsemen invaded the Jin Empire and began absorbing Khitan and Jurchen rebels. The Jin had a large army with 150,000 cavalry but abandoned the \"western capital\" [[Datong]] (see also the [[Battle of Yehuling]]). The next year the Mongols went north and looted the Jin \"eastern capital\", and in 1213 they besieged the \"central capital\", [[Zhongdu]] (present-day [[Beijing]]). In 1214 the Jin made a humiliating treaty but retained the capital. That summer, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]] abandoned the central capital and moved the government to the \"southern capital\" [[Kaifeng]], making it the official seat of the Jin dynasty's power.\n\nIn 1216, a hawkish faction in the Jin imperial court persuaded Emperor Xuanzong to attack the Song dynasty, but in 1219 they were defeated at the same place by the [[Yangtze River]] where [[Wanyan Liang]] had been defeated in 1161. The Jin dynasty now faced a two front war that they could not afford. Furthermore, [[Emperor Aizong of Jin|Emperor Aizong]] won a succession struggle against his brother and then quickly ended the war and went back to the capital. He made peace with the [[Tangut people|Tanguts]] of Western Xia, who had been allied with the Mongols.\n\nMany [[Han Chinese]] and Khitans defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin dynasty.

However, due to lingering territorial disputes, the Song dynasty and the Mongols eventually went to war with one another over these territories.\n\nIn ''Empire of The Steppes'', [[Ren\u00e9 Grousset]] reports that the Mongols were always amazed at the valour of the Jurchen warriors, who held out until seven years after the death of Genghis Khan.\n\n== Military ==\nContemporary Chinese writers ascribed Jurchen success in overwhelming the Liao and Northern Song dynasties mainly to their cavalry. Already during [[Wanyan Aguda|Aguda]]'s rebellion against the Liao dynasty, all Jurchen fighters were mounted. It was said that the Jurchen cavalry tactics were a carryover from their hunting skills.<ref name=tao21>Tao (1976), Chapter 2. \"The Rise of the Chin dynasty\", Pages 21\u201324.</ref> Jurchen horsemen were provided with heavy armor; on occasions, they would use a team of horses attached to each other with chains (''[[Guaizi Ma]]'').<ref name=\"tao21\" />\n\n[[File:Serven Khaalga Jurchen inscription.jpg|thumb|right|200px|\"Great Golden Central State O-Giao Jeo-Shio\" (1196), found in now Mongolia.]]\n\nAs the Liao dynasty fell apart and the Song dynasty retreated beyond the [[Yangtze]], the army of the new Jin dynasty absorbed many soldiers who formerly fought for the Liao or Song dynasties.<ref name=tao21/> The new Jin empire adopted many of the Song military's weapons, including various machines for [[siege warfare]] and [[artillery]]. In fact, the Jin military's use of cannons, grenades, and even rockets to defend besieged [[Kaifeng]] against the Mongols in 1233 is considered the first ever battle in human history in which gunpowder was used effectively, even though it failed to prevent the eventual Jin defeat.<ref name=\"tao21\" />\n\nOn the other hand, the Jin military was not particularly good at naval warfare. Both in 1129\u201330 and in 1161 Jin forces were defeated by the [[Southern Song dynasty|Southern Song]] navies when trying to cross the Yangzi River into the core [[Southern Song dynasty|Southern Song]] territory (see [[Battle of Tangdao]] and [[Battle of Caishi]]), even though for the latter campaign the Jin had equipped a large navy of their own, using Han Chinese shipbuilders and even Han Chinese captains who had defected from the Southern Song.<ref name=\"tao21\" />\n\nIn 1130, the Jin army reached Hangzhou and [[Ningbo]] in southern China. But heavy Chinese resistance and the geography of the area halted the Jin advance, and they were forced to retreat and withdraw, and they had not been able to escape the Song navy when trying to return until they were directed by a Han Chinese defector who helped them escape in [[Zhenjiang]]. Southern China was then cleared of the Jurchen forces.<ref>{{cite book|quote=The emperor Kao-tsung had taken flight to Ningpo (then known as Mingchow) and later to the port of Wenchow, south of Chekiang.

''Meng-an'' is from the Mongol word for thousand, ''mingghan'' (see [[Military of the Yuan dynasty]]) while ''mou-k'o'' means clan or tribe. Groups of fifty households known as ''p'u-li-yen'' were grouped together as a ''mou-k'o'', while seven to ten ''mou-k'o'' formed a ''meng-an'', and several ''meng-an'' were grouped into a ''wanhu'', Chinese for Ten Thousand Households. This was not only a military structure but also grouped all Jurchen households for economic and administrative functions. Khitans and Han Chinese soldiers who had defected to the Jin dynasty were also assigned into their own ''meng-an''. All male members of the households were required to serve in the military; the servants of the household would serve as auxiliaries to escort their masters in battle. The numbers of Han Chinese soldiers in the Jin armies seemed to be very significant.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Denis C.

Wang took the nickname of [[Wang Chongyang]] (Wang \"Double Yang\") and the disciples he took were retrospectively known as the \"seven patriarchs of Quanzhen\".

The most spectacular of the tombs is that of the ''Great Overlord of [[Hare nome|the Hare (15th) Nome]]'' called [[Djehutihotep]]. He lived during the reigns of [[Amenemhat II]], [[Senusret II]] and [[Senusret III]].\n\nDeir El Bersha [[necropolis]] is near the Nile valley town of Minya, 225&nbsp;km south of Cairo.\n\n== Excavations ==\nIn the spring of 1915, the [[Harvard University]]-Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, expedition dug at Bersha. They excavated a tomb (designated number 10A) that belonged to an early Middle Kingdom nomarch named [[Djehutynakht (10A)|Djehutynakht]]. The tomb had been looted, but an enormous collection of wooden models representing scenes of daily life and boats remained. The tomb also contained the extraordinary painted coffins of Djehutynakht and his wife. The grave goods are now in the collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].\n\nIn 2007, the tomb of an Egyptian courtier was found. The tomb belonged to Henu, an estate manager and high-ranking official during the First Intermediate Period, which lasted from 2181 to 2050 BC and was a time of political chaos in ancient Egypt. The archaeologists found Henu's mummy wrapped in linen in a large wooden coffin and a sarcophagus decorated with hieroglyphic texts addressed to the gods [[Anubis]] and [[Osiris]]. The tomb contained well-preserved painted wooden statuettes of workers making bricks, women making beer and pounding cereal, and a model of a boat with rowers, Egyptian media said. (from a 2007-05-21 news article at www.chinaview.cn  )\n\nIn 2019, archaeologists revealed a 4000-year-old ancient Egyptian 'map for the soul' on two wooden panels with a mix of ancient [[hieroglyph]]s and symbols inside a sarcophagus known as the [[Coffin Texts]] at Deir El Bersha.

The most spectacular of the tombs is that of the ''Great Overlord of [[Hare nome|the Hare (15th) Nome]]'' called [[Djehutihotep]]. He lived during the reigns of [[Amenemhat II]], [[Senusret II]] and [[Senusret III]].\n\nDeir El Bersha [[necropolis]] is near the Nile valley town of Minya, 225&nbsp;km south of Cairo.\n\n== Excavations ==\nIn the spring of 1915, the [[Harvard University]]-Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, expedition dug at Bersha. They excavated a tomb (designated number 10A) that belonged to an early Middle Kingdom nomarch named [[Djehutynakht (10A)|Djehutynakht]]. The tomb had been looted, but an enormous collection of wooden models representing scenes of daily life and boats remained. The tomb also contained the extraordinary painted coffins of Djehutynakht and his wife. The grave goods are now in the collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].\n\nIn 2007, the tomb of an Egyptian courtier was found. The tomb belonged to Henu, an estate manager and high-ranking official during the First Intermediate Period, which lasted from 2181 to 2050 BC and was a time of political chaos in ancient Egypt. The archaeologists found Henu's mummy wrapped in linen in a large wooden coffin and a sarcophagus decorated with hieroglyphic texts addressed to the gods [[Anubis]] and [[Osiris]]. The tomb contained well-preserved painted wooden statuettes of workers making bricks, women making beer and pounding cereal, and a model of a boat with rowers, Egyptian media said. (from a 2007-05-21 news article at www.chinaview.cn  )\n\nIn 2019, archaeologists revealed a 4000-year-old ancient Egyptian 'map for the soul' on two wooden panels with a mix of ancient [[hieroglyph]]s and symbols inside a sarcophagus known as the [[Coffin Texts]] at Deir El Bersha.
