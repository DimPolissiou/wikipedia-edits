It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating east of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February. One of them dissipated later. Another one of them has been moving in and out of the Australian region. It was designated 06F by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]].

Blake would later make landfall in  northwestern [[Australia]] and soon degenerate afterwards. At the same time, Claudia, another tropical cyclone, formed. It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating east of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February. One of them dissipated later. Another one of them has been moving in and out of the Australian region. It was designated 06F by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]]. The third one intensified into Cyclone Damien. In late February, 2 new tropical lows formed, and were named Esther and Ferdinand. Esther didn't strengthen much, but Ferdinand went on to become a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, equivalent to a Category 2 Atlantic hurricane.\n\n== Systems ==\n=== Tropical Cyclone Blake ===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=Aus\n|Image=Blake 2020-01-06 0537Z.jpg\n|Track=Blake 2020 track.png\n|Formed=4 January\n|Dissipated=11 January\n|10-min winds=40\n|1-min winds=50\n|Pressure=986\n}}\n\nDuring 4 January, the BOM reported that Tropical Low 02U had started to develop within a monsoon trough, about 750 km (465 mi) north-northwest of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/wa/forecasts/nwcyclone.shtml|title=Western Region Tropical Cyclone Outlook|last=|first=|date=4 January 2020|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200104062353/http://www.bom.gov.au/wa/forecasts/nwcyclone.shtml|archive-date=4 January 2020|access-date=4 January 2020}}</ref> Citing considerable rotation extending into the mid [[troposphere]], well-established dual-channel [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] and warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, the JTWC assessed the system as having a moderate chance of attaining tropical cyclone intensity within the following 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/abioweb.txt|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Indian Ocean (91S)|last=|first=|date=4 January 2020|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200104063202/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/abioweb.txt|archive-date=4 January 2020|access-date=4 January 2020}}</ref> The system gradually gathered strength in the favourable environment as it tracked slowly towards the south-southwest,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDW60281.shtml|title=Tropical Low 02U Forecast Track Map #4 (00Z)|last=|first=|date=5 January 2020|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105004641/http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDW60281.shtml|archive-date=5 January 2020|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> leading the JTWC to issue a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert|tropical cyclone formation alert]] at 03:30 UTC the following day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh9120web.txt|title=Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (06S)|last=|first=|date=5 January 2020|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105065010/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh9120web.txt|archive-date=5 January 2020|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> The BOM indicated that sustained [[Beaufort scale|gale-force]] winds had developed on the western side of the tropical low at 15:00 UTC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDW60281.shtml|title=Tropical Low 02U Forecast Track Map #8 (15Z)|last=|first=|date=5 January 2020|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105160308/http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDW60281.shtml|archive-date=5 January 2020|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> and the system was designated as Tropical Cyclone 06S by the JTWC a few hours later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh0620web.txt|title=Tropical Cyclone 06S Warning #1 (18Z)|last=|first=|date=5 January 2020|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105215539/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh0620web.txt|archive-date=5 January 2020|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Gales fully encircled the system by 00:00 UTC on 6 January, prompting the BOM to upgrade the low to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|Australian scale]], the first of the season.

At the same time, the Bank of India was permitted to treat those credits as assets against which it could print currency up to two and a half times more than the total debt incurred.

The \"test\" aspect arose because there was an assumption that if relatively large numbers of people took the offer, that indicated that famine conditions were prevalent.{{sfn|J. Mukherjee |2015 |p=29 }}  Agricultural loans offered no assistance to the large numbers of rural poor who had little or no land.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=553}} Grain relief was divided between cheap grain shops and the open market, with far more going to the markets. Supplying grain to the markets was intended to lower grain prices,{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=545}} but in practice gave little help to the rural poor, instead placing them into direct purchasing competition with wealthier Bengalis at greatly inflated prices.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=559}} Thus from the beginning of the crisis until around August 1943, private charity was the principal form of relief available to the very poor.{{sfn|A.

Moreover, the urban middle-class were their overriding concern, not the rural poor. They were also expecting the Government of India to rescue Bengal by bringing food in from outside the province (350,000 tons had been promised but not delivered).

A key source of impoverishment was the widespread coping strategy of selling assets, including land.  In 1943 alone in one village in east Bengal, for example,  54 out of a total of 168 families sold all or part of their landholdings; among these, 39 (or very nearly 3 out of 4) did so as a coping strategy in reaction to the scarcity of food.{{sfn| \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2009|p=172}} As the famine wore on across Bengal, nearly 1.6 million families&nbsp;\u2013 roughly one-quarter of all landholders&nbsp;\u2013 sold or mortgaged their paddy lands in whole or in part.

The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A.

This misunderstanding led to a wholly misguided emphasis on measuring non-existent food shortages rather than addressing the very real and devastating inflation-driven imbalances in exchange entitlements.{{sfn|A. Sen|1977|pp=52\u201353}} In stark contrast, though Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da notes that the exchange entitlements view of this famine is generally accepted,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015|p=90|quote=The 1943\u201344 famine has become paradigmatic as an 'entitlements famine,' whereby speculation born of greed and panic produced an 'artificial' shortage of rice, the staple food.}} he lends greater weight to the importance of a crop shortfall than does Sen, and goes on to largely reject Sen's emphasis on hoarding and speculation.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1y=2008|1pp=25\u201328|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2015|2p=90}} He does not stop there, however, but emphasises a \"lack of political will\" and the pressure of wartime priorities that drove the British government and the provincial government of Bengal to make fateful decisions: the \"denial policies\", the use of heavy shipping for war supplies rather than food, the refusal to officially declare a state of famine, and the [[Balkanization|Balkanisation]] of grain markets through inter-provincial trade barriers.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |1y=2015|1p=90|1ps=&nbsp;\"...the lack of political will to divert foodstuffs from the war effort rather than [market] speculation... was mainly responsible for the famine\"|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008|2pp=20, 33}} On this view, these policies were designed to serve British military goals at the expense of Indian interests,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|pp=190\u2013191}} reflecting the War Cabinet's willingness to \"supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wavell|1y=1973|1pp= 68, 122|2a1=S.

Mukherjee |2015|pp=251\u2013252}} The policies may have met their intended wartime goals, but only at the cost of large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.

They sought the truth rather than evidence in favour of their [own] hypotheses.

In his account, Bengal was at base susceptible to famine because of population pressures and market inefficiencies, and these were exacerbated by a dire combination of war, political strife, and natural causes.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=138}} Above all else, however, direct blame should be laid on a series of government interventions that disrupted the wholesale rice market.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=262}} Once the crisis began, morbidity rates were driven by a series of cultural decisions, as dependents were abandoned by their providers at every level of society: male heads of peasant households abandoned weaker family members; landholders abandoned the various forms of patronage that (according to Greenough) had traditionally been maintained, and the government abandoned the rural poor. These abandoned groups had been socially and politically selected for death.{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough |1y=1982 | 1pp=261\u2013275|2a1=S.

The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1977|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1981a}} in describing the Bengal famine of 1943 as an \"entitlements famine\". On this view, the prelude to the famine was generalised war-time inflation, and the problem was exacerbated by prioritised distribution and abortive attempts at price control,{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough|1y=1982|1pp=127\u2013138|2a1=A.

The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.

They sought the truth rather than evidence in favour of their [own] hypotheses.

In his account, Bengal was at base susceptible to famine because of population pressures and market inefficiencies, and these were exacerbated by a dire combination of war, political strife, and natural causes.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=138}} Above all else, however, direct blame should be laid on a series of government interventions that disrupted the wholesale rice market.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=262}} Once the crisis began, morbidity rates were driven by a series of cultural decisions, as dependents were abandoned by their providers at every level of society: male heads of peasant households abandoned weaker family members; landholders abandoned the various forms of patronage that (according to Greenough) had traditionally been maintained, and the government abandoned the rural poor. These abandoned groups had been socially and politically selected for death.{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough |1y=1982 | 1pp=261\u2013275|2a1=S.
