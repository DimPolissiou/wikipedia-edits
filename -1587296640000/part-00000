Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in [[Hindu temples]]' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation.

Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth.\n\nThe empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at [[Hampi]]. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in [[Hindu temples]]' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Sanskrit]], while [[Carnatic music]] evolved into its current form.

Jagannath]] in lead and supporting roles.<ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/sep-08-04/directors-26-09-08.html</ref> The film, scored by [[Sabesh-Murali]] and filmed by Balabharani, was released on 5 June 2009, going on to become successful at the [[box office]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in the backdrop of a village near Usilampatti, in Madurai district. Mayandi ([[Manivannan]]) and Virumandi ([[G. M. Kumar]]) are siblings with disputes over settling their properties. Mayandi insists giving a portion of their ancestral properties to their stepsister, for which Virumandi does not agree. This creates enmity in Virumandi and his sons against Mayandi and his family.\n\nMayandi has four sons - Thavasi ([[Ponvannan]]), Virumandi ([[Seeman (director)|Seeman]]), Cheenisamy ([[K. P. Jagannath]]) and Paraman ([[Tarun Gopi]]) - and one daughter - Mayakka (Deepa Shankar). All the sons except Paraman marry, and they live as a joint family. Paraman falls in love with his schoolmate Poongodi (Poongodi). He gets admission into engineering, and Mayandi sells a portion of his land to pay fees for Paraman. This angers the wives of Thavasi and Virumandi. They keep insisting on partitioning the properties between four sons, thinking that Mayandi is spending more for the education of Paraman, while the other three sons are not educated properly. However, Paraman\u2019s brothers are actually so affectionate towards him, and they prefer staying together. Suddenly, Mayandi passes away due to an electric shock when he steps over a wire unknowingly. Now, the wives of Thavasi and Virumandi again keep insisting on doing the property partition. Their plan gets executed: the properties get partitioned into three, leaving Paraman as his portion was already sold by Mayandi to pay the college fees.\n\nParaman could not bear his father\u2019s death, and Poongodi shows affection to him. Poongodi gets admission into Madras Medical College, and she leaves to Chennai for education, though she keeps talking to Paraman regularly on the phone. Paraman continues his engineering course while he is considered as a burden by his sisters-in-law. However, his brothers take care of him. One day, Thavasi\u2019s wife falls sick, and she needs blood urgently. As it is a rare group, it becomes difficult. Paraman informs this to his friends in college, and his friends come for rescue. Thavasi\u2019s wife is saved, and she realizes her mistake and feels bad for ill-treating Paraman despite which he helped her in a timely manner.\n\nParaman secures a job through campus placement, and his living condition improves. One day, he gets shocked to see Poongodi in a bus stop along with her husband and a baby. Paraman cries upon thinking that Poongodi has betrayed him. However, Poongodi tells a flashback that her \"husband\" is actually her relative who lost his leg in an accident on the day of the marriage, following which the marriage gets cancelled. Now, her parents request Poongodi to marry the groom as it would be an insult for the entire family due to a cancelled marriage. Poongodi, though not interested, accepts for the sake of her family\u2019s wishes. Still, she kept calling Paraman over the phone in the usual manner so that he will not get broken and instead will concentrate on studies. Knowing the truth, Paraman feels happy about Poongodi\u2019s kind heart and her sacrifice for the welfare of her family.\n\nFinally, Paraman meets Virumandi and cries to him to lead a joint life along with everyone. He also wins the heart of Virumandi and his sons also and marries his aunt's daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Manivannan]] as Mayandi\n* [[Ponvannan]] as Thavasi Mayandi (Mayandi's son)\n* [[Seeman (director)|Seeman]] as Virumandi Mayandi (Mayandi's son)\n* [[K.

Jagannath]] in lead and supporting roles.<ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/sep-08-04/directors-26-09-08.html</ref> The film, scored by [[Sabesh-Murali]] and filmed by Balabharani, was released on 5 June 2009, going on to become successful at the [[box office]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in the backdrop of a village near Usilampatti, in Madurai district. Mayandi ([[Manivannan]]) and Virumandi ([[G. M. Kumar]]) are siblings with disputes over settling their properties. Mayandi insists giving a portion of their ancestral properties to their stepsister, for which Virumandi does not agree. This creates enmity in Virumandi and his sons against Mayandi and his family.\n\nMayandi has four sons - Thavasi ([[Ponvannan]]), Virumandi ([[Seeman (director)|Seeman]]), Cheenisamy ([[K. P. Jagannath]]) and Paraman ([[Tarun Gopi]]) - and one daughter - Mayakka (Deepa Shankar). All the sons except Paraman get married, and they live as a joint family. Paraman falls in love with his schoolmate Poongodi (Poongodi). He gets admission into engineering, and Mayandi sells a portion of his land to pay fees for Paraman. This angers the wives of Thavasi and Virumandi. They keep insisting on partitioning the properties between four sons, thinking that Mayandi is spending more for the education of Paraman, while the other three sons are not educated properly. However, Paraman\u2019s brothers are actually so affectionate towards him, and they prefer staying together. Suddenly, Mayandi passes away due to an electric shock when he steps over a wire unknowingly. Now, the wives of Thavasi and Virumandi again keep insisting on doing the property partition. Their plan gets executed: the properties get partitioned into three, leaving Paraman as his portion was already sold by Mayandi to pay the college fees.\n\nParaman could not bear his father\u2019s death, and Poongodi shows affection to him. Poongodi gets admission into Madras Medical College, and she leaves to Chennai for education, though she keeps talking to Paraman regularly on the phone. Paraman continues his engineering course while he is considered as a burden by his sisters-in-law. However, his brothers take care of him. One day, Thavasi\u2019s wife falls sick, and she needs blood urgently. As it is a rare group, it becomes difficult. Paraman informs this to his friends in college, and his friends come for rescue. Thavasi\u2019s wife is saved, and she realizes her mistake and feels bad for ill-treating Paraman despite which he helped her in a timely manner.\n\nParaman secures a job through campus placement, and his living condition improves. One day, he gets shocked to see Poongodi in a bus stop along with her husband and a baby. Paraman cries upon thinking that Poongodi has betrayed him. However, Poongodi tells a flashback that her \"husband\" is actually her relative who lost his leg in an accident on the day of the marriage, following which the marriage gets cancelled. Now, her parents request Poongodi to marry the groom as it would be an insult for the entire family due to a cancelled marriage. Poongodi, though not interested, accepts for the sake of her family\u2019s wishes. Still, she kept calling Paraman over the phone in the usual manner so that he will not get broken and instead will concentrate on studies. Knowing the truth, Paraman feels happy about Poongodi\u2019s kind heart and her sacrifice for the welfare of her family.\n\nFinally, Paraman meets Virumandi and cries to him to lead a joint life along with everyone. He also wins the heart of Virumandi and his sons also and gets married to his aunt's daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Manivannan]] as Mayandi\n* [[Ponvannan]] as Thavasi Mayandi (Mayandi's son)\n* [[Seeman (director)|Seeman]] as Virumandi Mayandi (Mayandi's son)\n* [[K.
