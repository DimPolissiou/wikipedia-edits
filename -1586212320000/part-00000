Surfactants may act as [[detergent]]s, [[wetting]] agents, [[emulsion#Emulsifiers|emulsifiers]], [[foaming agent]]s, and [[dispersant]]s.\n\n{{toc limit|4}}\n\n==Etymology and definition==\n{{wikt | surfactant}}\nThe word ''surfactant'' is a [[Blend word|blend]] of ''surface-active agent''.<ref name=\"Rosen MJ\">\n{{Cite book\n |vauthors= Rosen MJ, Kunjappu JT |lastauthoramp= yes\n |title= Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena\n |edition= 4th |year= 2012\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1rCdNIzB78AC&printsec=frontcover\n |isbn= 978-1-118-22902-6 |location= Hoboken, New Jersey\n |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |page= 1 |url-status= live\n |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170108051750/https://books.google.com/books?id=1rCdNIzB78AC&printsec=frontcover\n |archive-date= 8 January 2017 |df= dmy-all \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[United States National Library of Medicine]]'s [[Medical Subject Headings |Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)]] vocabulary reserves ''surfactant'' for the meaning \"[[pulmonary surfactant]]\". For the more general meaning, ''surface active agent/s'' is the heading.\n\n[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&nbsp;\u2013 the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] \"heads\" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\"emulsion breaking\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes{{when|date=February 2019}} known as a reverse micelle.]]\n\n==Composition and structure==\nSurfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').<ref name=\"The Lipid Chronicles\">{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|access-date=1 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archive-date=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}</ref> Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.\n\nWorld production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Classification==\nThe \"tails\" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].\n\nDetergents have also been used to decellularise organs.

Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Classification==\nThe \"tails\" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant.

In respiratory distress syndrome or RDS [[Pulmonary surfactant (medication)|surfactant replacement]] therapy helps patients have normal respiration by using pharmaceutical forms of the surfactants. One example of pharmaceutical pulmonary surfactants is Survanta ([[beractant]]) or its generic form Beraksurf produced by [[AbbVie Inc.|Abbvie]] and [[Tekzima]] respectively. [[Bile salts]] play important role in digestion.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2010.12.002|pmid=21236400|title=The role of bile salts in digestion|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=165|issue=1|pages=36\u201346|year=2011|last1=Maldonado-Valderrama|first1=Julia|last2=Wilde|first2=Pete|last3=MacIerzanka|first3=Adam|last4=MacKie|first4=Alan}}</ref>\n\n== Safety and environmental risks ==\nMost anionic and non-ionic surfactants are nontoxic, having [[LD50]] comparable to sodium chloride. The toxicity of [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium compounds]], which are [[antibacterial]] and [[antifungal]], varies. Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides ([[DDAC]], [[DSDMAC]]) used as [[fabric softener]]s have low [[LD50]] (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the [[disinfectant]] alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the [[lipid membrane]] that protects skin and other cells. Skin irritancy generally increases in the series non-ionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic surfactants.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nSurfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process or as industrial and household waste.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins.

{"title_page": "Network switching subsystem", "text_new": "{{Short description|Component of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)}}\n{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2019}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}\n'''Network switching subsystem'''  ('''NSS''') (or '''GSM core network''') is the component of a [[GSM]] system that carries out [[telephone exchange|call out]] and [[mobility management]] functions for [[mobile phones]] [[roaming]] on the [[Base Station subsystem|network of base stations]]. It is owned and deployed by [[mobile phone operator]]s and allows mobile devices to communicate with each other and [[telephone]]s in the wider [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.abcofnetworks.com/2019/10/Gsm-Architecture.html|title=The A - Z Guide Of GSM ARCHITECTURE|last=Networks|first=Editor ABC of|website=ABC of Networks|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> The architecture contains specific features and functions which are needed because the phones are not fixed in one location.\n\nThe NSS originally consisted of the circuit-switched [[core network]], used for traditional [[GSM services]] such as voice calls, [[Short message service|SMS]], and [[Circuit Switched Data|circuit switched data]] calls. It was extended with an overlay architecture to provide packet-switched data services known as the [[GPRS core network]]. This allows mobile phones to have access to services such as [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] and the [[Internet]].\n\n==Mobile switching center (MSC)==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Short message service]] -->\n\n===Description===\nThe JNM '''mobile switching center''' (MSC) is the primary service delivery node for GSM/CDMA, responsible for [[routing in the PSTN|routing]] voice calls and SMS as well as other services (such as conference calls, FAX, and circuit-switched data).\n\nThe MSC sets up and releases the '''end-to-end connection''', handles mobility and hand-over requirements during the call and takes care of charging and real-time prepaid account monitoring.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the GSM mobile phone system, in contrast with earlier analogue services, fax and data information is sent digitally encoded directly to the MSC. Only at the MSC is this re-coded into an \"analogue\" signal (although actually this will almost certainly mean sound is encoded digitally as a [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) signal in a 64-kbit/s timeslot, known as a [[DS0]] in America).\n\nThere are various different names for MSCs in different contexts which reflects their complex role in the network, all of these terms though could refer to the same MSC, but doing different things at different times.\n\nThe '''gateway MSC''' (G-MSC) is the MSC that determines which \"visited MSC\" (V-MSC) the subscriber who is being called is currently located at. It also interfaces with the PSTN. All mobile to mobile calls and PSTN to mobile calls are routed through a G-MSC. The term is only valid in the context of one call, since any MSC may provide both the gateway function and the visited MSC function. However, some manufacturers design dedicated high capacity MSCs which do not have any [[base station subsystem]]s (BSS) connected to them. These MSCs will then be the gateway MSC for many of the calls they handle.\n\nThe '''visited MSC''' (V-MSC) is the MSC where a customer is currently located. The [[Network_switching_subsystem#Visitor_location_register_(VLR)|visitor location register]] (VLR) associated with this MSC will have the subscriber's data in it.\n\nThe '''anchor MSC''' is the MSC from which a [[handover]] has been initiated. The '''target MSC''' is the MSC toward which a handover should take place. A [[mobile switching center server]] is a part of the redesigned MSC concept starting from [[3GPP#Standards|3GPP Release 4]].\n\n===Mobile switching center server (MSC-Server, MSCS or MSS)===\n{{main article|Mobile switching centre server}}\n\nThe '''mobile switching center server''' is a soft-switch variant (therefore it may be referred to as mobile soft switch, MSS) of the mobile switching center, which provides circuit-switched calling mobility management, and GSM services to the mobile phones [[roaming]] within the area that it serves. The functionality enables split control between (signaling ) and user plane (bearer in network element called as media gateway/MG), which guarantees better placement of network elements within the network.\n\nMSS and [[Media Gateway|media gateway]] (MGW) makes it possible to cross-connect circuit-switched calls switched by using IP, ATM AAL2 as well as [[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]]. More information is available in 3GPP TS 23.205.\n\nThe term [[Circuit switching]] (CS) used here originates from traditional telecommunications systems. However, modern MSS and MGW devices mostly use generic [[Internet]] technologies and form [[Next-generation network|next-generation telecommunication networks]]. MSS software may run on generic computers or [[virtual machine]]s in [[Cloud computing|cloud]] environment.\n\n===Other GSM core network elements connected to the MSC===\nThe MSC connects to the following elements:\n* The [[Network switching subsystem#Home location register (HLR)|home location register]] (HLR) for obtaining data about the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] and [[MSISDN|mobile services ISDN]] number (MSISDN; i.e., the telephone number).\n* The [[Base Station Subsystem|base station subsystems]] (BSS) which handles the radio communication with [[2G]] and [[2.5G]] mobile phones.\n* The [[UTRAN|UMTS terrestrial radio access network]] (UTRAN) which handles the radio communication with [[3G]] mobile phones.\n* The [[Network switching subsystem#Visitor location register (VLR)|visitor location register]] (VLR) provides subscriber information when the subscriber is outside its home network.\n* Other MSCs for procedures such as [[handoff|hand over]].\n\n===Procedures implemented===\nTasks of the MSC include:\n* [[GSM services#Call set up process for incoming calls|Delivering calls to subscribers]] as they arrive based on information from the VLR.\n* Connecting outgoing calls to other mobile subscribers or the PSTN.\n* Delivering SMSs from subscribers to the [[short message service center]] (SMSC) and vice versa.\n* Arranging handovers from BSC to BSC.\n* Carrying out handovers from this MSC to another.\n* Supporting [[supplementary services]] such as conference calls or call hold.\n* Generating billing information.\n\n==Home location register (HLR) {{anchor|HLR}}==\nThe '''home location register''' (HLR) is a central database that contains details of each mobile phone subscriber that is authorized to use the GSM core network. There can be several logical, and physical, HLRs per [[Public Land Mobile Network|public land mobile network]] (PLMN), though one [[international mobile subscriber identity]] (IMSI)/MSISDN pair can be associated with only one logical HLR (which can span several physical nodes) at a time<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nThe HLRs store details of every [[SIM card]] issued by the mobile phone operator. Each SIM has a unique identifier called an IMSI which is the [[primary key]] to each HLR record.\n\nAnother important item of data associated with the SIM are the MSISDNs, which are the [[telephone number]]s used by mobile phones to make and receive calls.  The primary MSISDN is the number used for making and receiving voice calls and SMS, but it is possible for a SIM to have other secondary MSISDNs associated with it for [[fax]] and data calls. Each MSISDN is also a [[unique key]] to the HLR record. The HLR data is stored for as long as a subscriber remains with the mobile phone operator.\n\nExamples of other data stored in the HLR against an IMSI record is:\n* GSM services that the subscriber has requested or been given.\n* [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS) settings to allow the subscriber to access packet services.\n* Current location of subscriber (VLR and [[SGSN|serving GPRS support node]]/SGSN).\n* [[Call forwarding|Call divert]] settings applicable for each associated MSISDN.\n\nThe HLR is a system which directly receives and processes [[Mobile Application Part|MAP]] transactions and messages from elements in the GSM network, for example, the location update messages received as mobile phones roam around.\n\n===Other GSM core network elements connected to the HLR===\nThe HLR connects to the following elements:\n* The G-MSC for handling incoming calls\n* The VLR for handling requests from mobile phones to attach to the network\n* The SMSC for handling incoming SMSs\n* The [[voice mail]] system for delivering notifications to the mobile phone that a message is waiting\n* The AuC for authentication and ciphering and exchange of data (triplets)\n\n===Procedures implemented===\nThe main function of the HLR is to manage the fact that SIMs and phones move around a lot. The following procedures are implemented to deal with this:\n* Manage the mobility of subscribers by means of updating their position in administrative areas called 'location areas', which are identified with a LAC. The action of a user of moving from one LA to another is followed by the HLR with a Location area update procedure.\n* Send the subscriber data to a VLR or SGSN when a subscriber first roams there.\n* Broker between the G-MSC or SMSC and the subscriber's current VLR in order to allow [[GSM services#Call set up process for incoming calls|incoming calls or text messages to be delivered]].\n* Remove subscriber data from the previous VLR when a subscriber has roamed away from it.\n* Responsible for all SRI related queries (i.e. for invoke SRI, HLR should give sack SRI or SRI reply).\n\n=={{anchor|AuC}} Authentication center (AuC)==\n\n===Description===\nThe '''authentication center''' (AuC) is a function to [[authentication|authenticate]] each [[SIM card]] that attempts to connect to the '''gsm''' core network (typically when the phone is powered on). Once the authentication is successful, the HLR is allowed to manage the SIM and services described above. An [[encryption key]] is also generated that is subsequently used to encrypt all wireless communications (voice, SMS, etc.) between the mobile phone and the GSM core network.\n\nIf the authentication fails, then no services are possible from that particular combination of SIM card and mobile phone operator attempted. There is an additional form of identification check performed on the serial number of the mobile phone described in the EIR section below, but this is not relevant to the AuC processing.\n\nProper implementation of security in and around the AuC is a key part of an operator's strategy to avoid [[SIM cloning]].\n\nThe AuC does not engage directly in the authentication process, but instead generates data known as ''triplets'' for the MSC to use during the procedure.  The security of the process depends upon a [[shared secret]] between the AuC and the SIM called the ''K<sub>i</sub>''. The ''K<sub>i</sub>'' is securely burned into the SIM during manufacture and is also securely replicated onto the AuC. This ''K<sub>i</sub>'' is never transmitted between the AuC and SIM, but is combined with the IMSI to produce a challenge/response for identification purposes and an encryption key called ''K<sub>c</sub>'' for use in over the air communications.\n\n===Other GSM core network elements connected to the AuC===\nThe AuC connects to the following elements:\n* The MSC which requests a new batch of triplet data for an IMSI after the previous data have been used. This ensures that same keys and challenge responses are not used twice for a particular mobile.\n\n===Procedures implemented===\nThe AuC stores the following data for each IMSI:\n* the ''K<sub>i</sub>''\n* Algorithm id. (the standard algorithms are called A3 or A8, but an operator may choose a proprietary one).\n\nWhen the MSC asks the AuC for a new set of triplets for a particular IMSI, the AuC first generates a random number known as ''RAND''. This ''RAND'' is then combined with the ''K<sub>i</sub>'' to produce two numbers as follows:\n* The ''K<sub>i</sub>'' and ''RAND'' are fed into the A3 algorithm and the signed response (SRES) is calculated.\n* The ''K<sub>i</sub>'' and ''RAND'' are fed into the A8 algorithm and a session key called ''K<sub>c</sub>'' is calculated.\nThe numbers (''RAND'', SRES, ''K<sub>c</sub>'') form the triplet sent back to the MSC. When a particular IMSI requests access to the GSM core network, the MSC sends the ''RAND'' part of the triplet to the SIM. The SIM then feeds this number and the ''K<sub>i</sub>'' (which is burned onto the SIM) into the A3 algorithm as appropriate and an SRES is calculated and sent back to the MSC. If this SRES matches with the SRES in the triplet (which it should if it is a valid SIM), then the mobile is allowed to attach and proceed with GSM services.\n\nAfter successful authentication, the MSC sends the encryption key ''K<sub>c</sub>'' to the [[Base Station Subsystem#Base station controller|base station controller]] (BSC) so that all communications can be encrypted and decrypted. Of course, the mobile phone can generate the ''K<sub>c</sub>'' itself by feeding the same RAND supplied during authentication and the ''K<sub>i</sub>'' into the A8 algorithm.\n\nThe AuC is usually collocated with the HLR, although this is not necessary. Whilst the procedure is secure for most everyday use, it is by no means hack proof. Therefore, a new set of security methods was designed for 3G phones.\n\nA3 Algorithm is used to encrypt Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cellular communications. In practice, A3 and A8 algorithms are generally implemented together (known as A3/A8, see [[COMP128]]). An A3/A8 algorithm is implemented in Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards and in GSM network Authentication Centers. It is used to authenticate the customer and generate a key for encrypting voice and data traffic, as defined in 3GPP TS 43.020 (03.20 before Rel-4). Development of A3 and A8 algorithms is considered a matter for individual GSM network operators, although example implementations are available.\n\n==Visitor location register (VLR)==<!-- inbound links -->\n\n===Description===\nThe '''Visitor Location Register (VLR)''' is a database of the MSs ([[Mobile station]]s) that have roamed into the jurisdiction of the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) which it serves. Each main [[Base Transceiver Station|base station]] in the network is served by exactly one VLR (one [[Base transceiver station|BTS]] may be served by many MSCs in case of MSC in pool), hence a subscriber cannot be present in more than one VLR at a time.\n\nThe data stored in the VLR has either been received from the [[Network_switching_subsystem#Home_location_register_.28HLR.29|'''Home Location Register (HLR)''']], or collected from the MS. In practice, for performance reasons, most vendors integrate the VLR directly to the V-MSC and, where this is not done, the VLR is very tightly linked with the MSC via a proprietary interface. Whenever an MSC detects a new MS in its network, in addition to creating a new record in the VLR, it also updates the HLR of the mobile subscriber, apprising it of the new location of that MS. If VLR data is corrupted it can lead to serious issues with text messaging and call services.\n\nData stored include:  \n* [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] (the subscriber's identity number).\n* Authentication data.\n* MSISDN (the subscriber's phone number).\n* GSM services that the subscriber is allowed to access.\n* [[GPRS Access Points|access point (GPRS)]] subscribed.\n* The HLR address of the subscriber.\n* SCP Address(For Prepaid Subscriber).\n\n===Procedures implemented===\nThe primary functions of the VLR are:\n* To inform the HLR that a subscriber has arrived in the particular area covered by the VLR.\n* To track where the subscriber is within the VLR area (location area) when no call is ongoing.\n* To allow or disallow which services the subscriber may use.\n* To allocate roaming numbers during the processing of incoming calls.\n* To purge the subscriber record if a subscriber becomes inactive whilst in the area of a VLR. The VLR deletes the subscriber's data after a fixed time period of inactivity and informs the HLR (e.g., when the phone has been switched off and left off or when the subscriber has moved to an area with no coverage for a long time).\n* To delete the subscriber record when a subscriber explicitly moves to another, as instructed by the HLR.\n\n==Equipment identity register (EIR)==\nThe '''[[Central Equipment Identity Register|equipment identity register]]''' is often integrated to the HLR. The EIR keeps a list of mobile phones (identified by their [[IMEI]]) which are to be banned from the network or monitored. This is designed to allow tracking of stolen mobile phones. In theory all data about all stolen mobile phones should be distributed to all EIRs in the world through a Central EIR. It is clear, however, that there are some countries where this is not in operation. The EIR data does not have to change in real time, which means that this function can be less distributed than the function of the HLR. The EIR is a database that contains information about the identity of the mobile equipment that prevents calls from stolen, unauthorized or defective mobile stations. Some EIR also have the capability to log Handset attempts and store it in a log file.\n\n==Other support functions==\nConnected more or less directly to the GSM core network are many other functions.\n\n===Billing center (BC)===\nThe '''billing center''' is responsible for processing the toll tickets generated by the VLRs and HLRs and generating a bill for each subscriber. It is also responsible for generating billing data of roaming subscriber.\n\n===Multimedia messaging service center (MMSC)===\nThe '''[[multimedia messaging service]] center''' supports the sending of multimedia messages (e.g., images, [[Sound|audio]], [[video]] and their combinations) to (or from) MMS-bluetooth.\n\n===Voicemail system (VMS)===\nThe '''[[voicemail]] system''' records and stores voicemail. which may have to pay\n\n===Lawful interception functions===\n{{main|Lawful interception}}\nAccording to U.S. law, which has also been copied into many other countries, especially in Europe, all telecommunications equipment must provide facilities for monitoring the calls of selected users. There must be some level of support for this built into any of the different elements. The concept of ''lawful interception'' is also known, following the relevant U.S. law, as [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]].\nGenerally, lawful Interception implementation is similar to the implementation of conference call. While A and B are talking with each other, C can join the call and listen silently.\n\n==See also==\n* The GSM core network.\n* Base station subsystem\n*COM 128\n*4GLET \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* 4GLET - the standardisation body for GSM and UMTS\n* [http://www.elektroda.pl/rtvforum/download.php?id=338749 UMTS Networks: Protocols, Terminology and Implementation] - a PDF eBook by Gunnar Heine\n{{Mobile telecommunications standards}}\n\n[[Category:GSM standard]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications infrastructure]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Component of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)}}\n{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2019}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}\n'''Network switching subsystem'''  ('''NSS''') (or '''GSM core network''') is the component of a [[GSM]] system that carries out [[telephone exchange|call out]] and [[mobility management]] functions for [[mobile phones]] [[roaming]] on the [[Base Station subsystem|network of base stations]]. It is owned and deployed by [[mobile phone operator]]s and allows mobile devices to communicate with each other and [[telephone]]s in the wider [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.abcofnetworks.com/2019/10/Gsm-Architecture.html|title=The A - Z Guide Of GSM ARCHITECTURE|last=Networks|first=Editor ABC of|website=ABC of Networks|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> The architecture contains specific features and functions which are needed because the phones are not fixed in one location.\n\nThe NSS originally consisted of the circuit-switched [[core network]], used for traditional [[GSM services]] such as voice calls, [[Short message service|SMS]], and [[Circuit Switched Data|circuit switched data]] calls. It was extended with an overlay architecture to provide packet-switched data services known as the [[GPRS core network]]. This allows mobile phones to have access to services such as [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] and the [[Internet]].\n\n==Mobile switching center (MSC)==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Short message service]] -->\n\n===Description===\nThe JNM '''mobile switching center''' (MSC) is the primary service delivery node for GSM/CDMA, responsible for [[routing in the PSTN|routing]] voice calls and SMS as well as other services (such as conference calls, FAX, and circuit-switched data).\n\nThe MSC sets up and releases the '''end-to-end connection''', handles mobility and hand-over requirements during the call and takes care of charging and real-time prepaid account monitoring.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the GSM mobile phone system, in contrast with earlier analogue services, fax and data information is sent digitally encoded directly to the MSC. Only at the MSC is this re-coded into an \"analogue\" signal (although actually this will almost certainly mean sound is encoded digitally as a [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) signal in a 64-kbit/s timeslot, known as a [[DS0]] in America).\n\nThere are various different names for MSCs in different contexts which reflects their complex role in the network, all of these terms though could refer to the same MSC, but doing different things at different times.\n\nThe '''gateway MSC''' (G-MSC) is the MSC that determines which \"visited MSC\" (V-MSC) the subscriber who is being called is currently located at. It also interfaces with the PSTN. All mobile to mobile calls and PSTN to mobile calls are routed through a G-MSC. The term is only valid in the context of one call, since any MSC may provide both the gateway function and the visited MSC function. However, some manufacturers design dedicated high capacity MSCs which do not have any [[base station subsystem]]s (BSS) connected to them. These MSCs will then be the gateway MSC for many of the calls they handle.\n\nThe '''visited MSC''' (V-MSC) is the MSC where a customer is currently located. The [[Network_switching_subsystem#Visitor_location_register_(VLR)|visitor location register]] (VLR) associated with this MSC will have the subscriber's data in it.\n\nThe '''anchor MSC''' is the MSC from which a [[handover]] has been initiated. The '''target MSC''' is the MSC toward which a handover should take place. A [[mobile switching center server]] is a part of the redesigned MSC concept starting from [[3GPP#Standards|3GPP Release 4]].\n\n===Mobile switching center server (MSC-Server, MSCS or MSS)===\n{{main article|Mobile switching centre server}}\n\nThe '''mobile switching center server''' is a soft-switch variant (therefore it may be referred to as mobile soft switch, MSS) of the mobile switching center, which provides circuit-switched calling mobility management, and GSM services to the mobile phones [[roaming]] within the area that it serves. The functionality enables split control between (signaling ) and user plane (bearer in network element called as media gateway/MG), which guarantees better placement of network elements within the network.\n\nMSS and [[Media Gateway|media gateway]] (MGW) makes it possible to cross-connect circuit-switched calls switched by using IP, ATM AAL2 as well as [[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]]. More information is available in 3GPP TS 23.205.\n\nThe term [[Circuit switching]] (CS) used here originates from traditional telecommunications systems. However, modern MSS and MGW devices mostly use generic [[Internet]] technologies and form [[Next-generation network|next-generation telecommunication networks]]. MSS software may run on generic computers or [[virtual machine]]s in [[Cloud computing|cloud]] environment.\n\n===Other GSM core network elements connected to the MSC===\nThe MSC connects to the following elements:\n* The [[Network switching subsystem#Home location register (HLR)|home location register]] (HLR) for obtaining data about the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] and [[MSISDN|mobile services ISDN]] number (MSISDN; i.e., the telephone number).\n* The [[Base Station Subsystem|base station subsystems]] (BSS) which handles the radio communication with [[2G]] and [[2.5G]] mobile phones.\n* The [[UTRAN|UMTS terrestrial radio access network]] (UTRAN) which handles the radio communication with [[3G]] mobile phones.\n* The [[Network switching subsystem#Visitor location register (VLR)|visitor location register]] (VLR) provides subscriber information when the subscriber is outside its home network.\n* Other MSCs for procedures such as [[handoff|hand over]].\n\n===Procedures implemented===\nTasks of the MSC include:\n* [[GSM services#Call set up process for incoming calls|Delivering calls to subscribers]] as they arrive based on information from the VLR.\n* Connecting outgoing calls to other mobile subscribers or the PSTN.\n* Delivering SMSs from subscribers to the [[short message service center]] (SMSC) and vice versa.\n* Arranging handovers from BSC to BSC.\n* Carrying out handovers from this MSC to another.\n* Supporting [[supplementary services]] such as conference calls or call hold.\n* Generating billing information.\n\n==Home location register (HLR) {{anchor|HLR}}==\nThe '''home location register''' (HLR) is a central database that contains details of each mobile phone subscriber that is authorized to use the GSM core network. There can be several logical, and physical, HLRs per [[Public Land Mobile Network|public land mobile network]] (PLMN), though one [[international mobile subscriber identity]] (IMSI)/MSISDN pair can be associated with only one logical HLR (which can span several physical nodes) at a time<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nThe HLRs store details of every [[SIM card]] issued by the mobile phone operator. Each SIM has a unique identifier called an IMSI which is the [[primary key]] to each HLR record.\n\nAnother important item of data associated with the SIM are the MSISDNs, which are the [[telephone number]]s used by mobile phones to make and receive calls.  The primary MSISDN is the number used for making and receiving voice calls and SMS, but it is possible for a SIM to have other secondary MSISDNs associated with it for [[fax]] and data calls. Each MSISDN is also a [[unique key]] to the HLR record. The HLR data is stored for as long as a subscriber remains with the mobile phone operator.\n\nExamples of other data stored in the HLR against an IMSI record is:\n* GSM services that the subscriber has requested or been given.\n* [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS) settings to allow the subscriber to access packet services.\n* Current location of subscriber (VLR and [[SGSN|serving GPRS support node]]/SGSN).\n* [[Call forwarding|Call divert]] settings applicable for each associated MSISDN.\n\nThe HLR is a system which directly receives and processes [[Mobile Application Part|MAP]] transactions and messages from elements in the GSM network, for example, the location update messages received as mobile phones roam around.\n\n===Other GSM core network elements connected to the HLR===\nThe HLR connects to the following elements:\n* The G-MSC for handling incoming calls\n* The VLR for handling requests from mobile phones to attach to the network\n* The SMSC for handling incoming SMSs\n* The [[voice mail]] system for delivering notifications to the mobile phone that a message is waiting\n* The AuC for authentication and ciphering and exchange of data (triplets)\n\n===Procedures implemented===\nThe main function of the HLR is to manage the fact that SIMs and phones move around a lot. The following procedures are implemented to deal with this:\n* Manage the mobility of subscribers by means of updating their position in administrative areas called 'location areas', which are identified with a LAC. The action of a user of moving from one LA to another is followed by the HLR with a Location area update procedure.\n* Send the subscriber data to a VLR or SGSN when a subscriber first roams there.\n* Broker between the G-MSC or SMSC and the subscriber's current VLR in order to allow [[GSM services#Call set up process for incoming calls|incoming calls or text messages to be delivered]].\n* Remove subscriber data from the previous VLR when a subscriber has roamed away from it.\n* Responsible for all SRI related queries (i.e. for invoke SRI, HLR should give sack SRI or SRI reply).\n\n=={{anchor|AuC}} Authentication center (AuC)==\n\n===Description===\nThe '''authentication center''' (AuC) is a function to [[authentication|authenticate]] each [[SIM card]] that attempts to connect to the '''gsm''' core network (typically when the phone is powered on). Once the authentication is successful, the HLR is allowed to manage the SIM and services described above. An [[encryption key]] is also generated that is subsequently used to encrypt all wireless communications (voice, SMS, etc.) between the mobile phone and the GSM core network.\n\nIf the authentication fails, then no services are possible from that particular combination of SIM card and mobile phone operator attempted. There is an additional form of identification check performed on the serial number of the mobile phone described in the EIR section below, but this is not relevant to the AuC processing.\n\nProper implementation of security in and around the AuC is a key part of an operator's strategy to avoid [[SIM cloning]].\n\nThe AuC does not engage directly in the authentication process, but instead generates data known as ''triplets'' for the MSC to use during the procedure.  The security of the process depends upon a [[shared secret]] between the AuC and the SIM called the ''K<sub>i</sub>''. The ''K<sub>i</sub>'' is securely burned into the SIM during manufacture and is also securely replicated onto the AuC. This ''K<sub>i</sub>'' is never transmitted between the AuC and SIM, but is combined with the IMSI to produce a challenge/response for identification purposes and an encryption key called ''K<sub>c</sub>'' for use in over the air communications.\n\n===Other GSM core network elements connected to the AuC===\nThe AuC connects to the following elements:\n* The MSC which requests a new batch of triplet data for an IMSI after the previous data have been used. This ensures that same keys and challenge responses are not used twice for a particular mobile.\n\n===Procedures implemented===\nThe AuC stores the following data for each IMSI:\n* the ''K<sub>i</sub>''\n* Algorithm id. (the standard algorithms are called A3 or A8, but an operator may choose a proprietary one).\n\nWhen the MSC asks the AuC for a new set of triplets for a particular IMSI, the AuC first generates a random number known as ''RAND''. This ''RAND'' is then combined with the ''K<sub>i</sub>'' to produce two numbers as follows:\n* The ''K<sub>i</sub>'' and ''RAND'' are fed into the A3 algorithm and the signed response (SRES) is calculated.\n* The ''K<sub>i</sub>'' and ''RAND'' are fed into the A8 algorithm and a session key called ''K<sub>c</sub>'' is calculated.\nThe numbers (''RAND'', SRES, ''K<sub>c</sub>'') form the triplet sent back to the MSC. When a particular IMSI requests access to the GSM core network, the MSC sends the ''RAND'' part of the triplet to the SIM. The SIM then feeds this number and the ''K<sub>i</sub>'' (which is burned onto the SIM) into the A3 algorithm as appropriate and an SRES is calculated and sent back to the MSC. If this SRES matches with the SRES in the triplet (which it should if it is a valid SIM), then the mobile is allowed to attach and proceed with GSM services.\n\nAfter successful authentication, the MSC sends the encryption key ''K<sub>c</sub>'' to the [[Base Station Subsystem#Base station controller|base station controller]] (BSC) so that all communications can be encrypted and decrypted. Of course, the mobile phone can generate the ''K<sub>c</sub>'' itself by feeding the same RAND supplied during authentication and the ''K<sub>i</sub>'' into the A8 algorithm.\n\nThe AuC is usually collocated with the HLR, although this is not necessary. Whilst the procedure is secure for most everyday use, it is by no means hack proof. Therefore, a new set of security methods was designed for 3G phones.\n\nA3 Algorithm is used to encrypt Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cellular communications. In practice, A3 and A8 algorithms are generally implemented together (known as A3/A8, see [[COMP128]]). An A3/A8 algorithm is implemented in Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards and in GSM network Authentication Centers. It is used to authenticate the customer and generate a key for encrypting voice and data traffic, as defined in 3GPP TS 43.020 (03.20 before Rel-4). Development of A3 and A8 algorithms is considered a matter for individual GSM network operators, although example implementations are available.\n\n==Visitor location register (VLR)==<!-- inbound links -->\n\n===Description===\nThe '''Visitor Location Register (VLR)''' is a database of the MSs ([[Mobile station]]s) that have roamed into the jurisdiction of the MSC (Mobile Switching Center) which it serves. Each main [[Base Transceiver Station|base station]] in the network is served by exactly one VLR (one [[Base transceiver station|BTS]] may be served by many MSCs in case of MSC in pool), hence a subscriber cannot be present in more than one VLR at a time.\n\nThe data stored in the VLR has either been received from the [[Network_switching_subsystem#Home_location_register_.28HLR.29|'''Home Location Register (HLR)''']], or collected from the MS. In practice, for performance reasons, most vendors integrate the VLR directly to the V-MSC and, where this is not done, the VLR is very tightly linked with the MSC via a proprietary interface. Whenever an MSC detects a new MS in its network, in addition to creating a new record in the VLR, it also updates the HLR of the mobile subscriber, apprising it of the new location of that MS. If VLR data is corrupted it can lead to serious issues with text messaging and call services.\n\nData stored include:  \n* [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] (the subscriber's identity number).\n* Authentication data.\n* MSISDN (the subscriber's phone number).\n* GSM services that the subscriber is allowed to access.\n* [[GPRS Access Points|access point (GPRS)]] subscribed.\n* The HLR address of the subscriber.\n* SCP Address(For Prepaid Subscriber).\n\n===Procedures implemented===\nThe primary functions of the VLR are:\n* To inform the HLR that a subscriber has arrived in the particular area covered by the VLR.\n* To track where the subscriber is within the VLR area (location area) when no call is ongoing.\n* To allow or disallow which services the subscriber may use.\n* To allocate roaming numbers during the processing of incoming calls.\n* To purge the subscriber record if a subscriber becomes inactive whilst in the area of a VLR. The VLR deletes the subscriber's data after a fixed time period of inactivity and informs the HLR (e.g., when the phone has been switched off and left off or when the subscriber has moved to an area with no coverage for a long time).\n* To delete the subscriber record when a subscriber explicitly moves to another, as instructed by the HLR.\n\n==Equipment identity register (EIR)==\nThe '''[[Central Equipment Identity Register|equipment identity register]]''' is often integrated to the HLR. The EIR keeps a list of mobile phones (identified by their [[IMEI]]) which are to be banned from the network or monitored. This is designed to allow tracking of stolen mobile phones. In theory all data about all stolen mobile phones should be distributed to all EIRs in the world through a Central EIR. It is clear, however, that there are some countries where this is not in operation. The EIR data does not have to change in real time, which means that this function can be less distributed than the function of the HLR. The EIR is a database that contains information about the identity of the mobile equipment that prevents calls from stolen, unauthorized or defective mobile stations. Some EIR also have the capability to log Handset attempts and store it in a log file.\n\n==Other support functions==\nConnected more or less directly to the GSM core network are many other functions.\n\n===Billing center (BC)===\nThe '''billing center''' is responsible for processing the toll tickets generated by the VLRs and HLRs and generating a bill for each subscriber. It is also responsible for generating billing data of roaming subscriber.\n\n===Multimedia messaging service center (MMSC)===\nThe '''[[multimedia messaging service]] center''' supports the sending of multimedia messages (e.g., images, [[Sound|audio]], [[video]] and their combinations) to (or from) MMS-bluetooth.\n\n===Voicemail system (VMS)===\nThe '''[[voicemail]] system''' records and stores voicemail. which may have to pay\n\n===Lawful interception functions===\n{{main|Lawful interception}}\nAccording to U.S. law, which has also been copied into many other countries, especially in Europe, all telecommunications equipment must provide facilities for monitoring the calls of selected users.
