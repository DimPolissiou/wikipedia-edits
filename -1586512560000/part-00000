A full '''factorial design''' may also be called a '''fully crossed design'''. Such an experiment allows the investigator to study the effect of each factor on the [[response variable]], as well as the effects of [[interaction (statistics)|interaction]]s between factors on the response variable.\n\nFor the vast majority of factorial experiments, each factor has only two levels. For example, with two factors each taking two levels, a factorial experiment would have four treatment combinations in total, and is usually called a ''2\u00d72 factorial design''.\n\nIf the number of combinations in a full factorial design is too high to be logistically feasible, a [[fractional factorial design]] may be done, in which some of the possible combinations (usually at least half) are omitted.\n\n==History==\nFactorial designs were used in the 19th century by [[John Bennet Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] of the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]].<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Frank|last1=Yates|authorlink1= Frank Yates|first2=Kenneth|last2=Mather|authorlink2=Kenneth Mather|title= Ronald Aylmer Fisher|journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]]|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London, England|volume= 9|pages = 91\u2013120|date= 1963|doi= 10.1098/rsbm.1963.0006|url =http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//fisher/fisherbiog.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-url  =https://web.archive.org/web/20090218135035/http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special/|archive-date = February 18, 2009|df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Ronald Fisher]] argued in 1926 that \"complex\" designs (such as factorial designs) were more efficient than studying one factor at a time.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Ronald|last=Fisher|authorlink=Ronald Fisher| title =The Arrangement of Field Experiments | journal =[[Journal of the Ministry of Agriculture of Great Britain]] | publisher=Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries|location=London, England|volume =33 | pages =503\u2013513| date =1926| url =http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/15191/1/48.pdf}}</ref> Fisher wrote, {{quote|\"No aphorism is more frequently repeated in connection with field trials, than that we must ask Nature few questions, or, ideally, one question, at a time.

Factorial designs are required to detect such [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]]. Use of OFAT when interactions are present can lead to serious misunderstanding of how the response changes with the factors.\n* Factorial designs allow the effects of a factor to be estimated at several levels of the other factors, yielding conclusions that are valid over a range of experimental conditions.\n\n===Example of advantages of factorial experiments===\n\nIn his book, ''Improving Almost Anything: Ideas and Essays'', statistician [[George E.

Christer asked if there were other factors they would like to test. They said there were, but that making added runs would exceed their budget. Christer showed them how they could test two additional factors \"for free\" \u2013 without increasing the number of runs and without reducing the accuracy of their estimate of the cage effect. In this arrangement, called a 2\u00d72\u00d72 factorial design, each of the three factors would be run at two levels and all the eight possible combinations included.

The factors changed were heat treatment, outer ring osculation, and cage design. The numbers show the relative lengths of lives of the bearings. If you look at [the cube plot], you can see that the choice of cage design did not make a lot of difference. \u2026 But, if you average the pairs of numbers for cage design, you get the [table below], which shows what the two other factors did. \u2026 It led to the extraordinary discovery that, in this particular application, the life of a bearing can be increased fivefold if the two factor(s) outer ring osculation and inner ring heat treatments are increased together.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin:0 0 10px 1em;  text-align:center; width:9em;\"\n|+  Bearing life vs. heat and osculation\n|-\n! !!

A likely explanation is that, because most engineers have, until recently, employed only one factor at a time experimentation, [[Interaction (statistics)|interaction]] effects have been missed.\"\n\n==Example==\n\nThe simplest factorial experiment contains two levels for each of two factors. Suppose an engineer wishes to study the total power used by each of two different motors, A and B, running at each of two different speeds, 2000 or 3000 RPM. The factorial experiment would consist of four experimental units: motor A at 2000 RPM, motor B at 2000 RPM, motor A at 3000 RPM, and motor B at 3000 RPM. Each combination of a single level selected from every factor is present once.\n\nThis experiment is an example of a 2<sup>2</sup> (or 2\u00d72) factorial experiment, so named because it considers two levels (the base) for each of two factors (the power or superscript), or #levels<sup>#factors</sup>, producing 2<sup>2</sup>=4 factorial points.\n\n[[File:Factorial Design.svg|thumb|left|500px|\nCube plot for factorial design\n]]\n\nDesigns can involve many independent variables. As a further example, the effects of three input variables can be evaluated in eight experimental conditions shown as the corners of a cube.\n\nThis can be conducted with or without replication, depending on its intended purpose and available resources. It will provide the effects of the three independent variables on the dependent variable and possible interactions.\n\n==Notation==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 10px 1em;  text-align:center; width:9em;\"\n|+  2\u00d72 factorial experiment\n|-\n! !!

When a design is denoted a 2<sup>3</sup> factorial, this identifies the number of factors (3); how many levels each factor has (2); and how many experimental conditions there are in the design (2<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;8). Similarly, a 2<sup>5</sup> design has five factors, each with two levels, and 2<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;32 experimental conditions. Factorial experiments can involve factors with different numbers of levels. A 2<sup>4</sup>3 design has five factors, four with two levels and one with three levels, and has 16&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;48 experimental conditions.\n<ref>{{cite web|last1=Penn State University College of Health and Human Development|url=http://methodology.psu.edu/ra/most/factorial|title=Introduction to Factorial Experimental Designs|date=2011-12-22}}</ref>\n\nTo save space, the points in a two-level factorial experiment are often abbreviated with strings of plus and minus signs. The strings have as many symbols as factors, and their values dictate the level of each factor: conventionally, <math>-</math> for the first (or low) level, and <math>+</math> for the second (or high) level. The points in this experiment can thus be represented as <math>--</math>, <math>+-</math>, <math>-+</math>, and <math>++</math>.\n\nThe factorial points can also be abbreviated by (1), a, b, and ab, where the presence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its high (or second) level and the absence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its low (or first) level (for example, \"a\" indicates that factor A is on its high setting, while all other factors are at their low (or first) setting). (1) is used to indicate that all factors are at their lowest (or first) values.\n\n==Implementation==\n\nFor more than two factors, a 2<sup>''k''</sup> factorial experiment can usually be recursively designed from a 2<sup>''k''\u22121</sup> factorial experiment by replicating the 2<sup>''k''\u22121</sup> experiment, assigning the first replicate to the first (or low) level of the new factor, and the second replicate to the second (or high) level. This framework can be generalized to, ''e.g.'', designing three replicates for three level factors, ''etc''.\n\nA factorial experiment allows for estimation of [[experimental error]] in two ways. The experiment can be [[reproducibility|replicated]], or the [[sparsity-of-effects principle]] <!--and/or the hierarchical ordering principle (which states roughly that higher order interactions are progressively less important) -->can often be exploited. Replication is more common for small experiments and is a very reliable way of assessing experimental error. When the number of factors is large (typically more than about 5 factors, but this does vary by application), replication of the design can become operationally difficult. In these cases, it is common to only run a single replicate of the design, and to assume that factor interactions of more than a certain order (say, between three or more factors) are negligible. Under this assumption, estimates of such high order interactions are estimates of an exact zero, thus really an estimate of experimental error.\n\nWhen there are many factors, many experimental runs will be necessary, even without replication. For example, experimenting with 10 factors at two levels each produces 2<sup>10</sup>=1024 combinations. At some point this becomes infeasible due to high cost or insufficient resources. In this case, [[fractional factorial designs]] may be used.\n\nAs with any statistical experiment, the experimental runs in a factorial experiment should be randomized to reduce the impact that [[biased sample|bias]] could have on the experimental results. In practice, this can be a large operational challenge.\n\nFactorial experiments can be used when there are more than two levels of each factor. However, the number of experimental runs required for three-level (or more) factorial designs will be considerably greater than for their two-level counterparts. Factorial designs are therefore less attractive if a researcher wishes to consider more than two levels.\n\n==Analysis==\n{{main|Yates analysis}}\nA factorial experiment can be analyzed using [[ANOVA]] or [[regression analysis]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J | year = 1968 | title = Multiple regression as a general data-analytic system | doi = 10.1037/h0026714| journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 70 | issue = 6| pages = 426\u2013443 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.476.6180 }}</ref> To compute the main effect of a factor \"A\", subtract the average response of all experimental runs for which A was at its low (or first) level from the average response of all experimental runs for which A was at its high (or second) level.\n\nOther useful exploratory analysis tools for factorial experiments include [[main effect]]s plots, [[Interaction (statistics)|interaction plots]], [[Pareto chart|Pareto plots]], and a [[normal probability plot]] of the estimated effects.\n\nWhen the factors are continuous, two-level factorial designs assume that the effects are [[linear]]. If a [[quadratic function|quadratic]] effect is expected for a factor, a more complicated experiment should be used, such as a [[central composite design]]. Optimization of factors that could have quadratic effects is the primary goal of [[response surface methodology]].\n\n===Analysis example===\n\nMontgomery <ref name=\"Montgomery\" /> gives the following example of analysis of a factorial experiment:.<blockquote>An engineer would like to increase the filtration rate (output) of a process to produce a chemical, and to reduce the amount of formaldehyde used in the process. Previous attempts to reduce the formaldehyde have lowered the filtration rate. The current filtration rate is 75 gallons per hour. Four factors are considered: temperature (A), pressure (B), formaldehyde concentration (C), and stirring rate (D). Each of the four factors will be tested at two levels.</blockquote>Onwards, the minus (\u2212) and plus (+) signs will indicate whether the factor is run at a low or high level, respectively.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Design matrix and resulting filtration rate\n!A\n!B\n!C\n!D\n!Filtration rate\n|-\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n|45\n|-\n| +\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n|71\n|-\n| \u2212\n| +\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n|48\n|-\n| +\n| +\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n|65\n|-\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| +\n| \u2212\n|68\n|-\n| +\n| \u2212\n| +\n| \u2212\n|60\n|-\n| \u2212\n| +\n| +\n| \u2212\n|80\n|-\n| +\n| +\n| +\n| \u2212\n|65\n|-\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| +\n|43\n|-\n| +\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| +\n|100\n|-\n| \u2212\n| +\n| \u2212\n| +\n|45\n|-\n| +\n| +\n| \u2212\n| +\n|104\n|-\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| +\n| +\n|75\n|-\n| +\n| \u2212\n| +\n| +\n|86\n|-\n| \u2212\n| +\n| +\n| +\n|70\n|-\n| +\n| +\n| +\n| +\n|96\n|}\n<gallery widths=\"600\" heights=\"400\">\nFile:Montgomery filtration rates.svg|Plot of the main effects showing the filtration rates for the low (\u2212) and high (+) settings for each factor.\nFile:Interaction plots filtration rate.png|Plot of the interaction effects showing the mean filtration rate at each of the four possible combinations of levels for a given pair of factors.\n</gallery>The non-parallel lines in the A:C interaction plot indicate that the effect of factor A depends on the level of factor C.

The coefficient values and the graphs suggest that the important factors are A, C, and D, and the interaction terms A:C and A:D.\n\nThe coefficients for A, C, and D are all positive in the ANOVA, which would suggest running the process with all three variables set to the high value. However, the main effect of each variable is the average over the levels of the other variables. The A:C interaction plot above shows that the effect of factor A depends on the level of factor C, and vice versa. Factor A (temperature) has very little effect on filtration rate when factor C is at the + level. But Factor A has a large effect on filtration rate when factor C (formaldehyde) is at the \u2212 level. The combination of A at the + level and C at the \u2212 level gives the highest filtration rate. This observation indicates how one-factor-at-a-time analyses can miss important interactions. Only by varying both factors A and C at the same time could the engineer discover that the effect of factor A depends on the level of factor C.\n[[File:Montgomery_filtration_cube_plot.png|frame|450x450px|Cube plot for the ANOVA using factors A, C, and D, and the interaction terms A:C and A:D.

This result also satisfies the objective of reducing formaldehyde (factor C). Because B does not appear to be important, it can be dropped from the model.

Christer asked if there were other factors they would like to test. They said there were, but that making added runs would exceed their budget. Christer showed them how they could test two additional factors \"for free\" \u2013 without increasing the number of runs and without reducing the accuracy of their estimate of the cage effect. In this arrangement, called a 2\u00d72\u00d72 factorial design, each of the three factors would be run at two levels and all the eight possible combinations included. The various combinations can conveniently be shown as the vertices of a cube ... \"\n\"In each case, the standard condition is indicated by a minus sign and the modified condition by a plus sign. The factors changed were heat treatment, outer ring osculation, and cage design. The numbers show the relative lengths of lives of the bearings. If you look at [the cube plot], you can see that the choice of cage design did not make a lot of difference. \u2026 But, if you average the pairs of numbers for cage design, you get the [table below], which shows what the two other factors did. \u2026 It led to the extraordinary discovery that, in this particular application, the life of a bearing can be increased fivefold if the two factor(s) outer ring osculation and inner ring heat treatments are increased together.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin:0 0 10px 1em;  text-align:center; width:9em;\"\n|+  Bearing life vs. heat and osculation\n|-\n! !!

Heat +\n| 21|| 106\n|}\n\n\"Remembering that bearings like this one have been made for decades, it is at first surprising that it could take so long to discover so important an improvement. A likely explanation is that, because most engineers have, until recently, employed only one factor at a time experimentation, [[Interaction (statistics)|interaction]] effects have been missed.\"\n\n==Example==\n\nThe simplest factorial experiment contains two levels for each of two factors. Suppose an engineer wishes to study the total power used by each of two different motors, A and B, running at each of two different speeds, 2000 or 3000 RPM. The factorial experiment would consist of four experimental units: motor A at 2000 RPM, motor B at 2000 RPM, motor A at 3000 RPM, and motor B at 3000 RPM. Each combination of a single level selected from every factor is present once.\n\nThis experiment is an example of a 2<sup>2</sup> (or 2\u00d72) factorial experiment, so named because it considers two levels (the base) for each of two factors (the power or superscript), or #levels<sup>#factors</sup>, producing 2<sup>2</sup>=4 factorial points.\n\n[[File:Factorial Design.svg|thumb|left|500px|\nCube plot for factorial design\n]]\n\nDesigns can involve many independent variables. As a further example, the effects of three input variables can be evaluated in eight experimental conditions shown as the corners of a cube.\n\nThis can be conducted with or without replication, depending on its intended purpose and available resources. It will provide the effects of the three independent variables on the dependent variable and possible interactions.\n\n==Notation==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 10px 1em;  text-align:center; width:9em;\"\n|+  2\u00d72 factorial experiment\n|-\n! !!

When a design is denoted a 2<sup>3</sup> factorial, this identifies the number of factors (3); how many levels each factor has (2); and how many experimental conditions there are in the design (2<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;8). Similarly, a 2<sup>5</sup> design has five factors, each with two levels, and 2<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;32 experimental conditions. Factorial experiments can involve factors with different numbers of levels. A 2<sup>4</sup>3 design has five factors, four with two levels and one with three levels, and has 16&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;48 experimental conditions.\n<ref>{{cite web|last1=Penn State University College of Health and Human Development|url=http://methodology.psu.edu/ra/most/factorial|title=Introduction to Factorial Experimental Designs|date=2011-12-22}}</ref>\n\nTo save space, the points in a two-level factorial experiment are often abbreviated with strings of plus and minus signs. The strings have as many symbols as factors, and their values dictate the level of each factor: conventionally, <math>-</math> for the first (or low) level, and <math>+</math> for the second (or high) level. The points in this experiment can thus be represented as <math>--</math>, <math>+-</math>, <math>-+</math>, and <math>++</math>.\n\nThe factorial points can also be abbreviated by (1), a, b, and ab, where the presence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its high (or second) level and the absence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its low (or first) level (for example, \"a\" indicates that factor A is on its high setting, while all other factors are at their low (or first) setting). (1) is used to indicate that all factors are at their lowest (or first) values.\n\n==Implementation==\n\nFor more than two factors, a 2<sup>''k''</sup> factorial experiment can usually be recursively designed from a 2<sup>''k''\u22121</sup> factorial experiment by replicating the 2<sup>''k''\u22121</sup> experiment, assigning the first replicate to the first (or low) level of the new factor, and the second replicate to the second (or high) level. This framework can be generalized to, ''e.g.'', designing three replicates for three level factors, ''etc''.\n\nA factorial experiment allows for estimation of [[experimental error]] in two ways. The experiment can be [[reproducibility|replicated]], or the [[sparsity-of-effects principle]] <!--and/or the hierarchical ordering principle (which states roughly that higher order interactions are progressively less important) -->can often be exploited. Replication is more common for small experiments and is a very reliable way of assessing experimental error. When the number of factors is large (typically more than about 5 factors, but this does vary by application), replication of the design can become operationally difficult. In these cases, it is common to only run a single replicate of the design, and to assume that factor interactions of more than a certain order (say, between three or more factors) are negligible. Under this assumption, estimates of such high order interactions are estimates of an exact zero, thus really an estimate of experimental error.\n\nWhen there are many factors, many experimental runs will be necessary, even without replication. For example, experimenting with 10 factors at two levels each produces 2<sup>10</sup>=1024 combinations. At some point this becomes infeasible due to high cost or insufficient resources. In this case, [[fractional factorial designs]] may be used.\n\nAs with any statistical experiment, the experimental runs in a factorial experiment should be randomized to reduce the impact that [[biased sample|bias]] could have on the experimental results. In practice, this can be a large operational challenge.\n\nFactorial experiments can be used when there are more than two levels of each factor. However, the number of experimental runs required for three-level (or more) factorial designs will be considerably greater than for their two-level counterparts. Factorial designs are therefore less attractive if a researcher wishes to consider more than two levels.\n\n==Analysis==\n{{main|Yates analysis}}\nA factorial experiment can be analyzed using [[ANOVA]] or [[regression analysis]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J | year = 1968 | title = Multiple regression as a general data-analytic system | doi = 10.1037/h0026714| journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 70 | issue = 6| pages = 426\u2013443 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.476.6180 }}</ref> To compute the main effect of a factor \"A\", subtract the average response of all experimental runs for which A was at its low (or first) level from the average response of all experimental runs for which A was at its high (or second) level.\n\nOther useful exploratory analysis tools for factorial experiments include [[main effect]]s plots, [[Interaction (statistics)|interaction plots]], [[Pareto chart|Pareto plots]], and a [[normal probability plot]] of the estimated effects.\n\nWhen the factors are continuous, two-level factorial designs assume that the effects are [[linear]]. If a [[quadratic function|quadratic]] effect is expected for a factor, a more complicated experiment should be used, such as a [[central composite design]]. Optimization of factors that could have quadratic effects is the primary goal of [[response surface methodology]].\n\n===Analysis example===\n\nMontgomery <ref name=\"Montgomery\" /> gives the following example of analysis of a factorial experiment:.<blockquote>An engineer would like to increase the filtration rate (output) of a process to produce a chemical, and to reduce the amount of formaldehyde used in the process. Previous attempts to reduce the formaldehyde have lowered the filtration rate. The current filtration rate is 75 gallons per hour. Four factors are considered: temperature (A), pressure (B), formaldehyde concentration (C), and stirring rate (D). Each of the four factors will be tested at two levels.</blockquote>Onwards, the minus (\u2212) and plus (+) signs will indicate whether the factor is run at a low or high level, respectively.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Design matrix and resulting filtration rate\n!A\n!B\n!C\n!D\n!Filtration rate\n|-\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n|45\n|-\n| +\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n|71\n|-\n| \u2212\n| +\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n|48\n|-\n| +\n| +\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n|65\n|-\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| +\n| \u2212\n|68\n|-\n| +\n| \u2212\n| +\n| \u2212\n|60\n|-\n| \u2212\n| +\n| +\n| \u2212\n|80\n|-\n| +\n| +\n| +\n| \u2212\n|65\n|-\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| +\n|43\n|-\n| +\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| +\n|100\n|-\n| \u2212\n| +\n| \u2212\n| +\n|45\n|-\n| +\n| +\n| \u2212\n| +\n|104\n|-\n| \u2212\n| \u2212\n| +\n| +\n|75\n|-\n| +\n| \u2212\n| +\n| +\n|86\n|-\n| \u2212\n| +\n| +\n| +\n|70\n|-\n| +\n| +\n| +\n| +\n|96\n|}\n<gallery widths=\"600\" heights=\"400\">\nFile:Montgomery filtration rates.svg|Plot of the main effects showing the filtration rates for the low (\u2212) and high (+) settings for each factor.\nFile:Interaction plots filtration rate.png|Plot of the interaction effects showing the mean filtration rate at each of the four possible combinations of levels for a given pair of factors.\n</gallery>The non-parallel lines in the A:C interaction plot indicate that the effect of factor A depends on the level of factor C. A similar results holds for the A:D interaction. The graphs indicate that factor B has little effect on filtration rate.

The coefficient values and the graphs suggest that the important factors are A, C, and D, and the interaction terms A:C and A:D.\n\nThe coefficients for A, C, and D are all positive in the ANOVA, which would suggest running the process with all three variables set to the high value. However, the main effect of each variable is the average over the levels of the other variables. The A:C interaction plot above shows that the effect of factor A depends on the level of factor C, and vice versa. Factor A (temperature) has very little effect on filtration rate when factor C is at the + level. But Factor A has a large effect on filtration rate when factor C (formaldehyde) is at the \u2212 level. The combination of A at the + level and C at the \u2212 level gives the highest filtration rate. This observation indicates how one-factor-at-a-time analyses can miss important interactions. Only by varying both factors A and C at the same time could the engineer discover that the effect of factor A depends on the level of factor C.\n[[File:Montgomery_filtration_cube_plot.png|frame|450x450px|Cube plot for the ANOVA using factors A, C, and D, and the interaction terms A:C and A:D. The plot aids in visualizing the result and shows that the best combination is A+, D+, and C\u2212.]]\nThe best filtration rate is seen when A and D are at the high level, and C is at the low level. This result also satisfies the objective of reducing formaldehyde (factor C). Because B does not appear to be important, it can be dropped from the model. Performing the ANOVA using factors A, C, and D, and the interaction terms A:C and A:D, gives the result shown in the following table, in which all the terms are significant (p-value < 0.05). \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ANOVA results\n!Coefficient\n!Estimate\n!Standard error\n!t value\n!p-value\n|-\n|Intercept\n|70.062\n|1.104\n|63.444\n|2.3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u221214</sup>\n|-\n|A\n|10.812\n|1.104\n|9.791\n|1.9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22126</sup>\n|-\n|C\n|4.938\n|1.104\n|4.471\n|1.2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22123</sup>\n|-\n|D\n|7.313\n|1.104\n|6.622\n|5.9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22125</sup>\n|-\n|A:C\n| \u22129.063\n|1.104\n| \u22128.206\n|9.4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22126</sup>\n|-\n|A:D\n|8.312\n|1.104\n|7.527\n|2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22125</sup>\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Combinatorial design]]\n*[[Design of experiments]]\n*[[Orthogonal array]]\n*[[Plackett\u2013Burman design]]\n*[[Taguchi methods]]\n*[[Welch's t-test]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |authorlink=George E.

The only consistent member was singer/sampler player/occasional guitarist David Callahan, who initially co-led the project with [[Margaret Fiedler McGinnis|Margaret Fiedler]] (Fiedler and bass player John Frenett would leave Moonshake in 1993 to form the more commercially successful [[Laika (band)|Laika]]). The band was notable for its extensive use of textures and sampler technology in a rock context.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1991)===\nDavid Callahan (vocals, guitars, samplers) had been in indie rock band [[The Wolfhounds]], who were active for much of the second half of the 1980s. Often associated with the [[C86 (music)|C86]] indie scene of the time, the band released several acclaimed albums of abrasive guitar pop and a dozen or so singles on a variety of labels. Following the dissolution of [[The Wolfhounds]], Callahan decided to form a new band and recruited [[Margaret Fiedler]] (vocals, guitars, samplers), [[John Frenett]] (bass) and finally Miguel \"Mig\" Moreland (drums, percussion). Although Callahan originally favoured '''Skyscraper''' as a project name, the band ultimately settled on the name '''Moonshake''' (taken from a [[Can (band)|Can]] [[Moonshake (song)|single]] on the seminal [[Krautrock]]ers' ''[[Future Days]]'' album.<ref name=old4adfaq>{{Cite web|url=http://www.evo.org/4ad-faq/artists/moonshake/moonshake.txt|title=Moonshake FAQ on old 4AD Records page|website=Evo.org}}</ref> \n\nCallahan and Fiedler alternated the lead vocal and songwriting duties for the band, both favouring very different approaches: Fiedler created surreal, ethereal and atmospheric material, while Callahan favoured harsher-sounding urban fables. Due to this factor, the performance style of the band alternated considerably depending on which songwriter's songs were being played. Initially, the band's diversity added to its strength - in 2009, Fiedler would recall \"I really liked Dave Callahan's songs and his voice - obviously! That's why I wanted to be in a band with him... We were different people and wrote differently, but came from the same influences - [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Public Image Ltd.|PIL]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Eric B & Rakim]], and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|MBV]] to name a few bands. Moonshake was a collision - it was supposed to be a collision.\"<ref name=dumbingofamerica>[http://thedumbingofamerica.net/2009/10/26/history-lesson-laika-moonshake-and-the-great-margaret-fiedler/ \"Laika, Moonshake And The Great Margaret Fiedler\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612030559/http://thedumbingofamerica.net/2009/10/26/history-lesson-laika-moonshake-and-the-great-margaret-fiedler/ |date=12 June 2010 }}, The Dumbing of America webzine, 26 October 2009</ref> Regardless of the divergence in approaches, all Moonshake songs made a strong use of textures, noise and sampler technology.\n\n===First lineup - early EPs and ''Eva Luna'' (1991\u20131992)===\nMoonshake signed to [[Alan McGee]]'s [[Creation (record label)|Creation]] Records for their debut EP, ''First'', released in spring 1991. At this point, the band was continuing to follow the harsh-effected guitar-heavy sound which had characterised a lot of the last Wolfhounds recordings. The results drew comparisons with [[Sonic Youth]] and especially [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], and lacked the dub element which would feature in later recordings.  \n\nAfter the release of ''First'', Moonshake signed to the emerging independent label [[Too Pure]] (home of [[PJ Harvey]], [[Th' Faith Healers]] and [[Stereolab]]). Their first single for the new label was ''Secondhand Clothes'', which showed a leaning towards the dub-bass-heavy post-punk sound of bands such as [[Public Image Limited]] and [[The Pop Group]]. This was followed in 1992 by the ''Beautiful Pigeon'' EP (which featured two rare songwriting collaborations between Callahan and Fiedler) and then by Moonshake's debut album, ''Eva Luna''. The band began to earn many positive reviews for its unusual sample-driven and rhythmically propulsive sound, which drew on indie rock, noise-rock, breakbeats, electronica, psychedelia, dub, art-rock, [[Krautrock]] and punk.\n\n===''Big Good Angel'' and split of original lineup (1993)===\nFor 1993's mini-album ''Big Good Angel'', both Callahan and Fiedler contributed three songs each. By now the divergent styles of the two songwriters was producing too much creative tension for the band to survive for much longer. In 2009, Fiedler recalled that \"maybe after a while, the tension that was there in our writing and singing styles spilled over into real life. Things did get extremely tense on the last tour we did together in 1993 in North America.\"<ref name=dumbingofamerica/>\n\nFollowing this tour, Moonshake split in half, with Margaret Fiedler and John Frenett departing to form [[Laika (band)|Laika]] with Guy Fixsen (who had engineered ''Eva Luna''). In 2009 Fiedler would recall of the split \"it wasn't amicable. In fact it took me years to get over it, which is kinda sad to admit. I haven't spoken to Dave in years...\"<ref name=dumbingofamerica/> Earlier (in a 1995 Laika interview), she commented \"Laika is a close working collective; in Moonshake that was never possible. David and I always did what we liked. I have never compromised myself and that's the main reason why I was forced to leave the band. After the American tour David no longer wanted to work with me.\"<ref>[http://www.mail-archive.com/sloannet@sloanmusic.com/msg01830.html Laika interview in Indie List Digest, Volume 4 No.&nbsp;39], Mail-arcive.com, 24 September 1995</ref>\n\n===Second lineup and ''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'' (1994\u20131995)===\nMoonshake was left as a duo of David Callahan and Mig Moreland. With the loss of Fiedler's guitar-playing and Callahan's increasing interest in samplers, the band began moving further away from indie rock and psychedelia and deeper into Callahan's art-punk/film-noir stylings. While recording the band's second full-length album, ''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'', Callahan and Moreland drew on a host of guest musicians. [[Collapsed Lung (band)|Collapsed Lung]]'s bass player Johnny Dawe covered for the departed Frenett, while [[PJ Harvey]], [[Stereolab]] keyboard player [[Katharine Gifford]] and [[Sidi Bou Said (band)|Sidi Bou Said]] members Lee Howton and Claire Lemmon all contributed vocals. Horns were added by trumpeter Andrew Blick (Blowpipe) and saxophonist Raymond Dickaty (from [[Gallon Drunk]] and Skree).<ref name=dickatybiog>[http://www.studiosaxophones.co.uk/Data/Pages/RayMDickatyBriefBiogplusJune2009.pdf Raymond Dickaty biography], Studiosaxophones.co.uk, June 2009</ref><ref name=dickatybiog2>{{Cite web|url=https://www.raydickaty.com/biography.html|title=Biography|website=Raydickaty.com}}</ref> The band refused to use an outside producer for the sessions and self-produced instead, labelling producers as \"an overpaid imposition\".\n\n''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'' was released in 1994 (a few months before Fiedler, Frenett and Fixsen followed with their debut as [[Laika (band)|Laika]]). It revealed that Moonshake had completely banned guitars from their new sound, relying entirely on the combination of Dickaty's saxophones with looped and layered samples over the rhythm section (in a similar manner to [[The Young Gods]]). Compared to earlier recordings, the new Moonshake material was jazzier (with extensive horn parts) and more direct. Callahan wrote all of the songs for the record, with his bleak, vivid urban vision now uninterrupted and untempered by Fiedler's more psychedelic approaches. However, the use of female singers on the record \u2013 in particular, [[PJ Harvey]]'s striking guest contribution on \"Just a Working Girl\" \u2013 would ensure that for now Moonshake would retain a strong female component despite Fiedler's departure. \n\nDuring the recording of ''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'', Dickaty had joined the band as a full-time member<ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" /> and Matt Brewer was recruited as the new bass guitarist. When Moreland then left the band to join [[Moose (band)|Moose]], Callahan was left as the sole surviving original member.<ref name=old4adfaq/> Moreland was replaced on drums by Kevin Bass. Katherine Gifford continued to guest as female harmony singer on live Moonshake dates (as well as performing as lead singer on those newer songs written for a female voice, such as \"Heart Keeps Beating\"). \n\n''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'' received good reviews not matched by great sales, and some time after the release of the album Moonshake would part company with Too Pure.\n\n===The C/Z years - ''Dirty & Divine'' and final split (1996\u20131997)===\nIn 1996, Moonshake signed with the Seattle indie label [[C/Z Records]], which was determined to promote them in America. As part of this, the band joined the 1996 [[Lollapalooza]] tour of the American Midwest headlined by [[Metallica]] and [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. The latter experience proved disappointing - assigned to \"the third stage\", the band found themselves playing from the back of a truck some distance from the main arena. Dickaty would later recall \"with other so-called 'alternative' artists, we played to a largely indifferent crowd of thrill-seeking metal fans.\"<ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" /> and the band were unimpressed by their treatment by the Lollapalooza organisation.\n\nKatherine Gifford left altogether in 1996 (to form [[Snowpony]]), where she was later joined by Kevin Bass. Moonshake then recruited Michael Rother (not to be confused with his namesake in [[Neu!]]) as the new drummer. This line-up recorded the band's final album ''Dirty & Divine''. Compared to ''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'', ''Dirty & Divine'' featured a far less prominent role for female vocals (reduced more to harmonies) and reduced instrumentation, being recorded by a core group of Callahan, Brewer, Rother and Dickaty (with vocal assistance from [[Stereolab]]'s [[Mary Hansen]]). The album contained various songs which had been played in the Moonshake set during the previous two years, with subjects ranging from sailor's tales, the lives and deaths of cities, addictions to risk and danger and sexual fantasy in advertising. \n\n''Dirty & Divine'' was released in 1996 on C/Z Records and later licensed to a UK release through [[World Domination Recordings]] By this time, however, three years of self-management and hard touring with little reward had exhausted the band. In 1997, shortly after the UK release of ''Dirty & Divine'', Callahan moved to the USA (to briefly relocate to Brooklyn, New York City) and the band split up, albeit amicably.<ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" />\n\n===Post-Moonshake===\nAn EP of Moonshake remixes \u2013 originally commissioned to promote the ''Dirty & Divine'' album \u2013 was belatedly issued in 1999, though this release was disowned by Callahan.<ref name=old4adfaq/>\n\nDavid Callahan's time in the United States was brief, and he returned to London soon afterwards. He re-emerged on the London music scene in the early 2000s, setting up a multimedia/DJ/music project called '''The $urplus!'''. In its band formation (in which Callahan was joined by singer Anja Buechele) The $urplus! released a single self-titled EP containing four songs, resembling Moonshake's later material but with a lighter and less brutal approach, the inclusion of guitars, and Callahan and Buechele operating as much more equal partners than was the case with latter-day Moonshake. The band briefly experimented with an expanded garage-rock lineup, but did not release any more material (although Buechele would later contribute to the revived [[Bark Psychosis]]). Post-$urplus, Callahan involved himself in other work including DJing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.howdoesitfeel.co.uk/weblog2002.html|title=how does it feel to be loved? - london club night playing indie pop, northern soul, tamla motown, girl groups, sixties heartbreak|website=Howdoesitfeel.co.uk}}</ref> Callahan would also reform [[The Wolfhounds]] (initially for live performances in 2004 and 2006, but with a full and ongoing reunion following in 2010).\n\nRaymond Dickaty would go on to join [[Spiritualized]] and would stay with them until 2002, following which he studied free improvisation. He would later work with [[The Duke Spirit]], AMP, [[Zukanican]] and his own free-jazz/rock fusion band Solar Fire Trio.<ref name=dickatybiog/><ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" /> In 2006 he joined the Ninja Tune band Loka. Relocating to Poland in 2009, he would become a member of both the Trifonidis Free Orchestra and the Tricphonix Streetband.<ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" />\n\nIn early 2019, Callahan began hinting in Facebook posts that he was working on new Moonshake material (although he provided no details on collaborators or a proposed release date) alongside his ongoing Wolfhounds work and a new parallel solo acoustic career as David Lance Callahan. He also began work on a new blog called 'On the Rock'n'Roll' dealing with \"a history of making music on the dole, incorporating anecdotes, interviews, musical selections, social history, dirty squatters, social security scroungers, workshy ponces and a whole load of cultural misappropriation\", for which the first entry related to Moonshake performing a 1997 record label showcase in New Orleans while Callahan and Michael Rother were simultaneously waiting for imminent DSS Restart interviews back in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontherocknroll.com/|title=Home &#124; Social History of Pop Music|website=Ontherocknroll.com}}</ref>\n\n==Connections==\nDuring his Moonshake years, David Callahan enjoyed brief cameos with contemporaries (and originally, [[Too Pure]] labelmates) [[Stereolab]], performing \"French Disko\" with them on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]'' in 1993, and the [[Stereolab]] spin-off project Turn On. Ray Dickaty also played with Stereolab, appearing on several tracks recorded around the time of their ''[[Emperor Tomato Ketchup (album)|Emperor Tomato Ketchup]]'' album. The connection also went the other way: Stereolab's [[Mary Hansen]] and Katherine Gifford provided backing vocals on Moonshake's last album ''Dirty and Divine''. Some copies of ''Dirty and Divine'' were even stickered to alert potential buyers to Hansen's presence.\n\n==Discography==\n===Singles===\n*''First EP'' (1991, Creation Records)\n*''Secondhand Clothes EP'' (1991, Too Pure)\n*\"Beautiful Pigeon\" (1992, Too Pure)\n*\"Lola Lola\" b/w \"Always True to You in My Fashion\" (1995, Clawfist Singles Club)\n*\"Cranes\" (1996, C/Z / World Domination)\n\n===Albums===\n*''Eva Luna'' (1992, Too Pure / 1993, Matador / Atlantic)\n*''Big Good Angel'' (Mini-album) (1993, Too Pure / Matador)\n*''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'' (1994, Too Pure / American)\n*''Dirty & Divine'' (1996, C/Z-BMG / World Domination)\n*''Remixes'' (1999, C/Z)\n\n===Compilation appearances===\n*''Beautiful Pigeon'' (1992, V/A \"Independent Top 20 Volume 15\", Beechwood Music; the track \"Night Tripper\" also appeared on a 7\" single given away with the vinyl edition of this LP)\n*''Just a Working Girl'' (1994, V/A \"Pop - Do We Not Like That?\", Too Pure)\n*''Nothing but Time'' (1995, V/A \"Volume 16 - Copulation Explosion\")\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thewolfhounds.co.uk/  Access through the Wolfhounds website]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Creation Records artists]]\n[[Category:British indie rock groups]]\n[[Category:Experimental rock groups]]\n[[Category:British post-rock groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1991]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1997]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from London]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2016}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Moonshake\n| image               = Moonshake.jpg\n| image_size          = \n| caption             = David Callahan of Moonshake in 1994\n| background          = group_or_band\n| origin              = \n| genre               = [[Post-rock]], [[experimental rock]]\n| years_active        = 1991\u20131997\n| label               = [[Creation Records|Creation]], [[C/Z Records|C/Z]], [[Too Pure]]\n| website             = \n| past_members        = David Callahan<br />[[Margaret Fiedler McGinnis|Margaret Fiedler]]<br />[[John Frenett]]<br />Miguel \"Mig\" Moreland<br />Raymond Dickaty<br />Matt Brewer<br />Kevin Bass<br />Katherine Gifford<br />Michael Rother \n}}\n\n'''Moonshake''' were a British-based [[experimental rock]]/[[post-rock]] band, existing between 1991 and 1997.

Following the dissolution of [[The Wolfhounds]], Callahan decided to form a new band and recruited [[Margaret Fiedler]] (vocals, guitars, samplers), [[John Frenett]] (bass) and finally Miguel \"Mig\" Moreland (drums, percussion). Although Callahan originally favoured '''Skyscraper''' as a project name, the band ultimately settled on the name '''Moonshake''' (taken from a [[Can (band)|Can]] [[Moonshake (song)|single]] on the seminal [[Krautrock]]ers' ''[[Future Days]]'' album.<ref name=old4adfaq>{{Cite web|url=http://www.evo.org/4ad-faq/artists/moonshake/moonshake.txt|title=Moonshake FAQ on old 4AD Records page|website=Evo.org}}</ref> \n\nCallahan and Fiedler alternated the lead vocal and songwriting duties for the band, both favouring very different approaches: Fiedler created surreal, ethereal and atmospheric material, while Callahan favoured harsher-sounding urban fables. Due to this factor, the performance style of the band alternated considerably depending on which songwriter's songs were being played. Initially, the band's diversity added to its strength - in 2009, Fiedler would recall \"I really liked Dave Callahan's songs and his voice - obviously! That's why I wanted to be in a band with him... We were different people and wrote differently, but came from the same influences - [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Public Image Ltd.|PIL]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Eric B & Rakim]], and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|MBV]] to name a few bands. Moonshake was a collision - it was supposed to be a collision.\"<ref name=dumbingofamerica>[http://thedumbingofamerica.net/2009/10/26/history-lesson-laika-moonshake-and-the-great-margaret-fiedler/ \"Laika, Moonshake And The Great Margaret Fiedler\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612030559/http://thedumbingofamerica.net/2009/10/26/history-lesson-laika-moonshake-and-the-great-margaret-fiedler/ |date=12 June 2010 }}, The Dumbing of America webzine, 26 October 2009</ref> Regardless of the divergence in approaches, all Moonshake songs made a strong use of textures, noise and sampler technology.\n\n===First lineup - early EPs and ''Eva Luna'' (1991\u20131992)===\nMoonshake signed to [[Alan McGee]]'s [[Creation (record label)|Creation]] Records for their debut EP, ''First'', released in spring 1991. At this point, the band was continuing to follow the harsh-effected guitar-heavy sound which had characterised a lot of the last Wolfhounds recordings. The results drew comparisons with [[Sonic Youth]] and especially [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], and lacked the dub element which would feature in later recordings.  \n\nAfter the release of ''First'', Moonshake signed to the emerging independent label [[Too Pure]] (home of [[PJ Harvey]], [[Th' Faith Healers]] and [[Stereolab]]). Their first single for the new label was ''Secondhand Clothes'', which showed a leaning towards the dub-bass-heavy post-punk sound of bands such as [[Public Image Limited]] and [[The Pop Group]]. This was followed in 1992 by the ''Beautiful Pigeon'' EP (which featured two rare songwriting collaborations between Callahan and Fiedler) and then by Moonshake's debut album, ''Eva Luna''. The band began to earn many positive reviews for its unusual sample-driven and rhythmically propulsive sound, which drew on indie rock, noise-rock, breakbeats, electronica, psychedelia, dub, art-rock, [[Krautrock]] and punk.\n\n===''Big Good Angel'' and split of original lineup (1993)===\nFor 1993's mini-album ''Big Good Angel'', both Callahan and Fiedler contributed three songs each. By now the divergent styles of the two songwriters was producing too much creative tension for the band to survive for much longer. In 2009, Fiedler recalled that \"maybe after a while, the tension that was there in our writing and singing styles spilled over into real life. Things did get extremely tense on the last tour we did together in 1993 in North America.\"<ref name=dumbingofamerica/>\n\nFollowing this tour, Moonshake split in half, with Margaret Fiedler and John Frenett departing to form [[Laika (band)|Laika]] with Guy Fixsen (who had engineered ''Eva Luna''). In 2009 Fiedler would recall of the split \"it wasn't amicable. In fact it took me years to get over it, which is kinda sad to admit. I haven't spoken to Dave in years...\"<ref name=dumbingofamerica/> Earlier (in a 1995 Laika interview), she commented \"Laika is a close working collective; in Moonshake that was never possible. David and I always did what we liked. I have never compromised myself and that's the main reason why I was forced to leave the band. After the American tour David no longer wanted to work with me.\"<ref>[http://www.mail-archive.com/sloannet@sloanmusic.com/msg01830.html Laika interview in Indie List Digest, Volume 4 No.&nbsp;39], Mail-arcive.com, 24 September 1995</ref>\n\n===Second lineup and ''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'' (1994\u20131995)===\nMoonshake was left as a duo of David Callahan and Mig Moreland. With the loss of Fiedler's guitar-playing and Callahan's increasing interest in samplers, the band began moving further away from indie rock and psychedelia and deeper into Callahan's art-punk/film-noir stylings. While recording the band's second full-length album, ''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'', Callahan and Moreland drew on a host of guest musicians. [[Collapsed Lung (band)|Collapsed Lung]]'s bass player Johnny Dawe covered for the departed Frenett, while [[PJ Harvey]], [[Stereolab]] keyboard player [[Katharine Gifford]] and [[Sidi Bou Said (band)|Sidi Bou Said]] members Lee Howton and Claire Lemmon all contributed vocals. Horns were added by trumpeter Andrew Blick (Blowpipe) and saxophonist Raymond Dickaty (from [[Gallon Drunk]] and Skree).<ref name=dickatybiog>[http://www.studiosaxophones.co.uk/Data/Pages/RayMDickatyBriefBiogplusJune2009.pdf Raymond Dickaty biography], Studiosaxophones.co.uk, June 2009</ref><ref name=dickatybiog2>{{Cite web|url=https://www.raydickaty.com/biography.html|title=Biography|website=Raydickaty.com}}</ref> The band refused to use an outside producer for the sessions and self-produced instead, labelling producers as \"an overpaid imposition\".\n\n''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'' was released in 1994 (a few months before Fiedler, Frenett and Fixsen followed with their debut as [[Laika (band)|Laika]]). It revealed that Moonshake had completely banned guitars from their new sound, relying entirely on the combination of Dickaty's saxophones with looped and layered samples over the rhythm section (in a similar manner to [[The Young Gods]]). Compared to earlier recordings, the new Moonshake material was jazzier (with extensive horn parts) and more direct. Callahan wrote all of the songs for the record, with his bleak, vivid urban vision now uninterrupted and untempered by Fiedler's more psychedelic approaches. However, the use of female singers on the record \u2013 in particular, [[PJ Harvey]]'s striking guest contribution on \"Just a Working Girl\" \u2013 would ensure that for now Moonshake would retain a strong female component despite Fiedler's departure. \n\nDuring the recording of ''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'', Dickaty had joined the band as a full-time member<ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" /> and Matt Brewer was recruited as the new bass guitarist. When Moreland then left the band to join [[Moose (band)|Moose]], Callahan was left as the sole surviving original member.<ref name=old4adfaq/> Moreland was replaced on drums by Kevin Bass. Katherine Gifford continued to guest as female harmony singer on live Moonshake dates (as well as performing as lead singer on those newer songs written for a female voice, such as \"Heart Keeps Beating\"). \n\n''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'' received good reviews not matched by great sales, and some time after the release of the album Moonshake would part company with Too Pure.\n\n===The C/Z years - ''Dirty & Divine'' and final split (1996\u20131997)===\nIn 1996, Moonshake signed with the Seattle indie label [[C/Z Records]], which was determined to promote them in America. As part of this, the band joined the 1996 [[Lollapalooza]] tour of the American Midwest headlined by [[Metallica]] and [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. The latter experience proved disappointing - assigned to \"the third stage\", the band found themselves playing from the back of a truck some distance from the main arena. Dickaty would later recall \"with other so-called 'alternative' artists, we played to a largely indifferent crowd of thrill-seeking metal fans.\"<ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" /> and the band were unimpressed by their treatment by the Lollapalooza organisation.\n\nKatherine Gifford left altogether in 1996 (to form [[Snowpony]]), where she was later joined by Kevin Bass. Moonshake then recruited Michael Rother (not to be confused with his namesake in [[Neu!]]) as the new drummer. This line-up recorded the band's final album ''Dirty & Divine''. Compared to ''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'', ''Dirty & Divine'' featured a far less prominent role for female vocals (reduced more to harmonies) and reduced instrumentation, being recorded by a core group of Callahan, Brewer, Rother and Dickaty (with vocal assistance from [[Stereolab]]'s [[Mary Hansen]]). The album contained various songs which had been played in the Moonshake set during the previous two years, with subjects ranging from sailor's tales, the lives and deaths of cities, addictions to risk and danger and sexual fantasy in advertising. \n\n''Dirty & Divine'' was released in 1996 on C/Z Records and later licensed to a UK release through [[World Domination Recordings]] By this time, however, three years of self-management and hard touring with little reward had exhausted the band. In 1997, shortly after the UK release of ''Dirty & Divine'', Callahan moved to the USA (to briefly relocate to Brooklyn, New York City) and the band split up, albeit amicably.<ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" />\n\n===Post-Moonshake===\nAn EP of Moonshake remixes \u2013 originally commissioned to promote the ''Dirty & Divine'' album \u2013 was belatedly issued in 1999, though this release was disowned by Callahan.<ref name=old4adfaq/>\n\nDavid Callahan's time in the United States was brief, and he returned to London soon afterwards. He re-emerged on the London music scene in the early 2000s, setting up a multimedia/DJ/music project called '''The $urplus!'''. In its band formation (in which Callahan was joined by singer Anja Buechele) The $urplus! released a single self-titled EP containing four songs, resembling Moonshake's later material but with a lighter and less brutal approach, the inclusion of guitars, and Callahan and Buechele operating as much more equal partners than was the case with latter-day Moonshake. The band briefly experimented with an expanded garage-rock lineup, but did not release any more material (although Buechele would later contribute to the revived [[Bark Psychosis]]). Post-$urplus, Callahan involved himself in other work including DJ-ing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.howdoesitfeel.co.uk/weblog2002.html|title=how does it feel to be loved? - london club night playing indie pop, northern soul, tamla motown, girl groups, sixties heartbreak|website=Howdoesitfeel.co.uk}}</ref> Callahan would also reform [[The Wolfhounds]] (initially for live performances in 2004 and 2006, but with a full and ongoing reunion following in 2010).\n\nRaymond Dickaty would go on to join [[Spiritualized]] and would stay with them until 2002, following which he studied free improvisation. He would later work with [[The Duke Spirit]], AMP, [[Zukanican]] and his own free-jazz/rock fusion band Solar Fire Trio.<ref name=dickatybiog/><ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" /> In 2006 he joined the Ninja Tune band Loka. Relocating to Poland in 2009, he would become a member of both the Trifonidis Free Orchestra and the Tricphonix Streetband.<ref name=\"dickatybiog2\" />\n\nIn early 2019, Callahan began hinting in Facebook posts that he was working on new Moonshake material (although he provided no details on collaborators or a proposed release date) alongside his ongoing Wolfhounds work and a new parallel solo acoustic career as David Lance Callahan. He also began work on a new blog called 'On the Rock'n'Roll' dealing with \"a history of making music on the dole, incorporating anecdotes, interviews, musical selections, social history, dirty squatters, social security scroungers, workshy ponces and a whole load of cultural misappropriation\", for which the first entry related to Moonshake performing a 1997 record label showcase in New Orleans while Callahan and Michael Rother were simultaneously waiting for imminent DSS Restart interviews back in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontherocknroll.com/|title=Home &#124; Social History of Pop Music|website=Ontherocknroll.com}}</ref>\n\n==Connections==\nDuring his Moonshake years, David Callahan enjoyed brief cameos with contemporaries (and originally, [[Too Pure]] labelmates) [[Stereolab]], performing \"French Disko\" with them on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]'' in 1993, and the [[Stereolab]] spin-off project Turn On. Ray Dickaty also played with Stereolab, appearing on several tracks recorded around the time of their ''[[Emperor Tomato Ketchup (album)|Emperor Tomato Ketchup]]'' album. The connection also went the other way: Stereolab's [[Mary Hansen]] and Katherine Gifford provided backing vocals on Moonshake's last album ''Dirty and Divine''. Some copies of ''Dirty and Divine'' were even stickered to alert potential buyers to Hansen's presence.\n\n==Discography==\n===Singles===\n*''First EP'' (1991, Creation Records)\n*''Secondhand Clothes EP'' (1991, Too Pure)\n*\"Beautiful Pigeon\" (1992, Too Pure)\n*\"Lola Lola\" b/w \"Always True to You in My Fashion\" (1995, Clawfist Singles Club)\n*\"Cranes\" (1996, C/Z / World Domination)\n\n===Albums===\n*''Eva Luna'' (1992, Too Pure / 1993, Matador / Atlantic)\n*''Big Good Angel'' (Mini-album) (1993, Too Pure / Matador)\n*''The Sound Your Eyes Can Follow'' (1994, Too Pure / American)\n*''Dirty & Divine'' (1996, C/Z-BMG / World Domination)\n*''Remixes'' (1999, C/Z)\n\n===Compilation appearances===\n*''Beautiful Pigeon'' (1992, V/A \"Independent Top 20 Volume 15\", Beechwood Music; the track \"Night Tripper\" also appeared on a 7\" single given away with the vinyl edition of this LP)\n*''Just a Working Girl'' (1994, V/A \"Pop - Do We Not Like That?\", Too Pure)\n*''Nothing but Time'' (1995, V/A \"Volume 16 - Copulation Explosion\")\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thewolfhounds.co.uk/  Access through the Wolfhounds website]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Creation Records artists]]\n[[Category:British indie rock groups]]\n[[Category:Experimental rock groups]]\n[[Category:British post-rock groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1991]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1997]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from London]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonshake"}

Ante el Sal\u00f3n Independencia oye un ruido seco. Con cierto automatismo, se asoma; alcanza a ver la contorsi\u00f3n hacia arriba del Presidente, que acaba de disparar el fusil-ametralladora desde el ment\u00f3n hacia arriba. Con el instinto del m\u00e9dico, se\nacerca al cuerpo y toma el pulso. A su alrededor s\u00f3lo hay rugidos: balazos, incendio, gritos.\nEl detective David Garrido ve la escena junto a Enrique Huerta, que no se contiene:\n-\u00a1El Presidente ha muerto! \u00a1Viva Chile, mierda, viva Allende! -y coge la metralleta que ha dejado de lado, dispuesto a seguir luchando.\nRicardo Pincheira se la quita. Delante suyo, Arsenio Poupin saca un rev\u00f3lver de su camisa y trata de ponerlo sobre su sien. Otros hombres se lo arrebatan.\nSiguiendo la tradici\u00f3n de guerra del Ej\u00e9rcito chileno, Palacios estima que un general debe situarse en la vanguardia. En los alrededores no hay otro que \u00e9l mismo. A saltos, cruza Morand\u00e9 con una metralleta en ristre, y entra al Palacio cuando los prisioneros ya se agolpan en la vereda poniente.\nPalacios busca un objetivo principal: el Presidente. Pregunta por \u00e9l en el primer piso, y trepa a toda velocidad las escalas hacia el segundo. Entonces, un GAP rezagado asoma desde una sala y dispara una r\u00e1faga. Un balazo rebota en un muro, pega en el casco del teniente Iv\u00e1n Herrera y rasga una mano del general Palacios. El teniente de Inteligencia Armando Fern\u00e1ndez Larios, enviado a identificar a los defensores del Palacio, pasa su pa\u00f1uelo al general para que lo use como venda (19).\nEl general avanza recorriendo las habitaciones, hasta que un subalterno le avisa que dos soldados han hallado un cuerpo en el Sal\u00f3n Independencia. Cuando entra, ve al doctor Guij\u00f3n junto al cad\u00e1ver del Presidente, al que reconoce por su macizo reloj Galga Coultre. Lo interroga brevemente, sin creerle mucho -llega a pensar que el propio doctor pudo dispararle-. Llama al oficial de radio y entrega su breve reporte al general Nu\u00f1o:\n-Misi\u00f3n cumplida.

Some sources misattribute Guij\u00f3n's declarations to \"Allende's personal doctor\", Enrique Paris Roa, who was at La Moneda not in his professional role but as a member of Allende's cabinet. He does not appear to have made any such statement as he was executed shortly afterwards.<ref>Anne-Marie O'Connor, [http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/svolk/lat102200.htm Out of the Ashes], ''Los Angeles Times'' 22 October 2000.

However, Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Quiroga]] only confirmed the details in 1999.<ref name=Gonzalez/><ref name=Pape>Pape, Eric, [http://www.garella.com/rich/eric/exile.htm Five Degrees of Exile], ''[[Los Angeles Times]] Magazine'', 11 July 1999.

The definitive finding of suicide by international experts and the Chilean courts in 2011 seems to have put the controversy to rest. Almost all claims of an ongoing \"controversy\" regarding Allende's death seem to predate the 2011 investigations and the factual record left in its wake.\n\n[[Fidel Castro]], who had given President Allende the AK-47 used as the suicide weapon, provides an example of the speculation and political posturing that grew out of Allende's death and the Pinochet coup d'\u00e9tat. On 28 September 1973 (only two weeks after Allende's death), Castro told a Cuban crowd in [[Havana]]'s ''Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n'' that Allende had died in [[Palacio de La Moneda|La Moneda]] wrapped in a Chilean flag, firing at Pinochet troops with Fidel's rifle. Over the coming decades, the Cuban leader would continue to make public addresses using this version of events.\nCastro's public statements formed the basis of Robinson Rojas' 1975 book ''The murder of Allende and the end of the Chilean way to socialism''. Rojas asserted that the Chilean president had been killed by Pinochet's military forces while defending the palace.<ref>Rojas, Robinson (1985). ''The Murder of Allende and the End of the Chilean Way to Socialism''. Joanna Cotler Books.</ref>\n\nWith the [[Chilean transition to democracy|peaceful transition to democracy]] in Chile in 1990, the view that Allende committed suicide began to gain popular acceptance as different testimonies confirming the details of the suicide have become available in press and in documentary interviews.<ref name=Gonzalez/> Likewise, members of Allende's immediate family including his wife and his daughter, have never disputed that it was a suicide.<ref name=PERIODISTA>{{cite web |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/internacional/not_int239424,0.htm |title='&#39;EUA tentaram impedir posse de Allende, diz documento.'&#39; Washington: Associated Press-Ag\u00eancia Estado, '&#39;in'&#39; '&#39;O Estado de S.

Ante el Sal\u00f3n Independencia oye un ruido seco. Con cierto automatismo, se asoma; alcanza a ver la contorsi\u00f3n hacia arriba del Presidente, que acaba de disparar el fusil-ametralladora desde el ment\u00f3n hacia arriba. Con el instinto del m\u00e9dico, se\nacerca al cuerpo y toma el pulso. A su alrededor s\u00f3lo hay rugidos: balazos, incendio, gritos.\nEl detective David Garrido ve la escena junto a Enrique Huerta, que no se contiene:\n-\u00a1El Presidente ha muerto! \u00a1Viva Chile, mierda, viva Allende! -y coge la metralleta que ha dejado de lado, dispuesto a seguir luchando.\nRicardo Pincheira se la quita. Delante suyo, Arsenio Poupin saca un rev\u00f3lver de su camisa y trata de ponerlo sobre su sien. Otros hombres se lo arrebatan.\nSiguiendo la tradici\u00f3n de guerra del Ej\u00e9rcito chileno, Palacios estima que un general debe situarse en la vanguardia. En los alrededores no hay otro que \u00e9l mismo. A saltos, cruza Morand\u00e9 con una metralleta en ristre, y entra al Palacio cuando los prisioneros ya se agolpan en la vereda poniente.\nPalacios busca un objetivo principal: el Presidente. Pregunta por \u00e9l en el primer piso, y trepa a toda velocidad las escalas hacia el segundo. Entonces, un GAP rezagado asoma desde una sala y dispara una r\u00e1faga. Un balazo rebota en un muro, pega en el casco del teniente Iv\u00e1n Herrera y rasga una mano del general Palacios. El teniente de Inteligencia Armando Fern\u00e1ndez Larios, enviado a identificar a los defensores del Palacio, pasa su pa\u00f1uelo al general para que lo use como venda (19).\nEl general avanza recorriendo las habitaciones, hasta que un subalterno le avisa que dos soldados han hallado un cuerpo en el Sal\u00f3n Independencia. Cuando entra, ve al doctor Guij\u00f3n junto al cad\u00e1ver del Presidente, al que reconoce por su macizo reloj Galga Coultre. Lo interroga brevemente, sin creerle mucho -llega a pensar que el propio doctor pudo dispararle-. Llama al oficial de radio y entrega su breve reporte al general Nu\u00f1o:\n-Misi\u00f3n cumplida. Moneda tomada, Presidente muerto (20).\nA las 14.38, Carvajal informa a Pinochet y a Leigh.-->\n\n===Witnesses===\nAll sources seem to agree that at least the following witnesses were present:\n*Dr. Patricio Guij\u00f3n \u2013 member of the Presidential Medical Staff \u2013 ''Survived''\n*Dr. Jos\u00e9 Quiroga \u2013 member of the Presidential Medical Staff \u2013 ''Survived''\n*Arsenio Poupin Oissel \u2013 Presidential Advisor and member of the cabinet \u2013 ''Executed a few days later''\n*Enrique Huerta Corval\u00e1n \u2013 Palace Intendant (governor) \u2013 ''Executed a few days later''\n*David Garrido \u2013 Detective (Presidential Security Detail) \u2013 ''Survived''\n*Ricardo Pincheira \u2013 Detective (Presidential Security Detail) \u2013 ''Survived''\n*Pablo Manuel Zepeda Camillieri \u2013 GAP (Presidential Security) \u2013 ''Survived''\n\nOf these witnesses, only Dr. Guij\u00f3n spoke about the events immediately after they happened, and was roundly vilified for doing so. Some sources misattribute Guij\u00f3n's declarations to \"Allende's personal doctor\", Enrique Paris Roa, who was at La Moneda not in his professional role but as a member of Allende's cabinet. He does not appear to have made any such statement as he was executed shortly afterwards.<ref>Anne-Marie O'Connor, [http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/svolk/lat102200.htm Out of the Ashes], ''Los Angeles Times'' 22 October 2000.

However, Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Quiroga]] only confirmed the details in 1999.<ref name=Gonzalez/><ref name=Pape>Pape, Eric, [http://www.garella.com/rich/eric/exile.htm Five Degrees of Exile], ''[[Los Angeles Times]] Magazine'', 11 July 1999.

The definitive finding of suicide by international experts and the Chilean courts in 2011 seems to have put the controversy to rest. Almost all claims of an ongoing \"controversy\" regarding Allende's death seem to predate the 2011 investigations and the factual record left in its wake.\n\n[[Fidel Castro]], who had given President Allende the AK-47 used as the suicide weapon, provides an example of the speculation and political posturing that grew out of Allende's death and the Pinochet coup d'\u00e9tat. On 28 September 1973 (only two weeks after Allende's death), Castro told a Cuban crowd in [[Havana]]'s ''Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n'' that Allende had died in [[Palacio de La Moneda|La Moneda]] wrapped in a Chilean flag, firing at Pinochet troops with Fidel's rifle. Over the coming decades, the Cuban leader would continue to make public addresses using this version of events.\nCastro's public statements formed the basis of Robinson Rojas' 1975 book ''The murder of Allende and the end of the Chilean way to socialism''. Rojas asserted that the Chilean president had been killed by Pinochet's military forces while defending the palace.<ref>Rojas, Robinson (1985). ''The Murder of Allende and the End of the Chilean Way to Socialism''. Joanna Cotler Books.</ref>\n\nWith the [[Chilean transition to democracy|peaceful transition to democracy]] in Chile in 1990, the view that Allende committed suicide began to gain popular acceptance as different testimonies confirming the details of the suicide have become available in press and in documentary interviews.<ref name=Gonzalez/> Likewise, members of Allende's immediate family including his wife and his daughter, have never disputed that it was a suicide.<ref name=PERIODISTA>{{cite web |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/internacional/not_int239424,0.htm |title='&#39;EUA tentaram impedir posse de Allende, diz documento.'&#39; Washington: Associated Press-Ag\u00eancia Estado, '&#39;in'&#39; '&#39;O Estado de S.
