''Names of the World's Peoples: a Comprehensive Dictionary of Names in Roman-Chinese'' [{{lang|zh|\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u540d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178}}, ''Sh\u00ecji\u00e8 R\u00e9nm\u00edng F\u0101ny\u00ec D\u00e0 C\u00eddi\u01cen''].</ref>\n\nSince [[Hong Kong]] was under British control until 1997, [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] borrowed many words from English such as \u5df4\u58eb (from the word \"bus\", Mandarin: ''b\u0101sh\u00ec'', Cantonese: ''baa1 si2''), \u7684\u58eb (from \"taxi\", Man.: ''d\u012bsh\u00ec'', Can.: ''dik1 si2''), \u829d\u58eb (from \"cheese\", Man.: ''zh\u012bsh\u00ec'', Can.: ''zi1 si6''), and \u9ea5\u7576\u52de/\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3 (from \"McDonald's\", Man.: ''M\u00e0id\u0101ngl\u00e1o'', Can.: ''Mak6 dong1 lou4''), and such loanwords have been adopted into Mandarin, despite them sounding much less similar to the English words the Cantonese versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yoyochinese.com/blog/8-Chinese-words-borrowed-English-that-will-finally-make-sense-to-you|title=8 Chinese Words Borrowed From English That Will Finally Make Sense to You|website=www.yoyochinese.com|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref>\n\nForeign businesses and products are usually free to choose their own transliterations and typically select ones with positive connotations and phonetic similarity to their products: for example, {{lang|zh|\u5b9c\u5bb6}}&nbsp;([[IKEA]]) is \"proper home\". Owing to [[antonomasia]] and [[generic trademark|genericization]], these can then enter general Chinese usage: for example [[Coca-Cola]]'s {{lang|zh|\u53ef\u53e3\u53ef\u4e50}}&nbsp;(\"delicious fun\") has led to {{lang|zh|\u53ef\u4e50}} becoming the common Chinese noun for all [[cola]]s.\n\nSince the [[Kuomintang]] retreated to [[Taiwan]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], relations between the [[Republic of China]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] had been hostile, thus communication between [[Taiwan]] and [[mainland China]] became limited. For that reason, many loanwords and proper names became quite different from each other. For example, \"cheese\" in mainland China is \u829d\u58eb ''zh\u012bsh\u00ec'', while cheese in Taiwan is \u8d77\u53f8 ''q\u012ds\u012b''.\n\n==Sanskrit==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

Note that some of the words below originated in other languages but may have arrived in Chinese via English (for example \"pizza/\u62ab\u8428\" from Italian). English [[acronym]]s are sometimes borrowed into Chinese without any transcription into Chinese characters; for example \"IT\" ([[information technology]]), \"PPT\" (PowerPoint), \"GDP\" ([[Gross domestic product]]), \"APP\" ([[mobile app]]), \"KTV\" (karaoke), or \"[[DVD]]\". A rarer occurrence is the blending of the [[Latin alphabet]] with Chinese characters, as in  \"\u5361\u62c9OK\" (\"karaoke\"), \u201cT\u6064\u201d (\"T-shirt\"), \"IP\u5361\" (\"internet phone card\").<ref>Zuo, X. (2005). Language planning with respect to English into China. ''Terminology'', 11(2), 283-292.</ref>  In some instances, the loanwords exists side by side with neologisms that translate the meaning of the concept into existing Chinese morphemes. For instance, while the loanword for 'penicillin' is \u76d8\u5c3c\u897f\u6797 (p\u00e1nn\u00edx\u012bl\u00edn), a neologism that 'translates' the word was later coined, \u9752\u9709\u7d20 (q\u012bngm\u00e9is\u00f9), which means 'blue/green mold extract/essence'.  In contemporary Chinese, neologisms using native Chinese morphemes tend to be favored over loanwords that are transliterations.  In the case of penicillin, the term \u9752\u9709\u7d20 is used almost exclusively, while \u76d8\u5c3c\u897f\u6797 is viewed as an early 20th century relic.  Similarly, 'science' is now known as \u79d1\u5b66 (k\u0113xu\u00e9) 'subject/specialty study' rather than \u8d5b\u56e0\u65af (s\u00e0iy\u012bns\u012b), though it should be pointed out that the characters \u79d1\u5b66 were actually coined in the late 19th century by the Japanese as a kanji compound.\n\nIn the chart below, loanwords in Taiwan will be written in [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]] and loanwords in mainland China will be written in [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]]. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In addition to phonetic differences, [[varieties of Chinese]] such as [[Cantonese]] and [[Shanghainese]] often have distinct words and phrases left from their original languages which they continue to use in daily life and sometimes even in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. Similarly, [[Mandarin Chinese|northern dialects]] include relatively greater numbers of loanwords from nearby languages such as [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and [[Manchu language|Manchu]].\n\nThroughout China, [[Buddhism]] has also introduced words from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali language|Pali]]. More recently, foreign invasion and trade since the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s of the mid-nineteenth century has led to prolonged contact with [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Although politically-minded language reform under the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic]] and [[People's Republic of China]] have generally preferred to use [[calque]]s and [[neologism]]s in place of loanwords, a growing number {{ndash}} particularly from [[American English]] {{ndash}} have become current in modern Chinese. On the [[mainland China|mainland]], [[transcription into Chinese characters]] in official media and publications is directed by the Proper Names and Translation Service of the [[Xinhua News Agency]] and its reference work ''Names of the World's Peoples''.<ref>[[Xinhua News Agency]]. ''Names of the World's Peoples: a Comprehensive Dictionary of Names in Roman-Chinese'' [{{lang|zh|\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u540d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178}}, ''Sh\u00ecji\u00e8 R\u00e9nm\u00edng F\u0101ny\u00ec D\u00e0 C\u00eddi\u01cen''].</ref>\n\nSince [[Hong Kong]] was under British control until 1997, [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] borrowed many words from English such as \u5df4\u58eb (from the word \"bus\", Mandarin: ''b\u0101sh\u00ec'', Cantonese: ''baa1 si2''), \u7684\u58eb (from \"taxi\", Man.: ''d\u012bsh\u00ec'', Can.: ''dik1 si2''), \u829d\u58eb (from \"cheese\", Man.: ''zh\u012bsh\u00ec'', Can.: ''zi1 si6''), and \u9ea5\u7576\u52de/\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3 (from \"McDonald's\", Man.: ''M\u00e0id\u0101ngl\u00e1o'', Can.: ''Mak6 dong1 lou4''), and such loanwords have been adopted into Mandarin, despite them sounding much less similar to the English words the Cantonese versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yoyochinese.com/blog/8-Chinese-words-borrowed-English-that-will-finally-make-sense-to-you|title=8 Chinese Words Borrowed From English That Will Finally Make Sense to You|website=www.yoyochinese.com|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref>\n\nForeign businesses and products are usually free to choose their own transliterations and typically select ones with positive connotations and phonetic similarity to their products: for example, {{lang|zh|\u5b9c\u5bb6}}&nbsp;([[IKEA]]) is \"proper home\". Owing to [[antonomasia]] and [[generic trademark|genericization]], these can then enter general Chinese usage: for example [[Coca-Cola]]'s {{lang|zh|\u53ef\u53e3\u53ef\u4e50}}&nbsp;(\"delicious fun\") has led to {{lang|zh|\u53ef\u4e50}} becoming the common Chinese noun for all [[cola]]s.\n\nSince the [[Kuomintang]] retreated to [[Taiwan]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], relations between the [[Republic of China]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] had been hostile, thus communication between [[Taiwan]] and [[mainland China]] became limited. For that reason, many loanwords and proper names became quite different from each other. For example, \"cheese\" in mainland China is \u829d\u58eb ''zh\u012bsh\u00ec'', while cheese in Taiwan is \u8d77\u53f8 ''q\u012ds\u012b''.\n\n==Sanskrit==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

Note that some of the words below originated in other languages but may have arrived in Chinese via English (for example \"pizza/\u62ab\u8428\" from Italian). English [[acronym]]s are sometimes borrowed into Chinese without any transcription into Chinese characters; for example \"IT\" ([[information technology]]), \"PPT\" (PowerPoint), \"GDP\" ([[Gross domestic product]]), \"APP\" ([[mobile app]]), \"KTV\" (karaoke), or \"[[DVD]]\". A rarer occurrence is the blending of the [[Latin alphabet]] with Chinese characters, as in  \"\u5361\u62c9OK\" (\"karaoke\"), \u201cT\u6064\u201d (\"T-shirt\"), \"IP\u5361\" (\"internet phone card\").<ref>Zuo, X. (2005). Language planning with respect to English into China. ''Terminology'', 11(2), 283-292.</ref>  In some instances, the loanwords exists side by side with neologisms that translate the meaning of the concept into existing Chinese morphemes. For instance, while the loanword for 'penicillin' is \u76d8\u5c3c\u897f\u6797 (p\u00e1nn\u00edx\u012bl\u00edn), a neologism that 'translates' the word was later coined, \u9752\u9709\u7d20 (q\u012bngm\u00e9is\u00f9), which means 'blue/green mold extract/essence'.  In contemporary Chinese, neologisms using native Chinese morphemes tend to be favored over loanwords that are transliterations.  In the case of penicillin, the term \u9752\u9709\u7d20 is used almost exclusively, while \u76d8\u5c3c\u897f\u6797 is viewed as an early 20th century relic.  Similarly, 'science' is now known as \u79d1\u5b66 (k\u0113xu\u00e9) 'subject/specialty study' rather than \u8d5b\u56e0\u65af (s\u00e0iy\u012bns\u012b), though it should be pointed out that the characters \u79d1\u5b66 were actually coined in the late 19th century by the Japanese as a kanji compound.\n\nIn the chart below, loanwords in Taiwan will be written in [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]] and loanwords in mainland China will be written in [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]]. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

C. (Michael Charles)|isbn=1-85573-839-2|location=Boca Raton|oclc=56123328}}</ref> The objective of the feed system is to spread products into a uniform monolayer so products are presented to the optical system evenly, without clumps, at a constant velocity. The optical system includes lights and sensors housed above and/or below the flow of the objects being inspected. The image processing system compares objects to user-defined accept/reject thresholds to classify objects and actuate the separation system. The separation system \u2014 usually compressed air for small products and mechanical devices for larger products, like whole potatoes \u2014 pinpoints objects while in-air and deflects the objects to remove into a reject chute while the good product continues along its normal trajectory.\n\nThe ideal sorter to use depends on the application. Therefore, the product's characteristics and the user's objectives determine the ideal sensors, software-driven capabilities and mechanical platform.\n\n== Sensors ==\nOptical sorters require a combination of lights and sensors to illuminate and capture images of the objects so the images can be processed. The processed images will determine if the material should be accepted or rejected.\n\nThere are camera sorters, laser sorters and sorters that feature a combination of the two on one platform. Lights, cameras, lasers and laser sensors can be designed to function within visible light wavelengths as well as the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) [[Spectrum|spectrums]]. The optimal wavelengths for each application maximize the contrast between the objects to be separated. Cameras and laser sensors can differ in spatial resolution, with higher resolutions enabling the sorter to detect and remove smaller defects.[[File:SortingGreenBeans.jpg|thumb|Shape sorting enables the detection of same-color defects and foreign material]]\n=== Cameras ===\nMonochromatic cameras detect shades of gray from black to white and can be effective when sorting products with high-contrast defects.\n\nSophisticated color cameras with high color resolution are capable of detecting millions of colors to better distinguish more subtle color defects. [[Trichromatic]] color cameras (also called three-channel cameras) divide light into three bands, which can include red, green and/or blue within the visible spectrum as well as IR and UV.\n\nCoupled with intelligent software, sorters that feature cameras are capable of recognizing each object's color, size and shape; as well as the color, size, shape and location of a defect on a product. Some intelligent sorters even allow the user to define a defective product based on the total defective surface area of any given object.\n\n=== Lasers ===\nWhile cameras capture product information based primarily on material reflectance, lasers and their sensors are able to distinguish a material's structural properties along with their color. This structural property inspection allows lasers to detect a wide range of organic and inorganic foreign material such as insects, glass, metal, sticks, rocks and plastic; even if they are the same color as the good product.\n\nLasers can be designed to operate within specific wavelengths of light; whether on the visible spectrum or beyond.<ref>{{Cite patent|title=Scattered/transmitted light information system|gdate=1992-09-30|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1993007468A1/en}}</ref> For example, lasers can detect chlorophyll by stimulating fluorescence using specific wavelengths; which is a process that is very effective for removing foreign material from green vegetables.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Hong|last2=Lu|first2=Hongfei|last3=Zheng|first3=Yueping|last4=Lou|first4=Heqiang|last5=Chen|first5=Cuiqin|date=2010-12-01|title=Automatic sorting of Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. \u2018hongxing\u2019) using chlorophyll fluorescence and support vector machine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877410003754|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|language=en|volume=101|issue=4|pages=402\u2013408|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.028|issn=0260-8774}}</ref>\n\n=== Camera/laser combinations ===\nSorters equipped with cameras and lasers on one platform are generally capable of identifying the widest variety of attributes. Cameras are often better at recognizing color, size and shape while laser sensors identify differences in structural properties to maximize foreign material detection and removal.[[File:Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips.jpg|thumb|Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips shows invisible defects]]\n=== Hyperspectral imaging ===\nDriven by the need to solve previously impossible sorting challenges, a new generation of sorters that feature [[multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral imaging]] systems are being developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-17/issue-2/features/spectral-imaging-sorts-sugar-end-defects.html|title=StackPath|website=www.vision-systems.com|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nLike trichromatic cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras collect data from the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike trichromatic cameras, which divide light into three bands, hyperspectral systems can divide light into hundreds of narrow bands over a continuous range that covers a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the three data points per pixel collected by trichromatic cameras, hyperspectral cameras can collect hundreds of data points per pixel, which are combined to create a unique [[spectral signature]] (also called a fingerprint) for each object. When complemented by capable software intelligence, a hyperspectral sorter processes those fingerprints to enable sorting on the chemical composition of the product. This is an emerging area of [[chemometrics]].\n\n== Software-driven intelligence ==\nOnce the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing takes over to manipulate the raw data to extract and categorize information about specific features. As raw data flows from the sensors, the definitions of good and bad flow from the user who sets the accept/reject thresholds. The art and science of image processing lies in developing [[algorithms]] that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.\n\nObject-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products, and if used to control the sorter's ejection system, it improves the accuracy of ejecting defective products, which improves product quality and increases yields.\n\nNew software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.\n\n== Platforms ==\nThe considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product \u2013 large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize \u2013 and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.\n\n=== Channel sorters ===\n\nThe simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of [[color sorter]] that can be effective for products that are small, hard and dry with a consistent size and shape such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.\n\nFor products that are soft or wet or non-homogenous, which cannot be handled by a channel sorter, and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed sorters or belt sorters are ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties and chemical composition.\n\n=== Freefall and chute-fed sorters ===\n\nAs the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall, while chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point, smaller footprint and the absence of moving parts, which contributes to low maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as a frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.\n\n=== Belt Sorters ===\n\n[[File:SortingPeas.jpg|thumb|Optical sorters can function within visible light wavelengths as well as the IR and UV spectrums]] Belt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying, most fresh cut produce and wet fruits as well as waste recycling. Belt sorters stabilize product on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect product on the belt from the top only while others also launch product off the belt for in-air inspection from the bottom. Belt sorters can be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or can be equipped with two ejector systems and three outfeed streams to achieve three-way sorting.\n\n=== ADR systems ===\n\nA fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. In conjunction with a mechanical nubbin grader that follows the ADR, this combination is essentially another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.\n\n=== Single-file inspection systems ===\n\nThe platforms described above all operate in bulk mode, without needing to single-file product prior to inspection. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. Although these sorters are effective in detecting and removing foreign tablets and capsules and defects based on differences in size, shape and color, they have not been widely adopted due to the high capital costs, low throughput and slow changeover, compared to the belt sorters for tablets, capsules and softgels.\n\n=== Mechanical graders ===\n\nFor products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems that don't utilize sensors or image processing systems are often highly effective. These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Technology|Food}}\n* [[Food grading]]\n* [[Food safety]]\n* [[Food technology]]\n* [[Recycling#Sorting]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Industrial machinery]]\n[[Category:Food processing]]\n[[Category:Optics]]\n[[Category:Recycling]]\n[[Category:Applications of computer vision]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{advert|date=June 2015}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}\n}}\n'''Optical sorting''' (sometimes called '''digital sorting''') is the automated process of [[sorting]] solid products using [[cameras]] and/or [[lasers]].\n\nDepending on the types of sensors used and the software-driven intelligence of the [[image processing]] system, optical sorters can recognize objects' color, size, shape, structural properties and chemical composition.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/228148344|title=Computer vision technology for food quality evaluation|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|others=Sun, Da-Wen.|isbn=978-0-12-373642-0|edition=1st ed|location=Amsterdam|oclc=228148344}}</ref> The sorter compares objects to user-defined accept/reject criteria to identify and remove defective products and foreign material (FM) from the production line, or to separate product of different grades or types of materials.\n\nOptical sorting achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes.\n\nOptical sorters are in widespread use in the [[food industry]] worldwide, with the highest adoption in processing harvested foods such as potatoes, fruits, vegetables and nuts where it achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes.

This is an emerging area of [[chemometrics]].\n\n== Software-driven intelligence ==\nOnce the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing takes over to manipulate the raw data to extract and categorize information about specific features. As raw data flows from the sensors, the definitions of good and bad flow from the user who sets the accept/reject thresholds. The art and science of image processing lies in developing [[algorithms]] that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.\n\nObject-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products, and if used to control the sorter's ejection system, it improves the accuracy of ejecting defective products, which improves product quality and increases yields.\n\nNew software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.\n\n== Platforms ==\nThe considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product \u2013 large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize \u2013 and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.\n\n=== Channel sorters ===\n\nThe simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of [[color sorter]] that can be effective for products that are small, hard and dry with a consistent size and shape such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.\n\nFor products that are soft or wet or non-homogenous, which cannot be handled by a channel sorter, and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed sorters or belt sorters are ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties and chemical composition.\n\n=== Freefall and chute-fed sorters ===\n\nAs the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall, while chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point, smaller footprint and the absence of moving parts, which contributes to low maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as a frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.\n\n=== Belt Sorters ===\n\n[[File:SortingPeas.jpg|thumb|Optical sorters can function within visible light wavelengths as well as the IR and UV spectrums]] Belt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying, most fresh cut produce and wet fruits as well as waste recycling. Belt sorters stabilize product on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect product on the belt from the top only while others also launch product off the belt for in-air inspection from the bottom. Belt sorters can be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or can be equipped with two ejector systems and three outfeed streams to achieve three-way sorting.\n\n=== ADR systems ===\n\nA fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. In conjunction with a mechanical nubbin grader that follows the ADR, this combination is essentially another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.\n\n=== Single-file inspection systems ===\n\nThe platforms described above all operate in bulk mode, without needing to single-file product prior to inspection. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. Although these sorters are effective in detecting and removing foreign tablets and capsules and defects based on differences in size, shape and color, they have not been widely adopted due to the high capital costs, low throughput and slow changeover, compared to the belt sorters for tablets, capsules and softgels.\n\n=== Mechanical graders ===\n\nFor products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems that don't utilize sensors or image processing systems are often highly effective. These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Technology|Food}}\n* [[Food grading]]\n* [[Food safety]]\n* [[Food technology]]\n* [[Recycling#Sorting]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Industrial machinery]]\n[[Category:Food processing]]\n[[Category:Optics]]\n[[Category:Recycling]]\n[[Category:Applications of computer vision]]\n", "name_user": "ZacharyNeeld", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed grammar and added source [9]", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_sorting"}
