Leslie is the classic hero \u2013 always dressed in white, handsome, ever-courteous, enormously talented and successful. Leslie's nemesis, Fate, is the traditional melodramatic villain \u2013 usually dressed in black, sporting a black moustache and top hat, glowering at most everyone, maniacal evil laugh, grandiose plans to thwart the hero, and dogged by failure. Leslie proposes an automobile race from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Paris]] and offers the Webber Motor Car Company the opportunity to build an automobile to make the journey.  They design and build a new car named \"The Leslie Special\". Fate builds his own race vehicle, \"The Hannibal Twin-8\", complete with hidden devices of sabotage. Other car owners enter the race, including one owned by New York City's most prominent newspaper. Driving the newspaper's car is beautiful photojournalist Maggie DuBois, a vocal [[suffragette]].\n\nA seven-car race begins, but Fate's long-suffering sidekick Maximilian Meen has sabotaged four other cars (and his own, by mistake), leaving just three cars in the race. The surviving teams are Leslie with his loyal mechanic Hezekiah Sturdy, Maggie DuBois driving a [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|Stanley Steamer]] by herself, and Fate and Max. The steamer car breaks down and Maggie accepts a lift in the Leslie Special. Fate arrives first at a refueling point, the small Western frontier town of Borracho (Spanish for \u2018drunk\u2019). A local outlaw named \"Texas Jack\" becomes jealous of the attraction to Leslie shown by showgirl Lily Olay and a saloon brawl ensues. Fate sneaks outside amidst the chaos, steals the fuel he needs, and destroys the rest. Leslie uses mules to pull his car to another refueling point, where Maggie tricks Hezekiah into boarding a train and handcuffs him to a seat, lying to Leslie that Hezekiah had quit and \"wanted to go back to New York\".\n\nThe two remaining cars reach the [[Bering Strait]] and park side-by-side in a blinding snowstorm. Keeping warm during the storm, Leslie and Maggie begin to see each other as more than competitors. Mishaps, including a polar bear in Fate's car, compel all four racers to warm themselves in Leslie's car. They awaken on a small ice floe which drifts into their intended [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n port, where Hezekiah is waiting for Leslie, who in turn casts off Maggie for deceiving him. Maggie is snatched by Fate, who drives off in the lead.\n\nAfter driving across [[Asia]], both cars enter the tiny kingdom of Carpania, whose alcoholic and foppish Crown Prince Friedrich Hapnick is the [[look-alike|spitting image]] of Professor Fate. Plotters under the leadership of Baron Rolfe von Stuppe and General Kuhster kidnap the Prince, Fate, Max, and Maggie. Max escapes and joins Leslie to rescue the others. Fate is forced to masquerade as the Prince during the coronation so that the rebels can gain control of the kingdom. Leslie and Max overcome Von Stuppe's henchmen and confront Von Stuppe.  Following a climactic sword fight with Leslie, Von Stuppe attempts escape by leaping to a waiting boat, but bursts the hull and sinks it. Leslie and Max return the real Prince to the capital in time to defeat Kuhster's plan for a military coup. Fate, still masquerading as Prince Hapnick, takes refuge in a bakery but falls into a huge cake.  A [[pie fight]] ensues involving the racers, the Prince's men and the conspirators. The five racers, covered in pie filling, depart Carpania with King Friedrich's best wishes.\n\nAs the racers leave Pottsdorf (with Maggie now back in Leslie's car), it becomes a straight road race to Paris. Nearing Paris, Leslie and Maggie have a spirited argument regarding the roles of men, women and sex in relationships. Leslie stops his car just short of the finish line under the [[Eiffel Tower]] to prove that he loves Maggie more than he cares about winning the race. Fate drives past to claim the winner's mantle, but becomes indignant that Leslie let him win. Fate demands a rematch: a race back to New York.\n\nThe return race commences, with newlyweds Leslie and Maggie now a team. Fate lets them start first, then attempts to destroy their car with a small cannon. The shot misses the Leslie Special, instead knocking down the Eiffel Tower.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Professor Fate/Prince Friedrich Hapnick\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as Leslie Gallant III (\"The Great Leslie\")\n* [[Natalie Wood]] as Maggie DuBois\n* [[Peter Falk]] as Maximillian \"Max\" Meen\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Hezekiah Sturdy\n* [[Arthur O'Connell]] as Henry Goodbody\n* [[Vivian Vance]] as Hester Goodbody\n* [[Dorothy Provine]] as Lily Olay\n* [[Larry Storch]] as Texas Jack\n* [[Ross Martin]] as Baron Rolfe von Stuppe\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Mayor of Boracho\n* [[Denver Pyle]] as Sheriff of Boracho\n* [[Marvin Kaplan]] as Frisbee\n* [[George Macready]] as General Kuhster\n* [[Joyce Nizzari]] as Woman in West\n* Ken Wales as Baron's Guard\n* [[William Bryant (actor)|William Bryant]] as Baron's Guard\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes==\nDirector [[Blake Edwards]] based the film on the [[1908 New York to Paris Race]], very loosely interpreted. On February 12, 1908, the \"Greatest Auto Race\" began with six entrants, starting in New York City and racing westward across three continents. The destination was Paris, making it the first around-the-world automobile race. Only the approximate race route and the general time period were borrowed by Edwards in his effort to make \"the funniest comedy ever\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movie-gurus.com/content/reviews//945/|title=Movie Gurus - The Movie Review Community|website=movie-gurus.com}}</ref>\n\nEdwards, a studious admirer of [[silent film]], dedicated the film to film comedians [[Laurel and Hardy]].<ref name=Wasson2009/> ''The Great Race'' incorporated a great many silent era visual gags, along with slapstick, [[double entendre]]s, parodies, and absurdities.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> The film includes such time-worn scenes as a barroom brawl, the tent of the desert sheik, a sword fight, and the laboratory of the [[mad scientist]]. The [[unintended consequence]]s of Professor Fate's order, \"Push the button, Max!\", is a running gag, along with the spotless invulnerability of \"The Great Leslie\".<ref name=Wasson2009>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWr3jPbVVDkC&pg=PT98 |pages=98\u2013108 |last=Wasson |first=Sam |title=A splurch in the kisser: the movies of Blake Edwards |chapter=The Great Race (1965) |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8195-6915-8 |series=Wesleyan Film}}</ref>\n\nEdwards poked fun at later films and literature as well. The saloon brawl scene was a parody of the [[Western (genre)|western]] film genre, and a plot detour launched during the final third of the film was a direct parody of the novel,  ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'', and of the [[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|1937 film version of the story]], wherein a traveler is a lookalike for the king and stands in for him.<ref name=Wasson2009/>\n\n==Production==\nBecause of the success of Edwards' previous films ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' and ''[[A Shot in the Dark (1964 film)|A Shot in the Dark]]'', the film's budget started at a generous $6&nbsp;million. [[Mirisch Company|Mirisch Productions]] initially financed the film for [[United Artists]]. The film's escalating costs led UA to drop the film, but the project was picked up by Warners.<ref>p.239 Mirisch, Walter ''I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History''  Univ of Wisconsin Press, 27/02/2008</ref>\n\nEdwards wanted [[Robert Wagner]] to play the leading man, but studio executive [[Jack L. Warner]] insisted on Tony Curtis, possibly because of Wood's recent divorce from Wagner. ([[Burt Lancaster]] was announced at one stage.)<ref>The American Girl' Seen Lost to Films: Males Dominate Producer Jurow Mourns: Tells Plans\nScheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 08 July 1963: D13.</ref> Working with Warner, Curtis's new agent [[Irving Paul Lazar|Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar]] negotiated US$125,000 for Curtis, more than Edwards and Lemmon who were to receive US$100,000 each. After Warner signed the Curtis contract, Lazar reasoned that Edwards and Lemmon should also make US$125,000, and Warner upped its compensation to match Curtis.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x0sFjFxhoGIC&pg=PA249 |pages=249\u2013250 |title=American Prince: A Memoir |last1=Curtis |first1=Tony |authorlink1=Tony Curtis |last2=Golenbock |first2=Peter |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-307-40849-5}}</ref>\n\nNatalie Wood did not want to make ''The Great Race'', but Warner talked her into it. Wood was unhappy with her career and her personal life, having been divorced from Robert Wagner in April 1962. Warner asked Curtis if he would give a percentage of his film royalties to Wood as an enticement, but Curtis refused. He said \"I couldn't give her anything to make her want to do the movie.\"<ref name=Finstead2009>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShQPhimir3EC&pg=PT297 |page=297 |last=Finstad |first=Suzanne |title=Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-42866-0}}</ref> Instead of more money, Warner promised Wood that if she completed ''The Great Race'', she could star in [[Gavin Lambert]]'s drama ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'', a role she greatly wished to have.<ref name=Finstead2009/> Wood agreed, thinking that filming would be brief on Edwards' movie.\n\nShooting began on June 15, 1964.<ref name=Finstead2009/> Many of the sight gags for ''The Great Race'' were expensive to create, and the costs ballooned to US$12&nbsp;million by the time the film was finished. Edwards, sometimes with Wood in tow, repeatedly visited Warner in his office to ask for more money. Warner approved nearly all of the requests. When it was released, it was the most expensive comedy ever filmed.<ref name=Wasson2009/>\n\nShooting ended in November 1964. During the five months of filming, Wood's unhappiness was not visible to the cast and crew, and her characterization of Maggie DuBois was playful. Her sister [[Lana Wood]] thought that Wood looked the prettiest she ever had, but Lana sensed that the film \"was physically taxing\" for Wood.<ref name=Finstad299>Finstad, 2009, p. 299</ref> On Friday, November 27, the day after Thanksgiving, Wood wrapped the last bit of dialog work, then went home and swallowed a bottle of prescription pills. Groggy from the drugs, she called her friend [[Mart Crowley]] who took her to the hospital for emergency treatment.<ref name=Finstad299/>\n\nMusic for the film was by [[Henry Mancini]], and the costumes were designed by [[Edith Head]]. Production design, setting the period and augmenting the visual humor, was by [[Fernando Carrere]] who had designed ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' and ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' for Blake Edwards.\n\nUnique slideshow-style title design was by Ken Mundie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-great-race/|title=The Great Race|website=www.artofthetitle.com}}</ref>\n\n===Custom cars===\nThe hero's white car, named the \"Leslie Special\" was specially built by Warner Brothers to resemble a [[Thomas Flyer]], the car that won the [[1908 New York to Paris Race]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowers |first=Jesse |url=http://justacarguy.blogspot.com/2010/12/in-movie-great-race-you-may-have-liked.html |title=Just a car guy : In the movie \"The Great Race\" you may have liked the \"Leslie Special\" ... but did you think they'd ever put it in another movie?

Following this was the throwing of 4,000 pies,<ref name=Wasson2009/> the most pies ever filmed in a pie fight.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> The scene lasts four minutes and 20 seconds and cost US$200,000 to shoot; US$18,000 just for the pastry.<ref name=Wasson2009/>\n\nColorful cream pies with fillings such as raspberry, strawberry, blueberry and lemon were used.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> For [[Continuity editing|continuity]] between days of shooting, the actors were photographed at the end of each day and then made up the following morning to have the same colorful appearance, the same smears of pie crust and filling.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nEdwards told the cast that a pie fight by itself is not funny, so to make it funny they would build tension by having the hero, dressed all in white, fail to get hit with any pies. He said \"The audience will start yearning for him to get it\".<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> Finally, the hero was to take a pie in the face at \"just the right moment\".<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nShooting was halted while the actors took the weekend off. Over the weekend, the pie residue spoiled all over the scenery. When the actors returned Monday morning, the set stunk so badly that the building required a thorough cleaning and large fans to blow out the sour air. The missing pie residue was recreated carefully with more pies, and shooting resumed.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nAt first, the actors had fun with the pie fight assignment, but eventually the process grew wearisome and dangerous. Wood choked briefly on pie filling which hit her open mouth. Lemmon reported that he got knocked out a few times; he said \"a pie hitting you in the face feels like a ton of cement\".<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> At the end of shooting, when Edwards called \"cut!\", he was barraged with several hundred pies that members of the cast had hidden, waiting for the moment.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nThe pie fight scene paid homage to the early [[Mack Sennett]] practice of using a single thrown pie as comedic punctuation, but to a greater degree, it was a celebration of classic movie pie fights such as ''[[Behind the Screen]]'' (1916) with [[Charlie Chaplin]]; ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'' (1927) starring [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]]; and ''[[In the Sweet Pie and Pie]]'' (1941) with [[the Three Stooges]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK9ZsmT9B5IC&pg=PA55 |page=55 |title=The complete films of Laurel & Hardy |chapter=The Battle of the Century |last=Everson |first=William K. |publisher=Citadel Press |year=1967 |isbn=0-8065-0146-4}}</ref> In his script for ''The Great Race'', Edwards called for a \"''Battle of the Century''-style pie fight\". Though Edwards used 4,000 pies over five days, many of these were used as set dressing for continuity. Laurel and Hardy used 3,000 pies in only one day of shooting, so more are seen flying through the air. [[Leonard Maltin]] compared ''The Great Race'' pie fight to ''The Battle of the Century'' and determined that Laurel and Hardy's pacing was far superior, that the more modern film suffered from an \"incomplete understanding of slapstick\" while the 1927 pie fight remains \"one of the great scenes in all of screen comedy.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Movie comedy teams |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |publisher=New American Library |year=1970 |edition=2 |page=19}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Great Race'' was generally not well-received upon release and though it more than made its money back,<ref name=thenumbers/> it was considered a critical flop, making it the first notable failure for director Edwards. Most critics attacked its blatant and overdone slapstick humor and its lack of substance. It also suffered from comparisons with another race-themed \"epic comedy\" of 1965, ''[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]''. Film critic [[Richard Schickel]] wrote that, though the film \"bumps along very pleasantly for the most part\", Edwards failed at his attempt to recreate the slapstick atmosphere of a Laurel and Hardy comedy.<ref name=Schickel1965>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8 |page=8 |title=A $12&nbsp;Million Romp in Hollywood's Attic |last=Schickel |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Schickel |work=Life |date=September 17, 1965 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> Schickel felt that Wood was \"hopelessly miscast\", and that the energies of Lemmon and Curtis did not quite make the slapstick work.<ref name=Schickel1965/> Maltin wrote that Wood \"never looked better\" and that the film's comedy sometimes worked but was otherwise forced: \"a mixed bag\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789/page/554 554] |title=Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |publisher=Penguin |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-452-28978-9}}</ref> It currently has a 74% \"fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|id=1008852-great_race|title=The Great Race}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nBefore the film was released, the soundtrack was re-recorded in Hollywood by RCA Victor Records for release on vinyl LP.

Leslie is the classic hero \u2013 always dressed in white, handsome, ever-courteous, enormously talented and successful. Leslie's nemesis, Fate, is the traditional melodramatic villain \u2013 usually dressed in black, sporting a black moustache and top hat, glowering at most everyone, maniacal evil laugh, grandiose plans to thwart the hero, and dogged by failure. Leslie proposes an automobile race from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Paris]] and offers the Webber Motor Car Company the opportunity to build an automobile to make the journey.  They design and build a new car named \"The Leslie Special\". Fate builds his own race vehicle, \"The Hannibal Twin-8\", complete with hidden devices of sabotage. Other car owners enter the race, including one owned by New York City's most prominent newspaper. Driving the newspaper's car is beautiful photojournalist Maggie DuBois, a vocal [[suffragette]].\n\nA seven-car race begins, but Fate's long-suffering sidekick Maximilian Meen has sabotaged four other cars (and his own, by mistake), leaving just three cars in the race. The surviving teams are Leslie with his loyal mechanic Hezekiah Sturdy, Maggie DuBois driving a [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|Stanley Steamer]] by herself, and Fate and Max. The steamer car breaks down and Maggie accepts a lift in the Leslie Special. Fate arrives first at a refueling point, the small Western frontier town of Borracho (Spanish for \u2018drunk\u2019). A local outlaw named \"Texas Jack\" becomes jealous of the attraction to Leslie shown by showgirl Lily Olay and a saloon brawl ensues. Fate sneaks outside amidst the chaos, steals the fuel he needs, and destroys the rest. Leslie uses mules to pull his car to another refueling point, where Maggie tricks Hezekiah into boarding a train and handcuffs him to a seat, lying to Leslie that Hezekiah had quit and \"wanted to go back to New York\".\n\nThe two remaining cars reach the [[Bering Strait]] and park side-by-side in a blinding snowstorm. Keeping warm during the storm, Leslie and Maggie begin to see each other as more than competitors. Mishaps, including a polar bear in Fate's car, compel all four racers to warm themselves in Leslie's car. They awaken on a small ice floe which drifts into their intended [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n port, where Hezekiah is waiting for Leslie, who in turn casts off Maggie for deceiving him. Maggie is snatched by Fate, who drives off in the lead.\n\nAfter driving across [[Asia]], both cars enter the tiny kingdom of Carpania, whose alcoholic and foppish Crown Prince Friedrich Hapnick is the [[look-alike|spitting image]] of Professor Fate. Plotters under the leadership of Baron Rolfe von Stuppe and General Kuhster kidnap the Prince, Fate, Max, and Maggie. Max escapes and joins Leslie to rescue the others. Fate is forced to masquerade as the Prince during the coronation so that the rebels can gain control of the kingdom. Leslie and Max overcome Von Stuppe's henchmen and confront Von Stuppe.  Following a climactic sword fight with Leslie, Von Stuppe attempts escape by leaping to a waiting boat, but bursts the hull and sinks it. Leslie and Max return the real Prince to the capitol in time to defeat Kuhster's plan for a military coup. Fate, still masquerading as Prince Hapnick, takes refuge in a bakery but falls into a huge cake.  A [[pie fight]] ensues involving the racers, the Prince's men and the conspirators. The five racers, covered in pie filling, depart Carpania with King Friedrich's best wishes.\n\nAs the racers leave Pottsdorf (with Maggie now back in Leslie's car), it becomes a straight road race to Paris. Nearing Paris, Leslie and Maggie have a spirited argument regarding the roles of men, women and sex in relationships. Leslie stops his car just short of the finish line under the [[Eiffel Tower]] to prove that he loves Maggie more than he cares about winning the race. Fate drives past to claim the winner's mantle, but becomes indignant that Leslie let him win. Fate demands a rematch: a race back to New York.\n\nThe return race commences, with newlyweds Leslie and Maggie now a team. Fate lets them start first, then attempts to destroy their car with a small cannon. The shot misses the Leslie Special, instead knocking down the Eiffel Tower.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Professor Fate/Prince Friedrich Hapnick\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as Leslie Gallant III (\"The Great Leslie\")\n* [[Natalie Wood]] as Maggie DuBois\n* [[Peter Falk]] as Maximillian \"Max\" Meen\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Hezekiah Sturdy\n* [[Arthur O'Connell]] as Henry Goodbody\n* [[Vivian Vance]] as Hester Goodbody\n* [[Dorothy Provine]] as Lily Olay\n* [[Larry Storch]] as Texas Jack\n* [[Ross Martin]] as Baron Rolfe von Stuppe\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Mayor of Boracho\n* [[Denver Pyle]] as Sheriff of Boracho\n* [[Marvin Kaplan]] as Frisbee\n* [[George Macready]] as General Kuhster\n* [[Joyce Nizzari]] as Woman in West\n* Ken Wales as Baron's Guard\n* [[William Bryant (actor)|William Bryant]] as Baron's Guard\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes==\nDirector [[Blake Edwards]] based the film on the [[1908 New York to Paris Race]], very loosely interpreted. On February 12, 1908, the \"Greatest Auto Race\" began with six entrants, starting in New York City and racing westward across three continents. The destination was Paris, making it the first around-the-world automobile race. Only the approximate race route and the general time period were borrowed by Edwards in his effort to make \"the funniest comedy ever\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movie-gurus.com/content/reviews//945/|title=Movie Gurus - The Movie Review Community|website=movie-gurus.com}}</ref>\n\nEdwards, a studious admirer of [[silent film]], dedicated the film to film comedians [[Laurel and Hardy]].<ref name=Wasson2009/> ''The Great Race'' incorporated a great many silent era visual gags, along with slapstick, [[double entendre]]s, parodies, and absurdities.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> The film includes such time-worn scenes as a barroom brawl, the tent of the desert sheik, a sword fight, and the laboratory of the [[mad scientist]]. The [[unintended consequence]]s of Professor Fate's order, \"Push the button, Max!\", is a running gag, along with the spotless invulnerability of \"The Great Leslie\".<ref name=Wasson2009>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWr3jPbVVDkC&pg=PT98 |pages=98\u2013108 |last=Wasson |first=Sam |title=A splurch in the kisser: the movies of Blake Edwards |chapter=The Great Race (1965) |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8195-6915-8 |series=Wesleyan Film}}</ref>\n\nEdwards poked fun at later films and literature as well. The saloon brawl scene was a parody of the [[Western (genre)|western]] film genre, and a plot detour launched during the final third of the film was a direct parody of the novel,  ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'', and of the [[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|1937 film version of the story]], wherein a traveler is a lookalike for the king and stands in for him.<ref name=Wasson2009/>\n\n==Production==\nBecause of the success of Edwards' previous films ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' and ''[[A Shot in the Dark (1964 film)|A Shot in the Dark]]'', the film's budget started at a generous $6&nbsp;million. [[Mirisch Company|Mirisch Productions]] initially financed the film for [[United Artists]]. The film's escalating costs led UA to drop the film, but the project was picked up by Warners.<ref>p.239 Mirisch, Walter ''I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History''  Univ of Wisconsin Press, 27/02/2008</ref>\n\nEdwards wanted [[Robert Wagner]] to play the leading man, but studio executive [[Jack L. Warner]] insisted on Tony Curtis, possibly because of Wood's recent divorce from Wagner. ([[Burt Lancaster]] was announced at one stage.)<ref>The American Girl' Seen Lost to Films: Males Dominate Producer Jurow Mourns: Tells Plans\nScheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 08 July 1963: D13.</ref> Working with Warner, Curtis's new agent [[Irving Paul Lazar|Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar]] negotiated US$125,000 for Curtis, more than Edwards and Lemmon who were to receive US$100,000 each. After Warner signed the Curtis contract, Lazar reasoned that Edwards and Lemmon should also make US$125,000, and Warner upped its compensation to match Curtis.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x0sFjFxhoGIC&pg=PA249 |pages=249\u2013250 |title=American Prince: A Memoir |last1=Curtis |first1=Tony |authorlink1=Tony Curtis |last2=Golenbock |first2=Peter |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-307-40849-5}}</ref>\n\nNatalie Wood did not want to make ''The Great Race'', but Warner talked her into it. Wood was unhappy with her career and her personal life, having been divorced from Robert Wagner in April 1962. Warner asked Curtis if he would give a percentage of his film royalties to Wood as an enticement, but Curtis refused. He said \"I couldn't give her anything to make her want to do the movie.\"<ref name=Finstead2009>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShQPhimir3EC&pg=PT297 |page=297 |last=Finstad |first=Suzanne |title=Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-42866-0}}</ref> Instead of more money, Warner promised Wood that if she completed ''The Great Race'', she could star in [[Gavin Lambert]]'s drama ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'', a role she greatly wished to have.<ref name=Finstead2009/> Wood agreed, thinking that filming would be brief on Edwards' movie.\n\nShooting began on June 15, 1964.<ref name=Finstead2009/> Many of the sight gags for ''The Great Race'' were expensive to create, and the costs ballooned to US$12&nbsp;million by the time the film was finished. Edwards, sometimes with Wood in tow, repeatedly visited Warner in his office to ask for more money. Warner approved nearly all of the requests. When it was released, it was the most expensive comedy ever filmed.<ref name=Wasson2009/>\n\nShooting ended in November 1964. During the five months of filming, Wood's unhappiness was not visible to the cast and crew, and her characterization of Maggie DuBois was playful. Her sister [[Lana Wood]] thought that Wood looked the prettiest she ever had, but Lana sensed that the film \"was physically taxing\" for Wood.<ref name=Finstad299>Finstad, 2009, p. 299</ref> On Friday, November 27, the day after Thanksgiving, Wood wrapped the last bit of dialog work, then went home and swallowed a bottle of prescription pills. Groggy from the drugs, she called her friend [[Mart Crowley]] who took her to the hospital for emergency treatment.<ref name=Finstad299/>\n\nMusic for the film was by [[Henry Mancini]], and the costumes were designed by [[Edith Head]]. Production design, setting the period and augmenting the visual humor, was by [[Fernando Carrere]] who had designed ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' and ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' for Blake Edwards.\n\nUnique slideshow-style title design was by Ken Mundie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-great-race/|title=The Great Race|website=www.artofthetitle.com}}</ref>\n\n===Custom cars===\nThe hero's white car, named the \"Leslie Special\" was specially built by Warner Brothers to resemble a [[Thomas Flyer]], the car that won the [[1908 New York to Paris Race]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowers |first=Jesse |url=http://justacarguy.blogspot.com/2010/12/in-movie-great-race-you-may-have-liked.html |title=Just a car guy : In the movie \"The Great Race\" you may have liked the \"Leslie Special\" ... but did you think they'd ever put it in another movie?

Following this was the throwing of 4,000 pies,<ref name=Wasson2009/> the most pies ever filmed in a pie fight.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> The scene lasts four minutes and 20 seconds and cost US$200,000 to shoot; US$18,000 just for the pastry.<ref name=Wasson2009/>\n\nColorful cream pies with fillings such as raspberry, strawberry, blueberry and lemon were used.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> For [[Continuity editing|continuity]] between days of shooting, the actors were photographed at the end of each day and then made up the following morning to have the same colorful appearance, the same smears of pie crust and filling.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nEdwards told the cast that a pie fight by itself is not funny, so to make it funny they would build tension by having the hero, dressed all in white, fail to get hit with any pies. He said \"The audience will start yearning for him to get it\".<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> Finally, the hero was to take a pie in the face at \"just the right moment\".<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nShooting was halted while the actors took the weekend off. Over the weekend, the pie residue spoiled all over the scenery. When the actors returned Monday morning, the set stunk so badly that the building required a thorough cleaning and large fans to blow out the sour air. The missing pie residue was recreated carefully with more pies, and shooting resumed.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nAt first, the actors had fun with the pie fight assignment, but eventually the process grew wearisome and dangerous. Wood choked briefly on pie filling which hit her open mouth. Lemmon reported that he got knocked out a few times; he said \"a pie hitting you in the face feels like a ton of cement\".<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> At the end of shooting, when Edwards called \"cut!\", he was barraged with several hundred pies that members of the cast had hidden, waiting for the moment.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nThe pie fight scene paid homage to the early [[Mack Sennett]] practice of using a single thrown pie as comedic punctuation, but to a greater degree, it was a celebration of classic movie pie fights such as ''[[Behind the Screen]]'' (1916) with [[Charlie Chaplin]]; ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'' (1927) starring [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]]; and ''[[In the Sweet Pie and Pie]]'' (1941) with [[the Three Stooges]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK9ZsmT9B5IC&pg=PA55 |page=55 |title=The complete films of Laurel & Hardy |chapter=The Battle of the Century |last=Everson |first=William K. |publisher=Citadel Press |year=1967 |isbn=0-8065-0146-4}}</ref> In his script for ''The Great Race'', Edwards called for a \"''Battle of the Century''-style pie fight\". Though Edwards used 4,000 pies over five days, many of these were used as set dressing for continuity. Laurel and Hardy used 3,000 pies in only one day of shooting, so more are seen flying through the air. [[Leonard Maltin]] compared ''The Great Race'' pie fight to ''The Battle of the Century'' and determined that Laurel and Hardy's pacing was far superior, that the more modern film suffered from an \"incomplete understanding of slapstick\" while the 1927 pie fight remains \"one of the great scenes in all of screen comedy.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Movie comedy teams |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |publisher=New American Library |year=1970 |edition=2 |page=19}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Great Race'' was generally not well-received upon release and though it more than made its money back,<ref name=thenumbers/> it was considered a critical flop, making it the first notable failure for director Edwards. Most critics attacked its blatant and overdone slapstick humor and its lack of substance. It also suffered from comparisons with another race-themed \"epic comedy\" of 1965, ''[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]''. Film critic [[Richard Schickel]] wrote that, though the film \"bumps along very pleasantly for the most part\", Edwards failed at his attempt to recreate the slapstick atmosphere of a Laurel and Hardy comedy.<ref name=Schickel1965>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8 |page=8 |title=A $12&nbsp;Million Romp in Hollywood's Attic |last=Schickel |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Schickel |work=Life |date=September 17, 1965 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> Schickel felt that Wood was \"hopelessly miscast\", and that the energies of Lemmon and Curtis did not quite make the slapstick work.<ref name=Schickel1965/> Maltin wrote that Wood \"never looked better\" and that the film's comedy sometimes worked but was otherwise forced: \"a mixed bag\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789/page/554 554] |title=Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |publisher=Penguin |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-452-28978-9}}</ref> It currently has a 74% \"fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|id=1008852-great_race|title=The Great Race}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nBefore the film was released, the soundtrack was re-recorded in Hollywood by RCA Victor Records for release on vinyl LP.

(season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansAoS\" /> By August 2014, the studio was ready to move forward in development with the film, with a screenplay written by Joe Robert Cole.<ref name=\"Inhumans2\" /> In October 2014, the film was announced for Phase Three<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and scheduled for release July 2019.<ref name=\"Feb2015Dates\" /> By October 2015, Cole was no longer involved with the film and any potential drafts that he may have written would not be used.<ref name=\"ColeNo\" /> In April 2016, ''Inhumans'' was removed from the release schedule,<ref name=\"InhumansNoReleaseDate\" /> and would no longer be a part of Phase Three.<ref name=\"InhumansNoPhase3\" /> In July 2016, Feige said ''Inhumans'' would \"certainly\" be a part of the discussion regarding the film ideas for 2020 and 2021,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> adding the following November that he was still optimistic the film could be released in Phase Four.<ref name=\"FeigeInhumansNov2016\" /> In November 2016, Marvel Television announced the series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in September 2017, after [[Inhumans premiere|the first two episodes]] were screened in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries\" /> The series was not intended to be a reworking of the film.<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries2\" /> ABC canceled ''Inhumans'' after one season in May 2018.<ref name=\"InhumansCanceled\" />\n*{{anchor|Runaways}} '''''Runaways''''': A film based on the ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' went through a number of iterations. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] was originally hired to write a screenplay based on the property in May 2008.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> The following October, development on the film was put on hold,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved in favor of ''The Avengers'', with the earliest it could release being Phase Three.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Feige stated the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault\", adding, \"We'd love to do something with ''Runaways'' some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" /> In August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] announced ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' from the streaming service [[Hulu]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHuluOrder\" /> with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> It premiered in November 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysPremiere\"

Writers Chris Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received \"the seal of approval\" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline.<ref name=\"WritingBigWeek\" /> As promotion for ''The Avengers'', Marvel released an official [[infographic]] detailing this timeline in May 2012.<ref name=\"TimelineInfographic\" />\n\nWanting to simplify the in-universe timeline,<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to ''The Avengers'': ''Iron Man 3'' takes place about six months later, during Christmas;<ref name=\"IM3TimeFrame\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Thor: The Dark World'' is set one year later;<ref name=\"ThorTDWSynopsis1\" /> and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' is two years after.<ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''Ant-Man'' ended the phase in 2015,<ref name=\"THRAvengers2ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"AntManReleaseDate\" /> with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\"/> For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so ''Captain America: Civil War'' begins a year after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"CapCWTimeline\" /> with ''Avengers: Infinity War'' set two years after that.<ref name=\"CWIWTimeline\" /> However, producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually \"happen on top of each other\" while being less \"interlocked\" as the Phase One films were,<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> with ''Black Panther'' and ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' respectively beginning a week and several months after ''Civil War'';<ref name=\"BPProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"SMHTimeline\" /> ''Thor: Ragnarok'' beginning four years after ''The Dark World'' and two years after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"Oct2014EventMarvel\" /><ref name=\"RagnarokSDCC\" /> around the same time as ''Civil War'' and ''Homecoming'';<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> ''Doctor Strange'' taking place over a whole year and ending \"up to date with the rest of the MCU\";<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' also set two years after ''Civil War'' and shortly before ''Infinity War'';<ref name=\"AMWTimeline\" /> and both ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and its sequel ''Vol. 2'' being explicitly set in 2014,<ref name=\"GotGTimeline\" /><ref name=\"GotG2Timeline2\" /> which Feige believed would create a four-year gap between ''Vol. 2'' and ''Infinity War'', though the other MCU films up to that point do not specify years onscreen.<ref name=\"GuardiansIWFourYears\" />\n\nWhen ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not lineup, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of ''Homecoming'' into the previous films, such as ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TimelineScroll\" /> This was labeled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of ''The Avengers'' and the events of ''Civil War'', which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed.<ref name=\"SMHTimeline2\" /><ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> Additionally, dialogue in ''Civil War'' indicates that eight years pass between the end of ''Iron Man'' and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years.<ref name=\"VisionMistake\" /><ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> ''Infinity War'' co-director Joe Russo described the ''Homecoming'' eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\",<ref name=\"RussoSMHIncorrect\" /> and the mistake was ignored in ''Infinity War'' which specified that its events were taking place only six years after ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> The public response to the ''Homecoming'' mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,<ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> and in November 2018, a timeline, specifying dates for the events in each film released to that point, was included as part of the sourcebook ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'', celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the MCU.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:65%; border: none;\"\n|+ ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' timeline from November 2018<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Year(s)\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Feature films\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1943\u20131945\n| ''Captain America: The First Avenger''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2010\n| ''Iron Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2011\n| ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| ''The Avengers'', ''Iron Man 3''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| ''Thor: The Dark World''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n| ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', ''Ant-Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| ''Captain America: Civil War''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\u20132017\n| ''Doctor Strange''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n| ''Black Panther'', ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ''Avengers: Infinity War''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Notes:''' ''The Incredible Hulk'', ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', and ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' are discussed in the ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' sourcebook, but their events are not included in the timeline.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n|}\n\nThis timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of ''Black Panther'' and ''Infinity War'' by placing them in 2017. Despite the latter apparent mistakes, Thomas Bacon of [[Screen Rant]] described the timeline as \"the closest Marvel has yet come to making an official statement on just when the different MCU events are set\", bringing \"some sense of balance to the MCU continuity\".<ref name=\"10YearTimelineScreenRant\" /> Following ''Infinity War'', the Russo brothers said future films would not necessarily be set according to real time as there are \"a lot of very inventive ways of where the story can go from here\", with both ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' and ''Captain Marvel'' set earlier in the timeline;<ref name=\"AfterIW\" /> the latter is set in 1995.<ref name=\"CMTimeline\" /> ''Avengers: Endgame'' begins shortly after ''Infinity War'' and ends in 2023 after a five-year time jump.

(season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansAoS\" /> By August 2014, the studio was ready to move forward in development with the film, with a screenplay written by Joe Robert Cole.<ref name=\"Inhumans2\" /> In October 2014, the film was announced for Phase Three<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and scheduled for release July 2019.<ref name=\"Feb2015Dates\" /> By October 2015, Cole was no longer involved with the film and any potential drafts that he may have written would not be used.<ref name=\"ColeNo\" /> In April 2016, ''Inhumans'' was removed from the release schedule,<ref name=\"InhumansNoReleaseDate\" /> and would no longer be a part of Phase Three.<ref name=\"InhumansNoPhase3\" /> In July 2016, Feige said ''Inhumans'' would \"certainly\" be a part of the discussion regarding the film ideas for 2020 and 2021,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> adding the following November that he was still optimistic the film could be released in Phase Four.<ref name=\"FeigeInhumansNov2016\" /> In November 2016, Marvel Television announced the series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in September 2017, after [[Inhumans premiere|the first two episodes]] were screened in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries\" /> The series was not intended to be a reworking of the film.<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries2\" /> ABC canceled ''Inhumans'' after one season in May 2018.<ref name=\"InhumansCanceled\" />\n*{{anchor|Runaways}} '''''Runaways''''': A film based on the ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' went through a number of iterations. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] was originally hired to write a screenplay based on the property in May 2008.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> The following October, development on the film was put on hold,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved in favor of ''The Avengers'', with the earliest it could release being Phase Three.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Feige stated the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault\", adding, \"We'd love to do something with ''Runaways'' some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" /> In August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] announced ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' from the streaming service [[Hulu]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHuluOrder\" /> with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> It premiered in November 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysPremiere\"
