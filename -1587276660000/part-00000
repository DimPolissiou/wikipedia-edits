With the launching of [[MTV Base|MTV Base Africa]], artists within West Africa were able to grant themselves a large platform. Artists such as [[M.I Abaga|MI Abaga]], [[Naeto C]], and [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]] were among the first to take advantage of this, however most of the artists were merely making interpretations of hip hop and R&B. While this allowed them to build local audiences, it blocked them from a wider platform due to the language barriers in-place. [[P-Square]] released their album ''[[Game Over (P-Square album)|Game Over]]'' in 2007, which was unique for its usage of Nigerian rhythms and melodies.

The dissemination of afrobeats, afro-house, and the Angolan genres [[semba]] and [[kuduro]] in Cuba was aided in large part by African medical students from nations such as Angola, Ghana, and Nigeria who visit Cuba to study as part of higher education exchange programs. Some students would have direct contact with local Cuban artists and influence the creation of Bakos\u00f3, which fuses these African genres with local sounds such as [[Cuban rumba|rumba]] and [[Conga (music)|conga]]. An artist named Inka has been credited for coining the name of the genre. Originally the word \"Bakos\u00f3\" was used to mean \"party\". In 2019, [[Havana]]-based DJ Jig\u00fce released a documentary titled \"''Bakos\u00f3: AfroBeats of Cuba''\" (or \"''Bakos\u00f3: Afrobeats de Cuba''\") about the genre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theoutline.com/post/1591/santiago-cuba-bakoso|title=How African med students created a new genre of Cuban music|last=Kameir|first=Rawiya|website=The Outline|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829014212/https://theoutline.com/post/1591/santiago-cuba-bakoso|archive-date=2019-08-29|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://remezcla.com/film/bakoso-documentary-crowdfund-campaign/|title=This Documentary Charts the Birth of Bakos\u00f3, Cuba's Irresistible Take on Afrobeats|date=2019-01-25|website=Remezcla|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828224404/https://remezcla.com/film/bakoso-documentary-crowdfund-campaign/|archive-date=2019-08-28|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://belatina.com/we-cant-wait-to-see-the-film-bakoso-afrobeats-de-cuba/|title=Here's Why We Can't Wait to See the Film 'Bakos\u00f3 Afrobeats de Cuba'|last=Liberman|first=Dr Esther|date=2019-04-11|website=BeLatina|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829014215/https://belatina.com/we-cant-wait-to-see-the-film-bakoso-afrobeats-de-cuba/|archive-date=2019-08-29|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capradio.org/133528|title=Sacramento-Raised Filmmakers Introduce Bakos\u00f3 Music To The World|last=Radio|first=Capital Public|last2=BoulevardSacramento|first2=Inc 7055 Folsom|website=www.capradio.org|access-date=2019-08-28|last3=map278-8900480-5900|first3=CA 95826View|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829014216/http://www.capradio.org/133528|archive-date=2019-08-29|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.magazineampm.com/en/que-se-llama-bakoso/|title=Que se llama Bakos\u00f3|date=2019-07-10|website=Magazine AM:PM|access-date=2019-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828225256/https://www.magazineampm.com/en/que-se-llama-bakoso/|archive-date=2019-08-28|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.okayafrica.com/afrobeats-cuba-bakoso-film-documentary/|title=Documenting Cuba's Afrobeats: A Movement in the Making|date=2019-02-18|website=OkayAfrica|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829014217/https://www.okayafrica.com/afrobeats-cuba-bakoso-film-documentary/|archive-date=2019-08-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Afro-Trap ===\n{{Distinguish|Afroswing}}\nAfro-Trap (also written as \"Afro Trap\") is a genre that takes inspiration from both [[Sub-Saharan African music traditions]] and modern [[rap music]].

With the launching of [[MTV Base|MTV Base Africa]], artists within West Africa were able to grant themselves a large platform. Artists such as [[M.I Abaga|MI Abaga]], [[Naeto C]], and [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]] were among the first to take advantage of this, however most of the artists were merely making interpretations of hip hop and R&B. While this allowed them to build local audiences, it blocked them from a wider platform due to the language barriers in-place. [[P-Square]] released their album ''[[Game Over (P-Square album)|Game Over]]'' in 2007, which was unique for its usage of Nigerian rhythms and melodies. Meanwhile, artists such as [[Flavour N'abania]] were able to find success by embracing older genres, such as [[highlife]], and remixing it into something more modern, as seen in his song \"[[Nwa Baby|Nwa Baby (Ashawo Remix)]]\". By 2011, artists within the burgeoning scene were beginning to become stars across the continent. P-Square released \"[[Chop My Money|Chop My Money (Remix)]]\" alongside popular Senegalese-American artist [[Akon]] in 2011.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nHowever it wasn't until \"[[Oliver Twist (D'banj song)|Oliver Twist]]\", released by Nigerian artist [[D'banj]] in the summer of 2011, that afrobeats first saw international success.
