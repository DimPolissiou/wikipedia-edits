It was produced by the band and recorded at [[Morgan Studios]] in London in September 1973.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n==Recording==\nFollowing Black Sabbath's 1972\u20131973 world tour in support of their album, ''[[Vol. 4 (Black Sabbath album)|Vol. 4]]'', the group returned to Los Angeles to begin work on its successor. Pleased with ''Vol. 4'', the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the [[Record Plant]] Studios. The band rented a house in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]] and began writing in the summer of 1973 but, due in part to [[substance abuse]] and fatigue, were unable to complete any songs. \"Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on ''Vol. 4'' and we really got discontent,\" guitarist and songwriter [[Tony Iommi]] said. \"Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything.\"<ref name=\"Rosen76\"/>  In 2013, bassist [[Geezer Butler]] told ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo magazine]]'' that after the tour in support of ''Vol. 4'' the band was \"absolutely, completely exhausted\" and by the time they played the [[Hollywood Bowl]], \"Tony collapsed. It was really touch-and-go at one point whether he'd survive or not because he was totally depleted. So we had to cancel the rest of the tour and we actually took time off for the first time since the band started. We got away from each other and had a social life. Then we came back together to start on the next album, and couldn't come up with anything.\" In his autobiography ''[[I Am Ozzy]]'', singer [[Ozzy Osbourne]] states that in the time leading up to the [[Hollywood Bowl]] \"Tony had been doing [[cocaine|coke]] literally for days \u2013 we all had, but Tony had gone over the edge. I mean, that stuff just twists your whole idea of reality.  You start seeing things that aren't there. And Tony was ''gone''. Near the end of the gig he walked off stage and collapsed.\" Regarding his writer's block, Iommi admitted to Phil Alexander in 2013, \"I panicked because I didn't have a single idea about what to write. It might have been the drugs, it could have been the pressure, but either way I felt it was my fault.\" The band were also disappointed to discover that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant had been replaced with a \"[[Tonto's Expanding Head Band#The TONTO synthesizer|giant synthesizer]]\" by [[Stevie Wonder]], who had recently recorded there.\n\nAfter a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to the UK, where they rented [[Clearwell Castle]] in [[The Forest of Dean]], Gloucestershire, England, which the likes of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Mott the Hoople]] and [[ Deep Purple ]] wrote and recorded in. The medieval surroundings may have revitalised the band musically, but also left a sinister impression; in the liner notes to the 1998 live album ''Reunion'', Iommi recalls, \"We rehearsed in the armoury there and one night I was walking down the corridor with Ozzy and we saw this figure in a black cloak&nbsp;... We followed this figure back into the armoury and there was absolutely no one there. Whoever it was had disappeared into thin air! The people that owned the castle knew all about this ghost and they said, 'Oh yes, that's the ghost of so and so. We were like 'What!?'\"  Adds Butler: \"We rehearsed in the [[dungeon]]s and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things, and stuff started coming out again\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=77}}</ref> While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of \"[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (song)|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]\", which set the tone for the new material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=79}}</ref> In 2001 Butler admitted to Dan Epstein of ''Guitar World'', \"We almost thought that we were finished as a band&nbsp;... Once Tony came out with the initial riff for 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' we went 'We're baaaack!'\" The spooky atmosphere at Clearwell Castle perfectly complemented the band's practice of playing practical jokes on one another. In the documentary ''Black Sabbath, Volume 1: 1970\u20131978'' Iommi recalls, \"I've got to be honest, we frightened the life out of each other. We had to leave in the end, everybody terrified of each other because we were playing jokes on each other and nobody knew who was doing it... We used to leave and drive all the way home and drive back the next day. It was really silly.\" In his autobiography Osbourne cracks, \"We weren't so much the Lords of Darkness as the Lords of Chickenshit when it came to that kind of thing&nbsp;... We wound each other up so much none of us got any sleep. You'd just lie there with your eyes wide open, expecting an empty suit of armour to walk into your bedroom at any second to shove a dagger up your arse.\" Osbourne also writes that he nearly burned the castle down one night when he fell asleep with his boot in the fire. Osbourne said that when it came to the shenanigans [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] typically \"got the worst of it\", with the drummer eventually going to bed at night with a dagger.\n\nAlthough the band's then-manager [[Patrick Meehan (producer)|Patrick Meehan]] received credit as co-producer, Iommi said years later that Meehan had virtually no actual involvement in the album's production, saying \"Meehan's ego got involved, and he stuck his name down as producer\".<ref name=\"Rosen76\">{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=76}}</ref> Recording was completed at [[Morgan Studios]] in [[Willesden]], North London in 1973.

Then we ended up falling out of favour with each other.\" Fuelled by rampant drug and alcohol use within the band, tensions began to mount. Iommi began to resent doing the lion's share of songwriting and studio work, thus having no social life.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" /> Bassist Butler also began complaining that vocalist Osbourne had become too reliant on him for lyrics.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" />\n\n==Composition==\nBuilding on the stylistic changes introduced on ''Vol. 4'', new songs incorporated synthesizers, strings, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and more complex arrangements. Iommi experimented with [[sitar]] and [[bagpipes]] in the studio but was not able to master the instruments to his satisfaction.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" />\nThe lyrics also delved into new areas, with ''Mojo'' opining in 2013, \"The title track led into an expansive set as Butler's lyrics contemplated the mysteries of birth and [[DNA]] in 'A National Acrobat' and \"Spiral Architect', respectively.\" \"'A National Acrobat' was just me thinking about who selects what [[sperm]] gets through to the egg\", Butler explained in the liner notes to ''Reunion'' in 1998. \"'Spiral Architect' was about life's experiences being added to a person's DNA to create a unique individual.  I used to get very contemplative on certain substances. I still do, but without those substances.\"  In his autobiography ''Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven & Hell with Black Sabbath'', Iommi reveals that the initial riff for \"A National Acrobat\" was written by Butler, to which the guitarist \"added bits to it. Geezer can write some great stuff.\"  According to the book ''How Black Was Our Sabbath'', the band invited an orchestra to play on 'Spiral Architect' \"but couldn't cram all of the musicians and their instruments into Morgan Studios.  They ended up at the nearby Pye Studio along the road, with Ozzy trying to explain what he wanted them to play like some sort of mad conductor. He had no written music to give the orchestra, he just hummed the part and they picked it up.\"\n\nOsbourne purchased a [[Moog synthesizer]]; though he \"didn't know how to use it\" according to Iommi, he was still able to compose the song \"Who Are You?\" with it.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" />  In his memoir Osbourne states, \"I'd written it one night at Bulrush Cottage while I was loaded and fiddling around with a Revox tape machine and my [[ARP 2600]].\" The singer also writes that ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' was \"Our last truly great album, I think... And with the music we'd managed to strike just the right balance between our old heaviness and our new, 'experimental' side.\" \"Killing Yourself to Live\" was a Butler composition written while he was in [[hospital]] for kidney problems caused by heavy drinking. Ward was also drinking heavily, and the song reflects the problems caused by their \"extreme\" lifestyles. An early incarnation of the song can be heard on the live albums ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'' and ''[[Past Lives (Black Sabbath album)|Past Lives]]''. The [[instrumental]] \"Fluff\" was composed by Iommi and named after [[BBC Radio 1|BBC]] radio disc jockey [[Alan Freeman|Alan \"Fluff\" Freeman]].<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> Freeman was one of the few radio personalities in Britain to play Sabbath's music on-air.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" />\n\n==Artwork==\n[[Drew Struzan]] (who would later create the iconic cover to [[Alice Cooper]]'s ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' LP) was the artist requested to do the cover painting, under the direction of Pacific Eye & Ear's [[Ernie Cefalu]]. The idea behind the artwork was to depict a man dying a horrible death on the front cover, and on the back cover the same man dying a \"good\" death. It depicts a man on a bed, seemingly having a [[nightmare]] or a vision of being attacked by [[demon]]s in human form. At the top of the bed is a large skull with long, outstretched arms and 666 (the [[Number of the Beast]]) written below it. The other side of the album features the opposite of the front cover, as shown [http://www.originalalbumcoverart.com/struzan/sabbath-bloody-sabbath.php here]. Inside the gatefold sleeve there is a photo of the band members shown over a photo of a bedroom. In his autobiography Osbourne enthuses, \"I fucking loved that cover.\" The ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' artwork continued the Sabbath tradition of offering provocative covers; in a 1992 ''Guitar World'' interview [[Metallica]] singer and guitarist [[James Hetfield]] recalled, \"I discovered Black Sabbath by digging through my older brother's record collection. Their album covers really drew me in. I immediately thought, 'I gotta put this on.' And when I did, I couldn't believe it. It was like, 'Whoa! Heavy as shit.' Sabbath was everything that the Sixties weren't. Their music was so cool because it was completely anti-hippie. I hated [[the Beatles]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Love (band)|Love]] and all that other happy shit.\"\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"SBS AMG Review\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev2Score = favourable<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/sabbath-bloody-sabbath-19740213 |title=Black Sabbath: ''Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath'' |last=Fletcher |first=Gordon |date=14 February 1974 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=#154 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev3Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/black-sabbath/albumguide |title=Black Sabbath: Album Guide |magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=5 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427215415/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/black-sabbath/albumguide |archivedate=27 April 2012 }}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n|rev4score = 4/10<ref>{{cite book|last1= Weisbard|first1= Eric|last2= Marks|first2= Craig|date= 1995|title= Spin Alternative Record Guide|publisher= Vintage Books|isbn= 1841955515}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev5score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book |last= C.

For the first time in their career, the band began to receive favourable reviews in the mainstream press, with ''Rolling Stone'' calling the album \"an extraordinarily gripping affair\", and \"nothing less than a complete success\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" /> Later reviewers such as [[AllMusic]]'s Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as \"a masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection\", while also displaying \"a newfound sense of finesse and maturity\".<ref name=\"SBS AMG Review\">{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r2002|tab=review |label=''Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath'' > Review\" |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |accessdate={{date|2008-02-25}}}}</ref> The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the United States.

The album would go on to be regarded in high esteem by the band members themselves; when asked by ''Guitar for the Practicing Musician'' in 1994 which songs he would like to see on the upcoming Black Sabbath box set, Butler replied, \"Probably anything off of ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath''. The song \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" itself. It was a whole new era for us. We felt really open on that album. It was a great atmosphere, good time, great coke! Just like a new birth for me.

To this day, I haven't heard anything as heavy that has as much soul.\"  Brent Hinds of [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] agrees, telling Nick Bowcott in 2008, \"The 'dreams turn to nightmares, Heaven turns to Hell' riff at the end of that song is unbeatable.\"  Kirk Hammett of Metallica cites \"Killing Yourself to Live\" as his favourite Black Sabbath song, revealing in the Holiday 2008 issue of ''Guitar World'' that \"A lot of people gravitate toward the album's title track, 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', but for me this is the stand out cut on the album.\"\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs by [[Tony Iommi]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]].\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Side one\n| title1   = [[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (song)|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]\n| length1  = 5:45\n| title2   = A National Acrobat\n| length2  = 6:16\n| title3   = Fluff\n| note3    = [[instrumental]]\n| length3  = 4:11\n| title4   = Sabbra Cadabra\n| length4  = 5:59\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Side two\n| title5   = Killing Yourself to Live\n| length5  = 5:41\n| title6   = Who Are You?\n| length6  = 4:11\n| title7   = Looking for Today\n| length7  = 5:06\n| title8   = Spiral Architect\n| length8  = 5:29\n}}\n\nThe initial [[Castle Communications]] CD release from 1986 (NELCD 6017) also featured a live version of \"Cornucopia\" from ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'' as a bonus track.

It was produced by the band and recorded at [[Morgan Studios]] in London in September 1973.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n==Recording==\nFollowing Black Sabbath's 1972\u20131973 world tour in support of their album, ''[[Vol. 4 (Black Sabbath album)|Vol. 4]]'', the group returned to Los Angeles to begin work on its successor. Pleased with ''Vol. 4'', the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the [[Record Plant]] Studios. The band rented a house in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]] and began writing in the summer of 1973 but, due in part to [[substance abuse]] and fatigue, were unable to complete any songs. \"Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on ''Vol. 4'' and we really got discontent,\" guitarist and songwriter [[Tony Iommi]] said. \"Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything.\"<ref name=\"Rosen76\"/>  In 2013, bassist [[Geezer Butler]] told ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo magazine]]'' that after the tour in support of ''Vol. 4'' the band was \"absolutely, completely exhausted\" and by the time they played the [[Hollywood Bowl]], \"Tony collapsed. It was really touch-and-go at one point whether he'd survive or not because he was totally depleted. So we had to cancel the rest of the tour and we actually took time off for the first time since the band started. We got away from each other and had a social life. Then we came back together to start on the next album, and couldn't come up with anything.\" In his autobiography ''[[I Am Ozzy]]'', singer [[Ozzy Osbourne]] states that in the time leading up to the [[Hollywood Bowl]] \"Tony had been doing [[cocaine|coke]] literally for days \u2013 we all had, but Tony had gone over the edge. I mean, that stuff just twists your whole idea of reality.  You start seeing things that aren't there. And Tony was ''gone''. Near the end of the gig he walked off stage and collapsed.\" Regarding his writer's block, Iommi admitted to Phil Alexander in 2013, \"I panicked because I didn't have a single idea about what to write. It might have been the drugs, it could have been the pressure, but either way I felt it was my fault.\" The band were also disappointed to discover that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant had been replaced with a \"[[Tonto's Expanding Head Band#The TONTO synthesizer|giant synthesizer]]\" by [[Stevie Wonder]], who had recently recorded there.\n\nAfter a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to the UK, where they rented [[Clearwell Castle]] in [[The Forest of Dean]], Gloucestershire, England, which the likes of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Mott the Hoople]] and [[ Deep Purple ]] wrote and recorded in. The medieval surroundings may have revitalised the band musically, but also left a sinister impression; in the liner notes to the 1998 live album ''Reunion'', Iommi recalls, \"We rehearsed in the armoury there and one night I was walking down the corridor with Ozzy and we saw this figure in a black cloak&nbsp;... We followed this figure back into the armoury and there was absolutely no one there. Whoever it was had disappeared into thin air! The people that owned the castle knew all about this ghost and they said, 'Oh yes, that's the ghost of so and so. We were like 'What!?'\"  Adds Butler: \"We rehearsed in the [[dungeon]]s and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things, and stuff started coming out again\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=77}}</ref> While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of \"[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (song)|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]\", which set the tone for the new material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=79}}</ref> In 2001 Butler admitted to Dan Epstein of ''Guitar World'', \"We almost thought that we were finished as a band&nbsp;... Once Tony came out with the initial riff for 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' we went 'We're baaaack!'\" The spooky atmosphere at Clearwell Castle perfectly complemented the band's practice of playing practical jokes on one another. In the documentary ''Black Sabbath, Volume 1: 1970\u20131978'' Iommi recalls, \"I've got to be honest, we frightened the life out of each other. We had to leave in the end, everybody terrified of each other because we were playing jokes on each other and nobody knew who was doing it... We used to leave and drive all the way home and drive back the next day. It was really silly.\" In his autobiography Osbourne cracks, \"We weren't so much the Lords of Darkness as the Lords of Chickenshit when it came to that kind of thing&nbsp;... We wound each other up so much none of us got any sleep. You'd just lie there with your eyes wide open, expecting an empty suit of armour to walk into your bedroom at any second to shove a dagger up your arse.\" Osbourne also writes that he nearly burned the castle down one night when he fell asleep with his boot in the fire. Osbourne said that when it came to the shenanigans [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] typically \"got the worst of it\", with the drummer eventually going to bed at night with a dagger.\n\nAlthough the band's then-manager [[Patrick Meehan (producer)|Patrick Meehan]] received credit as co-producer, Iommi said years later that Meehan had virtually no actual involvement in the album's production, saying \"Meehan's ego got involved, and he stuck his name down as producer\".<ref name=\"Rosen76\">{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=76}}</ref> Recording was completed at [[Morgan Studios]] in [[Willesden]], North London in 1973.

Then we ended up falling out of favour with each other.\" Fuelled by rampant drug and alcohol use within the band, tensions began to mount. Iommi began to resent doing the lion's share of songwriting and studio work, thus having no social life.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" /> Bassist Butler also began complaining that vocalist Osbourne had become too reliant on him for lyrics.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" />\n\n==Composition==\nBuilding on the stylistic changes introduced on ''Vol. 4'', new songs incorporated synthesizers, strings, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and more complex arrangements. Iommi experimented with [[sitar]] and [[bagpipes]] in the studio but was not able to master the instruments to his satisfaction.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" />\nThe lyrics also delved into new areas, with ''Mojo'' opining in 2013, \"The title track led into an expansive set as Butler's lyrics contemplated the mysteries of birth and [[DNA]] in 'A National Acrobat' and \"Spiral Architect', respectively.\" \"'A National Acrobat' was just me thinking about who selects what [[sperm]] gets through to the egg\", Butler explained in the liner notes to ''Reunion'' in 1998. \"'Spiral Architect' was about life's experiences being added to a person's DNA to create a unique individual.  I used to get very contemplative on certain substances. I still do, but without those substances.\"  In his autobiography ''Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven & Hell with Black Sabbath'', Iommi reveals that the initial riff for \"A National Acrobat\" was written by Butler, to which the guitarist \"added bits to it. Geezer can write some great stuff.\"  According to the book ''How Black Was Our Sabbath'', the band invited an orchestra to play on 'Spiral Architect' \"but couldn't cram all of the musicians and their instruments into Morgan Studios.  They ended up at the nearby Pye Studio along the road, with Ozzy trying to explain what he wanted them to play like some sort of mad conductor. He had no written music to give the orchestra, he just hummed the part and they picked it up.\"\n\nOsbourne purchased a [[Moog synthesizer]]; though he \"didn't know how to use it\" according to Iommi, he was still able to compose the song \"Who Are You?\" with it.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" />  In his memoir Osbourne states, \"I'd written it one night at Bulrush Cottage while I was loaded and fiddling around with a Revox tape machine and my [[ARP 2600]].\" The singer also writes that ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' was \"Our last truly great album, I think... And with the music we'd managed to strike just the right balance between our old heaviness and our new, 'experimental' side.\" \"Killing Yourself to Live\" was a Butler composition written while he was in [[hospital]] for kidney problems caused by heavy drinking. Ward was also drinking heavily, and the song reflects the problems caused by their \"extreme\" lifestyles. An early incarnation of the song can be heard on the live albums ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'' and ''[[Past Lives (Black Sabbath album)|Past Lives]]''. The [[instrumental]] \"Fluff\" was composed by Iommi and named after [[BBC Radio 1|BBC]] radio disc jockey [[Alan Freeman|Alan \"Fluff\" Freeman]].<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> Freeman was one of the few radio personalities in Britain to play Sabbath's music on-air.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" />\n\n==Artwork==\n[[Drew Struzan]] (who would later create the iconic cover to [[Alice Cooper]]'s ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' LP) was the artist requested to do the cover painting, under the direction of Pacific Eye & Ear's [[Ernie Cefalu]]. The idea behind the artwork was to depict a man dying a horrible death on the front cover, and on the back cover the same man dying a \"good\" death. It depicts a man on a bed, seemingly having a [[nightmare]] or a vision of being attacked by [[demon]]s in human form. At the top of the bed is a large skull with long, outstretched arms and 666 (the [[Number of the Beast]]) written below it. The other side of the album features the opposite of the front cover, as shown [http://www.originalalbumcoverart.com/struzan/sabbath-bloody-sabbath.php here]. Inside the gatefold sleeve there is a photo of the band members shown over a photo of a bedroom. In his autobiography Osbourne enthuses, \"I fucking loved that cover.\" The ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' artwork continued the Sabbath tradition of offering provocative covers; in a 1992 ''Guitar World'' interview [[Metallica]] singer and guitarist [[James Hetfield]] recalled, \"I discovered Black Sabbath by digging through my older brother's record collection. Their album covers really drew me in. I immediately thought, 'I gotta put this on.' And when I did, I couldn't believe it. It was like, 'Whoa! Heavy as shit.' Sabbath was everything that the Sixties weren't. Their music was so cool because it was completely anti-hippie.

To this day, I haven't heard anything as heavy that has as much soul.\"  Brent Hinds of [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] agrees, telling Nick Bowcott in 2008, \"The 'dreams turn to nightmares, Heaven turns to Hell' riff at the end of that song is unbeatable.\"  Kirk Hammett of Metallica cites \"Killing Yourself to Live\" as his favourite Black Sabbath song, revealing in the Holiday 2008 issue of ''Guitar World'' that \"A lot of people gravitate toward the album's title track, 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', but for me this is the stand out cut on the album.\"\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs by [[Tony Iommi]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]].\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Side one\n| title1   = [[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (song)|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]\n| length1  = 5:45\n| title2   = A National Acrobat\n| length2  = 6:16\n| title3   = Fluff\n| note3    = [[instrumental]]\n| length3  = 4:11\n| title4   = Sabbra Cadabra\n| length4  = 5:59\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Side two\n| title5   = Killing Yourself to Live\n| length5  = 5:41\n| title6   = Who Are You?\n| length6  = 4:11\n| title7   = Looking for Today\n| length7  = 5:06\n| title8   = Spiral Architect\n| length8  = 5:29\n}}\n\nThe initial [[Castle Communications]] CD release from 1986 (NELCD 6017) also featured a live version of \"Cornucopia\" from ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'' as a bonus track.

They then included a monthly Saturday night called \"Brains\" (which was actually a residency for musical act [[The Avalanches]]).\n\nBorazio and Rogers eventually convinced The Avalanches that they could close the lane, remove the bins and stage a laneway party. With the addition of promotional material and other acts, the inaugural St. Jerome's Laneway Festival was launched. The line-up included: The Avalanches, [[Art of Fighting (band)|Art of Fighting]], [[Eskimo Joe]], [[The Dears]], [[Cut Copy]], [[Architecture in Helsinki]], [[Clare Bowditch]], the Feeding Set and [[Gersey]].\n\nFollowing a total attendance of 1,400 people at the first Laneway Festival, it was announced later in 2005 that Laneway was expanding to [[Sydney]], Australia.\n\n===2006===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Art of fighting.jpg|thumb|[[Art of Fighting (band)|Art of Fighting]] performing at the 2006 Sydney Laneway]]\nIn 2006, both Melbourne and Sydney hosted a lineup of both international and domestic artists, including: [[Broken Social Scene]], [[Les Savy Fav]], [[Gossip (band)|Gossip]], [[Pretty Girls Make Graves]], [[The Avalanches]], [[The Posies]], [[The Hold Steady]], [[The Raveonettes]] and [[The Drones (Australian band)|The Drones]].\n\n===2007===\nJust as Sydney's Laneway was becoming further established, Brisbane venue The Zoo staged the festival in 2007.

Whether it was St Vincent absolutely shredding her guitar, FKA mesmerising with her gymnastic ability or CB demonstrating equal levels of lyrical dexterity, the women proved that gender does not dictate the skill of the performer or strength of the performance.\n\n[[Mac Demarco]] spearheaded a gang of rabble-rousers that included [[Connan Mockasin]], Peter Bibby and [[Pond (Australian band)|Pond]] whose mutual admiration for each other culminated in plenty of guest appearances onstage and memorable scenes off.\n\nA surprise hit of the festival was Agnes Demarco, mother of Mac, along for the ride as a special guest MC. Armed with bundles of immaculately researched notes, Agnes introduced several bands in each Australian city and charmed audiences with her boundless charisma and enthusiasm.\n\nMark Kneebone (Laneway NZ co-promoter): \"Auckland turned on another great day for the biggest Laneway yet. FKA Twigs set a record for the biggest crowd, [[Vic Mensa]] tore the roof off mid afternoon and the new Thunderdome stage set up saw 700 punters rammed inside an abandoned silo doing a circle dance with [[Dan Deacon]].\"\n\n===2016===\n2016 saw Laneway Festival prove itself once again to be one of the most celebrated music events in the country. With more tickets sold than ever before, Laneway punters were treated to a huge selection of artists across all genres - the dreamy tones of [[Beach House]] and [[DIIV]] made for a transcendental experience whilst [[FIDLAR]], [[Violent Soho]] and [[DMA's]] represented the guitar establishment- but it was Melbourne's premier underground Psychotic rock band Tripmonks that stole the show with their unexpected nudity. [[Flume (musician)|Flume]] debuted his new material including special guest appearances from MC [[Vince Staples]] and Kai, and [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]] turned electro-pop on its head with her energetic dancer-infused sundowner set.\n\n===2017===\nLaneway Festival 2017 was the thirteenth edition of the boutique inner-city festival. In keeping with tradition, the line-up showcased the best new international talent ([[Car Seat Headrest]], [[Nao (singer)|NAO]], [[Mick Jenkins (rapper)|Mick Jenkins]], [[Aurora]] & more), while welcoming back acts that once occupied early slots to close out the festival. Local favourites like [[D.D Dumbo]], [[Camp Cope]], [[A.B. Original]] and [[Tash Sultana]] pulled some of the biggest crowds, and [[Tame Impala]] closed out the festival in Fremantle (their hometown) with the very final show of their incredible album cycle. 2017 also saw Laneway Festival launch a new podcast, throw a Hottest 100 Backyard Party in Brisbane, and introduce the 1800-LANEWAY hotline in every Australian city.\n\nDanny Rogers (Laneway co-founder): \"Laneway 2017 saw another Australian artist close out the festival - Tame Impala - from the festival perspective, having the guys return to Australia to do Laneway as their final run of shows on their incredibly successful album world tour was everything Laneway could ever hope for and more. The band opened up on the Laneway festival all the way back before they released their first record, so this had significant meaning for us and them. It was also a year where we also focused heavily on Australian / NZ talent, demonstrating to the world that artists from this region are continually standing up alongside their international pals. The festival also presented for the first time an Australian hip hop outfit and we could think of no act more appropriate than A.B Original who also hosted the festival. Strong crowds turned out for all shows with our new site in NZ at Albert Park lifting the Kiwi show up to being a genuine world class event.\"\n\n===2018===\nNew collaborations included I OH YOU's Block Party's, David Moyle's Royal Moyle food extravaganza, and the debut of Luke Henery's ([[Violent Soho]]) latest exhibition, \"Everybody Needs A Home\". It was the largest line-up so far and featured [[Mac DeMarco]], [[The Internet (band)|The Internet]] and [[Pond (Australian band)|POND]], as well as the Australian debut of [[(Sandy) Alex G]], Dream Wife, [[Shame (band)|Shame]], [[S U R V I V E]] and [[Slowdive]]. Triple J live broadcast the Adelaide event, with Ben & Liam mc'ing the event.\n\n===2019===\nLaneway Festival returned in 2019 as one of the most respected and popular events on the Australian music calendar. Our fifteenth edition saw the announcement of a new venue for Melbourne Laneway, now taking place at the lush Footscray Park. The move marked an exciting new chapter for Melbourne Laneway, which started in a Lonsdale St alleyway and came of age at Footscray Community Arts Centre.\n\nThis year's line-up once again showcased the best rising local and international talent. R&B queen [[Jorja Smith]] made her Australian debut alongside [[Clairo]], [[Denzel Curry]] and [[Rex Orange County]]. It was the twenty-year-old English crooner ROC who ignited crowd-singalongs across every leg of the festival with his lovelorn sentiments and dreamy tunes. Off the back of their record-breaking tour, [[Gang of Youths]] closed out the festival in Fremantle with a very special performance marking the last show of their album cycle.\n\nThe festival also teamed up with Girls Rock! to empower the next generation of women and gender-diverse musicians. The inaugural Girls Rock! collab featured a unique lineup, which saw artists like [[Alex Lahey]], [[Alex the Astronaut]], [[Courtney Barnett]], Georgia Maq ([[Camp Cope]]) and [[Middle Kids]] take to the stage. The line-up differed across each Australian festival date and also featured a stack of local favourites and Girls Rock! affiliated bands \u2013 a true highlight of 2019.\n\n===2020===\n2020 saw St. Jerome's Laneway Festival return as one of the most celebrated music events across the country. With more tickets sold than ever before, the sixteenth edition marked its most successful year ever. Over 100,000 music fans attended events in Auckland, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle and Sydney, where the event was held at [[The Domain]] for the very first time.\n\nWith performances from a diverse range of over 35 artists, the blockbuster bill featured the summer's best line-up of local and international acts including our brilliant 2020 headliners, [[The 1975]] and [[Charli XCX]] who were met with an army of fans in each city. From the wildly popular and hugely entertaining [[Oliver Tree]], to the charismatic BENEE (whose Laneway tour will surely go down as a career-defining moment in her unstoppable rise) and [[JID]] who announced himself as a powerful new force in hip-hop, the festival was jam-packed with incredible performances.

Festival began in 2005 when Jerome Borazio and Danny Rogers decided that summers in [[Melbourne]] would be far better with more live music in unique settings. First came the \"St. Jerome's Summer Series\" each Sunday afternoon, featuring \"new\" bands of the time, including [[The Presets]] and [[Architecture in Helsinki]]. They then included a monthly Saturday night called \"Brains\" (which was actually a residency for musical act [[The Avalanches]]).\n\nBorazio and Rogers eventually convinced The Avalanches that they could close the lane, remove the bins and stage a laneway party. With the addition of promotional material and other acts, the inaugural St. Jerome's Laneway Festival was launched. The line-up included: The Avalanches, [[Art of Fighting (band)|Art of Fighting]], [[Eskimo Joe]], [[The Dears]], [[Cut Copy]], [[Architecture in Helsinki]], [[Clare Bowditch]], the Feeding Set and [[Gersey]].\n\nFollowing a total attendance of 1,400 people at the first Laneway Festival, it was announced later in 2005 that Laneway was expanding to [[Sydney]], Australia.\n\n===2006===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Art of fighting.jpg|thumb|[[Art of Fighting (band)|Art of Fighting]] performing at the 2006 Sydney Laneway]]\nIn 2006, both Melbourne and Sydney hosted a lineup of both international and domestic artists, including: [[Broken Social Scene]], [[Les Savy Fav]], [[Gossip (band)|Gossip]], [[Pretty Girls Make Graves]], [[The Avalanches]], [[The Posies]], [[The Hold Steady]], [[The Raveonettes]] and [[The Drones (Australian band)|The Drones]].\n\n===2007===\nJust as Sydney's Laneway was becoming further established, Brisbane venue The Zoo staged the festival in 2007.

Whether it was St Vincent absolutely shredding her guitar, FKA mesmerising with her gymnastic ability or CB demonstrating equal levels of lyrical dexterity, the women proved that gender does not dictate the skill of the performer or strength of the performance.\n\n[[Mac Demarco]] spearheaded a gang of rabble-rousers that included [[Connan Mockasin]], Peter Bibby and [[Pond (Australian band)|Pond]] whose mutual admiration for each other culminated in plenty of guest appearances onstage and memorable scenes off.\n\nA surprise hit of the festival was Agnes Demarco, mother of Mac, along for the ride as a special guest MC. Armed with bundles of immaculately researched notes, Agnes introduced several bands in each Australian city and charmed audiences with her boundless charisma and enthusiasm.\n\nMark Kneebone (Laneway NZ co-promoter): \"Auckland turned on another great day for the biggest Laneway yet. FKA Twigs set a record for the biggest crowd, [[Vic Mensa]] tore the roof off mid afternoon and the new Thunderdome stage set up saw 700 punters rammed inside an abandoned silo doing a circle dance with [[Dan Deacon]].\"\n\n===2016===\n2016 saw Laneway Festival prove itself once again to be one of the most celebrated music events in the country. With more tickets sold than ever before, Laneway punters were treated to a huge selection of artists across all genres - the dreamy tones of [[Beach House]] and [[DIIV]] made for a transcendental experience whilst [[FIDLAR]], [[Violent Soho]] and [[DMA's]] represented the guitar establishment- but it was Melbourne's premier underground Psychotic rock band Tripmonks that stole the show with their unexpected nudity. [[Flume (musician)|Flume]] debuted his new material including special guest appearances from MC [[Vince Staples]] and Kai, and [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]] turned electro-pop on its head with her energetic dancer-infused sundowner set.\n\n===2017===\nLaneway Festival 2017 was the thirteenth edition of the boutique inner-city festival. In keeping with tradition, the line-up showcased the best new international talent ([[Car Seat Headrest]], [[Nao (singer)|NAO]], [[Mick Jenkins (rapper)|Mick Jenkins]], [[Aurora]] & more), while welcoming back acts that once occupied early slots to close out the festival. Local favourites like [[D.D Dumbo]], [[Camp Cope]], [[A.B. Original]] and [[Tash Sultana]] pulled some of the biggest crowds, and [[Tame Impala]] closed out the festival in Fremantle (their hometown) with the very final show of their incredible album cycle. 2017 also saw Laneway Festival launch a new podcast, throw a Hottest 100 Backyard Party in Brisbane, and introduce the 1800-LANEWAY hotline in every Australian city.\n\nDanny Rogers (Laneway co-founder): \"Laneway 2017 saw another Australian artist close out the festival - Tame Impala - from the festival perspective, having the guys return to Australia to do Laneway as their final run of shows on their incredibly successful album world tour was everything Laneway could ever hope for and more. The band opened up on the Laneway festival all the way back before they released their first record, so this had significant meaning for us and them. It was also a year where we also focused heavily on Australian / NZ talent, demonstrating to the world that artists from this region are continually standing up alongside their international pals. The festival also presented for the first time an Australian hip hop outfit and we could think of no act more appropriate than A.B Original who also hosted the festival. Strong crowds turned out for all shows with our new site in NZ at Albert Park lifting the Kiwi show up to being a genuine world class event.\"\n\n===2018===\nNew collaborations included I OH YOU's Block Party's, David Moyle's Royal Moyle food extravaganza, and the debut of Luke Henery's ([[Violent Soho]]) latest exhibition, \"Everybody Needs A Home\". It was the largest line-up so far and featured [[Mac DeMarco]], [[The Internet (band)|The Internet]] and [[Pond (Australian band)|POND]], as well as the Australian debut of [[(Sandy) Alex G]], Dream Wife, [[Shame (band)|Shame]], [[S U R V I V E]] and [[Slowdive]]. Triple J live broadcast the Adelaide event, with Ben & Liam mc'ing the event.\n\n===2019===\nLaneway Festival returned in 2019 as one of the most respected and popular events on the Australian music calendar. Our fifteenth edition saw the announcement of a new venue for Melbourne Laneway, now taking place at the lush Footscray Park. The move marked an exciting new chapter for Melbourne Laneway, which started in a Lonsdale St alleyway and came of age at Footscray Community Arts Centre.\n\nThis year's line-up once again showcased the best rising local and international talent. R&B queen [[Jorja Smith]] made her Australian debut alongside [[Clairo]], [[Denzel Curry]] and [[Rex Orange County]]. It was the twenty-year-old English crooner ROC who ignited crowd-singalongs across every leg of the festival with his lovelorn sentiments and dreamy tunes. Off the back of their record-breaking tour, [[Gang of Youths]] closed out the festival in Fremantle with a very special performance marking the last show of their album cycle.\n\nThe festival also teamed up with Girls Rock! to empower the next generation of women and gender-diverse musicians. The inaugural Girls Rock! collab featured a unique lineup, which saw artists like [[Alex Lahey]], [[Alex the Astronaut]], [[Courtney Barnett]], Georgia Maq ([[Camp Cope]]) and [[Middle Kids]] take to the stage. The line-up differed across each Australian festival date and also featured a stack of local favourites and Girls Rock! affiliated bands \u2013 a true highlight of 2019.\n\n===2020===\n2020 saw St. Jerome's Laneway Festival return as one of the most celebrated music events across the country. With more tickets sold than ever before, the sixteenth edition marked its most successful year ever. Over 100,000 music fans attended events in Auckland, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle and Sydney, where the event was held at [[The Domain]] for the very first time.\n\nWith performances from a diverse range of over 35 artists, the blockbuster bill featured the summer's best line-up of local and international acts including our brilliant 2020 headliners, [[The 1975]] and [[Charli XCX]] who were met with an army of fans in each city. From the wildly popular and hugely entertaining [[Oliver Tree]], to the charismatic BENEE (whose Laneway tour will surely go down as a career-defining moment in her unstoppable rise) and [[JID]] who announced himself as a powerful new force in hip-hop, the festival was jam-packed with incredible performances. [[King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard]], [[Tones and I]] and [[Ruel (singer)|Ruel]] played to adoring hometown crowds while [[Omar Apollo]], [[Oliver Tree]] and [[bbno$]] all made their Australian debuts.\n\nThe sold-out Laneway Festival afterparties, one off charity gig by [[The 1975]] and Ruel, plus the 50c donation from every beer sold at the festival collectively raised over $150,000 to support those who were affected by the devastating [http://2019%E2%80%9320_Australian_bushfire_season Black Summer bushfire crisis in Australia].

It was the first home of the Art Museum of Toronto. Today, it is part of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]. The structure was built in 1817, making it the [[List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto|12th oldest surviving building in Toronto and the oldest remaining brick house]]. It was built for [[D'Arcy Boulton (1785\u20131846)|D'Arcy Boulton]] (1785\u20131846), one of the town's leading citizens and part of the powerful Boulton family that played an important role in the [[Family Compact]]. Originally, it was considerably west of the city, but over time, the city grew and Boulton sold his considerable land holdings surrounding the manor at great profit.\n\nThe house was inherited by D'Arcy's son and Toronto mayor, [[William Henry Boulton]]. When he died in 1874, the house passed to his widow, Hariette Boulton. She remarried the prominent scholar [[Goldwin Smith]], and the couple lived in The Grange for the rest of their lives. Upon Goldwin's Smith's death in 1910, the couple bequeathed the building to the Art Museum of Toronto (now known as the Art Gallery of Ontario) and The Grange became the new home of the gallery. The building also served as the first home of the Ontario College of Art and Design, now [[OCAD University]]. Since the early 20th century, the Art Gallery of Ontario has been expanded a number of times and the original manor makes up only a small part of the structure.\n\nThe expanse of lawn to the south of the building, what is left of the grounds, is operated by the city as [[Grange Park (Toronto)|Grange Park]]. Also on the old grounds is St. George Church, which was founded by the Boultons and which burned down in 1956. Only the tower and original Sunday school building remain.\n\nIn 1970, The Grange was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in recognition of the house's significance to the [[history of Toronto]].<ref>[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=0549&oqeName=The+Grange&oqfName=The+Grange The Grange]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada</ref><ref>[http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=7529&pid=0 The Grange], National Register of Historic Places</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history (1817\u20131910)===\nThe Grange was built in 1817 as the home of D'Arcy Boulton (1785\u20131846; son of [[G. D'Arcy Boulton]]), his wife, Sarah Anne, and their eight children. It was located on 100 acres (40 ha) of land that extended from Queen Street in the south to Bloor Street in the north and from Beverley Street east to McCaul Street. The north section of the property was sold to Bishop Strachan in 1828, to be used for the establishment of King\u2019s College, an Anglican university. Property to the south was donated in the 1830s and 1840s for St. George the Martyr Church and [[St. Patrick's Market]], both still in existence.\n\nSarah Anne Robinson was born in Lower Canada in 1789 to a [[United Empire Loyalists|loyalist]] family who had previously moved north from Virginia after the American Revolution. D\u2019Arcy Boulton, in contrast, immigrated to Canada in 1797 when he was 12 years old. The two met through Sara Anne\u2019s older brother Peter Robinson and settled at The Grange (so named for the Boulton family estate in Lincolnshire, England) in 1817.<ref name=\"House Guests\" />\n\nSarah Anne quickly established herself as a superior hostess and The Grange became a central site for the social and political happenings of early Toronto. Over the course of their lives, the Boultons had eight children. D\u2019Arcy Boulton made his living running a dry good store and obtaining three governments posts. He died in 1846 after a rough decade of family deaths, a cholera epidemic and financial strain. When D\u2019Arcy died, the house was left to Sarah Anne. She put the house and the land around it in trust for her daughter-in-law, Harriette, as a marriage settlement. Thus, the house was under Harriette\u2019s control and it was Harriette who bequeathed the house to the Art Museum of Toronto. The head of the household was now his eldest son, William Henry Boulton.<ref name=\"House Guests\" />\n[[File:Smith and friends.jpg|thumb|[[Goldwin Smith]] (centre foreground) at The Grange with friends.

William, however, was fond of gambling and Harriette and her mother-in-law, Sarah Anne, spent much time trying to keep The Grange in Boulton hands.<ref name=\"House Guests\" /> William died in 1874, leaving Harriette as the sole owner of The Grange.\n\nIn 1875, Harriette married [[Goldwin Smith]], British scholar and political writer. Goldwin Smith was once [[regius professor of history]] at [[Oxford University]] and personal tutor to the [[Prince of Wales]]. However, he decided to settle in Toronto in 1871. Smith was a proud supporter of the arts in Toronto and founded journals and encouraged young artists to paint Canadian subjects.<ref name=\"House Guests\" /> The couple lived happily in The Grange until their deaths in 1909 (Harriette) and 1910 (Goldwin).\n\n===Re-purposing into an art gallery (1911\u2013present)===\n{{main|Art Gallery of Ontario}}\n[[File:People visiting the Grange.jpg|thumb|The Grange in 1910, shortly before it was transformed into an art museum]]\nBy the turn of the 20th century, it was decided that Toronto should have an art gallery, much like many other major cities at the time. By 1900, local artist George Reid was the president of the Ontario Society of Artists and was pushing for the creation of an art gallery. Between Reid and Edmund Walker (prominent banker and champion of the arts), a campaign was established to raise money for the gallery scheme. In 1902, the Smiths joined the cause and decided to bequeath The Grange as the first location of the Art Museum of Toronto. It wasn\u2019t until 1913 that the museum held its first exhibition, composed of Smith\u2019s own collection.<ref name=\"House Guests\" /> By 1966, The Art Museum of Toronto was renamed the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) and The Grange now sits on the south side of the larger AGO building.\n\nFrom the early days of the Art Museum of Toronto until the restoration of the 1960s, The Grange underwent a variety of changes, including electrification and the inclusion of an apartment for a live-in caretaker. In 1918 and 1926 respectively, additional gallery wings were added to the AGO and several rooms in The Grange were used as staff offices. A tea room was also established in the drawing room and breakfast parlour.\n\nBy the 1960s, the AGO was once again expanding, therefore forging a new path for The Grange. This was a time in Ontario of increased interest in heritage preservation and so the Junior Women's Committee raised $650 000 for a restoration project. This money was used to restore The Grange to how it would have looked in 1835. In 1970, The Grange was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].<ref name=\"House Guests\" /> Designated by the City of Toronto under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'' by By-law 130-91<ref>[http://app.toronto.ca/HeritagePreservation/details.do?folderRsn=2435769&propertyRsn=666769 317 Dundas Street West], City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties</ref>\n\nToday, The Grange houses the Norma Ridley Members\u2019 Lounge and exhibit spaces. While it is no longer furnished as a historic house depicting the 1830s, it retains its historic roots and architectural integrity. Visitors to the AGO are free to enjoy The Grange and explore the exhibits, take a tour, and speak to a volunteer about The Grange history.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:AGO Grange.jpg|thumb|The [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]'s five-storey main building situated behind The Grange, a two-storey [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-styled residence]]\nThe original house, designed by an unknown architect, was two storeys high, 60 by 40 feet (18&nbsp;m \u00d7&nbsp;12&nbsp;m) in area, with a low hipped roof containing a circular window. It is likely that the bricks were made on the property from the heavily clayed soil. The windows are double-hung with brick lintels and louvered wooden shutters. They are 12-over-12 sash on the main floor and 8-over-8 sash on the second. The front door has a moulded reveal and a semi-circular fanlight, with separate sidelights.  Originally, the gate of the building extended to Queen Street, however the gates have been crowded back to the head of John Street.  As was the custom at the time, The Grange was built in the middle of a hundred-acre park lot. It received the name \"The Grange\" after a family estate in England.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 19: A Sketch of The Grange|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/a-sketch-of-the-grange|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto Revisited|access-date=2015-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927125237/http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/a-sketch-of-the-grange|archive-date=2018-09-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nReflecting a sense of Georgian balance, the front door opened onto a central hall with the dining room on the left and the drawing room on the right. At the back of the house and on the second floor were bedrooms for the family. There were also four large rooms in the attic, probably for the servants. The kitchen, food storage areas and scullery were in the basement.\n\nThe property saw two major expansions, with the first series of expansions occurring in the 1840s. Several additions were made to the house, possibly because there had been a fire (this is difficult to confirm). These changes included the enlargement of the drawing room; the elimination of three bedrooms to create a large second-floor assembly room; and an addition on the west end to house an office. William Boulton, who was mayor of Toronto four times and a Member of Parliament, might have needed such a space. The front hall was also enlarged and a new central staircase installed. The painted glass window depicting the family crest was also added. This crest is a [[canting arms|visual play on the name]] Boulton, as it shows a barrel pierced by an arrow, or ''bolt'', with a hogshead of wine or ''tun''. The family motto&nbsp;\u2014 ''\"Dux vitae ratio\"'' (\"The guide to life is reason\")&nbsp;\u2014 rests below the crest, always reminding the Boultons of their British ancestry.<ref name=\"House Guests\">[Charlotte Gray.

Smith was a scholar and a large library was added to the west of the house. The Georgian-style staircase was replaced with an angular Victorian-style oak stair that skirted the painted window. The wooden front porch was replaced with a stone version.\n\n===Gardens===\n{{main|Grange Park (Toronto)|l1=Grange Park}}\nOriginally, there was a path running up to the front steps, with an oval drive around the front lawn. The house stood on raised ground with terraces, as it does today. Around it was a mix of open spaces, stands of trees and flower gardens. Behind the house were vegetable and fruit gardens and, farther north, an orchard. The front lawn of The Grange, now known as the Grange Park, was central to Grange activities. This was the site for many garden parties, church school picnics and even a royal visit.\n\nSeveral images of The Grange show a domed glass conservatory on the east side of the house, which would have been filled with plants readily available from catalogues. One 1827 catalogue advertised 79 varieties of apple among other fruit and ornamental trees, as well as a wide variety of shrubs, flowers and greenhouse plants. We know that there was an orchard house on the property growing peaches, nectarines and grapes. William Boulton won prizes at the 1844 Toronto Horticultural Society Show for geraniums, roses, greenhouse plants and pansies. The gardener, John Gray, named a geranium he developed ''[[Pelargonium]] boultonianum'' after the Boultons.\n\nWith the sale of the southern part of the property in the mid-19th century, a new entrance to The Grange was created, which included a lodge \u2014 home to William Chin, the butler, and his family. Other buildings included a stable, a root house, a tool house and a drive shed. Later in the century, cottages for married servants were also erected.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|The Grange (Toronto)|The Grange}}\n*[https://ago.ca/about/the-grange Art Gallery of Ontario \u2013 The Grange]\n*[http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMDC-PICTURES-R-246&R=DC-PICTURES-R-246 The Grange, 1909, from the Toronto Public Gallery]\n\n{{NHSC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grange}}\n[[Category:Houses in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Museums in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Ontario]]\n[[Category:National Historic Sites in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in Canada]]\n[[Category:Art Gallery of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Designated heritage properties in Ontario]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2011}}\n{{Infobox historic site\n| name = The Grange\n| image = The Grange.JPG\n| caption = The Grange in 2005\n| coordinates = {{coord|43|39|11|N|79|23|33|W|region:CA-ON_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| location = {{comma separated entries|1=|2=[[Toronto]]|3=[[Ontario]]}}\n| beginning_label = Established\n| built = 1817\n| original_use = [[Manor house]]\n| current_use = A wing of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]\n| governing_body = Art Gallery of Ontario\n| designation1 = National Historic Site of Canada\n| designation1_date = 1970\n}}\n\n'''The Grange''' is a historic [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] manor in downtown [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].

It designs, makes and maintains [[aircraft engines|engines]] for commercial and military [[aircraft]] as well as [[rocket engines]] for [[launch vehicle]]s and [[satellites]].\n\nSome of its notable past developments, alone or in partnership, include the [[Snecma M88|M88]] for the [[Rafale]], [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593|Olympus 593]] for [[Concorde]], [[CFM56]]/[[CFM International LEAP|CFM-LEAP]] for single-aisle airliners, and the [[Vulcain (rocket engine)|Vulcain]] engines for the [[Ariane 5]].\n\nIt has 15,700 employees working at 35 production sites, offices, and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|MRO]] facilities worldwide. It files an average of nearly 500 [[patent]]s each year. Safran Aircraft Engines is a subsidiary of [[Safran]].\n\n==Major Programmes==\nIn terms of volume, the most impactful commercial aero engine produced by Safran Aircraft Engines is the [[CFM International CFM56]] [[turbofan]] powerplant. This engine is both developed and manufactured via a 50-50 [[joint venture]] company, [[CFM International]], which Safran splits the ownership of with the American industrial conglomerate [[General Electric]] (GE). Established during the 1970s, the CFM56 was not an early success; by April 1979, the joint venture had not received a single order in five years and was allegedly two weeks away from being dissolved.<ref name=160712PR/> The program was saved when [[Delta Air Lines]], [[United Airlines]], and [[Flying Tiger Line|Flying Tigers]] chose the CFM56 to re-engine their [[DC-8]]s; shortly thereafter, it was also selected to re-engine the [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] fleet of the [[United States Air Force]], this operating being the engine's biggest customer.<ref name=160712PR/> Following this turn of fortune, tens of thousands of engines have since been produced over the decades.

It designs, makes and maintains [[aircraft engines|engines]] for commercial and military [[aircraft]] as well as [[rocket engines]] for [[launch vehicle]]s and [[satellites]].\n\nSome of its notable past developments, alone or in partnership, include the [[Snecma M88|M88]] for the [[Rafale]], [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593|Olympus 593]] for [[Concorde]], [[CFM56]]/[[CFM International LEAP|CFM-LEAP]] for single-aisle airliners, and the [[Vulcain]] engines for the [[Ariane 5]].\n\nIt has 15,700 employees working at 35 production sites, offices, and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|MRO]] facilities worldwide. It files an average of nearly 500 [[patent]]s each year. Safran Aircraft Engines is a subsidiary of [[Safran]].\n\n==Major Programmes==\nIn terms of volume, the most impactful commercial aero engine produced by Safran Aircraft Engines is the [[CFM International CFM56]] [[turbofan]] powerplant. This engine is both developed and manufactured via a 50-50 [[joint venture]] company, [[CFM International]], which Safran splits the ownership of with the American industrial conglomerate [[General Electric]] (GE). Established during the 1970s, the CFM56 was not an early success; by April 1979, the joint venture had not received a single order in five years and was allegedly two weeks away from being dissolved.<ref name=160712PR/> The program was saved when [[Delta Air Lines]], [[United Airlines]], and [[Flying Tiger Line|Flying Tigers]] chose the CFM56 to re-engine their [[DC-8]]s; shortly thereafter, it was also selected to re-engine the [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] fleet of the [[United States Air Force]], this operating being the engine's biggest customer.<ref name=160712PR/> Following this turn of fortune, tens of thousands of engines have since been produced over the decades.

King Seon led campaigns that resulted in the absorbing of many [[Heishui Mohe|northern Mohe]] tribes and southwest [[Little Goguryeo]] kingdom, which was located in the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], was absorbed into Balhae.

A Khitan invasion took the capital of Balhae after a 25-day siege in 926. After defeating Balhae, the Khitans established a puppet state founded by its new Khitan rulers, the [[Dongdan Kingdom]], which was annexed by Liao in 936.
