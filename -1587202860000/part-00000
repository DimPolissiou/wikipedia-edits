After paying a small $2 fee to join the scheme, the victim is sent a [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] template for the self-same work-from-home scheme, and instructed to post these advertisements around their local area&nbsp;&ndash; the victim is simply \"stuffing envelopes\" with flyer templates that perpetuate the scheme.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> Originally found as printed adverts in [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, variants of this scam have expanded into more modern media, such as [[television]] and [[radio]] adverts, and forum posts on the [[Internet]].\n\nIn some countries, law enforcement agencies work to fight work-at-home schemes. In 2006, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] established [[Project False Hopes]], a federal and state law enforcement sweep that targets bogus business opportunity and work at home scams. The crackdown involved more than 100 law enforcement actions by the FTC, the Department of Justice, the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], and law enforcement agencies in eleven states.<ref name=\"falsehopes\"/>\n\nLegitimate [[home-based business]] and [[telecommuting]] opportunities do exist, and many people do their jobs in the comfort of their own homes, but anyone seeking such an employment opportunity can be scammed by accepting a home employment offer. A 2007 report in the United States suggested that about 97% of work-at-home offers were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/TakeControlOfYourLife/story?id=3003833&page=1 |title=Working From Home: Don't Get Scammed |publisher=ABC: Good Morning America |date= 2007-04-03|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> Many legitimate jobs at home require some form of post-high-school education, such as a [[college degree]] or certificate, or [[trade school]], and some experience in the field in an office or other supervised setting. Additionally, many legitimate at-home jobs are not like those in schemes are portrayed to be, as they are often performed at least some of the time in the company's office, require more [[self discipline]] than a traditional job, and have a higher risk of [[firing]].\n\nCommon types of work found in work-at-home schemes include:\n* Stuffing envelopes.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> The victim sees a flyer advertising a job stuffing envelopes, with \"up to 1,000 envelopes a week that you can stuff... with postage and address already affixed!\", offering a payment of $1\u20132 per envelope. To apply for the job, the victim is required to send a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] for information and a small processing fee. In return, the victim is sent a template for the flyer they had originally seen; the envelopes they stuff are from other people who answer the flyer, and the payment is the processing fee.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Assembly of items of some type, such as [[crafts]], [[jewellery]] or medical equipment. The worker is required to pay up front for materials and construction kits, and when they attempt to sell the finished products back to the scheme's organiser, they are told that the products \"don't meet our specifications\", leaving the worker with assembled products and no buyer.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Processing medical claims. The worker pays several hundred dollars for medical billing software, but will later discover that most medical clinics process their own bills, outsource their billing to established firms rather than individuals, or have stricter requirements than the purchased software can provide.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* [[Forum spam]]ming. Usually advertised as some variant of \"email processing\", the worker is simply given instructions on spamming online forums, and told they can make money by selling these same instructions online.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Sales of a product or service that is difficult or impossible to sell. This is often done in the form of a [[pyramid scheme]].\n* Talking on a [[phone sex]] hotline.\n\nSome adverts offer legitimate forms of work that really do exist, but exaggerate the salary and understate the effort that will have to be put into the job, or exaggerate the amount of work that will be available. Many such ads do not even specify the type of work that will be performed. Some similar schemes do not advertise work that would be performed at home, but may instead offer occasional, sporadic work away from home for large payments, paired with a lot of free time. Some common offers fitting this description are acting as [[Extra (actor)|extras]], [[mystery shopping]] (which in reality requires hard work, is paid close to minimum wage, and most importantly, does not require an up-front fee to join) and working as a [[nanny]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Police issue warning over horror film extras scam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/11/police-warning-horror-film-extras-scam|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Mystery Shopping in Australia |url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/mystery-shopper-jobs-in-australia-and-the-companies-to-work-for/#Mystery-Shopping-in-Australia-|publisher=Finance Informer|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Nanny Scams |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/jobsearchscams/a/nanny-scams.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Signs of a scam==\nSigns of a work-at-home scam versus a legitimate job may include:\n* Payment of fee is required prior to starting employment. In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] states that ''under no circumstances'' should anyone be forced to pay a fee in order to obtain a job. In many countries, no legitimate employer will require a fee be paid as a condition of starting work (except perhaps a small amount for a [[criminal background check]]).\n* Pay is too good to be true. Though there may be legitimate jobs in existence in which employees are paid to perform the particular task in question, even from home, in reality, they would be paid a wage that is fair for that type of work and level of education, not the $40 per hour or $3000 per week that is typically offered in a work-at-home scheme.\n* Employer will seemingly hire anyone, with no experience necessary and no qualifications. Legitimate work-at-home employers will only be interested in those who have the proper experience, skills, certification, and other qualifying factors, and will give at least some scrutiny to an applicant seeking employment. But the perpetrator of a work-at-home scheme is only interested in the payment required to join.\n* Company is little known, and does not seemingly have a customer base bringing them revenue from which they can pay employees. \n* Company name is similar to, but not exactly the same as a well known, legitimate company.\n* Company does not appear to have a permanent location. Its address, phone number, and website appear to be centered on recruitment of employees, not customers.\n* Company tries to show unnatural benefits of working in a very short period.\n* Company repeatedly tries to make contact until the victim replies.\n* Fake news stories and Web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-04-2011/scam-alert-fake-news-websites.html|title=Fake News Websites Pitch Get-Rich-Quick Schemes|author=Sid Kirchheimer|date=2011-04-20|publisher=AARP}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe consequences of falling for a work-at-home scheme may be as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://how-to-make-money-working-from-home.academehub.com/50-ways-to-work-from-home-with-online-business-or-not/ |title=Work-at-Home Schemes |publisher=Bbb.org |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref>\n* Loss of money: It may be only the initial fee to join, which may be a large or small amount. Some scammers will run after receiving just this fee. Others will continue to ask for more in order for the promise of high pay to be fulfilled. Some will act on a two-way street, actually issuing paychecks, all the while receiving payments of greater value in return, which in some cases have exceeded tens of thousands of US dollars. In other cases, the employer may obtain the victim's personal information for purposes of [[identity theft]].\n* Loss of legitimate job: Those with a real job may quit in hopes of a better one, only to find they cannot get their original job back after they discover their dream job was only a [[hoax]].\n* Damaged reputation: Those who engage in sales of a faulty or otherwise controversial product may be tarnishing their own name as the salesperson of such a worthless item.\n* Trouble with law: Some victims may actually receive money. But at the same time, they may be unknowingly breaking the law, on behalf of the perpetrator of the scheme, but will be fully legally responsible. Such violations may be criminal or civil in nature. In other cases, they will not be committing any criminal acts, but they will end up framed in an investigation for the crimes of the perpetrator.\n* Wasted time: Victims will often invest huge amounts of time with no pay in return. This is time that can be spent earning money at a legitimate job.\n* Victim's contact information is sold to other scammers, who then contact the victim with new scams.\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Employment}}\n{{Scams and confidence tricks}}\n\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n[[Category:Confidence tricks]]\n[[Category:Crime]]\n[[Category:Deception]]\n[[Category:Finance fraud]]\n[[Category:Telecommuting]]\n", "text_old": "{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=February 2011}} \n\n[[File:Workathomead.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An ad for a work-at-home scheme posted on a pole]]\nA '''work-at-home scheme''' is a [[get-rich-quick scheme|get-rich-quick scam]] in which a victim is lured by an offer to be employed at home, very often doing some simple task in a minimal amount of time with a large amount of income that far exceeds the market rate for the type of work.

The crackdown involved more than 100 law enforcement actions by the FTC, the Department of Justice, the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], and law enforcement agencies in eleven states.<ref name=\"falsehopes\"/>\n\nLegitimate [[home-based business]] and [[telecommuting]] opportunities do exist, and many people do their jobs in the comfort of their own homes, but anyone seeking such an employment opportunity can be scammed by accepting a home employment offer. A 2007 report in the United States suggested that about 97% of work-at-home offers were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/TakeControlOfYourLife/story?id=3003833&page=1 |title=Working From Home: Don't Get Scammed |publisher=ABC: Good Morning America |date= 2007-04-03|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> Many legitimate jobs at home require some form of post-high-school education, such as a [[college degree]] or certificate, or [[trade school]], and some experience in the field in an office or other supervised setting. Additionally, many legitimate at-home jobs are not like those in schemes are portrayed to be, as they are often performed at least some of the time in the company's office, require more [[self discipline]] than a traditional job, and have a higher risk of [[firing]].\n\nCommon types of work found in work-at-home schemes include:\n* Stuffing envelopes.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> The victim sees a flyer advertising a job stuffing envelopes, with \"up to 1,000 envelopes a week that you can stuff... with postage and address already affixed!\", offering a payment of $1\u20132 per envelope. To apply for the job, the victim is required to send a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] for information and a small processing fee. In return, the victim is sent a template for the flyer they had originally seen; the envelopes they stuff are from other people who answer the flyer, and the payment is the processing fee.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Assembly of items of some type, such as [[crafts]], [[jewellery]] or medical equipment. The worker is required to pay up front for materials and construction kits, and when they attempt to sell the finished products back to the scheme's organiser, they are told that the products \"don't meet our specifications\", leaving the worker with assembled products and no buyer.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Processing medical claims. The worker pays several hundred dollars for medical billing software, but will later discover that most medical clinics process their own bills, outsource their billing to established firms rather than individuals, or have stricter requirements than the purchased software can provide.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* [[Forum spam]]ming. Usually advertised as some variant of \"email processing\", the worker is simply given instructions on spamming online forums, and told they can make money by selling these same instructions online.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Sales of a product or service that is difficult or impossible to sell. This is often done in the form of a [[pyramid scheme]].\n* Talking on a [[phone sex]] hotline.\n\nSome adverts offer legitimate forms of work that really do exist, but exaggerate the salary and understate the effort that will have to be put into the job, or exaggerate the amount of work that will be available. Many such ads do not even specify the type of work that will be performed. Some similar schemes do not advertise work that would be performed at home, but may instead offer occasional, sporadic work away from home for large payments, paired with a lot of free time. Some common offers fitting this description are acting as [[Extra (actor)|extras]], [[mystery shopping]] (which in reality requires hard work, is paid close to minimum wage, and most importantly, does not require an up-front fee to join) and working as a [[nanny]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Police issue warning over horror film extras scam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/11/police-warning-horror-film-extras-scam|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Mystery Shopping in Australia |url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/mystery-shopper-jobs-in-australia-and-the-companies-to-work-for/#Mystery-Shopping-in-Australia-|publisher=Finance Informer|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Nanny Scams |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/jobsearchscams/a/nanny-scams.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Signs of a scam==\nSigns of a work-at-home scam versus a legitimate job may include:\n* Payment of fee is required prior to starting employment. In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] states that ''under no circumstances'' should anyone be forced to pay a fee in order to obtain a job. In many countries, no legitimate employer will require a fee be paid as a condition of starting work (except perhaps a small amount for a [[criminal background check]]).\n* Pay is too good to be true. Though there may be legitimate jobs in existence in which employees are paid to perform the particular task in question, even from home, in reality, they would be paid a wage that is fair for that type of work and level of education, not the $40 per hour or $3000 per week that is typically offered in a work-at-home scheme.\n* Employer will seemingly hire anyone, with no experience necessary and no qualifications. Legitimate work-at-home employers will only be interested in those who have the proper experience, skills, certification, and other qualifying factors, and will give at least some scrutiny to an applicant seeking employment. But the perpetrator of a work-at-home scheme is only interested in the payment required to join.\n* Company is little known, and does not seemingly have a customer base bringing them revenue from which they can pay employees. \n* Company name is similar to, but not exactly the same as a well known, legitimate company.\n* Company does not appear to have a permanent location. Its address, phone number, and website appear to be centered on recruitment of employees, not customers.\n* Company tries to show unnatural benefits of working in a very short period.\n* Company repeatedly tries to make contact until the victim replies.\n* Fake news stories and Web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-04-2011/scam-alert-fake-news-websites.html|title=Fake News Websites Pitch Get-Rich-Quick Schemes|author=Sid Kirchheimer|date=2011-04-20|publisher=AARP}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe consequences of falling for a work-at-home scheme may be as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://how-to-make-money-working-from-home.academehub.com/50-ways-to-work-from-home-with-online-business-or-not/ |title=Work-at-Home Schemes |publisher=Bbb.org |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref>\n* Loss of money: It may be only the initial fee to join, which may be a large or small amount. Some scammers will run after receiving just this fee. Others will continue to ask for more in order for the promise of high pay to be fulfilled. Some will act on a two-way street, actually issuing paychecks, all the while receiving payments of greater value in return, which in some cases have exceeded tens of thousands of US dollars. In other cases, the employer may obtain the victim's personal information for purposes of [[identity theft]].\n* Loss of legitimate job: Those with a real job may quit in hopes of a better one, only to find they cannot get their original job back after they discover their dream job was only a [[hoax]].\n* Damaged reputation: Those who engage in sales of a faulty or otherwise controversial product may be tarnishing their own name as the salesperson of such a worthless item.\n* Trouble with law: Some victims may actually receive money. But at the same time, they may be unknowingly breaking the law, on behalf of the perpetrator of the scheme, but will be fully legally responsible. Such violations may be criminal or civil in nature. In other cases, they will not be committing any criminal acts, but they will end up framed in an investigation for the crimes of the perpetrator.\n* Wasted time: Victims will often invest huge amounts of time with no pay in return. This is time that can be spent earning money at a legitimate job.\n* Victim's contact information is sold to other scammers, who then contact the victim with new scams.\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Employment}}\n{{Scams and confidence tricks}}\n\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n[[Category:Confidence tricks]]\n[[Category:Crime]]\n[[Category:Deception]]\n[[Category:Finance fraud]]\n[[Category:Telecommuting]]\n", "name_user": "Babu201", "label": "safe", "comment": "Do you want to earn money online part-time or full-time?

The day before vehicle traffic was allowed, 200,000 people crossed either on foot or on roller skates.<ref name=\"two\"/> On opening day, Mayor [[Angelo Joseph Rossi|Angelo Rossi]] and other officials rode the ferry to Marin, then crossed the bridge in a motorcade past three ceremonial \"barriers,\" the last a blockade of [[Beauty pageant|beauty queens]] who required Joseph Strauss to present the bridge to the Highway District before allowing him to pass. An official song, \"[[There's a Silver Moon on the Golden Gate]],\" was chosen to commemorate the event. Strauss wrote a poem that is now on the Golden Gate Bridge entitled \"The Mighty Task is Done.\" The next day, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] pushed a button in Washington, D.C. signaling the official start of vehicle traffic over the Bridge at noon. As the celebration got out of hand there was a small riot in the uptown [[Polk Gulch]] area. Weeks of civil and cultural activities called \"the Fiesta\" followed. A statue of Strauss was moved in 1955 to a site near the bridge.<ref name=\"Owens\"/>\n\nIn May 1987, as part of the 50th anniversary celebration, the Golden Gate Bridge district again closed the bridge to automobile traffic and allowed pedestrians to cross the bridge. However, this celebration attracted 750,000 to 1,000,000 people, and ineffective crowd control meant the bridge became congested with roughly 300,000 people, causing the center span of the bridge to flatten out under the weight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20695952/day-golden-gate-bridge-flattened |title=The Day the Golden Gate Bridge Flattened |author=Tung, Stephen |date=May 23, 2012 |work=San Jose Mercury News |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref> Although the bridge is designed to flex in that way under heavy loads, and was estimated not to have exceeded 40% of the yielding stress of the suspension cables,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gndec.ac.in/~librarian/book/Book%20Cds/25885/PDF/CASES/CABLES/GOLDEN_G.PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011090153/http://gndec.ac.in/~librarian/book/Book%20Cds/25885/PDF/CASES/CABLES/GOLDEN_G.PDF |archivedate=October 11, 2011 |title=THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE |author1 =Pollalis, Spiro N. |author2 =Otto, Caroline |year=1990 |publisher=Harvard Design School |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref> bridge officials stated that uncontrolled pedestrian access was not being considered as part of the 75th anniversary on Sunday, May 27, 2012,<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/26/us/golden-gate-crowd-made-bridge-bend.html |title=Golden Gate Crowd Made Bridge Bend |author=McCarthy, Terrence |date=May 26, 1987 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"MIJ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_15588533 |title=Golden Gate Bridge officials nix walk for 75th anniversary |author=Prado, Mark |date=July 23, 2010 |work=Marin Independent Journal |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227010207/http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_15588533 |archive-date=December 27, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name=\"GSA\">{{cite web |url=http://goldengatebridge75.org/celebrate/golden-gate-festival.html |title=Golden Gate Festival :: Golden Gate Bridge 75th Anniversary |work=Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref> because of the additional law enforcement costs required \"since [[September 11 attacks|9/11.]]\"<ref name=\"WSJ-BayArea\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304019404577418440018082040 |title=A Historian's Long View of Golden Gate Bridge |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=August 31, 2013 |author=Fowler, Geoffrey A. |pages=A13C}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220\">\nFile:GoldenGateBridge openingday.jpg|A pedestrian poses at the old railing on opening day, 1937.\nFile:Golden Gate Bridge Opening - (1936).ogg|Opening of the Golden Gate Bridge\nFile:Invitation to Golden Gate Bridge opening, 1937.jpg|Official invitation to the opening of the bridge.
