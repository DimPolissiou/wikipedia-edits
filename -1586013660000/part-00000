She was intrigued by the geography of our landscape and gave us a brilliant view of ourselves through our work.\"<ref name=\"Earl1992\"/>\n\nLocke cited Bonnard, Gauguin and Piero della Francesca as strong influences in her work. In the mid 1960s she produced paintings that is now referred to as her 'Kitty phase', after the Kitty district in which she lived. For some of these she would approach strangers and ask to paint their backyards. She recorded the varying activities and sights of local life.\n[[File:\"Back Yards, Public Road, Kitty\", by Leila Locke.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=\"Public Road, Kitty, Georgetown\" by Leila Locke.

Destroyed in fire 2017.|Public Road, Kitty, Georgetown, by Leila Locke c. 1973]]\nElfrieda Bissember (later Director of [[Castellani House, Guyana]], Guyana's National Art Gallery) has written of her paintings: \"It is a record of a contemplative moment, complete in its details of unassuming but essential elements of any Guyanese life....There is a delicacy and unity of colour in the artist's handling of paint, and she has created a scene of great simplicity, warmth and directness...harmoniously designed in its unassuming details within this framed glimpse of a local backyard...thoughtful and limpid\".  From the mid 1970s she produced paintings that were a complete departure from her earlier work: non-representational, bright, abstract patterns and motifs, one of which was a strong recurring motif of a stylised Amerindian man with sun-ray markings around the head.<ref name=\"Bissember1988\"/>\n[[File:Timehri_painting_by_Leila_Locke,1973.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Timehri painting by Leila Locke, 1973.

Private Collection.|Timehri painting by Leila Locke 1973]]\nIn later years, commercial and studio ceramics became a more central part of her work.  While living in chilly grey Edinburgh for four years she started making pottery models of Guyanese houses to remind her of the year she had spent, models she continued up until her death.  Her major ceramic piece was a tiled swimming-pool, made entirely of locally sourced materials for the then President. She described \u2013\n\n{{quote|text=The swimming pool was expected to be blue but I thought it should represent creek water, and so we made 2\" by 2\" mosaic tiles in shades from cream to yellow, blue, orange, green and brilliant scarlet.  When the pool was filled the movement of the water turned the pool into an enormous op-art painting constantly moving and changing.<ref name=\"Bissember1988\"/>\n}}\n\nShe wrote about an occasion in the 1970s, following her divorce:\n\n{{quote|text=I remember going on a picnic to Red Water Creek and while swimming in the creek looking at the sunlight shining through the water and making it from a translucent burnt sienna to a translucent yellow ochre, and the sparkling green water plants and water weed with tiny yellow flowers.  If I went back to England I would not be able to see this light, this colour to inspire paintings.  The landscape in England is so cultivated and there have been so many artists before me who have said all that can be said about that landscape.

She was intrigued by the geography of our landscape and gave us a brilliant view of ourselves through our work.\"<ref name=\"Earl1992\"/>\n\nLocke cited Bonnard, Gauguin and Piero della Francesca as strong influences in her work. In the mid 1960s she produced paintings that is now referred to as her 'Kitty phase', after the Kitty district in which she lived. For some of these she would approach strangers and ask to paint their backyards. She recorded the varying activities and sights of local life.\n[[File:\"Back Yards, Public Road, Kitty\", by Leila Locke.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=\"Public Road, Kitty, Georgetown\" by Leila Locke.

Destroyed in fire 2017.|Public Road, Kitty, Georgetown, by Leila Locke c. 1973]]\nElfrieda Bissember (later Director of [[Castellani House, Guyana]], Guyana's National Art Gallery) has written of her paintings: \"It is a record of a contemplative moment, complete in its details of unassuming but essential elements of any Guyanese life....There is a delicacy and unity of colour in the artist's handling of paint, and she has created a scene of great simplicity, warmth and directness...harmoniously designed in its unassuming details within this framed glimpse of a local backyard...thoughtful and limpid\".  From the mid 1970s she produced paintings that were a complete departure from her earlier work: non-representational, bright, abstract patterns and motifs, one of which was a strong recurring motif of a stylised Amerindian man with sun-ray markings around the head.<ref name=\"Bissember1988\"/>\n[[File:Timehri_painting_by_Leila_Locke,1973.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Timehri painting by Leila Locke, 1973.

Private Collection.|Timehri painting by Leila Locke 1973]]\nIn later years, commercial and studio ceramics became a more central part of her work.  While living in chilly grey Edinburgh for four years she started making pottery models of Guyanese houses to remind her of the year she had spent, models she continued up until her death.  Her major ceramic piece was a tiled swimming-pool, made entirely of locally sourced materials for the then President. She described \u2013\n\n{{quote|text=The swimming pool was expected to be blue but I thought it should represent creek water, and so we made 2\" by 2\" mosaic tiles in shades from cream to yellow, blue, orange, green and brilliant scarlet.  When the pool was filled the movement of the water turned the pool into an enormous op-art painting constantly moving and changing.<ref name=\"Bissember1988\"/>\n}}\n\nShe wrote about an occasion in the 1970s, following her divorce:\n\n{{quote|text=I remember going on a picnic to Red Water Creek and while swimming in the creek looking at the sunlight shining through the water and making it from a translucent burnt sienna to a translucent yellow ochre, and the sparkling green water plants and water weed with tiny yellow flowers.  If I went back to England I would not be able to see this light, this colour to inspire paintings.  The landscape in England is so cultivated and there have been so many artists before me who have said all that can be said about that landscape.  Whereas the Guyana landscape, the plants, have hardly been explored.

It consists of [[#Dark Empire I|a six-issue]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] written by [[Tom Veitch]] and drawn by [[Cam Kennedy]], followed by [[#Dark Empire II|a second six-issue limited series]] by Veitch and Kennedy and [[#Empire's End|a two-issue limited series]] written by Veitch and drawn by [[Jim Baikie]]. The initial series is notable for being one of the very first ''Star Wars'' comics to be produced by Dark Horse Comics, who had acquired the comic rights to the ''Star Wars'' franchise in the early 1990s.\n\nPart of the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]], the trilogy follows events in the ''Star Wars'' franchise six years after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', specifically the aftereffects of [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[Thrawn trilogy|''Thrawn'' trilogy]]. The story deals with the return of the villainous [[Palpatine]], having successfully cheated death by having his spiritual entity \"reincarnated\" through the essence transfer ritual and cloning technology. Other themes include [[Luke Skywalker]] temporarily succumbing to the dark side of [[the Force]], the official return of [[Boba Fett]] (who had seemingly died after being swallowed by the [[Sarlacc]] in ''Return of the Jedi''), and the first appearance of [[Princess Leia]] and [[Han Solo]]'s son [[Anakin Solo]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe ''Dark Empire I'' story was originally developed by [[Tom Veitch]] and [[Cam Kennedy]] for [[Marvel Comics]]. Veitch and Kennedy were approached by [[Lucasfilm]] based on their success with ''[[The Light and Darkness War]]''.<ref>''The [[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]'', [[West End Games]], 1st edition, 1993.

All three series, plus a sourcebook, would be combined in a hardbound omnibus in 2010.\n\nThe individual comic issues each feature several bonus pages of written context; ''Dark Empire'' for instance details some of Palpatine's history related to his return, including excerpts of encyclopedic volumes called the ''Dark Side Compendium'' written from his perspective.{{sfn|Slavicsek|1994|p=115}}{{efn|''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe]]'' (1998) explains that while he was on [[Byss]], [[Luke Skywalker]] read all three completed volumes of the hundreds the Emperor had planned.

Han Solo, Leia Organa, [[Chewbacca]] and [[C-3PO]] are heading to the planet to rescue [[Luke Skywalker]], R2-D2 and [[Lando Calrissian]], who have spent the past several days holding out against Imperial attacks after an earlier raid using the captured [[Star Destroyer]] ''Liberator'' goes awry and the warship crashes. The Rebels successfully rescue the survivors, but a massive energy storm appears. Luke sees the storm as a large disturbance in [[the Force]], and asks everybody to leave him behind; he lets himself be devoured by the storm.\n\nThe taskforce returns to the Rebel fleet in the Da Soocha system. Rebel commanders discuss the appearance of the Imperials coming out of the Deep Core and discover that Admiral Ackbar's homeworld of Mon Calamari is now under attack by a fleet of Imperial war machines. Called the World Devastators, the machines are designed to convert everything in their path into raw materials for building more war machines on the spot. Lando leads another taskforce with a second captured Star Destroyer leading the charge to aid in Mon Calamari's defense.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke awakes from the light of the Force storm and finds out he is aboard an old Imperial prison ship heading to [[Byss]]. The ship docks and Luke is closely escorted to a chamber, where he is stunned to see [[Emperor Palpatine]] alive. The Emperor explains that he has revived himself in a clone body and makes Luke doubt any attempt to kill him knowing he will quickly manifest in another clone. Sensing the futility and seeing the horror of what is happening in Mon Calamari, Luke humbly surrenders to becoming the Emperor's new apprentice.\n\nLeia has visions of Luke being corrupted into the Dark Side and wants to travel to Byss and save him. She and Han travel to [[Nar Shaddaa]] and try to arrange a ship to bring them past Byss' security network. Han reunites with smuggler friends Shug Ninx, Salla Zend, and Mako Spince to make it happen. Along the way, an old woman named Vima-da-Boda\u2014a former Jedi who survived the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]'s purge\u2014feels Leia's Force energy and gives her an old Jedi artifact. However, the Hutts have put a large bounty on Han and Leia, with Spince selling him out to [[Boba Fett]] (revealed to have survived being devoured by the Sarlacc during the events of ''Return of the Jedi''); the two escape Nar Shaddaa aboard Salla's ship, the Starlight Intruder, with the Falcon attached. The Intruder has the proper codes to get inside Byss, and Imperial security lets them in (but lock out a pursuing Fett). Han Leia, Chewie, and the droids are brought before Luke and the Emperor.\n\nLeia discovers that he holds hostage an even greater treasure: a mysterious and intelligent artifact called the [[Jedi]] [[Holocron]], a holographic cube that contains historical information about the Jedi. When Leia discovers that the Emperor is interested in possessing her third child, she steals the Holocron and the group successfully breaks out of Byss while having to leave behind Luke again. Luke faces the already frail Emperor and destroys his clone tanks, but the Emperor possesses one living clone and subdues him to his will.\n\nHan's group travels to Mon Calamari as Rebel commando forces lay siege to the World Devastators, which have been shut down by a special master code Luke was able to steal and give to R2 and C3PO for transmission to the machines. The Imperials aboard the machines still have the factories running and attack the Rebels. R2 rigs the World Devastators to destroy each other.\n\nAs the Rebels celebrate on Mon Calamari, Alliance command determines that the World Devastators are part of a larger Imperial offensive to conquer the galaxy. Leia studies the Holocron and sees an old prophecy about a pregnant woman coming to save the Jedi from doom. At the same time, a small Imperial fleet, led by the massive flagship ''Eclipse'', appears above Da Soocha. The Emperor demands that the Alliance surrender Leia to him and Luke. Leia travels on her own and appeals to Luke to break away from the Emperor. Palpatine creates a large Force storm to destroy the Rebel fleet, but Leia and Luke work together to amplify the storm beyond the Emperor's power and turn it against him. The siblings escape the doomed warship, and as Luke sees the last remnants of the Eclipse being vaporized, he declares the Jedi Knights will rise again.\n\n===''Dark Empire II''===\nWith Emperor Palpatine apparently perishing aboard the Eclipse, more worlds defy Imperial edicts, especially those that have been recently reconquered. One of these is the arms manufacturing planet Balmorra, whose planetary governor, Beltane, has begun supplying the Rebels with the latest military vehicles, such as the Viper X1 Automadon, a war droid designed to convert energy from enemy laser fire into power for its own turbolaser cannons. The Emperor's Dark Side Executor Sedriss leads a force to subdue the planet, but Beltane's troops hold the line and Sedriss is compelled to negotiate a supply agreement with him. Sedriss returns to Byss, where he kills two Dark Side Adepts who've been killing other clones of Emperor Palpatine that Luke missed. Palpatine possesses one clone to Sedriss' surprise and orders the Imperial offensive to continue.\n\nHaving pledged to reestablish the Jedi Order by finding any surviving Jedi in the galaxy, Luke Skywalker returns to Pinnacle Base on the moon Da Soocha V (orbiting Da Soocha in the Cyax System of Hutt Space of the Outer Rim) with Kam Solusar, a former Dark Jedi. Beltane tips the [[Rebel Alliance]] of a shipment of new Vipers bound for the Empire's Deep Core stronghold of Byss, and Alliance commanders accept Wedge Antilles' suggestion of intercepting the shipment for a surgical strike using the droids, with Rebel commandos in the attack. Although Luke presses for liberating more worlds to provide more staging areas for an all-out strike on Byss, Mon Mothma asks him to concentrate on rebuilding the Jedi Order instead. The Jedi Holocron educates Luke about the planet Ossus, a former Jedi-populated world destroyed by the Sith thousands of years earlier.\n\nHan, Leia and Chewie fly back to Nar Shaddaa to find Vima-da-Boda, at least where Leia last saw her. However, Vima has disappeared and every bounty hunter on the moon is still out for them, including Boba Fett, as well as an Imperial force led by two Dark Side Elites. Leia successfully fetches Vima after flying into the deeper reaches of Nar Shaddaa. Aboard Nar Shaddaa's traffic control tower, Mako Spince sees Han and guides an Imperial Star Destroyer's tractor beam on him. Han turns the tables by flying close to the tower, forcing the tractor beam to lock onto the structure and pull it instead at full power. The tower impales the Star Destroyer and it crashes into Nar Shaddaa. Fett, back in his old ship Slave I, chases the Millennium Falcon into a nearby acidic gas cloud. Han takes the risk and flies into the cloud, surprisingly appearing on the other side and stumbling onto the long-lost world of Ganath. Ganathan engineers repair the Falcon and equip it with a lightning cannon while the team meets Ganath's ruler, Empatojayos Brand, a veteran Jedi who survived the Empire's Jedi Purge. Inspired by the possibility of a Jedi rebirth, Brand joins Han's party while leaving Ganath in the hands of a military officer. Han takes out Fett and heads to a secret hideout on New Alderaan, where Han and Leia's twin children are under care.\n\nLuke and Kam fly to Ossus and chances upon the Ysanna, a warrior tribe which has rudimentary Force powers. They fight off the Ysanna attacks and sensing they are indeed Jedi, the Ysanna chief welcomes them. Having known about the trip, the Emperor orders Sedriss and fellow Dark Side Elite Vill Goir to capture them. Solusar kills Goir, but Sedriss takes one of the Ysanna hostage and leans against a tree. To everybody's surprise, the tree is a millennia-old Neti Jedi Master named Ood Bnar, who wraps Sedriss in a fatal embrace and they die in an explosion of Force energy. Bnar's heroic sacrifice leaves a part of him in the soil and a hole underneath his location reveals an old cache of lightsabers; Luke successfully discovers an old Jedi library. Two Ysanna tribe members, siblings Ralf and Jem, join Luke and Kam in leaving the planet with their elders' blessing.\n\nLando leads the Rebel infiltration into Byss and start the attack when the Viper droids are offloaded. The droids prove superior to existing Imperial defenses until the Emperor releases an army of Dark Side-mutated monsters on the attackers. The Vipers, which are attuned against energy attacks, are cut to shreds under the monsters' mauling. Salla Zend and Shug Ninx mobilizes fellow smugglers nearby to rescue the Rebel strike group and escape Byss.\n\nOn New Alderaan, Leia prepares for the birth of her third child as Han and Chewie attempt to rendezvous with Lando's group. Luke's party arrives with grim news: he had reached Da Soocha to see a large missile appear and destroy the planet, with the Rebel Alliance command presumably killed. He uses the time to train the Ysanna siblings as Kam and Empatojayos practice their Jedi skills as well. Unknown to them, the Emperor's Dark Side Elites have tortured a Rebel pilot into revealing the location of New Alderaan. The Emperor sees this as an opportunity to capture the Skywalker siblings and Leia's offspring in one fell swoop. The Darksiders attempt to poison Luke, but Vima saves him as the entire settlement goes into action to fight the Imperials, who have deployed AT-ATs as backup. In the course of the fighting, Jem is killed and Rayf saves Leia's twins from being kidnapped. The Millennium Falcon and Lando's forces arrive and defeat the Imperial assault, then evacuate the New Alderaan survivors.\n\nThe Rebels relocate to the space stations of Nespis VIII, where they discover that the Alliance had evacuated Pinnacle Base before it was destroyed. On Nespis VIII, Anakin Solo is born and the Alliance plots the final destruction of the Empire.\n\n===''Empire's End''===\nAfter perishing in battle with Luke and Leia Skywalker in ''Dark Empire I'', Emperor Palpatine is forced to occupy an inferior clone body, since it was the last clone body that remained. Unknown to him, his personal physician had been corrupted by [[List of minor Star Wars characters#Jax, Carnor|Carnor Jax]], backed by a number of other high-ranking Imperial personnel. The physician had deliberately inserted genetic material and contaminants into all stored samples of the Emperor's original body, to the effect that the resulting bodies would be nowhere as resistant to the ravaging effects of the Dark Side as the original.\n\nThe last clone body not destroyed by Skywalker or traitorous Imperials is now aging rapidly, and Palpatine's final end is near, unless he can either fix his genetic material (an impossibility since no unaltered samples remain) or insert his spirit into another body. After consulting with ancient Sith Lords on the mausoleum planet [[Korriban]], Palpatine learns that [[Han Solo|Han]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia's]] youngest child, named [[Anakin Solo|Anakin]] after his deceased grandfather, has the only workable body.\n\nPalpatine follows the Solos to [[Onderon]] in order to gain a new body, to ensure the future of his rule. A fierce duel occurs between Luke Skywalker and his Jedi team and Palpatine; finally, Han Solo wrongly shoots the Emperor, allowing him to be out of his physical form and get what he wanted: Anakin's body. He desperately tries to send his spirit into the infant Anakin Solo, but he is blocked by the soul of the dying [[Jedi]], Empatojayos Brand, who makes the ultimate sacrifice in willingly sending his eternal soul into the \"madness beyond death\" that is the Dark Side, to ensure Palpatine would go as well and can never return. Luke then vows to revive the Jedi Order. After the death of Palpatine, a projectile from the Galaxy Gun is shot into Byss (since the crew were frightened by the potential collision, and also misfired), utterly destroying Byss, and destroying the second ''Eclipse''-class Star Destroyer, ''Eclipse II'', which was steered into a collision course with the Galaxy Gun by [[R2-D2]], thus ending the Empire's harsh rule.\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Audiobooks===\nIn 1994 and 1995 respectively, [[Time Warner Cable|Time Warner Audio Publishing]] released audio dramas of the first and second volumes of ''Dark Empire''.

produced by [[Dark Horse Comics]]. It consists of [[#Dark Empire I|a six-issue]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] written by [[Tom Veitch]] and drawn by [[Cam Kennedy]], followed by [[#Dark Empire II|a second six-issue limited series]] by Veitch and Kennedy and [[#Empire's End|a two-issue limited series]] written by Veitch and drawn by [[Jim Baikie]]. The initial series is notable for being one of the very first ''Star Wars'' comics to be produced by Dark Horse Comics, who had acquired the comic rights to the ''Star Wars'' franchise in the early 1990s.\n\nPart of the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]], the trilogy follows events in the ''Star Wars'' franchise six years after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', specifically the aftereffects of [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[Thrawn trilogy|''Thrawn'' trilogy]]. The story deals with the return of the villainous [[Palpatine]], having successfully cheated death by having his spiritual entity \"reincarnated\" through the essence transfer ritual and cloning technology. Other themes include [[Luke Skywalker]] temporarily succumbing to the dark side of [[the Force]], the official return of [[Boba Fett]] (who had seemingly died after being swallowed by the [[Sarlacc]] in ''Return of the Jedi''), and the first appearance of [[Princess Leia]] and [[Han Solo]]'s son [[Anakin Solo]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe ''Dark Empire I'' story was originally developed by [[Tom Veitch]] and [[Cam Kennedy]] for [[Marvel Comics]]. Veitch and Kennedy were approached by [[Lucasfilm]] based on their success with ''[[The Light and Darkness War]]''.<ref>''The [[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]'', [[West End Games]], 1st edition, 1993.

All three series, plus a sourcebook, would be combined in a hardbound omnibus in 2010.\n\nThe individual comic issues each feature several bonus pages of written context; ''Dark Empire'' for instance details some of Palpatine's history related to his return, including excerpts of encyclopedic volumes called the ''Dark Side Compendium'' written from his perspective.{{sfn|Slavicsek|1998|p=115}}{{efn|''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe]]'' (1998) explains that while he was on [[Byss]], [[Luke Skywalker]] read all three completed volumes of the hundreds the Emperor had planned.

Han Solo, Leia Organa, [[Chewbacca]] and [[C-3PO]] are heading to the planet to rescue [[Luke Skywalker]], R2-D2 and [[Lando Calrissian]], who have spent the past several days holding out against Imperial attacks after an earlier raid using the captured [[Star Destroyer]] ''Liberator'' goes awry and the warship crashes. The Rebels successfully rescue the survivors, but a massive energy storm appears. Luke sees the storm as a large disturbance in [[the Force]], and asks everybody to leave him behind; he lets himself be devoured by the storm.\n\nThe taskforce returns to the Rebel fleet in the Da Soocha system. Rebel commanders discuss the appearance of the Imperials coming out of the Deep Core and discover that Admiral Ackbar's homeworld of Mon Calamari is now under attack by a fleet of Imperial war machines. Called the World Devastators, the machines are designed to convert everything in their path into raw materials for building more war machines on the spot. Lando leads another taskforce with a second captured Star Destroyer leading the charge to aid in Mon Calamari's defense.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke awakes from the light of the Force storm and finds out he is aboard an old Imperial prison ship heading to [[Byss]]. The ship docks and Luke is closely escorted to a chamber, where he is stunned to see [[Emperor Palpatine]] alive. The Emperor explains that he has revived himself in a clone body and makes Luke doubt any attempt to kill him knowing he will quickly manifest in another clone. Sensing the futility and seeing the horror of what is happening in Mon Calamari, Luke humbly surrenders to becoming the Emperor's new apprentice.\n\nLeia has visions of Luke being corrupted into the Dark Side and wants to travel to Byss and save him. She and Han travel to [[Nar Shaddaa]] and try to arrange a ship to bring them past Byss' security network. Han reunites with smuggler friends Shug Ninx, Salla Zend, and Mako Spince to make it happen. Along the way, an old woman named Vima-da-Boda\u2014a former Jedi who survived the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]'s purge\u2014feels Leia's Force energy and gives her an old Jedi artifact. However, the Hutts have put a large bounty on Han and Leia, with Spince selling him out to [[Boba Fett]] (revealed to have survived being devoured by the Sarlacc during the events of ''Return of the Jedi''); the two escape Nar Shaddaa aboard Salla's ship, the Starlight Intruder, with the Falcon attached. The Intruder has the proper codes to get inside Byss, and Imperial security lets them in (but lock out a pursuing Fett). Han Leia, Chewie, and the droids are brought before Luke and the Emperor.\n\nLeia discovers that he holds hostage an even greater treasure: a mysterious and intelligent artifact called the [[Jedi]] [[Holocron]], a holographic cube that contains historical information about the Jedi. When Leia discovers that the Emperor is interested in possessing her third child, she steals the Holocron and the group successfully breaks out of Byss while having to leave behind Luke again. Luke faces the already frail Emperor and destroys his clone tanks, but the Emperor possesses one living clone and subdues him to his will.\n\nHan's group travels to Mon Calamari as Rebel commando forces lay siege to the World Devastators, which have been shut down by a special master code Luke was able to steal and give to R2 and C3PO for transmission to the machines. The Imperials aboard the machines still have the factories running and attack the Rebels. R2 rigs the World Devastators to destroy each other.\n\nAs the Rebels celebrate on Mon Calamari, Alliance command determines that the World Devastators are part of a larger Imperial offensive to conquer the galaxy. Leia studies the Holocron and sees an old prophecy about a pregnant woman coming to save the Jedi from doom. At the same time, a small Imperial fleet, led by the massive flagship ''Eclipse'', appears above Da Soocha. The Emperor demands that the Alliance surrender Leia to him and Luke. Leia travels on her own and appeals to Luke to break away from the Emperor. Palpatine creates a large Force storm to destroy the Rebel fleet, but Leia and Luke work together to amplify the storm beyond the Emperor's power and turn it against him. The siblings escape the doomed warship, and as Luke sees the last remnants of the Eclipse being vaporized, he declares the Jedi Knights will rise again.\n\n===''Dark Empire II''===\nWith Emperor Palpatine apparently perishing aboard the Eclipse, more worlds defy Imperial edicts, especially those that have been recently reconquered. One of these is the arms manufacturing planet Balmorra, whose planetary governor, Beltane, has begun supplying the Rebels with the latest military vehicles, such as the Viper X1 Automadon, a war droid designed to convert energy from enemy laser fire into power for its own turbolaser cannons. The Emperor's Dark Side Executor Sedriss leads a force to subdue the planet, but Beltane's troops hold the line and Sedriss is compelled to negotiate a supply agreement with him. Sedriss returns to Byss, where he kills two Dark Side Adepts who've been killing other clones of Emperor Palpatine that Luke missed. Palpatine possesses one clone to Sedriss' surprise and orders the Imperial offensive to continue.\n\nHaving pledged to reestablish the Jedi Order by finding any surviving Jedi in the galaxy, Luke Skywalker returns to Pinnacle Base on the moon Da Soocha V (orbiting Da Soocha in the Cyax System of Hutt Space of the Outer Rim) with Kam Solusar, a former Dark Jedi. Beltane tips the [[Rebel Alliance]] of a shipment of new Vipers bound for the Empire's Deep Core stronghold of Byss, and Alliance commanders accept Wedge Antilles' suggestion of intercepting the shipment for a surgical strike using the droids, with Rebel commandos in the attack. Although Luke presses for liberating more worlds to provide more staging areas for an all-out strike on Byss, Mon Mothma asks him to concentrate on rebuilding the Jedi Order instead. The Jedi Holocron educates Luke about the planet Ossus, a former Jedi-populated world destroyed by the Sith thousands of years earlier.\n\nHan, Leia and Chewie fly back to Nar Shaddaa to find Vima-da-Boda, at least where Leia last saw her. However, Vima has disappeared and every bounty hunter on the moon is still out for them, including Boba Fett, as well as an Imperial force led by two Dark Side Elites. Leia successfully fetches Vima after flying into the deeper reaches of Nar Shaddaa. Aboard Nar Shaddaa's traffic control tower, Mako Spince sees Han and guides an Imperial Star Destroyer's tractor beam on him. Han turns the tables by flying close to the tower, forcing the tractor beam to lock onto the structure and pull it instead at full power. The tower impales the Star Destroyer and it crashes into Nar Shaddaa. Fett, back in his old ship Slave I, chases the Millennium Falcon into a nearby acidic gas cloud. Han takes the risk and flies into the cloud, surprisingly appearing on the other side and stumbling onto the long-lost world of Ganath. Ganathan engineers repair the Falcon and equip it with a lightning cannon while the team meets Ganath's ruler, Empatojayos Brand, a veteran Jedi who survived the Empire's Jedi Purge. Inspired by the possibility of a Jedi rebirth, Brand joins Han's party while leaving Ganath in the hands of a military officer. Han takes out Fett and heads to a secret hideout on New Alderaan, where Han and Leia's twin children are under care.\n\nLuke and Kam fly to Ossus and chances upon the Ysanna, a warrior tribe which has rudimentary Force powers. They fight off the Ysanna attacks and sensing they are indeed Jedi, the Ysanna chief welcomes them. Having known about the trip, the Emperor orders Sedriss and fellow Dark Side Elite Vill Goir to capture them. Solusar kills Goir, but Sedriss takes one of the Ysanna hostage and leans against a tree. To everybody's surprise, the tree is a millennia-old Neti Jedi Master named Ood Bnar, who wraps Sedriss in a fatal embrace and they die in an explosion of Force energy. Bnar's heroic sacrifice leaves a part of him in the soil and a hole underneath his location reveals an old cache of lightsabers; Luke successfully discovers an old Jedi library. Two Ysanna tribe members, siblings Ralf and Jem, join Luke and Kam in leaving the planet with their elders' blessing.\n\nLando leads the Rebel infiltration into Byss and start the attack when the Viper droids are offloaded. The droids prove superior to existing Imperial defenses until the Emperor releases an army of Dark Side-mutated monsters on the attackers. The Vipers, which are attuned against energy attacks, are cut to shreds under the monsters' mauling. Salla Zend and Shug Ninx mobilizes fellow smugglers nearby to rescue the Rebel strike group and escape Byss.\n\nOn New Alderaan, Leia prepares for the birth of her third child as Han and Chewie attempt to rendezvous with Lando's group. Luke's party arrives with grim news: he had reached Da Soocha to see a large missile appear and destroy the planet, with the Rebel Alliance command presumably killed. He uses the time to train the Ysanna siblings as Kam and Empatojayos practice their Jedi skills as well. Unknown to them, the Emperor's Dark Side Elites have tortured a Rebel pilot into revealing the location of New Alderaan. The Emperor sees this as an opportunity to capture the Skywalker siblings and Leia's offspring in one fell swoop. The Darksiders attempt to poison Luke, but Vima saves him as the entire settlement goes into action to fight the Imperials, who have deployed AT-ATs as backup. In the course of the fighting, Jem is killed and Rayf saves Leia's twins from being kidnapped. The Millennium Falcon and Lando's forces arrive and defeat the Imperial assault, then evacuate the New Alderaan survivors.\n\nThe Rebels relocate to the space stations of Nespis VIII, where they discover that the Alliance had evacuated Pinnacle Base before it was destroyed. On Nespis VIII, Anakin Solo is born and the Alliance plots the final destruction of the Empire.\n\n===''Empire's End''===\nAfter perishing in battle with Luke and Leia Skywalker in ''Dark Empire I'', Emperor Palpatine is forced to occupy an inferior clone body, since it was the last clone body that remained. Unknown to him, his personal physician had been corrupted by [[List of minor Star Wars characters#Jax, Carnor|Carnor Jax]], backed by a number of other high-ranking Imperial personnel. The physician had deliberately inserted genetic material and contaminants into all stored samples of the Emperor's original body, to the effect that the resulting bodies would be nowhere as resistant to the ravaging effects of the Dark Side as the original.\n\nThe last clone body not destroyed by Skywalker or traitorous Imperials is now aging rapidly, and Palpatine's final end is near, unless he can either fix his genetic material (an impossibility since no unaltered samples remain) or insert his spirit into another body. After consulting with ancient Sith Lords on the mausoleum planet [[Korriban]], Palpatine learns that [[Han Solo|Han]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia's]] youngest child, named [[Anakin Solo|Anakin]] after his deceased grandfather, has the only workable body.\n\nPalpatine follows the Solos to [[Onderon]] in order to gain a new body, to ensure the future of his rule. A fierce duel occurs between Luke Skywalker and his Jedi team and Palpatine; finally, Han Solo wrongly shoots the Emperor, allowing him to be out of his physical form and get what he wanted: Anakin's body. He desperately tries to send his spirit into the infant Anakin Solo, but he is blocked by the soul of the dying [[Jedi]], Empatojayos Brand, who makes the ultimate sacrifice in willingly sending his eternal soul into the \"madness beyond death\" that is the Dark Side, to ensure Palpatine would go as well and can never return. Luke then vows to revive the Jedi Order. After the death of Palpatine, a projectile from the Galaxy Gun is shot into Byss (since the crew were frightened by the potential collision, and also misfired), utterly destroying Byss, and destroying the second ''Eclipse''-class Star Destroyer, ''Eclipse II'', which was steered into a collision course with the Galaxy Gun by [[R2-D2]], thus ending the Empire's harsh rule.\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 1994 and 1995 respectively, [[Time Warner Cable|Time Warner Audio Publishing]] released audio dramas of the first and second volumes of ''Dark Empire''. The cast was:\n* [[John Cygan]] - as [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Wedge Antilles]], Vill Goir, Okko and Umak Leth\n* Joe Hacker - as [[Han Solo]], [[Boba Fett]], [[List of Star Wars characters|Empatojayos Brand]] and Lo Khan\n* Ann Patricio - as [[Princess Leia]] and [[Mon Mothma]]\n* [[Nick Jameson]] - as [[Emperor Palpatine]] and Governor Beltane\n* [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] - as [[C-3PO]],

characters|Zevulon Veers]] and Baddon Fass\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] - as [[Lando Calrissian]]\n\nLater in 1995, a ''Dark Empire: Collector's Edition'' CD set was released that collected the 2 ''Dark Empire'' audio dramas as well as an exclusive adaptation of ''Empire's End'', the final chapter of the Dark Empire saga.\n\n==Impact==\nAlong with [[Timothy Zahn]]'s books, ''Dark Empire'' has been credited with sustaining the profitability of ''Star Wars'' during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite
