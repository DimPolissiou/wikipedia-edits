He is known for his [[Gothic film|gothic]] fantasy and horror films such as ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005), ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (2007), ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' (2012), and ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' (2012). He is also known for [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films, such as the adventure-comedy ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), the superhero films ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and its first sequel, ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), the sci-fi film ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (2001), the fantasy-drama ''[[Big Fish]]'' (2003), the musical adventure film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005), the fantasy film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010), and the film adaptation of ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]'' (2016).\n\nBurton has often worked with actor [[Johnny Depp]] and composer [[Danny Elfman]], who has composed scores for all but three of the films Burton has directed. [[Helena Bonham Carter]], Burton's former [[domestic partnership|domestic partner]], has appeared in many of his films. He wrote and illustrated the poetry book ''[[The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories]]'', published in 1997 by British publishing house [[Faber and Faber]], and a compilation of his drawings, sketches and other artwork, entitled ''The Art of Tim Burton'', was released in 2009. A follow-up to that book, entitled ''The Napkin Art of Tim Burton: Things You Think About in a Bar'', containing sketches made by Burton on [[napkin]]s at bars and restaurants he occasionally visits, was released in 2015.\n\n==Early life==\nBurton was born in 1958, in [[Burbank, California]], the son of Jean Burton (n\u00e9e Erickson), later the owner of a cat-themed gift shop, and William  \"Bill\" Burton, a former minor league baseball player who was working for the Burbank Parks and Recreation Department.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last=Morgenstern |first=Joe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/09/magazine/tim-burton-batman-and-the-joker.html?pagewanted=all |title=Tim Burton, Batman and The Joker |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=April 9, 1989 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article544489.ece?print=yes&randnumb=1151003209000 | work=The Times | location=London | title=Tim+Burton | accessdate=May 25, 2010 | first=Sadie | last=Gray}}{{dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=December 2019}}</ref> As a [[Preadolescence|preteen]], Burton would make short films in his backyard on Evergreen Street using crude [[stop motion]] animation techniques or shoot them on 8&nbsp;mm film without sound (one of his oldest known juvenile films is ''[[The Island of Doctor Agor]]'', which he made when he was 13 years old). Burton attended Providencia Elementary School in Burbank. Burton went to [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]], but he was not a particularly good student. He played on the water polo team at Burbank High. Burton was an introspective person and found pleasure in painting, drawing and watching movies. His future work would be heavily influenced by the works of such childhood heroes as [[Dr. Seuss]] and [[Roald Dahl]].<ref>Alison McMahan (2005).

His concept art never made it into the finished films.\n\nWhile at Disney in 1982, Burton made his first short, ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'', a six-minute black-and-white [[stop motion]] film based on a poem written by the filmmaker, and depicting a young boy who fantasizes that he is his hero [[Vincent Price]], with Price himself providing narration. The film was produced by [[Rick Heinrichs]], whom Burton had befriended while working in the concept art department at Disney. The film was shown at the Chicago Film Festival and released, alongside the teen drama ''[[Tex (film)|Tex]]'', for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema. This was followed by Burton's first live-action production ''[[Hansel and Gretel (1983 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]'', a Japanese-themed adaptation of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[Hansel and Gretel|fairy tale]] for the [[Disney Channel]], which climaxes in a [[kung fu]] fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch. Having aired once in 1983 at 10:30 pm on Halloween and promptly shelved, prints of the film are extremely difficult to locate, fueling rumors that the project did not exist. The short would finally go on public display in 2009 at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and again in 2011 as part of the Tim Burton art exhibit at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Is the Tim Burton Exhibition at LACMA for Kids?|url=http://museumstories.com/2011/09/26/is-lacmas-tim-burton-exhibition-for-kids/|website=museumstories.com|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Exhibit covers Tim Burton\u2019s career as filmmaker and artist|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/burton-303022-tim-art.html|website=Orange County Register|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> It was again shown at the [[Seoul Museum of Art]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Burton's 'nightmares' become hit museum exhibit|url=http://travel.cnn.com/tim-burtons-nightmares-arrive-seoul-015476/|website=CNN|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nBurton's next live-action short film, ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'', was released in 1984. It tells the story of a young boy who tries to revive his dog after it is run over by a car. Filmed in black-and-white, it stars [[Barret Oliver]], [[Shelley Duvall]] (with whom he would work again in 1986, directing an episode of her ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'') and [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]. After ''Frankenweenie'' was completed, Disney fired Burton, under the pretext of him spending the company's resources on a film that would be too dark and scary for children to see.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-editors/tim-burton-disney-fired-181740632.html|title=Tim Burton: How Disney fired me|first=Edward|last=Bovingdon |publisher=[[Yahoo! Inc.]] |date = October 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nActor [[Paul Reubens]] saw ''Frankenweenie'' and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spin-off of his popular character [[Pee-wee Herman]], stating on the Audio Commentary of 2000 DVD release of Pee-wee's Big Adventure that as soon as the short began, he was sold on Burton's style. Pee-wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at [[The Groundlings]] and [[The Roxy (London)|the Roxy]] which was later turned into an [[The Pee-wee Herman Show|HBO special]]. The film, ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'', was made on a budget of $8&nbsp;million and grossed more than $40&nbsp;million at the North American box office. Burton, a fan of the eccentric musical group [[Oingo Boingo]], asked songwriter [[Danny Elfman]] to provide the music for the film. Since then, Elfman has scored every film that Tim Burton has directed, except for ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Calamar|first=Gary|title=Danny Elfman|url=http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/or/or050828danny_elfman|work=The Open Road|publisher=KCRW}}</ref> ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' and ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]''.\n\nAfter directing episodes for the [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|revitalized version]] of '50s/'60s anthology horror series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', Burton directed his next big project: ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), a supernatural [[comedy horror]] about a young couple forced to cope with life after death, and the family of pretentious yuppies who invade their treasured New England home. Their teenage daughter Lydia ([[Winona Ryder]]) has an obsession with death which allows her to see the deceased couple. Starring [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Geena Davis]], and featuring [[Michael Keaton]] as the obnoxious bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, the film grossed $80&nbsp;million on a relatively low budget and won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]]. It would be converted into a [[Beetlejuice (TV series)|cartoon of the same name]], with Burton playing a role as executive producer, that ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].\n\nBurton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives, and he received his first big budget film, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. The production was plagued with problems. Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers, [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], but the most notable debacle involved casting. For the title role, Burton chose to cast Michael Keaton as [[Batman]] following their previous collaboration in ''Beetlejuice'', despite Keaton's average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor. Although Burton won in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent that Warner Brothers' share price slumped.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a \"bulked-up\" ultra-masculine man as Batman, insisting that Batman should be an ordinary man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals. Burton cast [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] ([[Tim Curry]] being his second choice) in a move that helped assuage fans' fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a [[superhero film]]. When the film opened in June 1989, it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing over US$250&nbsp;million in the U.S. and $400&nbsp;million worldwide (numbers not adjusted for inflation) and earning critical acclaim for the performances of both Keaton and Nicholson, as well as the film's production aspects, which won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]. The success of the film helped establish Burton as a profitable director, and it proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of [[Richard Donner]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' for a grimmer, more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth. It also became a major inspiration for the successful 1990s cartoon ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', in as much as the darkness of the picture and its sequel allowed for a darker Batman on television.\n\nBurton claimed that the graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' was a major influence on his film adaptation of ''Batman'':\n\n<blockquote>I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan&nbsp;\u2013 and I think it started when I was a child&nbsp;\u2013 is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was [[dyslexia]] or whatever, but that's why I loved ''The Killing Joke'', because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable.<ref>Tim Burton, ''Burton on Burton: Revised Edition'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 71.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, Burton co-wrote (with [[Caroline Thompson]]) and directed ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', re-uniting with Winona Ryder from ''Beetlejuice''. His friend [[Johnny Depp]], a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old-fashioned inventor (played by [[Vincent Price]] in one of his last screen appearances). Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator. Set in suburbia (and shot in [[Lakeland, Florida]]), the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his childhood in Burbank. Burton's idea<ref>{{Citation|last=EviLQuicK|title=Edward Scissorhands - Hollywood Backstories - PART1|date=2008-08-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaPob-C7Z3E|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref> for the character of Edward Scissorhands came from a drawing he created in high school. Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, ''Burton on Burton'', regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film. ''Edward Scissorhands'' is considered one of Burton's best movies by some critics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Biodrowski |first=Steve |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2000/10/edward-scissorhands-tim-burtons-elephant-man/ |title=Edward Scissorhands&nbsp;\u2013 Film & DVD Review |publisher=Cinefantastique Online |date=October 24, 2000 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref> Burton has stated that this is his most personable and meaningful film because it's a representation of him not being able to communicate effectively with others as a teenager.\n\nAfter the success of ''Batman'', Burton agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Bros. on the condition that he would be granted total control. The result was ''[[Batman Returns]]'', which featured Michael Keaton returning as Batman, and a new triad of villains: [[Danny DeVito]] (as [[Penguin (character)|the Penguin]]), [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] (as [[Catwoman]]) and [[Christopher Walken]] (as [[Max Shreck]], an evil corporate tycoon and original character created for the film). Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children. Audiences were more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume. Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would subsequently be applied to the character in both comics and television. While in the comics, he was an ordinary man, Burton created a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed, flipper-like fingers, a hooked, beak-like nose, and a penguin-like body (resulting in a rotund, obese man). Released in 1992, ''Batman Returns'' grossed $282.8&nbsp;million worldwide, making it a financial success, though not to the extent of its predecessor.\n\nDue to schedule constraints on ''Batman Returns'', Burton produced, but did not direct, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993) for Disney, originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme. The film was directed by [[Henry Selick]] and written by [[Caroline Thompson]], based on Burton's original story, world and characters. The film received positive reviews for the stop motion animation, musical score and original storyline. It was a box office success, grossing $50&nbsp;million. Because of the ruling nature of the film, it was not produced under Disney's name, but rather Disney owned Touchstone Pictures. Disney wanted the protagonist to have eyes,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60723/21-things-you-didnt-know-about-nightmare-christmas|title=21 Things You Didn't Know About ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''|date=2018-10-13|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}</ref> but it didn't happen. There were over 100 people working on this motion picture just to create the characters, and it took 3 years of work to produce the film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60723/21-things-you-didnt-know-about-nightmare-christmas|title=21 Things You Didn't Know About ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''|date=2017-12-03|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}</ref> Burton collaborated with Selick again for ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996), which Burton co-produced.\n\nIn 1994, Burton and frequent co-producer [[Denise Di Novi]] produced the 1994 fantasy-comedy ''[[Cabin Boy]]'', starring comedian [[Chris Elliott]] and directed/written by [[Adam Resnick]]. Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'', but handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''. Burton's next film, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of infamous director [[Ed Wood]]. Starring Johnny Depp in the title role, the film is an homage to the low-budget science fiction and horror films of Burton's childhood, and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity. Owing to creative squabbles during the making of ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'', Danny Elfman declined to score ''Ed Wood'', and the assignment went to [[Howard Shore]]. While a commercial failure at the time of its release, ''Ed Wood'' was well received by critics. [[Martin Landau]] received an Academy Award in the Best Supporting Actor category for his portrayal of [[Bela Lugosi]], and the film received the award for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]].\n\nDespite Burton's intention to still lead the ''Batman'' franchise, Warner Bros. considered ''Batman Returns'' too dark and unsafe for children. To attract the young audience, it was decided that [[Joel Schumacher]], who had directed films like ''[[The Client (1994 film)|The Client]]'', lead [[Batman Forever|the third film]], while Burton would only produce it in conjunction with [[Peter MacGregor-Scott]]. Following this change and the changes made by the new director, Michael Keaton resigned from the lead role and was replaced by [[Val Kilmer]]. Filming for ''Batman Forever'' began in late 1994 with new actors: [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, [[Nicole Kidman]] as Dr. Chase Meridian, [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Dick Grayson/Robin and [[Jim Carrey]] as Edward Nygma/ The Riddler; the only two actors who returned were [[Pat Hingle]] as Commissioner Gordon and [[Michael Gough]] as Alfred Pennyworth. The film, a combination of the darkness that characterized the saga and colors and neon signs proposed by Schumacher, was a huge box office success, earning $336&nbsp;million. Warner Bros. demanded that Schumacher delete some scenes so the film did not have the same tone as its predecessor, ''Batman Returns'' (later they were added as deleted scenes on the 2005 DVD release).\n\nIn 1996, Burton and Selick reunited for the musical fantasy ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'', based on the book by [[Roald Dahl]] which contains magical elements and references to drugs and alcohol.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/james-the-giant-peach-author-summary.html|title=James & the Giant Peach: Author & Summary {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}</ref> The film, a combination of live action and stop motion footage, starred [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Simon Callow]] and [[Jane Leeves]] among others, with Burton producing and Selick directing. The film was mostly praised by critics, and was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] (by [[Randy Newman]]).\n\nElfman and Burton reunited for ''Mars Attacks!'' (1996). Based on a popular science fiction trading card series, the film was a hybrid of 1950s science fiction and 1970s all-star disaster films. Coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', which had been released five months earlier. The film boasted an all-star cast, including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Lukas Haas]], [[Martin Short]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Christina Applegate]] and [[Jack Black]].\n\n''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', released in late 1999, had a supernatural setting and contained another performance by Johnny Depp as [[Ichabod Crane]], a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of [[Washington Irving]]'s original tale. With ''Sleepy Hollow'', Burton paid homage to the horror films of the English company [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]]. [[Christopher Lee]], one of Hammer's stars, was given a cameo role. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles ([[Michael Gough]], [[Jeffrey Jones]] and [[Christopher Walken]], among others) and [[Christina Ricci]] was cast as Katrina van Tassel. A well-regarded supporting cast was headed by [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Michael Gambon]], [[Richard Griffiths]] and [[Ian McDiarmid]]. Mostly well received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman's gothic score, the film won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], as well as two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. A box office success, ''Sleepy Hollow'' was also a turning point for Burton. Along with change in his personal life (separation from actress [[Lisa Marie (actress)|Lisa Marie]]), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' which, as Burton had repeatedly noted, was \"not a remake\" of the earlier film.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Pedro Almod\u00f3var and Tim Burton 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|180px|Tim Burton (right) and [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] at the premi\u00e8re of ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' in [[Madrid]], in 2007]]\n''Planet of the Apes'' was a commercial success, grossing $68&nbsp;million in its opening weekend. The film has received mixed reviews and is widely considered inferior to [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|the first adaptation]] of [[Planet of the Apes (novel)|the novel]]. In 2003, Burton directed ''Big Fish'', based on the novel ''[[Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions]]'' by [[Daniel Wallace (author)|Daniel Wallace]]. The film is about a father telling the story of his life to his son using exaggeration and color. Starring [[Ewan McGregor]] as young Edward Bloom and [[Albert Finney]] as an older Edward Bloom, the film also stars [[Jessica Lange]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Alison Lohman]] and [[Marion Cotillard]]. ''Big Fish'' received four [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominations as well as an Academy Award nomination for Elfman's score. The film was also the second collaboration between Burton and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who played the characters of Jenny and the Witch.\n\n''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (2005) is an adaptation of the [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|book of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]]. Starring Johnny Depp as [[Willy Wonka]], [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket and [[Deep Roy]] as the [[Oompa-Loompas]], the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', although some liberties were taken, such as adding Wonka's issue with his father (played by [[Christopher Lee]]). ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was later nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. The film made over $207&nbsp;million domestically.

He is known for his [[Gothic film|gothic]] fantasy and horror films such as ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005), ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (2007), ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' (2012), and ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' (2012). He is also known for [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films, such as the adventure-comedy ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), the superhero films ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and its first sequel, ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), the sci-fi film ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (2001), the fantasy-drama ''[[Big Fish]]'' (2003), the musical adventure film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005), the fantasy film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010), and the film adaptation of ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]'' (2016).\n\nBurton has often worked with actor [[Johnny Depp]] and composer [[Danny Elfman]], who has composed scores for all but three of the films Burton has directed. [[Helena Bonham Carter]], Burton's former [[domestic partnership|domestic partner]], has appeared in many of his films. He wrote and illustrated the poetry book ''[[The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories]]'', published in 1997 by British publishing house [[Faber and Faber]], and a compilation of his drawings, sketches and other artwork, entitled ''The Art of Tim Burton'', was released in 2009. A follow-up to that book, entitled ''The Napkin Art of Tim Burton: Things You Think About in a Bar'', containing sketches made by Burton on [[napkin]]s at bars and restaurants he occasionally visits, was released in 2015.\n\n==Early life==\nBurton was born in 1958, in [[Burbank, California]], the son of Jean Burton (n\u00e9e Erickson), later the owner of a cat-themed gift shop, and William  \"Bill\" Burton, a former minor league baseball player who was working for the Burbank Parks and Recreation Department.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last=Morgenstern |first=Joe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/09/magazine/tim-burton-batman-and-the-joker.html?pagewanted=all |title=Tim Burton, Batman and The Joker |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=April 9, 1989 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article544489.ece?print=yes&randnumb=1151003209000 | work=The Times | location=London | title=Tim+Burton | accessdate=May 25, 2010 | first=Sadie | last=Gray}}{{dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=December 2019}}</ref> As a [[Preadolescence|preteen]], Burton would make short films in his backyard on Evergreen Street using crude [[stop motion]] animation techniques or shoot them on 8&nbsp;mm film without sound (one of his oldest known juvenile films is ''[[The Island of Doctor Agor]]'', which he made when he was 13 years old). Burton attended Providencia Elementary School in Burbank. Burton went to [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]], but he was not a particularly good student. He played on the water polo team at Burbank High. Burton was an introspective person and found pleasure in painting, drawing and watching movies. His future work would be heavily influenced by the works of such childhood heroes as [[Dr. Seuss]] and [[Roald Dahl]].<ref>Alison McMahan (2005).

His concept art never made it into the finished films.\n\nWhile at Disney in 1982, Burton made his first short, ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'', a six-minute black-and-white [[stop motion]] film based on a poem written by the filmmaker, and depicting a young boy who fantasizes that he is his hero [[Vincent Price]], with Price himself providing narration. The film was produced by [[Rick Heinrichs]], whom Burton had befriended while working in the concept art department at Disney. The film was shown at the Chicago Film Festival and released, alongside the teen drama ''[[Tex (film)|Tex]]'', for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema. This was followed by Burton's first live-action production ''[[Hansel and Gretel (1983 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]'', a Japanese-themed adaptation of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[Hansel and Gretel|fairy tale]] for the [[Disney Channel]], which climaxes in a [[kung fu]] fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch. Having aired once in 1983 at 10:30 pm on Halloween and promptly shelved, prints of the film are extremely difficult to locate, fueling rumors that the project did not exist. The short would finally go on public display in 2009 at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and again in 2011 as part of the Tim Burton art exhibit at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Is the Tim Burton Exhibition at LACMA for Kids?|url=http://museumstories.com/2011/09/26/is-lacmas-tim-burton-exhibition-for-kids/|website=museumstories.com|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Exhibit covers Tim Burton\u2019s career as filmmaker and artist|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/burton-303022-tim-art.html|website=Orange County Register|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> It was again shown at the [[Seoul Museum of Art]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Burton's 'nightmares' become hit museum exhibit|url=http://travel.cnn.com/tim-burtons-nightmares-arrive-seoul-015476/|website=CNN|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nBurton's next live-action short film, ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'', was released in 1984. It tells the story of a young boy who tries to revive his dog after it is run over by a car. Filmed in black-and-white, it stars [[Barret Oliver]], [[Shelley Duvall]] (with whom he would work again in 1986, directing an episode of her ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'') and [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]. After ''Frankenweenie'' was completed, Disney fired Burton, under the pretext of him spending the company's resources on a film that would be too dark and scary for children to see.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-editors/tim-burton-disney-fired-181740632.html|title=Tim Burton: How Disney fired me|first=Edward|last=Bovingdon |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Pee-wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at [[The Groundlings]] and [[The Roxy (London)|the Roxy]] which was later turned into an [[The Pee-wee Herman Show|HBO special]]. The film, ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'', was made on a budget of $8&nbsp;million and grossed more than $40&nbsp;million at the North American box office. Burton, a fan of the eccentric musical group [[Oingo Boingo]], asked songwriter [[Danny Elfman]] to provide the music for the film. Since then, Elfman has scored every film that Tim Burton has directed, except for ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Calamar|first=Gary|title=Danny Elfman|url=http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/or/or050828danny_elfman|work=The Open Road|publisher=KCRW}}</ref> ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' and ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]''.\n\nAfter directing episodes for the [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|revitalized version]] of '50s/'60s anthology horror series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', Burton directed his next big project: ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), a supernatural [[comedy horror]] about a young couple forced to cope with life after death, and the family of pretentious yuppies who invade their treasured New England home. Their teenage daughter Lydia ([[Winona Ryder]]) has an obsession with death which allows her to see the deceased couple. Starring [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Geena Davis]], and featuring [[Michael Keaton]] as the obnoxious bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, the film grossed $80&nbsp;million on a relatively low budget and won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]]. It would be converted into a [[Beetlejuice (TV series)|cartoon of the same name]], with Burton playing a role as executive producer, that ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].\n\nBurton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives, and he received his first big budget film, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. The production was plagued with problems. Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers, [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], but the most notable debacle involved casting. For the title role, Burton chose to cast Michael Keaton as [[Batman]] following their previous collaboration in ''Beetlejuice'', despite Keaton's average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor. Although Burton won in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent that Warner Brothers' share price slumped.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a \"bulked-up\" ultra-masculine man as Batman, insisting that Batman should be an ordinary man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals. Burton cast [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] ([[Tim Curry]] being his second choice) in a move that helped assuage fans' fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a [[superhero film]]. When the film opened in June 1989, it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing over US$250&nbsp;million in the U.S. and $400&nbsp;million worldwide (numbers not adjusted for inflation) and earning critical acclaim for the performances of both Keaton and Nicholson, as well as the film's production aspects, which won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]. The success of the film helped establish Burton as a profitable director, and it proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of [[Richard Donner]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' for a grimmer, more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth. It also became a major inspiration for the successful 1990s cartoon ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', in as much as the darkness of the picture and its sequel allowed for a darker Batman on television.\n\nBurton claimed that the graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' was a major influence on his film adaptation of ''Batman'':\n\n<blockquote>I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan&nbsp;\u2013 and I think it started when I was a child&nbsp;\u2013 is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was [[dyslexia]] or whatever, but that's why I loved ''The Killing Joke'', because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable.<ref>Tim Burton, ''Burton on Burton: Revised Edition'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 71.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, Burton co-wrote (with [[Caroline Thompson]]) and directed ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', re-uniting with Winona Ryder from ''Beetlejuice''. His friend [[Johnny Depp]], a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old-fashioned inventor (played by [[Vincent Price]] in one of his last screen appearances). Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator. Set in suburbia (and shot in [[Lakeland, Florida]]), the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his childhood in Burbank. Burton's idea<ref>{{Citation|last=EviLQuicK|title=Edward Scissorhands - Hollywood Backstories - PART1|date=2008-08-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaPob-C7Z3E|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref> for the character of Edward Scissorhands came from a drawing he created in high school. Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, ''Burton on Burton'', regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film. ''Edward Scissorhands'' is considered one of Burton's best movies by some critics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Biodrowski |first=Steve |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2000/10/edward-scissorhands-tim-burtons-elephant-man/ |title=Edward Scissorhands&nbsp;\u2013 Film & DVD Review |publisher=Cinefantastique Online |date=October 24, 2000 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref> Burton has stated that this is his most personable and meaningful film because it's a representation of him not being able to communicate effectively with others as a teenager.\n\nAfter the success of ''Batman'', Burton agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Bros. on the condition that he would be granted total control. The result was ''[[Batman Returns]]'', which featured Michael Keaton returning as Batman, and a new triad of villains: [[Danny DeVito]] (as [[Penguin (character)|the Penguin]]), [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] (as [[Catwoman]]) and [[Christopher Walken]] (as [[Max Shreck]], an evil corporate tycoon and original character created for the film). Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children. Audiences were more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume. Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would subsequently be applied to the character in both comics and television. While in the comics, he was an ordinary man, Burton created a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed, flipper-like fingers, a hooked, beak-like nose, and a penguin-like body (resulting in a rotund, obese man). Released in 1992, ''Batman Returns'' grossed $282.8&nbsp;million worldwide, making it a financial success, though not to the extent of its predecessor.\n\nDue to schedule constraints on ''Batman Returns'', Burton produced, but did not direct, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993) for Disney, originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme. The film was directed by [[Henry Selick]] and written by [[Caroline Thompson]], based on Burton's original story, world and characters. The film received positive reviews for the stop motion animation, musical score and original storyline. It was a box office success, grossing $50&nbsp;million. Because of the ruling nature of the film, it was not produced under Disney's name, but rather Disney owned Touchstone Pictures. Disney wanted the protagonist to have eyes,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60723/21-things-you-didnt-know-about-nightmare-christmas|title=21 Things You Didn't Know About ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''|date=2018-10-13|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}</ref> but it didn't happen. There were over 100 people working on this motion picture just to create the characters, and it took 3 years of work to produce the film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60723/21-things-you-didnt-know-about-nightmare-christmas|title=21 Things You Didn't Know About ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''|date=2017-12-03|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}</ref> Burton collaborated with Selick again for ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996), which Burton co-produced.\n\nIn 1994, Burton and frequent co-producer [[Denise Di Novi]] produced the 1994 fantasy-comedy ''[[Cabin Boy]]'', starring comedian [[Chris Elliott]] and directed/written by [[Adam Resnick]]. Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'', but handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''. Burton's next film, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of infamous director [[Ed Wood]]. Starring Johnny Depp in the title role, the film is an homage to the low-budget science fiction and horror films of Burton's childhood, and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity. Owing to creative squabbles during the making of ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'', Danny Elfman declined to score ''Ed Wood'', and the assignment went to [[Howard Shore]]. While a commercial failure at the time of its release, ''Ed Wood'' was well received by critics. [[Martin Landau]] received an Academy Award in the Best Supporting Actor category for his portrayal of [[Bela Lugosi]], and the film received the award for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]].\n\nDespite Burton's intention to still lead the ''Batman'' franchise, Warner Bros. considered ''Batman Returns'' too dark and unsafe for children. To attract the young audience, it was decided that [[Joel Schumacher]], who had directed films like ''[[The Client (1994 film)|The Client]]'', lead [[Batman Forever|the third film]], while Burton would only produce it in conjunction with [[Peter MacGregor-Scott]]. Following this change and the changes made by the new director, Michael Keaton resigned from the lead role and was replaced by [[Val Kilmer]]. Filming for ''Batman Forever'' began in late 1994 with new actors: [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, [[Nicole Kidman]] as Dr. Chase Meridian, [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Dick Grayson/Robin and [[Jim Carrey]] as Edward Nygma/ The Riddler; the only two actors who returned were [[Pat Hingle]] as Commissioner Gordon and [[Michael Gough]] as Alfred Pennyworth. The film, a combination of the darkness that characterized the saga and colors and neon signs proposed by Schumacher, was a huge box office success, earning $336&nbsp;million. Warner Bros. demanded that Schumacher delete some scenes so the film did not have the same tone as its predecessor, ''Batman Returns'' (later they were added as deleted scenes on the 2005 DVD release).\n\nIn 1996, Burton and Selick reunited for the musical fantasy ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'', based on the book by [[Roald Dahl]] which contains magical elements and references to drugs and alcohol.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/james-the-giant-peach-author-summary.html|title=James & the Giant Peach: Author & Summary {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}</ref> The film, a combination of live action and stop motion footage, starred [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Simon Callow]] and [[Jane Leeves]] among others, with Burton producing and Selick directing. The film was mostly praised by critics, and was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] (by [[Randy Newman]]).\n\nElfman and Burton reunited for ''Mars Attacks!'' (1996). Based on a popular science fiction trading card series, the film was a hybrid of 1950s science fiction and 1970s all-star disaster films. Coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', which had been released five months earlier. The film boasted an all-star cast, including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Lukas Haas]], [[Martin Short]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Christina Applegate]] and [[Jack Black]].\n\n''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', released in late 1999, had a supernatural setting and contained another performance by Johnny Depp as [[Ichabod Crane]], a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of [[Washington Irving]]'s original tale. With ''Sleepy Hollow'', Burton paid homage to the horror films of the English company [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]]. [[Christopher Lee]], one of Hammer's stars, was given a cameo role. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles ([[Michael Gough]], [[Jeffrey Jones]] and [[Christopher Walken]], among others) and [[Christina Ricci]] was cast as Katrina van Tassel. A well-regarded supporting cast was headed by [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Michael Gambon]], [[Richard Griffiths]] and [[Ian McDiarmid]]. Mostly well received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman's gothic score, the film won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], as well as two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. A box office success, ''Sleepy Hollow'' was also a turning point for Burton. Along with change in his personal life (separation from actress [[Lisa Marie (actress)|Lisa Marie]]), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' which, as Burton had repeatedly noted, was \"not a remake\" of the earlier film.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Pedro Almod\u00f3var and Tim Burton 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|180px|Tim Burton (right) and [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] at the premi\u00e8re of ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' in [[Madrid]], in 2007]]\n''Planet of the Apes'' was a commercial success, grossing $68&nbsp;million in its opening weekend. The film has received mixed reviews and is widely considered inferior to [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|the first adaptation]] of [[Planet of the Apes (novel)|the novel]]. In 2003, Burton directed ''Big Fish'', based on the novel ''[[Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions]]'' by [[Daniel Wallace (author)|Daniel Wallace]]. The film is about a father telling the story of his life to his son using exaggeration and color. Starring [[Ewan McGregor]] as young Edward Bloom and [[Albert Finney]] as an older Edward Bloom, the film also stars [[Jessica Lange]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Alison Lohman]] and [[Marion Cotillard]]. ''Big Fish'' received four [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominations as well as an Academy Award nomination for Elfman's score. The film was also the second collaboration between Burton and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who played the characters of Jenny and the Witch.\n\n''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (2005) is an adaptation of the [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|book of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]]. Starring Johnny Depp as [[Willy Wonka]], [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket and [[Deep Roy]] as the [[Oompa-Loompas]], the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', although some liberties were taken, such as adding Wonka's issue with his father (played by [[Christopher Lee]]). ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was later nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. The film made over $207&nbsp;million domestically. Filming proved difficult as Burton, Depp, and Danny Elfman had to work on this and Burton's ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005) at the same time, which was Burton's first full-length stop motion film as a director, featuring the voices of [[Johnny Depp]] as Victor and [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Emily in the lead roles.\n\nBurton directed his first music video \"[[Bones (The Killers song)|Bones]]\" in 2006. \"Bones\" is the sixth overall single by American indie rock band [[The Killers]], the second released from their second studio album, ''[[Sam's Town]]''. Starring in this video were actors [[Michael Steger]] and [[Devon Aoki]]. Burton went to direct a second music video for [[The Killers]]' \"[[Here with Me (The Killers song)|Here with Me]]\", starring Winona Ryder, released in 2012.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/12/watch-the-killers-here-with-me-video-directed-by-tim-burton-and-starring-winona-ryder/ |title=Watch The Killers\u2019 \"Here With Me\" video, directed by Tim Burton and starring Winona Ryder |magazine=Consequence of Sound |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe DreamWorks/Warner Bros. production ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' was released on December 21, 2007.

The film blends explicit gore and Broadway tunes, and was well received by critics. [[Johnny Depp]]'s performance as [[Sweeney Todd]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\nIn 2005, filmmaker [[Shane Acker]] released his short film ''[[9 (short film)|9]]'', a story about a sentient rag doll living in a post-apocalyptic world who tries to stop machines from destroying the rest of his eight fellow rag dolls. The film won numerous awards and was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]. After seeing the short film, Tim Burton and [[Timur Bekmambetov]], director of ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'', showed interest in producing a [[9 (2009 animated film)|feature-length adaptation of the film]]. Directed by Acker, the full-length film was produced by Burton, written by Acker (story) and [[Pamela Pettler]] (screenplay, co-writer of ''[[Corpse Bride]]'') and featured the voice work of [[Elijah Wood]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Martin Landau]] and [[Crispin Glover]], among others.\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:Tim Burton at ComicCon 2009.jpg|thumb|Tim Burton speaking about ''[[9 (2009 animated film)|9]]'' at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]], 2009]]\nTim Burton appeared at the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con|Comic-Con]] in San Diego, California, to promote both ''9'' and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', the latter won two [[Academy Awards]], for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].

Since 1870, the Church of Ireland has designated St Patrick's as the national cathedral for the whole of Ireland, drawing chapter members from each of the twelve [[List of Church of Ireland dioceses|dioceses]] of the Church of Ireland. The [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|dean]] is the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] for the cathedral; this office has existed since 1219. The most famous office holder was [[Jonathan Swift]].\n\n===Status===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[File:presidentspew.jpg|thumb|250px|State pew of the [[President of Ireland]], still retains a British Standard carving on the front]]\nThere is almost no precedent for a two-cathedral city, and some believe it was intended that St Patrick's, a secular (diocesan clergy who are not members of a religious order, i.e. under a rule and, therefore, \"regular\") cathedral, would replace Christ Church, a cathedral managed by an order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nA confrontational situation persisted, with considerable tension, over the decades after the establishment of St Patrick's, and was eventually settled, more-or-less, by the signing of a six-point agreement of 1300, ''Pacis Compositio''. Still extant, and in force until 1870, it provided that:\n* The consecration and enthronement of the Archbishop of Dublin was to take place at Christ Church \u2013 records show that this provision was not always followed, with many archbishops enthroned in both, and at least two in Saint Patrick's only\n* Christ Church had formal precedence, as the mother and senior cathedral of the diocese\n* Christ Church was to retain the cross, mitre and ring of each deceased Archbishop of Dublin\n* Deceased Archbishops of Dublin were to be buried alternately in each of the two cathedrals, unless they personally willed otherwise\n* The annual consecration of chrism oil for the diocese was to take place at Christ Church\n* The two cathedrals were to act as one, and shared equally in their freedoms.\n\nOver the following centuries, the two cathedrals functioned together in the diocese, until in the period of disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the current designation of one as the ''cathedral of Dublin and Glendalough'', and one as the ''National Cathedral'', was developed.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Reformation period===\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Choir, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg |thumb|right|The choir of St Patrick's Cathedral]]\n\nIn 1192, [[John Comyn (archbishop)|John Comyn]], first Anglo-Norman [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], elevated one of the four Dublin Celtic parish churches, this one dedicated to [[Saint Patrick]], beside a holy well of the same name and on an island between two branches of the [[River Poddle]], to the status of a collegiate church, i.e., a church with a body of clergy devoted to both worship and learning. The new collegiate church fell outside the City boundaries, and this move created two new civic territories, one under the Archbishop's temporal jurisdiction. The church was dedicated to \"God, our Blessed Lady Mary and St Patrick\" on 17 March 1191.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 8</ref>\n\nComyn's charter of 1191 or 1192, which allowed for a chapter of thirteen canons, of which three held special dignities (as Chancellor, Precentor and Treasurer), was confirmed by a [[Papal Bull]] (of [[Pope Celestine III]]) within a year. The thirteen [[prebendaries]] attached to the church were provided with archepiscopal lands.\n\nOver time, a whole complex of buildings arose in the vicinity of the cathedral, including the Palace of the St Sepulchre (seat of the Archbishop), and legal jurisdiction was divided between a Liberty controlled by the Dean, around the cathedral, and a larger one belonging to the Archbishop, adjacent.\n\nWhile it is not clear when precisely the church was further raised to the status of cathedral, a unique move in a city with an existing cathedral, it was probably after 1192, and Comyn's successor as Archbishop, [[Henry de Loundres]], was elected in 1212 by the chapters of both Christ Church and St Patrick's, this election being recognised by [[Pope Innocent III]]. See below for more on the question of status. Henry granted a number of further charters to the Cathedral and Chapter between 1218 and 1220, and one of these in 1220 created the office of Dean to head the Cathedral,<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 9</ref> the right of election being allocated solely to the canons of the Chapter.\n\nThe basis of the present building, as noted, the largest church in Ireland, was built between 1191 and 1270, though little now remains of the earliest work beyond the Baptistry. Much of the work was overseen by the previously mentioned Henry of London, a friend of the King of England and signatory of the [[Magna Carta]], who was also involved in the construction of Dublin's city walls, and [[Dublin Castle]].\n\nAn order from [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1225 allowed the collection of donations from across the island for reconstruction for a period of four years, and the work, in the Early English [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, lasted at least until rededication in 1254. The [[Lady Chapel]] was added around 1270.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nIn 1300, [[Richard de Ferings|Archbishop Ferings]] of Dublin arranged an agreement between the two cathedrals, the ''Pacis Compositio'', which acknowledged both as cathedrals and made some provision to accommodate their shared status.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 73\u201374</ref> For more, see ''Status'' below.\n\nIn 1311 the [[Medieval University of Dublin]] was founded here with [[William de Rodyard]], Dean of St Patrick's, as its first Chancellor, and the Canons as its members. It never flourished, and was suppressed at the [[Reformation]].\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, and for over 500 years, the north [[transept]] of the building was used as the parish church of [[Church of St Nicholas Without, (Church of Ireland)|St Nicholas Without]] (i.e. the part of the Parish of St Nicholas outside the city proper).\n\nThe tower (Minot's Tower) and west [[nave]] were rebuilt between 1362 and 1370, following a fire. The name commemorates [[Thomas Minot]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] 1363\u201375, who oversaw the rebuilding.\n\nFrom the very earliest years there were problems with seepage of water, with a number of floods, especially in the later years of the 18th century, caused by the surrounding branches of the River Poddle \u2013 even in the 20th century, it is reported that the water table was within 2.3 metres (7.5&nbsp;feet) of the floor.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10, note 3</ref> This situation ensured there would never be a crypt or basement area.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10</ref>\n\n===Reformation period===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012|reason=Only one citation and that appears only to support a single clause of text about the 1555 charter}}\n[[File:St. Patrick's Jones memorial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to [[Thomas Jones (Archbishop)|Thomas Jones]], Dean of St Patrick's from 1581 to 1585]]\n\nAfter the [[English Reformation]] (an uneven process between 1536 and 1564 but at St Patrick's, effective from about 1537), St Patrick's became an [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] church. Most Dubliners followed the same line. In the 1530s some images within the cathedral were defaced by soldiers under [[Thomas Cromwell]],{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and neglect led to collapse of the nave in 1544. The conventionally-flexible style of the Archbishop of Dublin [[Hugh Curwen]] is instructive; he was a follower firstly of Henry's non-Reformed church in the 1530s, then of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] full-blown Protestantism c.1550, then accepting his appointment as archbishop during [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary's]] reversion of the church to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1555, and continued to serve as the archbishop, using the Anglican rite from 1559, under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] until 1567.\n\nUnder [[King Edward VI]], St Patrick's Cathedral was formally suppressed, and the building demoted back to the status of parish church. On 25 April 1547, a pension of 200 marks sterling was assigned to \"Sir Edward Basnet\", the Dean, followed, some months later, by pensions of \u00a360 each to Chancellor Alien and Precentor Humphrey, and \u00a340 to Archdeacon Power. The silver, jewels, and ornaments were transferred to the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. The King designated part of the building for use as a court house, the Cathedral Grammar School was established in the then vicar's hall and the deanery given to the archbishop, following the transfer of the Archbishop's Palace to the Lord Deputy of Ireland. In 1549, it was further ordered that the walls be repainted and inscribed with passages from the scriptures.\n\nIn 1555 a charter of the joint monarchs [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] and [[Mary I of England|Mary]] restored the cathedral's privileges<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 13</ref> and initiated restoration and a late document of Queen Mary's reign, a deed dated 27 April 1558, comprises a release or receipt by Thomas Leverous, the new Dean, and the Chapter of St Patrick's, of the \"goods, chattels, musical instruments, etc.\", belonging to the Cathedral, and which had been in the possession of the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. It was during this reign that the patronal festival of the Blessed Virgin Mary was last celebrated (in 1558).\n\nFollowing the ejection of the Catholic chapter of canons in 1559, the Catholic community continued in the 1560s\u20131570s at least to go on nominating canons and the principal dignitaries to St Patrick's.\n\nIn 1560, one of Dublin's first public clocks was erected in \"St Patrick's Steeple\".\n\n===17th century===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Lady Chapel, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Lady Chapel in Saint Patrick's Cathedral today.]]\nBy the early 17th century, the Lady Chapel was said to have been in ruins, and the arch at the east end of the choir was closed off by a lath and plaster partition wall. There was also routine flooding and a series of galleries was added to accommodate large congregations. In 1620 the English-born judge [[Luke Gernon]]  referred to the Cathedral's poor state of repair.<ref>Gernon, Luke  ''A Discourse of Ireland'' 1620 edited by C.S Falkiner 1904</ref>\n\nDuring the stay of [[Oliver Cromwell]] in Dublin, during his [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|conquest of Ireland]] the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]'s [[Lord Protector]] stabled his horses in the nave of the cathedral. This was intended to demonstrate Cromwell's disrespect for the [[Anglican]] religion, which he associated with [[Roman Catholicism]] and political [[Cavalier|Royalism]].\n\nAfter the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, repairs to the building were begun.\n\nIn 1666, the Cathedral Chapter offered the Lady Chapel for the use of French-speaking [[Huguenots]] who had fled to Ireland, and after some repair and preparation works, it became known as ''L'Eglise Fran\u00e7aise de St Patrick''. A lease was signed on 23 December 1665 and was renewed from time to time until the special services ceased in 1816, by which time the Huguenots had been fully assimilated into the city population.\n\nIn 1668 the roof, in danger of collapsing, was taken down, a new roof being completed by 1671. Buttresses were erected and the west window was replaced with a perpendicular window. Then, in the 1680s, the choir was reformed. In 1688\u201390, during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], [[James II of England|James II]] and his fellow [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] briefly repossessed St Patrick's. James attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] services there with his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters for a time.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} However, the victory of the Protestant Williamites in this war meant that the cathedral was restored to Anglican ownership in 1690 when James abandoned Dublin after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bust of [[Jonathan Swift]]]]\n[[File:Dublin, St.Patrick's Cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mid 18th century floor plan]]\nThroughout its long history the cathedral has contributed much to Irish life, and one key aspect of this relates to the writer and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]], author of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', who was [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the cathedral from 1713 to 1745. Many of his famous sermons and \"Irish tracts\" (such as the ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'') were given during his stay as Dean.<ref>''History of St Patrick's Cathedral'' by Monck Mason</ref>\n\nHis grave and [[epitaph]] can be seen in the cathedral, along with those of his friend Stella. Swift took a great interest in the building, its services and music and in what would now be called social welfare, funding an almshouse for poor women and Saint Patrick's Hospital.\n\nThe Choir School, which had been founded in 1432, supplied many of its members to take part in the very first performance of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] in 1742.\n\nIn 1749, the cathedral spire was added by [[George Semple]]; it remains one of Dublin's landmarks.\n\nIn 1792, divine service was temporarily suspended due to the poor condition of the south wall, then 60 centimetres (2&nbsp;feet) out of perpendicular, and of parts of the roof.\n\n====Chivalric chapels====\n* Knights of St Patrick. From 1783 until 1871 the cathedral served as the Chapel of the Most Illustrious [[Order of Saint Patrick]], members of which were the Knights of St Patrick. With the dis-establishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871 the installation ceremony moved to [[St. Patrick's Hall (Dublin)|St Patrick's Hall]], [[Dublin Castle]]. The heraldic banners of the knights at the time of the change still hang over the choir stalls to this day.\n* ''Paris-Malta obedience'' of the [[Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910)]]. The Cathedral contains the so-called ''Dunsany''{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Chapel which is the spiritual home of the order in Ireland. The decoration of the chapel was provided for by Randall Plunkett, 19th [[Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], who established the order in Ireland in 1962. The cathedral is used for its [[investiture]] ceremonies and the Dean of the Cathedral is an Ecclesiastical [[Commander (order)|Commander]] of the order.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral stones.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic cross discovered near the church in the 19th century.]]\n[[File:Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral Statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bronze statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness by John Henry Foley, erected in 1875.<ref>{{cite book |last=Casey |first=Christine |title=The Buildings of Ireland: Dublin |isbn=978-0-300-10923-8 |page=606 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005}}</ref>]]\nBy 1805, the north transept was in ruins and the south transept was in a poor condition; urgent work was carried out to the nave roof, held up by scaffolding.\n\nIn 1846, the post of Dean of Saint Patrick's was united with that of Dean of Christ Church, a situation which lasted in law until 1872.\n\nAn attempt at major restoration began under the direction of Dean Pakenham (Dean, 1843\u20131864), limited by poor economic circumstances. The Lady Chapel was restored, the floor (then raised several metres) reduced to its original level and other urgent matters were at least partly addressed.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a Celtic cross was found buried near the cathedral. This has been preserved and it is thought it may have marked the site of the former holy well.\n\nThe major reconstruction, paid for by [[Benjamin Guinness]], in 1860\u201365, and inspired by the fear that the cathedral was in imminent danger of collapse, means that much of the current building and decoration dates from the [[Victorian era]]; medieval [[Chantry|chantries]] were removed among other actions, and few records of the work survive today.\n\nThough the rebuilding ensured the survival of the Cathedral, the failure to preserve records of the scale of the rebuild means that little is known as to how much of the current building is genuinely [[medi\u00e6val]] and how much is Victorian pastiche. Sir Benjamin's statue by [[John Henry Foley|JH Foley]] is outside the south door. His son [[Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun|Arthur]] (also a brewer) came in for humorous but gentle criticism when he donated a stained glass window of '[[Rebecca]] at the well'; its motto read: 'I was thirsty and ye gave me drink'. In 1901 his son [[Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Edward]] created the adjacent \"St Patrick's Park\" from an area of decrepit housing, and donated a new set of bells to the cathedral.\n\nThe other great change for the cathedral occurred in 1871 when, following disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the newly independent church at its general synod finally resolved the \"two cathedral\" issue, making Christ Church the sole and undisputed cathedral of the Dublin diocese and St Patrick's the national cathedral.\n\n==Present==\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Nave 2, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The nave as viewed from the western end]]\n\nThe cathedral plays host to a number of public national ceremonies. Ireland's [[Remembrance Day]] ceremonies, hosted by the [[Royal British Legion]] and attended by the President of Ireland, take place there every November. Its carol service (the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols), celebrated twice in December, including every 24 December, is a colourful feature of Dublin life.\n\nOn Saturdays in autumn the cathedral hosts the graduation ceremonies of [[Technological University Dublin]].\n\nThe funerals of two Irish presidents, [[Douglas Hyde]] and [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine Childers]], took place there in 1949<ref>[http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Irish-Presidents.aspx The State Pew at St Patrick's Cathedral]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2w1004tq&chunk.id=d0e7854&toc.depth=1&toc.id=&brand=ucpress |author1=Dunleavy, Janet Egleson |author2=Gareth W.

At President Hyde's funeral, the whole of the Irish government and opposition contingent, but for Childers and [[Noel Browne]], stayed in the foyer of the church. This was because, at the time of the funeral, the [[Holy See]] forbade Roman Catholics from entering the churches of other Christian traditions.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Because President Childers died in office, his [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]] was a major state occasion. The attendance included foreign dignitaries King [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin of the Belgians]], the [[Vice-President of the United States]] ([[Spiro T. Agnew]] representing [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]]), [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] (representing [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]), [[British Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] and former British prime minister [[Edward Heath]].\n\nIn 2006, the cathedral's national prominence was used by a group of 18 Afghan migrants seeking asylum, who occupied it for several days before being persuaded to leave without trouble.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Anne-Marie |title=Timeline: how tense drama at St Patrick's unfolded |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/timeline-how-tense-drama-at-st-patricks-unfolded-26385590.html |website=Independent.ie |publisher=Irish Independent |accessdate=1 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Dean and chapter===\n[[File:Saint patrick floor.jpg|thumb|250px|Floor of the cathedral]]\nThe cathedral is headed by the [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|Dean]] and governed by the entire chapter, originally 13 in number and having been as many as 30, now numbering up to 28, whose foundation and members' rights derive from the charter of 1191 as approved by Pope Celestine in 1192.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of the Church of Ireland, the dean is the \"immediate ordinary of the cathedral for the purpose of directing the clergy and official and ordering the services\". However, \"All other matters relating to the cathedral and not otherwise provided for shall be determined in chapter\".<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2011/1028/1224306622399.html \"An ecumenical matter for St Patrick's'', ''The Irish Times'', 28 October 2011.]</ref>\nThe members of the chapter, which today represents in part the whole Church of Ireland, hold one of four ''dignities'' or special offices, or one of 24 prebends (22 regular, 2 ecumenical as noted below). One prebend is reserved for the Archbishop of Dublin, an unusual arrangement which is only actively used for elections of the dean.\n\nOf the 13 original prebends, several were later reallocated, new ones created to replace them, and later, yet further prebends were designated. For many years, the chapter comprised the four dignities, the archdeacons of Dublin and Glendalough and 24 prebendaries, but the archdeacons ceased to be members based on those offices in the late 19th century.\n\n===Cathedral group of parishes (1970 to 2012)===\nAs part of a reorganisation of city-based parishes (many with long histories), several were attached to each of the Dublin cathedrals. The Saint Patrick's Cathedral Group of Parishes which dated as a group from 1970 ceased to exist on the retirement of Dean Robert MacCarthy on 25 January 2012.\n\nA new parish, called the Parish of St Catherine and St James with St Audoen, was created by an act of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/pdf/Synod/2010/statutes/statute_ch_ii.pdf|title = Statute, Chapter II of 2010|date = 2010|accessdate = 2015-12-27|website = |publisher = |last = The Church of Ireland|first = General Synod of}}</ref> This new parish is made up of each of the parishes of St Peter, St Matthias and St Audoen; St Catherine and St James; and St Luke and St Kevin.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Our New Parish|url = http://cja.dublin.anglican.org/history/our-new-parish/|website = St Catherine and St James with St Audoen|accessdate = 2015-12-27|language = en-US}}</ref> The rector is the Revd Canon M.

Gardner, Prebendary of Maynooth.\n\n===Current offices===\n* Dean: from 1220 to 2007, the dean held the prebend of [[Clondalkin]] (a prebend since 1191), and churches at Kilberry, Clonwanwyr (Cloney) and Clonardmacgory (Tullaghgory), all later in the Parish of Kilberry. In 1228, the Church of [[Tallaght]] was attached to the Deanery. The current dean is the Very Revd William Morton, one time Dean of [[St Columb's Cathedral]], Londonderry.\n* Precentor: the precentor was given the prebend of a portion of [[Lusk, County Dublin|Lusk]] in 1191, and in 1218 the churches of St Andrew in Dublin and Ardree. After several changes, a portion of Lusk was left. The current precentor is the Revd Peter Campion.\n* Chancellor: from 1218 to 2007, the chancellor held the prebend of [[Finglas]] (from the 1191 charter) and the churches of St Martin's (Dublin) and Killachegar, though the latter ceased by 1280.

Doogan, Incumbent of Ballyholme (Down).\n* Tymothan: a manor estate, rather than a church, was attached to the Archbishopric until 1247, and has since been independent, though until Disestablishment, often vacant. As of September 2014, the Prebendary of Tymothan is Canon Paul Willoughby, Rector of the Kilmocomoge Union of Parishes (Cork).\n* Mulhuddart: [[Mulhuddart]] has a history intertwined with the prebend of [[Castleknock]], the two having been designated from at least 1230.

Gardner, Rector of St Catherine and St James with St Audoen (Dublin).\n* Howth: [[Howth]] was one of the founding prebends, and at any early stage, the Archbishops removed the prebendal church from [[Ireland's Eye]] to Howth village. The Prebendary of Howth as of January 2018 is Revd. Canon David Crooks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/installation-canon-david-crooks-prebendary-howth/|title=Installation of Canon David Crooks as Prebendary of Howth|date=2017-01-13|website=St Patrick's Cathedral|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref>\n* [[Rathmichael]]: this has been a prebend since 1227 at latest. At July 2013, Prebendary of [[Rathmichael]] is the Revd C. W.

Harvey, Rector of Abbeyleix (Leighlin).\n* Cualaun: after the impedance of the Prebend of Tymothan, and following a gap, from 1317, this prebend without a church provided a seat for the Archbishop of Dublin at the Chapter, used only at the election of a dean. The Prebendary of Cualan as at September 2011 is the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Revd M. G. St A. Jackson.\n* [[Clondalkin]]: transferred from the dean in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Heather Morris, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland\n* [[Finglas]]: transferred from the chancellor in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Kiaran O'Mahony OSA.\n\n===Ecumenical canons===\nAs noted above, in late June and early July 2007, Saint Patrick's appointed two ecumenical canons, one Presbyterian and one Roman Catholic, who can be invited by the dean to say Morning or Evening Prayer in the cathedral, read holy scripture and assist at baptisms, marriages, funerals or celebration of Holy Communion as well as participating in the meetings and decisions of the chapter.\n\n==Notable features==\n[[File:Doorreconciliation.jpg|thumb|The Door of Reconciliation, through a hole in which the earls of Kildare and Ormond shook hands in 1492.]]\nThe cathedral, which generally receives no State funding, welcomes all, with a chapel for those who come simply to pray and a small fee for those who wish to sight-see.<ref name=\"opening-times\">{{cite web | url=http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Opening_Times.aspx | title=St Patrick's Cathedral \u2013 Opening Times and Prices | publisher=St Patrick's Cathedral | accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> The Cathedral website mentioned in 2006 that visitor numbers had reached around 300,000 a year.\n\nLegend has it that Saint Patrick's was the place where the expression \"[[chancing your arm]]\" (meaning to take a risk) originated, when [[Gerald M\u00f3r FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]], cut a hole in a door there, still to be seen, and thrust his arm through it to shake hands in friendship, in an effort to call a truce in the [[Butler\u2013FitzGerald dispute]] with James, Earl of Ormond in 1492.\n\nIt was outside St Patrick's that the troops of the Jacob's Garrison assembled after the [[Easter Rising]] to march to [[Richmond Barracks]] where their leader [[Thomas MacDonagh]] and his sub-officers [[John MacBride]] and [[Michael O'Hanrahan]] were condemned to death and moved to [[Kilmainham Gaol]] to be shot.\n\n===Burials===\nOver 500 people are buried on the site, both under the cathedral's floor and in the graveyard outside. \nSome notable individuals include:\n[[File:The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin.jpg|thumb|The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin]]\n*[[Richard Northalis]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[John de Sandford]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n* [[Hugh Inge]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[Marcus Beresford (bishop)|Marcus Beresford]]\n* Sir [[John Blennerhassett (judge)|John Blennerhassett]] and his wife\n*[[Thomas Jones (archbishop)|Thomas Jones]] as well as his wife\n*[[Michael Boyle (the younger)|Michael Boyle]]\n*[[Richard Meredith (bishop)|Richard Meredith]]\n*[[Michael Tregury]], Archbishop of Dublin (1450\u20131471)\n*[[Adam Loftus (archbishop)|Adam Loftus]], also the first [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] \u2013 in a family vault also containing his wife and two of their children\n*[[John Cradock]], Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin (1772\u20131778)\n* [[Frederick Schomberg]], 1st Duke of Schomberg (1615/6-1690)\n*[[Jonathan Swift]], author and dean of the cathedral and [[Esther Johnson]] (\"Stella\") his companion of many years.\n*Sir [[Jerome Alexander]] (died 1670), a notoriously severe judge\n*[[Thomas Cromwell, 3rd Earl of Ardglass]]\n*[[Lennox Robinson]], Playwright and Director\n\n===Choir school and grammar school===\n[[File:Yoke.JPG|thumb|right|The current [[organ console]]]]\n\nThe choir school continues and although originally all-male, now also admits girls; a Cathedral Girls' Choir was founded in 2000 and sings once or twice a week. The girls are mostly drawn from either the choir school or St Patrick's Grammar School, which provides a secondary education. It is no longer compulsory for grammar school pupils to be in the choirs, although many of the girls are, and a few boys; many of the boys leave when their voice breaks. Choirboys are considered professional singers and are paid monthly for their services. The girls are not. The choir also sings very occasionally at weddings and receive payment for this. Until 1998 they received a large discount on their education; they are still offered free music lessons. While non-choirboy students had two months' holidays during the summer, half of the boys were on duty every day during the summer and had to attend choir practice and two services each weekday, one service on Saturday and two on Sunday. This arrangement was also changed in 1998.\n\n===Organ===\nThe organ of St Patrick's Cathedral is one of the largest in Ireland with over 4,000 pipes. Parts of it date from a [[Renatus Harris]] instrument of 1695.<ref>\"The Cathedrals of the [[Church of Ireland]]\" [[John Godfrey FitzMaurice Day|Day, J.G.F./]] [[Henry Edmund Patton|Patton, H.E.]] p79: [[London]], [[SPCK|S.P.C.K.]], [[1932]]</ref> The organ was rebuilt in the 1890s by Henry Willis and Son, in consultation with Sir George Martin.

The [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|dean]] is the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] for the cathedral; this office has existed since 1219. The most famous office holder was [[Jonathan Swift]].\n\n===Status===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[File:presidentspew.jpg|thumb|250px|State pew of the [[President of Ireland]], still retains a British Standard carving on the front]]\nThere is almost no precedent for a two-cathedral city, and some believe it was intended that St Patrick's, a secular (diocesan clergy who are not members of a religious order, i.e. under a rule and, therefore, \"regular\") cathedral, would replace Christ Church, a cathedral managed by an order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nA confrontational situation persisted, with considerable tension, over the decades after the establishment of St Patrick's, and was eventually settled, more-or-less, by the signing of a six-point agreement of 1300, ''Pacis Compositio''. Still extant, and in force until 1870, it provided that:\n* The consecration and enthronement of the Archbishop of Dublin was to take place at Christ Church \u2013 records show that this provision was not always followed, with many archbishops enthroned in both, and at least two in Saint Patrick's only\n* Christ Church had formal precedence, as the mother and senior cathedral of the diocese\n* Christ Church was to retain the cross, mitre and ring of each deceased Archbishop of Dublin\n* Deceased Archbishops of Dublin were to be buried alternately in each of the two cathedrals, unless they personally willed otherwise\n* The annual consecration of chrism oil for the diocese was to take place at Christ Church\n* The two cathedrals were to act as one, and shared equally in their freedoms.\n\nOver the following centuries, the two cathedrals functioned together in the diocese, until in the period of disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the current designation of one as the ''cathedral of Dublin and Glendalough'', and one as the ''National Cathedral'', was developed.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Reformation period===\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Choir, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg |thumb|right|The choir of St Patrick's Cathedral]]\n\nIn 1192, [[John Comyn (archbishop)|John Comyn]], first Anglo-Norman [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], elevated one of the four Dublin Celtic parish churches, this one dedicated to [[Saint Patrick]], beside a holy well of the same name and on an island between two branches of the [[River Poddle]], to the status of a collegiate church, i.e., a church with a body of clergy devoted to both worship and learning. The new collegiate church fell outside the City boundaries, and this move created two new civic territories, one under the Archbishop's temporal jurisdiction. The church was dedicated to \"God, our Blessed Lady Mary and St Patrick\" on 17 March 1191.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 8</ref>\n\nComyn's charter of 1191 or 1192, which allowed for a chapter of thirteen canons, of which three held special dignities (as Chancellor, Precentor and Treasurer), was confirmed by a [[Papal Bull]] (of [[Pope Celestine III]]) within a year. The thirteen [[prebendaries]] attached to the church were provided with archepiscopal lands.\n\nOver time, a whole complex of buildings arose in the vicinity of the cathedral, including the Palace of the St Sepulchre (seat of the Archbishop), and legal jurisdiction was divided between a Liberty controlled by the Dean, around the cathedral, and a larger one belonging to the Archbishop, adjacent.\n\nWhile it is not clear when precisely the church was further raised to the status of cathedral, a unique move in a city with an existing cathedral, it was probably after 1192, and Comyn's successor as Archbishop, [[Henry de Loundres]], was elected in 1212 by the chapters of both Christ Church and St Patrick's, this election being recognised by [[Pope Innocent III]]. See below for more on the question of status. Henry granted a number of further charters to the Cathedral and Chapter between 1218 and 1220, and one of these in 1220 created the office of Dean to head the Cathedral,<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 9</ref> the right of election being allocated solely to the canons of the Chapter.\n\nThe basis of the present building, as noted, the largest church in Ireland, was built between 1191 and 1270, though little now remains of the earliest work beyond the Baptistry. Much of the work was overseen by the previously mentioned Henry of London, a friend of the King of England and signatory of the [[Magna Carta]], who was also involved in the construction of Dublin's city walls, and [[Dublin Castle]].\n\nAn order from [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1225 allowed the collection of donations from across the island for reconstruction for a period of four years, and the work, in the Early English [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, lasted at least until rededication in 1254. The [[Lady Chapel]] was added around 1270.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nIn 1300, [[Richard de Ferings|Archbishop Ferings]] of Dublin arranged an agreement between the two cathedrals, the ''Pacis Compositio'', which acknowledged both as cathedrals and made some provision to accommodate their shared status.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 73\u201374</ref> For more, see ''Status'' below.\n\nIn 1311 the [[Medieval University of Dublin]] was founded here with [[William de Rodyard]], Dean of St Patrick's, as its first Chancellor, and the Canons as its members. It never flourished, and was suppressed at the [[Reformation]].\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, and for over 500 years, the north [[transept]] of the building was used as the parish church of [[Church of St Nicholas Without, (Church of Ireland)|St Nicholas Without]] (i.e. the part of the Parish of St Nicholas outside the city proper).\n\nThe tower (Minot's Tower) and west [[nave]] were rebuilt between 1362 and 1370, following a fire. The name commemorates [[Thomas Minot]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] 1363\u201375, who oversaw the rebuilding.\n\nFrom the very earliest years there were problems with seepage of water, with a number of floods, especially in the later years of the 18th century, caused by the surrounding branches of the River Poddle \u2013 even in the 20th century, it is reported that the water table was within 2.3 metres (7.5&nbsp;feet) of the floor.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10, note 3</ref> This situation ensured there would never be a crypt or basement area.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10</ref>\n\n===Reformation period===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012|reason=Only one citation and that appears only to support a single clause of text about the 1555 charter}}\n[[File:St. Patrick's Jones memorial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to [[Thomas Jones (Archbishop)|Thomas Jones]], Dean of St Patrick's from 1581 to 1585]]\n\nAfter the [[English Reformation]] (an uneven process between 1536 and 1564 but at St Patrick's, effective from about 1537), St Patrick's became an [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] church. Most Dubliners followed the same line. In the 1530s some images within the cathedral were defaced by soldiers under [[Thomas Cromwell]],{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and neglect led to collapse of the nave in 1544. The conventionally-flexible style of the Archbishop of Dublin [[Hugh Curwen]] is instructive; he was a follower firstly of Henry's non-Reformed church in the 1530s, then of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] full-blown Protestantism c.1550, then accepting his appointment as archbishop during [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary's]] reversion of the church to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1555, and continued to serve as the archbishop, using the Anglican rite from 1559, under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] until 1567.\n\nUnder [[King Edward VI]], St Patrick's Cathedral was formally suppressed, and the building demoted back to the status of parish church. On 25 April 1547, a pension of 200 marks sterling was assigned to \"Sir Edward Basnet\", the Dean, followed, some months later, by pensions of \u00a360 each to Chancellor Alien and Precentor Humphrey, and \u00a340 to Archdeacon Power. The silver, jewels, and ornaments were transferred to the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. The King designated part of the building for use as a court house, the Cathedral Grammar School was established in the then vicar's hall and the deanery given to the archbishop, following the transfer of the Archbishop's Palace to the Lord Deputy of Ireland. In 1549, it was further ordered that the walls be repainted and inscribed with passages from the scriptures.\n\nIn 1555 a charter of the joint monarchs [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] and [[Mary I of England|Mary]] restored the cathedral's privileges<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 13</ref> and initiated restoration and a late document of Queen Mary's reign, a deed dated 27 April 1558, comprises a release or receipt by Thomas Leverous, the new Dean, and the Chapter of St Patrick's, of the \"goods, chattels, musical instruments, etc.\", belonging to the Cathedral, and which had been in the possession of the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. It was during this reign that the patronal festival of the Blessed Virgin Mary was last celebrated (in 1558).\n\nFollowing the ejection of the Catholic chapter of canons in 1559, the Catholic community continued in the 1560s\u20131570s at least to go on nominating canons and the principal dignitaries to St Patrick's.\n\nIn 1560, one of Dublin's first public clocks was erected in \"St Patrick's Steeple\".\n\n===17th century===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Lady Chapel, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Lady Chapel in Saint Patrick's Cathedral today.]]\nBy the early 17th century, the Lady Chapel was said to have been in ruins, and the arch at the east end of the choir was closed off by a lath and plaster partition wall. There was also routine flooding and a series of galleries was added to accommodate large congregations. In 1620 the English-born judge [[Luke Gernon]]  referred to the Cathedral's poor state of repair.<ref>Gernon, Luke  ''A Discourse of Ireland'' 1620 edited by C.S Falkiner 1904</ref>\n\nDuring the stay of [[Oliver Cromwell]] in Dublin, during his [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|conquest of Ireland]] the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]'s [[Lord Protector]] stabled his horses in the nave of the cathedral. This was intended to demonstrate Cromwell's disrespect for the [[Anglican]] religion, which he associated with [[Roman Catholicism]] and political [[Cavalier|Royalism]].\n\nAfter the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, repairs to the building were begun.\n\nIn 1666, the Cathedral Chapter offered the Lady Chapel for the use of French-speaking [[Huguenots]] who had fled to Ireland, and after some repair and preparation works, it became known as ''L'Eglise Fran\u00e7aise de St Patrick''. A lease was signed on 23 December 1665 and was renewed from time to time until the special services ceased in 1816, by which time the Huguenots had been fully assimilated into the city population.\n\nIn 1668 the roof, in danger of collapsing, was taken down, a new roof being completed by 1671. Buttresses were erected and the west window was replaced with a perpendicular window. Then, in the 1680s, the choir was reformed. In 1688\u201390, during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], [[James II of England|James II]] and his fellow [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] briefly repossessed St Patrick's. James attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] services there with his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters for a time.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} However, the victory of the Protestant Williamites in this war meant that the cathedral was restored to Anglican ownership in 1690 when James abandoned Dublin after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bust of [[Jonathan Swift]]]]\n[[File:Dublin, St.Patrick's Cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mid 18th century floor plan]]\nThroughout its long history the cathedral has contributed much to Irish life, and one key aspect of this relates to the writer and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]], author of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', who was [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the cathedral from 1713 to 1745. Many of his famous sermons and \"Irish tracts\" (such as the ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'') were given during his stay as Dean.<ref>''History of St Patrick's Cathedral'' by Monck Mason</ref>\n\nHis grave and [[epitaph]] can be seen in the cathedral, along with those of his friend Stella. Swift took a great interest in the building, its services and music and in what would now be called social welfare, funding an almshouse for poor women and Saint Patrick's Hospital.\n\nThe Choir School, which had been founded in 1432, supplied many of its members to take part in the very first performance of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] in 1742.\n\nIn 1749, the cathedral spire was added by [[George Semple]]; it remains one of Dublin's landmarks.\n\nIn 1792, divine service was temporarily suspended due to the poor condition of the south wall, then 60 centimetres (2&nbsp;feet) out of perpendicular, and of parts of the roof.\n\n====Chivalric chapels====\n* Knights of St Patrick. From 1783 until 1871 the cathedral served as the Chapel of the Most Illustrious [[Order of Saint Patrick]], members of which were the Knights of St Patrick. With the dis-establishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871 the installation ceremony moved to [[St. Patrick's Hall (Dublin)|St Patrick's Hall]], [[Dublin Castle]]. The heraldic banners of the knights at the time of the change still hang over the choir stalls to this day.\n* ''Paris-Malta obedience'' of the [[Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910)]]. The Cathedral contains the so-called ''Dunsany''{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Chapel which is the spiritual home of the order in Ireland. The decoration of the chapel was provided for by Randall Plunkett, 19th [[Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], who established the order in Ireland in 1962. The cathedral is used for its [[investiture]] ceremonies and the Dean of the Cathedral is an Ecclesiastical [[Commander (order)|Commander]] of the order.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral stones.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic cross discovered near the church in the 19th century.]]\n[[File:Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral Statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bronze statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness by John Henry Foley, erected in 1875.<ref>{{cite book |last=Casey |first=Christine |title=The Buildings of Ireland: Dublin |isbn=978-0-300-10923-8 |page=606 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005}}</ref>]]\nBy 1805, the north transept was in ruins and the south transept was in a poor condition; urgent work was carried out to the nave roof, held up by scaffolding.\n\nIn 1846, the post of Dean of Saint Patrick's was united with that of Dean of Christ Church, a situation which lasted in law until 1872.\n\nAn attempt at major restoration began under the direction of Dean Pakenham (Dean, 1843\u20131864), limited by poor economic circumstances. The Lady Chapel was restored, the floor (then raised several metres) reduced to its original level and other urgent matters were at least partly addressed.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a Celtic cross was found buried near the cathedral. This has been preserved and it is thought it may have marked the site of the former holy well.\n\nThe major reconstruction, paid for by [[Benjamin Guinness]], in 1860\u201365, and inspired by the fear that the cathedral was in imminent danger of collapse, means that much of the current building and decoration dates from the [[Victorian era]]; medieval [[Chantry|chantries]] were removed among other actions, and few records of the work survive today.\n\nThough the rebuilding ensured the survival of the Cathedral, the failure to preserve records of the scale of the rebuild means that little is known as to how much of the current building is genuinely [[medi\u00e6val]] and how much is Victorian pastiche. Sir Benjamin's statue by [[John Henry Foley|JH Foley]] is outside the south door. His son [[Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun|Arthur]] (also a brewer) came in for humorous but gentle criticism when he donated a stained glass window of '[[Rebecca]] at the well'; its motto read: 'I was thirsty and ye gave me drink'. In 1901 his son [[Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Edward]] created the adjacent \"St Patrick's Park\" from an area of decrepit housing, and donated a new set of bells to the cathedral.\n\nThe other great change for the cathedral occurred in 1871 when, following disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the newly independent church at its general synod finally resolved the \"two cathedral\" issue, making Christ Church the sole and undisputed cathedral of the Dublin diocese and St Patrick's the national cathedral.\n\n==Present==\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Nave 2, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The nave as viewed from the western end]]\n\nThe cathedral plays host to a number of public national ceremonies. Ireland's [[Remembrance Day]] ceremonies, hosted by the [[Royal British Legion]] and attended by the President of Ireland, take place there every November. Its carol service (the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols), celebrated twice in December, including every 24 December, is a colourful feature of Dublin life.\n\nOn Saturdays in autumn the cathedral hosts the graduation ceremonies of [[Technological University Dublin]].\n\nThe funerals of two Irish presidents, [[Douglas Hyde]] and [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine Childers]], took place there in 1949<ref>[http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Irish-Presidents.aspx The State Pew at St Patrick's Cathedral]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2w1004tq&chunk.id=d0e7854&toc.depth=1&toc.id=&brand=ucpress |author1=Dunleavy, Janet Egleson |author2=Gareth W.

At President Hyde's funeral, the whole of the Irish government and opposition contingent, but for Childers and [[Noel Browne]], stayed in the foyer of the church. This was because, at the time of the funeral, the [[Holy See]] forbade Roman Catholics from entering the churches of other Christian traditions.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Because President Childers died in office, his [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]] was a major state occasion.

However, \"All other matters relating to the cathedral and not otherwise provided for shall be determined in chapter\".<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2011/1028/1224306622399.html \"An ecumenical matter for St Patrick's'', ''The Irish Times'', 28 October 2011.]</ref>\nThe members of the chapter, which today represents in part the whole Church of Ireland, hold one of four ''dignities'' or special offices, or one of 24 prebends (22 regular, 2 ecumenical as noted below). One prebend is reserved for the Archbishop of Dublin, an unusual arrangement which is only actively used for elections of the dean.\n\nOf the 13 original prebends, several were later reallocated, new ones created to replace them, and later, yet further prebends were designated. For many years, the chapter comprised the four dignities, the archdeacons of Dublin and Glendalough and 24 prebendaries, but the archdeacons ceased to be members based on those offices in the late 19th century.\n\n===Cathedral group of parishes (1970 to 2012)===\nAs part of a reorganisation of city-based parishes (many with long histories), several were attached to each of the Dublin cathedrals.

In 1228, the Church of [[Tallaght]] was attached to the Deanery. The current dean is the Very Revd William Morton, one time Dean of [[St Columb's Cathedral]], Londonderry.\n* Precentor: the precentor was given the prebend of a portion of [[Lusk, County Dublin|Lusk]] in 1191, and in 1218 the churches of St Andrew in Dublin and Ardree. After several changes, a portion of Lusk was left. The current precentor is the Revd Peter Campion.\n* Chancellor: from 1218 to 2007, the chancellor held the prebend of [[Finglas]] (from the 1191 charter) and the churches of St Martin's (Dublin) and Killachegar, though the latter ceased by 1280. By 1280, St Martin's also no longer provided revenue but St Werburgh's replaced it. The current chancellor is the Revd [[Niall Sloane]].\n* Treasurer: this office originally held the church of Clonkene and the prebend of [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)|St Audoen's]] (Dublin), as well as the rectory of St Mary's near Dublin Castle. Ballymore-Eustace later replaced Clonkene, and part of Lusk, St Audoen's. The current treasurer is H. E. Finlay, Canon of Windsor (Royal Peculiar, UK).\n* [[Taney Parish|Taney]]: this prebend, relating to an ancient rural diocese, originated with the 1191 charter, was given to the Archdeacon of Dublin about 1275 and became independent in 1883 when the office of Archdeacon of Dublin ceased to hold a place in the chapter. The current Prebendary of Taney is the Venerable R. W. Carney, Archdeacon of Killaloe and Clonfert.\n* [[Newcastle, County Dublin]]: this is a prebend since at least 1227 and was held by the Archdeacon of Glendalough from 1467 to 1872, when that archdeacon ceased to be a member of the chapter. The current Prebendary of Newcastle is the Revd I. M.

Prebendary of Wicklow as at September 2011 is the Revd S. E. Doogan, Incumbent of Ballyholme (Down).\n* Tymothan: a manor estate, rather than a church, was attached to the Archbishopric until 1247, and has since been independent, though until Disestablishment, often vacant. As of September 2014, the Prebendary of Tymothan is Canon Paul Willoughby, Rector of the Kilmocomoge Union of Parishes (Cork).\n* Mulhuddart: [[Mulhuddart]] has a history intertwined with the prebend of [[Castleknock]], the two having been designated from at least 1230.

Mullen, dean's vicar .\n* Monmohenock: originally part of the \"Economy Estate\" which supported cathedral operations, this became a lay-appointed prebend but was a regular prebend by circa 1227. The Prebendary of Monmohenock is the Revd T. C. Kinehan, Rector of Helen's Bay (Down).\n* Tipperkevin: Tipperkevin actually comprised two prebendaries from the early 14th century to circa 1600, lying in the remote parts of County Dublin later separate from the main county, between Kildare and Wicklow. As at September 2011, the Prebendary of Tipperkevin is the Revd R. Warren, Rector of Taney Parish (Dublin).\n* Donaghmore: this was a prebend from at least 1267. The Prebendary of Donaghmore as at September 2011 is the Revd E. R. G. West, Rector of Carnteel (Armagh).\n* Stagonil: named as a prebend in the Papal Bull of Celestine III, this does not seem to have functioned independently until 1303. The Prebendary of Stagonil as at December 2015 is the Revd P.A. Harvey, Rector of Abbeyleix (Leighlin).\n* Cualaun: after the impedance of the Prebend of Tymothan, and following a gap, from 1317, this prebend without a church provided a seat for the Archbishop of Dublin at the Chapter, used only at the election of a dean. The Prebendary of Cualan as at September 2011 is the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Revd M. G. St A. Jackson.\n* [[Clondalkin]]: transferred from the dean in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Heather Morris, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland\n* [[Finglas]]: transferred from the chancellor in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Kiaran O'Mahony OSA.\n\n===Ecumenical canons===\nAs noted above, in late June and early July 2007, Saint Patrick's appointed two ecumenical canons, one Presbyterian and one Roman Catholic, who can be invited by the dean to say Morning or Evening Prayer in the cathedral, read holy scripture and assist at baptisms, marriages, funerals or celebration of Holy Communion as well as participating in the meetings and decisions of the chapter.\n\n==Notable features==\n[[File:Doorreconciliation.jpg|thumb|The Door of Reconciliation, through a hole in which the earls of Kildare and Ormond shook hands in 1492.]]\nThe cathedral, which generally receives no State funding, welcomes all, with a chapel for those who come simply to pray and a small fee for those who wish to sight-see.<ref name=\"opening-times\">{{cite web | url=http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Opening_Times.aspx | title=St Patrick's Cathedral \u2013 Opening Times and Prices | publisher=St Patrick's Cathedral | accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> The Cathedral website mentioned in 2006 that visitor numbers had reached around 300,000 a year.\n\nLegend has it that Saint Patrick's was the place where the expression \"[[chancing your arm]]\" (meaning to take a risk) originated, when [[Gerald M\u00f3r FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]], cut a hole in a door there, still to be seen, and thrust his arm through it to shake hands in friendship, in an effort to call a truce in the [[Butler\u2013FitzGerald dispute]] with James, Earl of Ormond in 1492.\n\nIt was outside St Patrick's that the troops of the Jacob's Garrison assembled after the [[Easter Rising]] to march to [[Richmond Barracks]] where their leader [[Thomas MacDonagh]] and his sub-officers [[John MacBride]] and [[Michael O'Hanrahan]] were condemned to death and moved to [[Kilmainham Gaol]] to be shot.\n\n===Burials===\nOver 500 people are buried on the site, both under the cathedral's floor and in the graveyard outside. \nSome notable individuals include:\n[[File:The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin.jpg|thumb|The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin]]\n*[[Richard Northalis]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[John de Sandford]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n* [[Hugh Inge]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[Marcus Beresford (bishop)|Marcus Beresford]]\n* Sir [[John Blennerhassett (judge)|John Blennerhassett]] and his wife\n*[[Thomas Jones (archbishop)|Thomas Jones]] as well as his wife\n*[[Michael Boyle (the younger)|Michael Boyle]]\n*[[Richard Meredith (bishop)|Richard Meredith]]\n*[[Michael Tregury]], Archbishop of Dublin (1450\u20131471)\n*[[Adam Loftus (archbishop)|Adam Loftus]], also the first [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] \u2013 in a family vault also containing his wife and two of their children\n*[[John Cradock]], Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin (1772\u20131778)\n* [[Frederick Schomberg]], 1st Duke of Schomberg (1615/6-1690)\n*[[Jonathan Swift]], author and dean of the cathedral and [[Esther Johnson]] (\"Stella\") his companion of many years.\n*Sir [[Jerome Alexander]] (died 1670), a notoriously severe judge\n*[[Thomas Cromwell, 3rd Earl of Ardglass]]\n*[[Lennox Robinson]], Playwright and Director\n\n===Choir school and grammar school===\n[[File:Yoke.JPG|thumb|right|The current [[organ console]]]]\n\nThe choir school continues and although originally all-male, now also admits girls; a Cathedral Girls' Choir was founded in 2000 and sings once or twice a week. The girls are mostly drawn from either the choir school or St Patrick's Grammar School, which provides a secondary education. It is no longer compulsory for grammar school pupils to be in the choirs, although many of the girls are, and a few boys; many of the boys leave when their voice breaks. Choirboys are considered professional singers and are paid monthly for their services. The girls are not. The choir also sings very occasionally at weddings and receive payment for this. Until 1998 they received a large discount on their education; they are still offered free music lessons. While non-choirboy students had two months' holidays during the summer, half of the boys were on duty every day during the summer and had to attend choir practice and two services each weekday, one service on Saturday and two on Sunday. This arrangement was also changed in 1998.\n\n===Organ===\nThe organ of St Patrick's Cathedral is one of the largest in Ireland with over 4,000 pipes.

Lutz also claimed that the privacy hysteria was \"baseless\", as wandering had been an official diagnosis for five years, and there are a wide variety of communication devices to put on children are available with no retaliation.

Lutz also claimed that the privacy hysteria was \"baseless\", as wandering had been an official diagnosis for five years, and there are a wide variety of communication devices to put on children are available with no retaliation.

System values that get close enough to the attractor values remain close even if slightly disturbed.\n\nIn finite-dimensional systems, the evolving variable may be represented [[algebra]]ically as an ''n''-dimensional [[Coordinate vector|vector]]. The attractor is a region in [[space (mathematics)|''n''-dimensional space]]. In [[Physics|physical systems]], the ''n'' dimensions may be, for example, two or three positional coordinates for each of one or more physical entities; in [[Economics|economic systems]], they may be separate variables such as the [[inflation rate]] and the [[unemployment rate]].\n\nIf the evolving variable is two- or three-dimensional, the attractor of the dynamic process can be represented [[Geometry|geometrically]] in two or three dimensions, (as for example in the three-dimensional case depicted to the right). An attractor can be a [[point (geometry)|point]], a finite set of points, a [[curve]], a [[manifold]], or even a complicated set with a [[fractal]] structure known as a ''strange attractor'' (see [[Attractor#Strange attractor|strange attractor]] below). If the variable is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], the attractor is a subset of the real number line. Describing the attractors of chaotic dynamical systems has been one of the achievements of [[chaos theory]].\n\nA [[trajectory]] of the dynamical system in the attractor does not have to satisfy any special constraints except for remaining on the attractor, forward in time.  The trajectory may be [[Periodic function|periodic]] or [[Chaos theory|chaotic]]. If a set of points is periodic or chaotic, but the flow in the neighborhood is away from the set, the set is not an attractor, but instead is called a '''repeller''' (or ''repellor'').\n\n== Motivation of attractors ==\nA [[dynamical system]] is generally described by one or more [[differential equations|differential]] or [[difference equations]]. The equations of a given dynamical system specify its behavior over any given short period of time.  To determine the system's behavior for a longer period, it is often necessary to [[Integral|integrate]] the equations, either through analytical means or through [[iteration]], often with the aid of computers.\n\nDynamical systems in the physical world tend to arise from [[dissipative system|dissipative systems]]: if it were not for some driving force, the motion would cease.  (Dissipation may come from [[friction|internal friction]], [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic losses]], or loss of material, among many causes.)  The dissipation and the driving force tend to balance,  killing off initial transients and settle the system into its typical behavior. The subset of the [[phase space]] of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the '''attractor''', also known as the attracting section or attractee.\n\nInvariant sets and [[limit set]]s are similar to the attractor concept. An ''invariant set'' is a set that evolves to itself under the dynamics. Attractors may contain invariant sets. A ''limit set'' is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set (i.e. to each point of the set) as time goes to infinity.  Attractors are limit sets, but not all limit sets are attractors: It is possible to have some points of a system converge to a limit set, but different points when perturbed slightly off the limit set may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the limit set.\n\nFor example, the [[damping ratio|damped]] [[pendulum]] has two invariant points: the point {{math|x<sub>0</sub>}} of minimum height and the point {{math|x<sub>1</sub>}} of maximum height.  The point {{math|x<sub>0</sub>}} is also a limit set, as trajectories converge to it; the point {{math|x<sub>1</sub>}} is not a limit set.  Because of the dissipation due to air resistance, the point {{math|x<sub>0</sub>}} is also an attractor.  If there was no dissipation, {{math|x<sub>0</sub>}} would not be an attractor. Aristotle believed that objects moved only as long as they were pushed, which is an early formulation of a dissipative attractor.\n\nExponential [[chaos theory|divergence of trajectories]] complicates detailed predictions, but the world is knowable due to the existence of robust attractors.\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\nLet ''t'' represent time and let ''f''(''t'', \u2022) be a function which specifies the dynamics of the system.  That is, if ''a'' is a point in an ''n''-dimensional phase space, representing the initial state of the system, then ''f''(0, ''a'') = ''a'' and, for a positive value of ''t'', ''f''(''t'', ''a'') is the result of the evolution of this state after ''t'' units of time.  For example, if the system describes the evolution of a free particle in one dimension then the phase space is the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup> with coordinates (''x'',''v''), where ''x'' is the position of the particle, ''v'' is its velocity, ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x'',''v''), and the evolution is given by\n\n[[File:Julia immediate basin 1 3.png|right|thumb|Attracting period-3 cycle and its immediate basin of attraction for a certain parametrization of ''f''(''z'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''c''. The three darkest points are the points of the 3-cycle, which lead to each other in sequence, and iteration from any point in the basin of attraction leads to (usually asymptotic) convergence to this sequence of three points.]]\n\n: <math> f(t,(x,v))=(x+tv,v).\\ </math>\n\nAn '''attractor''' is a [[subset]] ''A'' of the [[phase space]] characterized by the following three conditions:\n* ''A'' is ''forward invariant'' under ''f'': if ''a'' is an element of ''A'' then so is ''f''(''t'',''a''), for all&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.\n* There exists a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of ''A'', called the '''basin of attraction''' for ''A'' and denoted ''B''(''A''), which consists of all points ''b'' that \"enter ''A'' in the limit ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e\". More formally, ''B''(''A'') is the set of all points ''b'' in the phase space with the following property:\n:: For any open neighborhood ''N'' of ''A'', there is a positive constant ''T'' such that ''f''(''t'',''b'') \u2208 ''N'' for all real ''t'' > ''T''.\n* There is no proper (non-empty) subset of ''A'' having the first two properties.\n\nSince the basin of attraction contains an [[open set]] containing ''A'', every point that is sufficiently close to ''A'' is attracted to ''A''.  The definition of an attractor uses a [[metric space|metric]] on the phase space, but the resulting notion usually depends only on the topology of the phase space. In the case of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, the Euclidean norm is typically used.\n\nMany other definitions of attractor occur in the literature.  For example, some authors require that an attractor have positive [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] (preventing a point from being an attractor), others relax the requirement that ''B''(''A'') be a neighborhood. <ref>Milnor, J. (1985). \"On the Concept of Attractor.\" Comm. Math. Phys 99: 177\u2013195.\n</ref>\n\n== Types of attractors ==\nAttractors are portions or [[subset]]s of the [[Configuration space (physics)|phase space]] of a [[dynamical system]].  Until the 1960s, attractors were thought of as being [[Geometric primitive|simple geometric subsets]] of the phase space, like [[Point (geometry)|points]], [[Line (mathematics)|lines]], [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s, and simple regions of [[three-dimensional space]].  More complex attractors that cannot be categorized as simple geometric subsets, such as [[topology|topologically]] wild sets, were known of at the time but were thought to be fragile anomalies.  [[Stephen Smale]] was able to show that his [[horseshoe map]] was [[structural stability|robust]] and that its attractor had the structure of a [[Cantor set]].\n\nTwo simple attractors are a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] and the [[limit cycle]].  Attractors can take on many other geometric shapes (phase space subsets).  But when these sets (or the motions within them) cannot be easily described as simple combinations (e.g. [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]]) of [[Geometric primitive|fundamental geometric objects]] (e.g. [[Line (mathematics)|lines]], [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s, [[sphere]]s, [[toroid]]s, [[manifold]]s), then the attractor is called a ''[[attractor#Strange attractor|strange attractor]]''.\n\n=== Fixed point ===\n[[File:Critical orbit 3d.png|right|thumb|Weakly attracting fixed point for a complex number evolving according to a [[complex quadratic polynomial]]. The phase space is the horizontal complex plane; the vertical axis measures the frequency with which points in the complex plane are visited. The point in the complex plane directly below the peak frequency is the fixed point attractor.]]\nA [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of a function or transformation is a point that is mapped to itself by the function or transformation. If we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations, then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation.  The final state that a dynamical system evolves towards corresponds to an attracting fixed point of the evolution function for that system, such as the center bottom position of a [[damping ratio|damped]] [[pendulum]], the level and flat water line of sloshing water in a glass, or the bottom center of a bowl contain a rolling marble. But the fixed point(s) of a dynamic system is not necessarily an attractor of the system. For example, if the bowl containing a rolling marble was inverted and the marble was balanced on top of the bowl, the center bottom (now top) of the bowl is a fixed state, but not an attractor.  This is equivalent to the difference between [[Stability theory#Stability of fixed points|stable and unstable equilibria]]. In the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl (a hill), that point at the top of the bowl (hill) is a fixed point (equilibrium), but not an attractor (stable equilibrium).\n\nIn addition, physical dynamic systems with at least one fixed point invariably have multiple fixed points and attractors due to the reality of dynamics in the physical world, including the [[nonlinear dynamics]] of [[stiction]], [[friction]], [[surface roughness]], [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] (both [[Elastic deformation|elastic]] and [[plastic]]ity), and even [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name=\"Contact of Nominally Flat Surfaces\">{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=J.

Each of these points is called a [[periodic point]]. This is illustrated by the [[logistic map]], which depending on its specific parameter value can have an attractor consisting of 2<sup>''n''</sup> points, 3\u00d72<sup>''n''</sup> points, etc., for any value of ''n''.\n\n=== Limit cycle ===\n{{main|Limit cycle}}\nA [[limit cycle]] is a periodic orbit of a continuous dynamical system that is [[isolated point|isolated]].  Examples include the swings of a [[pendulum clock]], and the heartbeat while resting. (The limit cycle of an ideal pendulum is not an example of a limit cycle attractor because its orbits are not isolated: in the phase space of the ideal pendulum, near any point of a periodic orbit there is another point that belongs to a different periodic orbit, so the former orbit is not attracting).\n\n[[File:VanDerPolPhaseSpace.png|center|250px|thumb|<center>[[Van der Pol oscillator|Van der Pol]] [[phase portrait]]: an attracting limit cycle</center>]]\n\n=== Limit torus ===\nThere may be more than one frequency in the periodic trajectory of the system through the state of a limit cycle. For example, in physics, one frequency may dictate the rate at which a planet orbits a star while a second frequency describes the oscillations in the distance between the two bodies. If two of these frequencies form an [[irrational number|irrational fraction]] (i.e. they are [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurate]]), the trajectory is no longer closed, and the limit cycle becomes a limit [[torus]]. This kind of attractor is called an {{math|''N''<sub>''t''</sub>}} -torus if there are {{math|N<sub>t</sub>}} incommensurate frequencies. For example, here is a 2-torus:\n\n[[File:torus.png|300px]]\n\nA time series corresponding to this attractor is a [[quasiperiodic]] series: A discretely sampled sum of {{math|N<sub>t</sub>}} periodic functions (not necessarily [[sine]] waves) with incommensurate frequencies. Such a time series does not have a strict periodicity, but its [[power spectrum]] still consists only of sharp lines.\n\n=== Strange attractor ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Lorenz attractor]] -->\n[[File:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|200px|right|A plot of Lorenz's strange attractor for values&nbsp;''\u03c1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28,&nbsp;''\u03c3''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10,&nbsp;''\u03b2''&nbsp;=&nbsp;8/3]]\nAn attractor is called '''strange''' if it has a [[fractal]] structure. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are [[chaos theory|chaotic]], but [[strange nonchaotic attractor]]s also exist.  If a strange attractor is chaotic, exhibiting [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor, after any of various numbers of iterations, will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart (subject to the confines of the attractor), and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together. Thus a dynamic system with a chaotic attractor is locally unstable yet globally stable: once some sequences have entered the attractor, nearby points diverge from one another but never depart from the attractor.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Grebogi Celso, Ott Edward, Yorke James A | year = 1987 | title = Chaos, Strange Attractors, and Fractal Basin Boundaries in Nonlinear Dynamics | url = | journal = Science | volume = 238 | issue = 4827| pages = 632\u2013638 | doi = 10.1126/science.238.4827.632 }}</ref>\n\nThe term '''strange attractor''' was coined by [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] to describe the attractor resulting from a series of [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]] of a system describing fluid flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ruelle |first=David |last2=Takens |first2=Floris |date=1971 |title=On the nature of turbulence |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103857186 |journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=167\u2013192 |doi=10.1007/bf01646553}}</ref> Strange attractors are often [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] in a few directions, but some are [[homeomorphic|like]] a [[Cantor dust]], and therefore not differentiable.

The attractor for any value of the parameter ''r'' is shown on the vertical line at that ''r''.]]\n\nA particular functional form of a dynamic equation can have various types of attractor depending on the particular parameter values used in the function. An example is the well-studied [[logistic map]],  <math>x_{t+1}=rx_t(1-x_t),</math> whose basins of attraction for various values of the parameter ''r'' are shown in the diagram. At some values of the parameter the attractor is a single point, at others it is two points that are visited in turn, at others it is 2<sup>''n''</sup> points or ''k''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup> points that are visited in turn, for any value of ''n'' depending on the value of the parameter ''r'', and at other values of ''r'' an infinitude of points are visited.\n\n==Basins of attraction==\n\nAn attractor's '''basin of attraction''' is the region of the [[phase space]], over which iterations are defined, such that any point (any [[initial condition]]) in that region will eventually be iterated into the attractor. For a [[stability (mathematics)|stable]] [[linear system]], every point in the phase space is in the basin of attraction. However, in [[nonlinear system]]s, some points may map directly or [[asymptotic behavior|asymptotically]] to infinity, while other points may lie in a different basin of attraction and map asymptotically into a different attractor; other initial conditions may be in or map directly into a non-attracting point or cycle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Strelioff|first1=C.|last2=HUbler|first2=A.|title=Medium-Term Prediction of Chaos|journal=Phys.

But if |''a''| < 1 all points on the number line map asymptotically (or directly in the case of 0) to 0; 0 is the attractor, and the entire number line is the basin of attraction.\n\nLikewise, a linear [[matrix difference equation]] in a dynamic [[coordinate vector|vector]] ''X'', of the homogeneous form <math>X_t=AX_{t-1}</math> in terms of [[square matrix]] ''A'' will have all elements of the dynamic vector diverge to infinity if the largest [[eigenvalue]] of ''A'' is greater than 1 in absolute value; there is no attractor and no basin of attraction. But if the largest eigenvalue is less than 1 in magnitude, all initial vectors will asymptotically converge to the zero vector, which is the attractor; the entire ''n''-dimensional space of potential initial vectors is the basin of attraction.\n\nSimilar features apply to linear [[differential equation]]s. The scalar equation <math> dx/dt =ax</math> causes all initial values of ''x'' except zero to diverge to infinity if ''a'' > 0 but to converge to an attractor at the value 0 if ''a'' < 0, making the entire number line the basin of attraction for 0. And the matrix system <math>dX/dt=AX</math> gives divergence from all initial points except the vector of zeroes if any eigenvalue of the matrix ''A'' is positive; but if all the eigenvalues are negative the vector of zeroes is an attractor whose basin of attraction is the entire phase space.\n\n===Nonlinear equation or system===\n\nEquations or systems that are [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] can give rise to a richer variety of behavior than can linear systems. One example is [[Newton's method]] of iterating to a root of a nonlinear expression. If the expression has more than one [[real number|real]] root, some starting points for the iterative algorithm will lead to one of the roots asymptotically, and other starting points will lead to another. The basins of attraction for the expression's roots are generally not simple&mdash;it is not simply that the points nearest one root all map there, giving a basin of attraction consisting of nearby points. The basins of attraction can be infinite in number and arbitrarily small. For example,<ref>Dence, Thomas, \"Cubics, chaos and Newton's method\", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 81, November 1997, 403\u2013408.</ref> for the function <math>f(x)=x^3-2x^2-11x+12</math>, the following initial conditions are in successive basins of attraction:\n\n[[File:newtroot 1 0 0 0 0 m1.png|thumb|Basins of attraction in the complex plane for using Newton's method to solve ''x''<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.

Each root has a basin of attraction in the [[complex plane]]; these basins can be mapped as in the image shown. As can be seen, the combined basin of attraction for a particular root can have many disconnected regions. For many complex functions, the boundaries of the basins of attraction are [[fractal]]s.\n\n== Partial differential equations ==\n[[Parabolic partial differential equation]]s may have finite-dimensional attractors.  The diffusive part of the equation damps higher frequencies and in some cases leads to a global attractor. The ''Ginzburg\u2013Landau'', the ''Kuramoto\u2013Sivashinsky'', and the two-dimensional, forced [[Navier\u2013Stokes equation]]s are all known to have global attractors of finite dimension.\n\nFor the three-dimensional, incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equation with periodic [[boundary condition]]s, if it has a global attractor, then this attractor will be of finite dimensions.<ref>[[Genevi\u00e8ve Raugel]], Global Attractors in Partial Differential Equations,\u00a0''Handbook of Dynamical Systems'', Elsevier, 2002, pp.\u00a0885\u2013982.</ref>\n\n== Numerical localization (visualization) of attractors: self-excited and hidden attractors ==\n[[File:Chua-chaotic-hidden-attractor.jpg|thumb|\nChaotic [[hidden attractor]] (green domain) in [[Chua's circuit|Chua's system]].\nTrajectories with initial data in a neighborhood of two saddle points (blue) tend (red arrow) to infinity or tend (black arrow) to stable zero equilibrium point (orange).\n]]\n\nFrom a computational point of view, attractors can be naturally regarded as ''self-excited attractors'' or\n''[[hidden attractor]]s''.<ref name=\"2011-PLA-Hidden-Chua-attractor\">{{cite journal |author1=Leonov G.A. |author2=Vagaitsev V.I. |author3=Kuznetsov N.V. |\nyear = 2011 |\ntitle = Localization of hidden Chua's attractors |\njournal = Physics Letters A |\nvolume = 375 |\nissue = 23 |\npages = 2230\u20132233 |\nurl = http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/nk/PDF/2011-PhysLetA-Hidden-Attractor-Chua.pdf |\ndoi = 10.1016/j.physleta.2011.04.037}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Bragin V.O. |author2=Vagaitsev V.I. |author3=Kuznetsov N.V. |author4=Leonov G.A. | year = 2011\n | title = Algorithms for Finding Hidden Oscillations in Nonlinear Systems.

System values that get close enough to the attractor values remain close even if slightly disturbed.\n\nIn finite-dimensional systems, the evolving variable may be represented [[algebra]]ically as an ''n''-dimensional [[Coordinate vector|vector]]. The attractor is a region in [[space (mathematics)|''n''-dimensional space]]. In [[Physics|physical systems]], the ''n'' dimensions may be, for example, two or three positional coordinates for each of one or more physical entities; in [[Economics|economic systems]], they may be separate variables such as the [[inflation rate]] and the [[unemployment rate]].\n\nIf the evolving variable is two- or three-dimensional, the attractor of the dynamic process can be represented [[Geometry|geometrically]] in two or three dimensions, (as for example in the three-dimensional case depicted to the right). An attractor can be a [[point (geometry)|point]], a finite set of points, a [[curve]], a [[manifold]], or even a complicated set with a [[fractal]] structure known as a ''strange attractor'' (see [[Attractor#Strange attractor|strange attractor]] below). If the variable is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], the attractor is a subset of the real number line. Describing the attractors of chaotic dynamical systems has been one of the achievements of [[chaos theory]].\n\nA [[trajectory]] of the dynamical system in the attractor does not have to satisfy any special constraints except for remaining on the attractor, forward in time.  The trajectory may be [[Periodic function|periodic]] or [[Chaos theory|chaotic]]. If a set of points is periodic or chaotic, but the flow in the neighborhood is away from the set, the set is not an attractor, but instead is called a '''repeller''' (or ''repellor'').\n\n== Motivation of attractors ==\nA [[dynamical system]] is generally described by one or more [[differential equations|differential]] or [[difference equations]]. The equations of a given dynamical system specify its behavior over any given short period of time.  To determine the system's behavior for a longer period, it is often necessary to [[Integral|integrate]] the equations, either through analytical means or through [[iteration]], often with the aid of computers.\n\nDynamical systems in the physical world tend to arise from [[dissipative system|dissipative]] systems: if it were not for some driving force, the motion would cease.  (Dissipation may come from [[friction|internal friction]], [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic losses]], or loss of material, among many causes.)  The dissipation and the driving force tend to balance,  killing off initial transients and settle the system into its typical behavior. The subset of the [[phase space]] of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the '''attractor''', also known as the attracting section or attractee.\n\nInvariant sets and [[limit set]]s are similar to the attractor concept. An ''invariant set'' is a set that evolves to itself under the dynamics. Attractors may contain invariant sets. A ''limit set'' is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set (i.e. to each point of the set) as time goes to infinity.  Attractors are limit sets, but not all limit sets are attractors: It is possible to have some points of a system converge to a limit set, but different points when perturbed slightly off the limit set may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the limit set.\n\nFor example, the [[damping ratio|damped]] [[pendulum]] has two invariant points: the point {{math|x<sub>0</sub>}} of minimum height and the point {{math|x<sub>1</sub>}} of maximum height.  The point {{math|x<sub>0</sub>}} is also a limit set, as trajectories converge to it; the point {{math|x<sub>1</sub>}} is not a limit set.  Because of the dissipation due to air resistance, the point {{math|x<sub>0</sub>}} is also an attractor.  If there was no dissipation, {{math|x<sub>0</sub>}} would not be an attractor. Aristotle believed that objects moved only as long as they were pushed, which is an early formulation of a dissipative attractor.\n\nExponential [[chaos theory|divergence of trajectories]] complicates detailed predictions, but the world is knowable due to the existence of robust attractors.\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\nLet ''t'' represent time and let ''f''(''t'', \u2022) be a function which specifies the dynamics of the system.  That is, if ''a'' is a point in an ''n''-dimensional phase space, representing the initial state of the system, then ''f''(0, ''a'') = ''a'' and, for a positive value of ''t'', ''f''(''t'', ''a'') is the result of the evolution of this state after ''t'' units of time.  For example, if the system describes the evolution of a free particle in one dimension then the phase space is the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup> with coordinates (''x'',''v''), where ''x'' is the position of the particle, ''v'' is its velocity, ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x'',''v''), and the evolution is given by\n\n[[File:Julia immediate basin 1 3.png|right|thumb|Attracting period-3 cycle and its immediate basin of attraction for a certain parametrization of ''f''(''z'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''c''. The three darkest points are the points of the 3-cycle, which lead to each other in sequence, and iteration from any point in the basin of attraction leads to (usually asymptotic) convergence to this sequence of three points.]]\n\n: <math> f(t,(x,v))=(x+tv,v).\\ </math>\n\nAn '''attractor''' is a [[subset]] ''A'' of the [[phase space]] characterized by the following three conditions:\n* ''A'' is ''forward invariant'' under ''f'': if ''a'' is an element of ''A'' then so is ''f''(''t'',''a''), for all&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.\n* There exists a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of ''A'', called the '''basin of attraction''' for ''A'' and denoted ''B''(''A''), which consists of all points ''b'' that \"enter ''A'' in the limit ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e\". More formally, ''B''(''A'') is the set of all points ''b'' in the phase space with the following property:\n:: For any open neighborhood ''N'' of ''A'', there is a positive constant ''T'' such that ''f''(''t'',''b'') \u2208 ''N'' for all real ''t'' > ''T''.\n* There is no proper (non-empty) subset of ''A'' having the first two properties.\n\nSince the basin of attraction contains an [[open set]] containing ''A'', every point that is sufficiently close to ''A'' is attracted to ''A''.  The definition of an attractor uses a [[metric space|metric]] on the phase space, but the resulting notion usually depends only on the topology of the phase space. In the case of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, the Euclidean norm is typically used.\n\nMany other definitions of attractor occur in the literature.  For example, some authors require that an attractor have positive [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] (preventing a point from being an attractor), others relax the requirement that ''B''(''A'') be a neighborhood. <ref>Milnor, J. (1985). \"On the Concept of Attractor.\" Comm. Math. Phys 99: 177\u2013195.\n</ref>\n\n== Types of attractors ==\nAttractors are portions or [[subset]]s of the [[Configuration space (physics)|phase space]] of a [[dynamical system]].  Until the 1960s, attractors were thought of as being [[Geometric primitive|simple geometric subsets]] of the phase space, like [[Point (geometry)|points]], [[Line (mathematics)|lines]], [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s, and simple regions of [[three-dimensional space]].  More complex attractors that cannot be categorized as simple geometric subsets, such as [[topology|topologically]] wild sets, were known of at the time but were thought to be fragile anomalies.  [[Stephen Smale]] was able to show that his [[horseshoe map]] was [[structural stability|robust]] and that its attractor had the structure of a [[Cantor set]].\n\nTwo simple attractors are a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] and the [[limit cycle]].  Attractors can take on many other geometric shapes (phase space subsets).  But when these sets (or the motions within them) cannot be easily described as simple combinations (e.g. [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]]) of [[Geometric primitive|fundamental geometric objects]] (e.g. [[Line (mathematics)|lines]], [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s, [[sphere]]s, [[toroid]]s, [[manifold]]s), then the attractor is called a ''[[attractor#Strange attractor|strange attractor]]''.\n\n=== Fixed point ===\n[[File:Critical orbit 3d.png|right|thumb|Weakly attracting fixed point for a complex number evolving according to a [[complex quadratic polynomial]]. The phase space is the horizontal complex plane; the vertical axis measures the frequency with which points in the complex plane are visited. The point in the complex plane directly below the peak frequency is the fixed point attractor.]]\nA [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of a function or transformation is a point that is mapped to itself by the function or transformation. If we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations, then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation.  The final state that a dynamical system evolves towards corresponds to an attracting fixed point of the evolution function for that system, such as the center bottom position of a [[damping ratio|damped]] [[pendulum]], the level and flat water line of sloshing water in a glass, or the bottom center of a bowl contain a rolling marble. But the fixed point(s) of a dynamic system is not necessarily an attractor of the system. For example, if the bowl containing a rolling marble was inverted and the marble was balanced on top of the bowl, the center bottom (now top) of the bowl is a fixed state, but not an attractor.  This is equivalent to the difference between [[Stability theory#Stability of fixed points|stable and unstable equilibria]]. In the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl (a hill), that point at the top of the bowl (hill) is a fixed point (equilibrium), but not an attractor (stable equilibrium).\n\nIn addition, physical dynamic systems with at least one fixed point invariably have multiple fixed points and attractors due to the reality of dynamics in the physical world, including the [[nonlinear dynamics]] of [[stiction]], [[friction]], [[surface roughness]], [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] (both [[Elastic deformation|elastic]] and [[plastic]]ity), and even [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name=\"Contact of Nominally Flat Surfaces\">{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=J. A.|author2=J. B. P. Williamson|title=Contact of Nominally Flat Surfaces|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|date=6 December 1966|volume=295|issue=1442|pages=300\u2013319|doi=10.1098/rspa.1966.0242}}</ref> In the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl, even if the bowl seems perfectly [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispherical]], and the marble's [[sphere|spherical]] shape, are both much more complex surfaces when examined under a microscope, and their [[Contact mechanics#History|shapes change]] or [[deformation (mechanics)|deform]] during contact. Any physical surface can be seen to have a rough terrain of multiple peaks, valleys, saddle points, ridges, ravines, and plains.<ref name=\"NISTIR 89-4088\">{{cite book|last=Vorberger|first=T. V.|title=Surface Finish Metrology Tutorial|year=1990|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards (NIST)|page=5|url=https://www.nist.gov/calibrations/upload/89-4088.pdf}}</ref> There are many points in this surface terrain (and the dynamic system of a similarly rough marble rolling around on this microscopic terrain) that are considered [[Critical point (mathematics)|stationary]] or fixed points, some of which are categorized as attractors.\n\n===Finite number of points===\n\nIn a [[Discrete time and continuous time|discrete-time]] system, an attractor can take the form of a finite number of points that are visited in sequence. Each of these points is called a [[periodic point]]. This is illustrated by the [[logistic map]], which depending on its specific parameter value can have an attractor consisting of 2<sup>''n''</sup> points, 3\u00d72<sup>''n''</sup> points, etc., for any value of ''n''.\n\n=== Limit cycle ===\n{{main|Limit cycle}}\nA [[limit cycle]] is a periodic orbit of a continuous dynamical system that is [[isolated point|isolated]].  Examples include the swings of a [[pendulum clock]], and the heartbeat while resting. (The limit cycle of an ideal pendulum is not an example of a limit cycle attractor because its orbits are not isolated: in the phase space of the ideal pendulum, near any point of a periodic orbit there is another point that belongs to a different periodic orbit, so the former orbit is not attracting).\n\n[[File:VanDerPolPhaseSpace.png|center|250px|thumb|<center>[[Van der Pol oscillator|Van der Pol]] [[phase portrait]]: an attracting limit cycle</center>]]\n\n=== Limit torus ===\nThere may be more than one frequency in the periodic trajectory of the system through the state of a limit cycle. For example, in physics, one frequency may dictate the rate at which a planet orbits a star while a second frequency describes the oscillations in the distance between the two bodies. If two of these frequencies form an [[irrational number|irrational fraction]] (i.e. they are [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurate]]), the trajectory is no longer closed, and the limit cycle becomes a limit [[torus]]. This kind of attractor is called an {{math|''N''<sub>''t''</sub>}} -torus if there are {{math|N<sub>t</sub>}} incommensurate frequencies. For example, here is a 2-torus:\n\n[[File:torus.png|300px]]\n\nA time series corresponding to this attractor is a [[quasiperiodic]] series: A discretely sampled sum of {{math|N<sub>t</sub>}} periodic functions (not necessarily [[sine]] waves) with incommensurate frequencies. Such a time series does not have a strict periodicity, but its [[power spectrum]] still consists only of sharp lines.\n\n=== Strange attractor ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Lorenz attractor]] -->\n[[File:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|200px|right|A plot of Lorenz's strange attractor for values&nbsp;''\u03c1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28,&nbsp;''\u03c3''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10,&nbsp;''\u03b2''&nbsp;=&nbsp;8/3]]\nAn attractor is called '''strange''' if it has a [[fractal]] structure. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are [[chaos theory|chaotic]], but [[strange nonchaotic attractor]]s also exist.  If a strange attractor is chaotic, exhibiting [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor, after any of various numbers of iterations, will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart (subject to the confines of the attractor), and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together. Thus a dynamic system with a chaotic attractor is locally unstable yet globally stable: once some sequences have entered the attractor, nearby points diverge from one another but never depart from the attractor.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Grebogi Celso, Ott Edward, Yorke James A | year = 1987 | title = Chaos, Strange Attractors, and Fractal Basin Boundaries in Nonlinear Dynamics | url = | journal = Science | volume = 238 | issue = 4827| pages = 632\u2013638 | doi = 10.1126/science.238.4827.632 }}</ref>\n\nThe term '''strange attractor''' was coined by [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] to describe the attractor resulting from a series of [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]] of a system describing fluid flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ruelle |first=David |last2=Takens |first2=Floris |date=1971 |title=On the nature of turbulence |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103857186 |journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=167\u2013192 |doi=10.1007/bf01646553}}</ref> Strange attractors are often [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] in a few directions, but some are [[homeomorphic|like]] a [[Cantor dust]], and therefore not differentiable.

The attractor for any value of the parameter ''r'' is shown on the vertical line at that ''r''.]]\n\nA particular functional form of a dynamic equation can have various types of attractor depending on the particular parameter values used in the function. An example is the well-studied [[logistic map]],  <math>x_{t+1}=rx_t(1-x_t),</math> whose basins of attraction for various values of the parameter ''r'' are shown in the diagram. At some values of the parameter the attractor is a single point, at others it is two points that are visited in turn, at others it is 2<sup>''n''</sup> points or ''k''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup> points that are visited in turn, for any value of ''n'' depending on the value of the parameter ''r'', and at other values of ''r'' an infinitude of points are visited.\n\n==Basins of attraction==\n\nAn attractor's '''basin of attraction''' is the region of the [[phase space]], over which iterations are defined, such that any point (any [[initial condition]]) in that region will eventually be iterated into the attractor. For a [[stability (mathematics)|stable]] [[linear system]], every point in the phase space is in the basin of attraction. However, in [[nonlinear system]]s, some points may map directly or [[asymptotic behavior|asymptotically]] to infinity, while other points may lie in a different basin of attraction and map asymptotically into a different attractor; other initial conditions may be in or map directly into a non-attracting point or cycle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Strelioff|first1=C.|last2=HUbler|first2=A.|title=Medium-Term Prediction of Chaos|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2006|volume=96|issue=4|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.044101|pmid=16486826|page=044101}}</ref>\n\n===Linear equation or system===\n\nA single-variable (univariate) linear [[difference equation]] of the [[homogeneous equation|homogeneous form]] <math>x_t=ax_{t-1}</math> diverges to infinity if |''a''| > 1 from all initial points except 0; there is no attractor and therefore no basin of attraction. But if |''a''| < 1 all points on the number line map asymptotically (or directly in the case of 0) to 0; 0 is the attractor, and the entire number line is the basin of attraction.\n\nLikewise, a linear [[matrix difference equation]] in a dynamic [[coordinate vector|vector]] ''X'', of the homogeneous form <math>X_t=AX_{t-1}</math> in terms of [[square matrix]] ''A'' will have all elements of the dynamic vector diverge to infinity if the largest [[eigenvalue]] of ''A'' is greater than 1 in absolute value; there is no attractor and no basin of attraction. But if the largest eigenvalue is less than 1 in magnitude, all initial vectors will asymptotically converge to the zero vector, which is the attractor; the entire ''n''-dimensional space of potential initial vectors is the basin of attraction.\n\nSimilar features apply to linear [[differential equation]]s. The scalar equation <math> dx/dt =ax</math> causes all initial values of ''x'' except zero to diverge to infinity if ''a'' > 0 but to converge to an attractor at the value 0 if ''a'' < 0, making the entire number line the basin of attraction for 0. And the matrix system <math>dX/dt=AX</math> gives divergence from all initial points except the vector of zeroes if any eigenvalue of the matrix ''A'' is positive; but if all the eigenvalues are negative the vector of zeroes is an attractor whose basin of attraction is the entire phase space.\n\n===Nonlinear equation or system===\n\nEquations or systems that are [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] can give rise to a richer variety of behavior than can linear systems. One example is [[Newton's method]] of iterating to a root of a nonlinear expression. If the expression has more than one [[real number|real]] root, some starting points for the iterative algorithm will lead to one of the roots asymptotically, and other starting points will lead to another. The basins of attraction for the expression's roots are generally not simple&mdash;it is not simply that the points nearest one root all map there, giving a basin of attraction consisting of nearby points. The basins of attraction can be infinite in number and arbitrarily small. For example,<ref>Dence, Thomas, \"Cubics, chaos and Newton's method\", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 81, November 1997, 403\u2013408.</ref> for the function <math>f(x)=x^3-2x^2-11x+12</math>, the following initial conditions are in successive basins of attraction:\n\n[[File:newtroot 1 0 0 0 0 m1.png|thumb|Basins of attraction in the complex plane for using Newton's method to solve ''x''<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.

Each root has a basin of attraction in the [[complex plane]]; these basins can be mapped as in the image shown. As can be seen, the combined basin of attraction for a particular root can have many disconnected regions. For many complex functions, the boundaries of the basins of attraction are [[fractal]]s.\n\n== Partial differential equations ==\n[[Parabolic partial differential equation]]s may have finite-dimensional attractors.  The diffusive part of the equation damps higher frequencies and in some cases leads to a global attractor. The ''Ginzburg\u2013Landau'', the ''Kuramoto\u2013Sivashinsky'', and the two-dimensional, forced [[Navier\u2013Stokes equation]]s are all known to have global attractors of finite dimension.\n\nFor the three-dimensional, incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equation with periodic [[boundary condition]]s, if it has a global attractor, then this attractor will be of finite dimensions.<ref>[[Genevi\u00e8ve Raugel]], Global Attractors in Partial Differential Equations,\u00a0''Handbook of Dynamical Systems'', Elsevier, 2002, pp.\u00a0885\u2013982.</ref>\n\n== Numerical localization (visualization) of attractors: self-excited and hidden attractors ==\n[[File:Chua-chaotic-hidden-attractor.jpg|thumb|\nChaotic [[hidden attractor]] (green domain) in [[Chua's circuit|Chua's system]].\nTrajectories with initial data in a neighborhood of two saddle points (blue) tend (red arrow) to infinity or tend (black arrow) to stable zero equilibrium point (orange).\n]]\n\nFrom a computational point of view, attractors can be naturally regarded as ''self-excited attractors'' or\n''[[hidden attractor]]s''.<ref name=\"2011-PLA-Hidden-Chua-attractor\">{{cite journal |author1=Leonov G.A. |author2=Vagaitsev V.I. |author3=Kuznetsov N.V. |\nyear = 2011 |\ntitle = Localization of hidden Chua's attractors |\njournal = Physics Letters A |\nvolume = 375 |\nissue = 23 |\npages = 2230\u20132233 |\nurl = http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/nk/PDF/2011-PhysLetA-Hidden-Attractor-Chua.pdf |\ndoi = 10.1016/j.physleta.2011.04.037}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Bragin V.O. |author2=Vagaitsev V.I. |author3=Kuznetsov N.V. |author4=Leonov G.A. | year = 2011\n | title = Algorithms for Finding Hidden Oscillations in Nonlinear Systems.

Designed by [[McDonnell Douglas]] (now part of [[Boeing]]) and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] (now part of [[Northrop Grumman]]), the F/A-18 was derived from the latter's [[YF-17]] in the 1970s for use by the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations, and since 1986, by the U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the [[Blue Angels]].\n\nThe F/A-18 was designed to be a highly versatile aircraft due to its avionics, cockpit displays, and excellent aerodynamic characteristics, with the ability to carry a wide variety of weapons. The aircraft can perform [[escort fighter|fighter escort]], fleet [[air defense]], [[suppression of enemy air defenses]], [[air interdiction]], [[close air support]], and [[aerial reconnaissance]]. Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset, though it has been criticized for its lack of range and payload compared to its earlier contemporaries, such as the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] in the fighter and [[strike fighter]] role, and the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]] in the attack role.\n\nThe Hornet first saw combat action during the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya]] and subsequently participated in the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and 2003 [[Iraq War]]. The F/A-18 Hornet served as the baseline for the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], its larger, evolutionary redesign.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|YF-16 and YF-17 prototypes being tested by the U.S. Air Force]]\n\nThe U.S. Navy started the Naval Fighter-Attack, Experimental ([[VFAX]]) program to procure a multirole aircraft to replace the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]], the [[Vought A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair II]], and the remaining [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s, and to complement the [[F-14 Tomcat]]. Vice Admiral [[Kent Lee]], then head of [[Naval Air Systems Command]], was the lead advocate for the VFAX against strong opposition from many Navy officers, including Vice Admiral [[William D. Houser]], deputy chief of naval operations for air warfare \u2013 the highest-ranking naval aviator.<ref name=Kelly_Inside_Story>Kelly, Orr. ''Hornet: the Inside Story of the F/A-18''.

[[Grumman]] proposed a stripped F-14 designated the F-14X, while [[McDonnell Douglas]] proposed a naval variant of the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], but both were nearly as expensive as the F-14.<ref name=Jenkins_p19>Jenkins 2000, pp. 19\u201321.</ref>  That summer, [[Secretary of Defense]] [[James R. Schlesinger]] ordered the Navy to evaluate the competitors in the Air Force's [[Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF) program, the [[General Dynamics]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|YF-16]] and [[Northrop YF-17]].<ref name=Navy_History_Hornet>[http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/fa18.htm \"F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18 Super Hornet.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217024406/http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/fa18.htm |date=17 December 2014}} ''U.S. Navy''.

In May 1974, the House Armed Services Committee redirected $34&nbsp;million from the VFAX to a new program, the [[Navy Air Combat Fighter]] (NACF),<ref name=Navy_History_Hornet/> intended to make maximum use of the technology developed for the LWF program.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n===Redesigning the YF-17===\nThough the YF-16 won the LWF competition, the Navy was skeptical that an aircraft with one engine and narrow landing gear could be easily or economically adapted to carrier service, and refused to adopt an F-16 derivative. On 2 May 1975, the Navy announced its selection of the YF-17.<ref>Donald, David ed. \"Boeing F/A-18 Hornet\". ''Warplanes of the Fleet''. London: AIRtime, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-880588-81-9}}.</ref> Since the LWF did not share the design requirements of the VFAX, the Navy asked McDonnell Douglas and Northrop to develop a new aircraft from the design and principles of the YF-17. On 1 March 1977, Secretary of the Navy W. Graham Claytor announced that the F-18 would be named \"Hornet\".<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n[[File:Northrop YF-17 Cobra - in flight.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Northrop YF-17 Cobra]] was developed into the carrier-capable F/A-18.]]\nNorthrop had partnered with McDonnell Douglas as a secondary contractor on NACF to capitalize on the latter's experience in building carrier aircraft, including the widely used F-4 Phantom II. On the F-18, the two companies agreed to evenly split component manufacturing, with McDonnell Douglas conducting final assembly. McDonnell Douglas would build the wings, [[stabilator]]s, and forward fuselage; while Northrop would build the center and aft fuselage and vertical stabilizers. McDonnell Douglas was the prime contractor for the naval versions, and Northrop would be the prime contractor for the F-18L land-based version which Northrop hoped to sell on the export market.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/><ref name=Navy_History_Hornet/>\n\nThe F-18, initially known as McDonnell Douglas Model 267, was drastically modified from the YF-17. For carrier operations, the airframe, undercarriage, and [[tailhook]] were strengthened, folding wings and catapult attachments were added, and the landing gear was widened.<ref name=Jenkins_p22>Jenkins 2000, pp. 22\u201326.</ref> To meet Navy range and reserves requirements, McDonnell increased fuel capacity by {{convert|4460|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, by enlarging the dorsal spine and adding a 96-gallon fuel tank to each wing. A \"snag\" was added to the wing's [[leading edge]] and stabilators to prevent an [[aeroelastic flutter]] discovered in the F-15 stabilator. The wings and stabilators were enlarged, the aft fuselage widened by {{convert|4|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, and the engines canted outward at the front. These changes added {{convert|10000|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} to the gross weight, bringing it to {{convert|37000|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. The YF-17's control system was replaced with a fully digital [[fly-by-wire]] system with quadruple redundancy, the first to be installed in a production fighter.<ref name=Jenkins_p22/>\n\n[[File:First YF-18A Hornet on display in 1978.JPG|thumb|The first preproduction F-18A on display in October 1978]]\nOriginally, plans were to acquire a total of 780 aircraft of three variants: the single-seat F-18A fighter and A-18A attack aircraft, differing only in avionics, and the dual-seat TF-18A, which retained full mission capability of the F-18 with a reduced fuel load.<ref name=FedAmSci/> Following improvements in avionics and multifunction displays, and a redesign of external stores stations, the A-18A and F-18A were able to be combined into one aircraft.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/> Starting in 1980, the aircraft began to be referred to as the F/A-18A, and the designation was officially announced on 1 April 1984. The TF-18A was redesignated F/A-18B.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n===Northrop's F-18L===\nNorthrop developed the F-18L as a potential export aircraft. Since it was not strengthened for carrier service, it was expected to be lighter and better performing, and a strong competitor to the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] then being offered to American allies. The F-18L's normal [[gross weight]] was lighter than the F/A-18A by {{convert|7700|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, via lighter landing gear, lack of wing folding mechanism, reduced part thickness in areas, and lower fuel-carrying capacity. Though the aircraft retained a lightened tailhook, the most obvious external difference was removed \"snags\" on the leading edge of the wings and stabilators. It still retained 71% commonality with the F/A-18 by parts weight, and 90% of the high-value systems, including the avionics, radar, and [[electronic countermeasure]] suite, though alternatives were offered. Unlike the F/A-18, the F-18L carried no fuel in its wings and lacked weapons stations on the intakes. It had three underwing pylons on each side, instead.<ref name=Jenkins_p26>Jenkins 2000, pp. 26\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe F/A-18L version followed to coincide with the US Navy's F/A-18A as a land-based export alternative. This was essentially an F/A-18A lightened by about {{convert|2500|to|3000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}; weight was reduced by removing the folding wing and associated actuators, implementing a simpler landing gear (single wheel nose gear and [[cantilever]] oleo main gear), and changing to a land-based tail hook. The revised F/A-18L included wing fuel tanks and fuselage stations of the F/A-18A. Its weapons capacity would increase from {{convert|13700|to|20000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, largely due to the addition of a third underwing pylon and strengthened wingtips (11 stations in total vs 9 stations of the F/A-18A). Compared to the F-18L, the outboard weapons pylons are moved closer to the wingtip missile rails. Because of the strengthened nonfolding wing, the wingtip missile rails were designed to carry either the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] or [[Skyflash]] medium-range air-to-air missiles, in addition to the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] as found on the F/A-18A. The F/A-18L was strengthened for a 9 g design load factor compared to the F/A-18A's 7.5 g factor.<ref>Northrop F/A-18L design brochure 1978.</ref>\n\nThe partnership between McDonnell Douglas and Northrop soured over competition for foreign sales for the two models. Northrop felt that McDonnell Douglas would put the F/A-18 in direct competition with the F-18L. In October 1979, Northrop filed a series of lawsuits charging that McDonnell was using Northrop technology developed for the F-18L for foreign sales of the F/A-18 in violation of their agreement, and asked for a moratorium on foreign sales of the Hornet.  McDonnell Douglas countersued, alleging Northrop illegally used F/A-18 technology in its [[Northrop F-20 Tigershark|F-20 Tigershark]]. A settlement was announced 8 April 1985 for all of the lawsuits.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-09/business/fi-28110_1_mcdonnell-douglas|title=McDonnell Settles Suit by Northrop for $50 Million|first=KATHLEEN|last=DAY|date=9 April 1985|website=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011185426/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-09/business/fi-28110_1_mcdonnell-douglas|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite newspaper |title=McDonnell, Northrop Suit The McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the Northrop Corporation yesterday announced |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/09/business/mcdonnell-northrop-suit-mcdonnell-douglas-corporation-northrop-corporation.html |date=April 9, 1985 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=4 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810132945/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/09/business/mcdonnell-northrop-suit-mcdonnell-douglas-corporation-northrop-corporation.html |archive-date=10 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/04/09/mcdonnell-douglas-northrop-settle-jet-feud/736cb2c3-466f-49e1-8c24-7b248911cf71/|title=McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Settle Jet Feud|date=9 April 1985|accessdate=10 April 2018|website=Washingtonpost.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018115242/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/04/09/mcdonnell-douglas-northrop-settle-jet-feud/736cb2c3-466f-49e1-8c24-7b248911cf71/|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book |first=Orr |last=Kelly |title=Hornet: The Inside Story of the F/A-18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdG1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT113 |year=2014 |publisher=Open Road Media |isbn=978-1-4976-4567-7 |page=113}}</ref> McDonnell Douglas paid Northrop $50&nbsp;million for \"rights to sell the F/A-18 wherever it could\".<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> Additionally, the companies agreed on McDonnell Douglas as the prime contractor with Northrop as the principal subcontractor.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/><ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/><ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> As principal subcontractor, Northrop will produce the rear section for the F/A-18 (A/B/C/D/E/F), while McDonnell Douglas will produce the rest with final assembly to be performed by McDonnell Douglas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/FA18EFSuperHornet/Pages/default.aspx|title=F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet|website=Northrop Grumman|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331182635/http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/FA18EFSuperHornet/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=31 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> At the time of the settlement, Northrop had ceased work on the F-18L.

The gaps, called the [[boundary layer]] air discharge slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of [[parasitic drag]], worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to [[bleed air]] from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme [[structural load]]s, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect.<ref name=Jenkins_p35>Jenkins 2000, p. 35.</ref> F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads. The first production F/A-18A flew on 12 April 1980. After a production run of 380 F/A-18As<ref name=Boeing_Milestones/> (including the nine assigned to flight systems development), manufacture shifted to the F/A-18C in September 1987.<ref name=FedAmSci/>\n\n===Improvements and design changes===\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. Navy faced the need to replace its aging [[A-6 Intruder]]s and A-7 Corsair IIs with no replacement in development.<ref name=Donald_p45>Donald 2004, p. 45.</ref> To answer this deficiency, the Navy commissioned development of the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. Despite its designation, it is not just an upgrade of the F/A-18 Hornet, but rather, a new, larger airframe using the design concepts of the Hornet.\n\nHornets and Super Hornets will serve complementary roles in the U.S. Navy carrier fleet until the Hornet A-D models are completely replaced by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35C Lightning II]].

It is highly maneuverable, owing to its good thrust-to-weight ratio, digital [[fly-by-wire]] control system, and [[leading-edge extension]]s, which allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. The [[trapezoidal wing]] has a 20-degree sweepback on the leading edge and a straight trailing edge. The wing has full-span, leading-edge flaps and the trailing edge has single-slotted [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] and [[aileron]]s over the entire span.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 131, 139.</ref>\n\nCanted vertical stabilizers are another distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high [[angle of attack]] ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing-edge flaps that operate as [[flaperon]]s, large full-length [[leading-edge slat]]s, and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 [[High Alpha Research Vehicle]] (HARV).

Originally the most notable differences between an Australian (A)F/A-18A/B and a US F/A-18A/B were the lack of a [[aircraft catapult|catapult attachment]], replacing the carrier [[tailhook]] with a lighter land arresting hook, and the automatic carrier landing system with an [[Instrument Landing System]]. Australian Hornets have been involved in several major upgrade programs. This program called HUG (Hornet Upgrade) has had a few evolutions over the years. The first was to give Australian Hornets F/A-18C model avionics.

Designed by [[McDonnell Douglas]] (now part of [[Boeing]]) and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] (now part of [[Northrop Grumman]]), the F/A-18 was derived from the latter's [[YF-17]] in the 1970s for use by the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations, and since 1986, by the U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the [[Blue Angels]].\n\nThe F/A-18 was designed to be a highly versatile aircraft due to its avionics, cockpit displays, and excellent aerodynamic characteristics, with the ability to carry a wide variety of weapons. The aircraft can perform [[escort fighter|fighter escort]], fleet [[air defense]], [[suppression of enemy air defenses]], [[air interdiction]], [[close air support]], and [[aerial reconnaissance]]. Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset, though it has been criticized for its lack of range and payload compared to its earlier contemporaries, such as the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] in the fighter and [[strike fighter]] role, and the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]] in the attack role.\n\nThe Hornet first saw combat action during the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya]] and subsequently participated in the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and 2003 [[Iraq War]]. The F/A-18 Hornet served as the baseline for the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], its larger, evolutionary redesign.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|YF-16 and YF-17 prototypes being tested by the U.S. Air Force]]\n\nThe U.S. Navy started the Naval Fighter-Attack, Experimental ([[VFAX]]) program to procure a multirole aircraft to replace the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]], the [[Vought A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair II]], and the remaining [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s, and to complement the [[F-14 Tomcat]]. Vice Admiral [[Kent Lee]], then head of [[Naval Air Systems Command]], was the lead advocate for the VFAX against strong opposition from many Navy officers, including Vice Admiral [[William D. Houser]], deputy chief of naval operations for air warfare \u2013 the highest-ranking naval aviator.<ref name=Kelly_Inside_Story>Kelly, Orr. ''Hornet: the Inside Story of the F/A-18''.

[[Grumman]] proposed a stripped F-14 designated the F-14X, while [[McDonnell Douglas]] proposed a naval variant of the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], but both were nearly as expensive as the F-14.<ref name=Jenkins_p19>Jenkins 2000, pp. 19\u201321.</ref>  That summer, [[Secretary of Defense]] [[James R.

London: AIRtime, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-880588-81-9}}.</ref> Since the LWF did not share the design requirements of the VFAX, the Navy asked McDonnell Douglas and Northrop to develop a new aircraft from the design and principles of the YF-17. On 1 March 1977, Secretary of the Navy W. Graham Claytor announced that the F-18 would be named \"Hornet\".<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n[[File:Northrop YF-17 Cobra - in flight.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Northrop YF-17 Cobra]] was developed into the carrier-capable F/A-18.]]\nNorthrop had partnered with McDonnell Douglas as a secondary contractor on NACF to capitalize on the latter's experience in building carrier aircraft, including the widely used F-4 Phantom II. On the F-18, the two companies agreed to evenly split component manufacturing, with McDonnell Douglas conducting final assembly. McDonnell Douglas would build the wings, [[stabilator]]s, and forward fuselage; while Northrop would build the center and aft fuselage and vertical stabilizers. McDonnell Douglas was the prime contractor for the naval versions, and Northrop would be the prime contractor for the F-18L land-based version which Northrop hoped to sell on the export market.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/><ref name=Navy_History_Hornet/>\n\nThe F-18, initially known as McDonnell Douglas Model 267, was drastically modified from the YF-17. For carrier operations, the airframe, undercarriage, and [[tailhook]] were strengthened, folding wings and catapult attachments were added, and the landing gear was widened.<ref name=Jenkins_p22>Jenkins 2000, pp. 22\u201326.</ref> To meet Navy range and reserves requirements, McDonnell increased fuel capacity by {{convert|4460|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, by enlarging the dorsal spine and adding a 96-gallon fuel tank to each wing. A \"snag\" was added to the wing's [[leading edge]] and stabilators to prevent an [[aeroelastic flutter]] discovered in the F-15 stabilator. The wings and stabilators were enlarged, the aft fuselage widened by {{convert|4|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, and the engines canted outward at the front. These changes added {{convert|10000|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} to the gross weight, bringing it to {{convert|37000|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. The YF-17's control system was replaced with a fully digital [[fly-by-wire]] system with quadruple redundancy, the first to be installed in a production fighter.<ref name=Jenkins_p22/>\n\n[[File:First YF-18A Hornet on display in 1978.JPG|thumb|The first preproduction F-18A on display in October 1978]]\nOriginally, plans were to acquire a total of 780 aircraft of three variants: the single-seat F-18A fighter and A-18A attack aircraft, differing only in avionics, and the dual-seat TF-18A, which retained full mission capability of the F-18 with a reduced fuel load.<ref name=FedAmSci/> Following improvements in avionics and multifunction displays, and a redesign of external stores stations, the A-18A and F-18A were able to be combined into one aircraft.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/> Starting in 1980, the aircraft began to be referred to as the F/A-18A, and the designation was officially announced on 1 April 1984. The TF-18A was redesignated F/A-18B.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n===Northrop's F-18L===\nNorthrop developed the F-18L as a potential export aircraft. Since it was not strengthened for carrier service, it was expected to be lighter and better performing, and a strong competitor to the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] then being offered to American allies. The F-18L's normal [[gross weight]] was lighter than the F/A-18A by {{convert|7700|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, via lighter landing gear, lack of wing folding mechanism, reduced part thickness in areas, and lower fuel-carrying capacity. Though the aircraft retained a lightened tailhook, the most obvious external difference was removed \"snags\" on the leading edge of the wings and stabilators. It still retained 71% commonality with the F/A-18 by parts weight, and 90% of the high-value systems, including the avionics, radar, and [[electronic countermeasure]] suite, though alternatives were offered. Unlike the F/A-18, the F-18L carried no fuel in its wings and lacked weapons stations on the intakes. It had three underwing pylons on each side, instead.<ref name=Jenkins_p26>Jenkins 2000, pp. 26\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe F/A-18L version followed to coincide with the US Navy's F/A-18A as a land-based export alternative. This was essentially an F/A-18A lightened by about {{convert|2500|to|3000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}; weight was reduced by removing the folding wing and associated actuators, implementing a simpler landing gear (single wheel nose gear and [[cantilever]] oleo main gear), and changing to a land-based tail hook. The revised F/A-18L included wing fuel tanks and fuselage stations of the F/A-18A. Its weapons capacity would increase from {{convert|13700|to|20000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, largely due to the addition of a third underwing pylon and strengthened wingtips (11 stations in total vs 9 stations of the F/A-18A). Compared to the F-18L, the outboard weapons pylons are moved closer to the wingtip missile rails. Because of the strengthened nonfolding wing, the wingtip missile rails were designed to carry either the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] or [[Skyflash]] medium-range air-to-air missiles, in addition to the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] as found on the F/A-18A. The F/A-18L was strengthened for a 9 g design load factor compared to the F/A-18A's 7.5 g factor.<ref>Northrop F/A-18L design brochure 1978.</ref>\n\nThe partnership between McDonnell Douglas and Northrop soured over competition for foreign sales for the two models. Northrop felt that McDonnell Douglas would put the F/A-18 in direct competition with the F-18L. In October 1979, Northrop filed a series of lawsuits charging that McDonnell was using Northrop technology developed for the F-18L for foreign sales of the F/A-18 in violation of their agreement, and asked for a moratorium on foreign sales of the Hornet.  McDonnell Douglas countersued, alleging Northrop illegally used F/A-18 technology in its [[Northrop F-20 Tigershark|F-20 Tigershark]]. A settlement was announced 8 April 1985 for all of the lawsuits.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-09/business/fi-28110_1_mcdonnell-douglas|title=McDonnell Settles Suit by Northrop for $50 Million|first=KATHLEEN|last=DAY|date=9 April 1985|website=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011185426/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-09/business/fi-28110_1_mcdonnell-douglas|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite newspaper |title=McDonnell, Northrop Suit The McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the Northrop Corporation yesterday announced |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/09/business/mcdonnell-northrop-suit-mcdonnell-douglas-corporation-northrop-corporation.html |date=April 9, 1985 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=4 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810132945/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/09/business/mcdonnell-northrop-suit-mcdonnell-douglas-corporation-northrop-corporation.html |archive-date=10 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/04/09/mcdonnell-douglas-northrop-settle-jet-feud/736cb2c3-466f-49e1-8c24-7b248911cf71/|title=McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Settle Jet Feud|date=9 April 1985|accessdate=10 April 2018|website=Washingtonpost.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018115242/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/04/09/mcdonnell-douglas-northrop-settle-jet-feud/736cb2c3-466f-49e1-8c24-7b248911cf71/|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book |first=Orr |last=Kelly |title=Hornet: The Inside Story of the F/A-18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdG1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT113 |year=2014 |publisher=Open Road Media |isbn=978-1-4976-4567-7 |page=113}}</ref> McDonnell Douglas paid Northrop $50&nbsp;million for \"rights to sell the F/A-18 wherever it could\".<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> Additionally, the companies agreed on McDonnell Douglas as the prime contractor with Northrop as the principal subcontractor.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/><ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/><ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> As principal subcontractor, Northrop will produce the rear section for the F/A-18 (A/B/C/D/E/F), while McDonnell Douglas will produce the rest with final assembly to be performed by McDonnell Douglas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/FA18EFSuperHornet/Pages/default.aspx|title=F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet|website=Northrop Grumman|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331182635/http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/FA18EFSuperHornet/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=31 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> At the time of the settlement, Northrop had ceased work on the F-18L.

The aircraft is carrying streamlined external fuel tanks and missiles under its wings, and is heading right.]]\nDuring flight testing, the snag on the leading edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the [[leading-edge extension]]s (LEX) and the fuselage was mostly filled in. The gaps, called the [[boundary layer]] air discharge slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of [[parasitic drag]], worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to [[bleed air]] from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme [[structural load]]s, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect.<ref name=Jenkins_p35>Jenkins 2000, p. 35.</ref> F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads. The first production F/A-18A flew on 12 April 1980. After a production run of 380 F/A-18As<ref name=Boeing_Milestones/> (including the nine assigned to flight systems development), manufacture shifted to the F/A-18C in September 1987.<ref name=FedAmSci/>\n\n===Improvements and design changes===\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. Navy faced the need to replace its aging [[A-6 Intruder]]s and A-7 Corsair IIs with no replacement in development.<ref name=Donald_p45>Donald 2004, p. 45.</ref> To answer this deficiency, the Navy commissioned development of the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. Despite its designation, it is not just an upgrade of the F/A-18 Hornet, but rather, a new, larger airframe using the design concepts of the Hornet.\n\nHornets and Super Hornets will serve complementary roles in the U.S. Navy carrier fleet until the Hornet A-D models are completely replaced by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35C Lightning II]].  The Marines have chosen to extend the use of certain F/A-18s up to 10,000 flight hours, due to delays in the F-35B variant.<ref>Munoz, Carlo.

It is highly maneuverable, owing to its good thrust-to-weight ratio, digital [[fly-by-wire]] control system, and [[leading-edge extension]]s, which allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. The [[trapezoidal wing]] has a 20-degree sweepback on the leading edge and a straight trailing edge. The wing has full-span, leading-edge flaps and the trailing edge has single-slotted [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] and [[aileron]]s over the entire span.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 131, 139.</ref>\n\nCanted vertical stabilizers are another distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high [[angle of attack]] ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing-edge flaps that operate as [[flaperon]]s, large full-length [[leading-edge slat]]s, and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 [[High Alpha Research Vehicle]] (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65\u201370 degrees using [[thrust vectoring]] vanes.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-002-DFRC.html \"F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) fact sheet.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421120737/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-002-DFRC.html |date=21 April 2008 }} ''NASA/Dryden Flight Research Center''.

The Super Hornet has a new, 25% larger airframe, larger rectangular air intakes, more powerful [[General Electric F414|GE F414]] engines based on F/A-18's F404, and an upgraded avionics suite. Like the Marine Corps' F/A-18D, the Navy's F/A-18F carries a [[naval flight officer]] as a second crew member in a weapon systems officer (WSO) role.  The Super Hornet is unofficially known as \"Rhino\" in operational use. This name was chosen to distinguish the newer variants from the legacy F-18A/B/C/D Hornet and avoid confusion during carrier deck operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0121b.shtml|title=Aerospaceweb.org - Ask Us - F-18E/F Rhino|website=Aerospaceweb.org|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011185621/http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0121b.shtml|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aero-pix.com/fighters/sf18page.htm|title=F/A-18 Super Hornet/Rhino|website=aero-pix.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407114521/http://www.aero-pix.com/fighters/sf18page.htm|archive-date=7 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/video/aircraft/jet-fighters/fa-18-ef-rhine-breaks-speed-of-sound/3967325319001|title=F/A-18E/F Rhino Breaks Speed of Sound|website=Military.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224232429/http://www.military.com/video/aircraft/jet-fighters/fa-18-ef-rhine-breaks-speed-of-sound/3967325319001|archive-date=24 December 2017|url-status=live|date=31 December 2014}}</ref>  The Super Hornet is also operated by Australia.\n\n===G Growler===\n{{main|Boeing EA-18G Growler}}\nThe EA-18G Growler is an electronic warfare version of the two-seat F/A-18F, which entered production in 2007.

Assembled in Australia (excluding the first two (A)F/A-18Bs) by Aero-Space Technologies of Australia (ASTA) from 1985 through to 1990, from kits produced by McDonnell Douglas with increasing local content in the later aircraft. Originally the most notable differences between an Australian (A)F/A-18A/B and a US F/A-18A/B were the lack of a [[aircraft catapult|catapult attachment]], replacing the carrier [[tailhook]] with a lighter land arresting hook, and the automatic carrier landing system with an [[Instrument Landing System]]. Australian Hornets have been involved in several major upgrade programs. This program called HUG (Hornet Upgrade) has had a few evolutions over the years. The first was to give Australian Hornets F/A-18C model avionics. The second and current upgrade program (HUG 2.2) updates the fleet's avionics even further.\n\n;[[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet|CF-18 Hornet]]\n* '''CF-18A''': Single-seat fighter/attack version for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].

When the Ice Age ended, many of these groups moved back north following the large herds of grazing animals which were, in turn, following the grasses northward in the warming climate. In the Peace River area, the two major language groups were the [[Athapaskan]] and the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]].\n\nIn 1670, following the arrival of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in [[Eastern Canada]], guns began making their way westward as trade goods and the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] speaking [[Cree]] began pushing the Athapaskan speakers [[Dunne-za]] or Beaver further west. The Beaver in turn pushed the [[Sekani]] deep into the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]] in the mid-18th century. A truce was eventually agreed to by the Cree and the Beaver and the great river they called Unchagah (the Peace River) became the boundary between their hunting territories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calverley.ca/BRIEFHISTORY.html |title=A very brief history of the peace river area |last1=Clare |first1=G |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502212553/http://www.calverley.ca/BRIEFHISTORY.html |archivedate=2011-05-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[North West Company]] pushed westward in the late 18th century in an attempt to reach the [[Pacific Ocean]], creating rivalry with the other major fur-trading company, the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n*1792: [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]] established [[Fort Fork]] on the eastern bank of Peace River just south of its confluence with the Smoky River.\n*1818, the HBC opens the first Fort St. Mary's at the forks of the Peace and the Smoky, it lasted for only one season<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geotourismcanada.com/documents/580.aspx |title=Fort St. Mary's I (Peace River, AB.) |publisher=Geotourismcanada.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref>\n*1820, the HBC built Fort St. Mary's III on the west side of the Peace River, directly across from the mouth of the [[Heart River (Alberta)|Heart River]] (in the present day Town of Peace River).

His \u201cTwelve-Foot Davis\u201d nickname stems from the 12-foot land claim during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush|Cariboo Country gold rush]] in [[British Columbia]] which netted him almost $30,000 worth of gold. He took these profits and staked it all on a trading post close to where the Town of Peace River stands today. It is for this reason that the Town of Peace River is sometimes referred to as the Land of Twelve-Foot Davis.

There is a variety of wetland habitats in the area with several being quite marshy with shallow water, soft bottoms, and abundant aquatic vegetation. Some of the lakes and sloughs are used by various waterfowls, both migrating and resident,  for nesting. The parkland also supports a host of terrestrial and aquatic animals. It is also Canada's most northerly agricultural region.\n\nThe [[Greene Valley Provincial Park]] lies just east of the town in the Northern Sunrise County and the [[Peace River Wildland Provincial Park]] is to the south on the east bank of the Peace River. These parks and the rest of the river valley, including some river islands, provide habitat for wildlife such as moose, deer, bear, coyotes, bats, reptiles, birds and numerous fish species. Maintaining natural areas in the river valley and limiting use to suitable recreational use has minimized impacts to wildlife habitat.\n\nHistorically, the town has been the subject of flooding. However, the town has developed a continuous dike system to prevent flood damage from to 1:100 year flood events and protect against ice-jam floods. As a result, the risk of flooding has been significantly reduced and no longer poses the same threat to the town.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Fog in PR valley.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Early morning fog in the Peace River valley]]\nThe Peace River area is generally characterized by a [[Humid continental climate|continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] [[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|''Dfb'']]) with low year-round precipitation. Its dry climate, which results in reduced humidity, causes the summer heat and winter cold feel less severe than in places with higher humidity.\n\nMoisture coming with Pacific Ocean air is lost over the mountain ranges as precipitation before moving into the area, while air from the Arctic flows uninterrupted into the region. Due to cold air drainage, the river valley is often completely filled with [[Stratus cloud|stratus]] and fog while outside the valley is clear. The fog usually clears in a few hours. Winds in town are channeled along the Peace River valley (towards the northeast or southwest) while winds outside the valley are quite variable. During both summer and winter, the wind patterns outside the valley are mostly from the southwest or north. The passage of a migratory low to the north of Peace River will cause southwest winds to shift around to the north.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/5-P32E.PDF|title= Airport Climatology| publisher= [[Nav Canada]] |date=September 26, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618000047/http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/5-P32E.PDF |archive-date=18 June 2004 }}</ref>\n\nWinters are often cold enough to see the formation of an ice cover on the Peace River from January to late March or early April. The ice cover is composed of juxtaposed [[frazil ice]] pans and break-away border ice pieces that consolidate in the river flow direction. This produces a very jagged surface. The formation of ice cover results in a gradual increase in river water levels in town and is monitored by both Alberta Environment and [[BC Hydro]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bchydro.com/about/our_system/generation/our_facilities/peace.html |title=Our Facilities |publisher=BC Hydro |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611224344/http://www.bchydro.com/about/our_system/generation/our_facilities/peace.html |archive-date=11 June 2011}}</ref> [[BC Hydro]] operates two hydroelectric dams on the Peace River in [[British Columbia]]: the [[W. A. C. Bennett Dam]] and [[Peace Canyon Dam]]. These dams have significant effect on the Peace River's water levels.\n\nSummer frequently features thunderstorms that are preceded with persistent winds and occasionally produce small grain-sized hail. Tornadoes and severe winds are a rarity in the Peace River area, although it is suspected that Grimshaw, a town 20 kilometres to the west, was struck by a tornado on June 30, 2003.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2003/07/02/alta_tornado030702.html|title=Experts study suspected Alberta tornado|publisher=CBC News|date=July 2, 2003}}</ref>\n\nDue to Peace River's northerly latitude, the [[summer solstice]] on June 21 brings 17 hours and 41 minutes of daylight.

image|Peace River.JPG|1250px|Peace River as seen from West Hill. The East Hill is to the left and Judah Hill to the right. [[Greene Valley Provincial Park]] is in the background.}}\nThe Town of Peace River is bounded by the [[Municipal District of Peace No. 135|M.D. of Peace No. 135]] to the west and southwest, [[Northern Sunrise County]] to the east, the [[County of Northern Lights]] to the north and [[Birch Hills County]] further south at the confluence of the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]] and [[Smoky River|Smoky]] Rivers. In recognizing the need to plan for the growth of the Town of Peace River, the M.D. of Peace No. 135, Northern Sunrise County and the County of Northern Lights participated in the Peace River Inter-Municipal Development Plan (IDP) in July 1999. Through the adoption of the Peace River IDP, the four municipalities confirmed their commitment to cooperate and work together for the purpose of realizing the opportunities associated with the future growth of the Peace River area. The IDP addresses the future land use planning of the Peace River area, as well as other matters related to the physical, social and economic development of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.net/images/stories/downloads/bylaws/Intermunicipal%20Development%20Plan.pdf |title=Intermunicipal Development Plan - Bylaw No. 1673 |publisher=Town of Peace River |date=July 1999 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The four municipalities are in the process of updating the IDP.

The joint development planning was a partnership agreement to share the costs of servicing the lands and then jointly collecting taxes instead of the town annexing these lands.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mdpeace.com/inter-municipal-cooperation-agreement/ |title= Inter Municipal Cooperation Agreement| publisher= M.D. of Peace |date=July 29, 2010}}</ref> This was in response to the town's growing need for commercial and industrial land, and also part of its long term plan to have industrial establishments on the scenic banks of the Peace River cede the riverfront to future residential development while gradually relocating to industrial parks now to be located away from the river bank.\n\nWith a land area of {{convert|24.87|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the [[population density]] in the Town of Peace River averages {{convert|253.9|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}<ref name=statcan2006>{{cite web| url= http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=4819038&Geo2=PR&Code2=48&Data=Count&SearchText=Peace%20River&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&GeoLevel=&GeoCode=4819038 | title= Canada 2006 Census: Peace River - Community Profile | author= Statistics Canada| authorlink= Statistics Canada| accessdate= 2007-06-12| date= 2007-03-13 }}</ref>  compared to Grimshaw's {{convert|352.1|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}} and Manning's {{convert|436.1|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. The lower population density of Town of Peace River relative to surrounding communities is attributable, in part to the rugged terrain in the river valley. The town's 2010 Municipal Development Plan indicates that {{convert|14.50|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the land base or 58.3% of the town's total land area is developable and {{convert|8.36|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} has actually been developed. The density based on developed land is {{convert|755.38|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. The existing land base just meets the 30 year requirement of residential development based on the 2006 Peace River Growth study that projected  the population growing to 28,200 citizens. If future residential development occurs at higher than current densities and in more land-efficient manner, the town's existing residential land supply should last even longer. Citadel Park Area Structure Plan for example is on a {{convert|0.14|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} parcel of land with a projection to accommodate 1600 persons,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://peaceriver.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Bylaw-1915-Citadel-Park-ASP-Dec-10-12.pdf|title= Citadel Park Area Structure Plan|publisher= Town of Peace River|year= 2009|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140907170908/http://peaceriver.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Bylaw-1915-Citadel-Park-ASP-Dec-10-12.pdf|archivedate= 2014-09-07}}</ref> for a density of {{convert|11510.80|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. Due to the topographic constraints of the valley as well as the need to protect the natural areas and agricultural lands, the town is committed to optimize the existing developable land base as indicated in the 2010 Municipal Development Plan. Not only does higher density development lead to efficient use of available land and of existing infrastructure, but it also supports public transit.\n\n==== Downtown revitalization ====\n[[File:PR Foot Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|A foot bridge connecting the Riverfront District to South End.]]\nIn 2009, the town engaged Avi Friedman, an architect and professor at McGill School of Architecture on an ambitious downtown revitalization and tourism development master plan. It can be found at the town's website. The highlights of his design recommendations were:\n*Redevelopment of the Riverfront District to include a marina, an upgraded Riverfront Park with lights and paving as well as high density residential development.\n*Opening the south end of Main Street to the Heart River with a ramp up the earthen [[Dyke (construction)|dyke]] and landscaping as well as the addition of an open air public art gallery to act as a counterpoint to the traffic circle on the north end of it.\n*Opening up the west end of 96 Avenue to the river with terraced ramps and landscaping. A commercial/light industrial entity currently occupies parcel of land at the west end of 96 Ave.\n*Creation of a heritage and welcoming park north of 100 Street between 94 Avenue and 96 Avenue adjacent to the Tourist Information Centre run by the Peace River & District Chamber of Commerce. Currently Linc Park occupies a small portion of these lands and is connected to Pat's Creek Trail and Friendship Trail.\n*Densification of Main Street and the downtown in general with a minimum of 3 storey buildings as well as aesthetic additions to Main Street like large-scale awnings and street furniture.\n*Upgrading the Twelve Foot Davis (baseball) Ball Park into a festival square equipped with better sitting and a stage. The baseball diamond currently hosts PeaceFest and Peace River Pow Wow. Peace River Aboriginal Inter-agency Committee made a formal request in June 2008 to erect a dance arbour for hosting traditional Aboriginal events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prrecordgazette.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&e=1873044|title=Council says \"not now\" to arbour request|publisher=Peace River Record Gazette|date=June 3, 2008|access-date=October 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722140429/http://www.prrecordgazette.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&e=1873044|archive-date=July 22, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Neighbourhoods ====\n[[File:PR South End.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An apartment building in the South End of Peace River with Grouard Hill serving as a backdrop..]]\nThe Town of Peace River has various distinct neighbourhoods separated by geographic features of the area. The Downtown core is the civic business, administrative, social services and cultural centre of the town. It is split vaguely into three districts - the Commercial District, a Mixed Commercial/Residential District, and a Riverfront District.\n\nThe Commercial District is centred on the intersection of Main Street (100 Street), which forms part of [[Alberta Highway 744|Highway 744]], and 100 Avenue. It spans from a block on either side of Main Street and along 100 Avenue. The Commercial District consists mostly of government, professional and commercial offices, financial institution, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, retail stores and hotels.\n\nThe Riverfront District borders the Peace River and River Road between 94 Avenue to the north and 102 Avenue to the south adjacent to the Heart River bridge. It is home to restaurants, an enclosed shopping mall, an arts performance hall, a mini-golf facility, hotels, a museum, a convention centre, apartments, parks, trails and a boat launch.\n\nThe Mixed Commercial/Residential District makes the rest of the Downtown and consists of a mixture of low density and high density housing, government offices, professional and commercial offices, recreational facilities, hotels, bars, retail stores and restaurants.\n\nOutside of Downtown core, the South End is the oldest neighbourhood in the town.  It is located immediately south of the Downtown core, across the Heart River bridge, and west of Judah Hill. It is developed in a long and somewhat linear form parallel to the Peace River. The South End consists of mostly older single detached homes, a relatively small number of duplexes and apartments and various seniors' residences including a large seniors' apartment lodge immediately across the Heart River bridge on 103 Avenue, which is managed by the North Peace Housing Foundation. The South End stretches a far as 118 Avenue block after which the bank slopes become too unstable and has resulted in slides in past.\n\nThe North End is located north of the Highway 2 and west of Kauffman Hill, and is also developed in a linear form parallel to the Peace River. The North End is actually two neighbourhoods: Springfield and Norglen, which are seamlessly connected. The town's schools and most of its recreational facilities are located in the North End. In addition to single detached housing, the North End consists of the majority of the town's high density housing. The North End has a boat launch. Bewley Island, a sizable Crown owned island on the Peace River is also located on the North End of town.\n\n[[File:Peace River neighbourhoods.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Peace River neighbourhoods: South End on the front left while Upper West Peace is at the foot of Misery mountain. Lower West Peace almost at river level.]]\n\nWest Peace lies southeast of the old Highway 2 alignment on the west shore of the Peace River. It includes two sub-neighbourhoods - Upper and Lower West Peace - that are divided by Shaftesbury Trail (Highway 684). Upper West Peace is on the west side of Highway 684 to the foot of the Misery Mountain Ski Hill. Lower West Peace is on the east side of Highway 684 and abuts Sisson Island, an 83 Acre privately owned island on the Peace River. Both Upper and Lower West Peace are predominantly developed with low density housing with some interspersed [[medium-density housing]]. Lower West Peace features a boat launch.\n\nThe Pines neighbourhood is located north of Upper and Lower West Peace, generally between the old and current Highway 2 alignments and more specifically across 100 Avenue from the Lions Camp Site. It was named for the numerous pine trees that grew in the area. The pine trees have since been chopped down after being ravaged by pine beetles. The Pines is single detached housing neighbourhood.\n\nRosedale is located to the south of Lower West Peace between Highway 684 and the Peace River. It consists of single detached housing with relatively larger lots on un-paved roads.\n\nShaftesbury Estates is further south of Rosedale separated by a short strip of undeveloped land and St. Germaine Creek along Highway 684 and abutting the Peace River. It is the town's most rapidly growing neighbourhood and consists of single detached housing.\n\nSaddleback Ridge, or Saddleback, is atop the West Hill immediately behind Misery Mountain and south of Highway 2 behind an industrial area. Rolling Hills neighbourhood is often considered to be part of Saddleback, although it is separate neighbourhood of single detached housing with some duplexes and row housing.

These highways also provide access to the rich oil and gas fields and forests.\n\nWhat was formerly the [[Northern Alberta Railway]] tracks through the town provide the only rail crossing over the Peace River in Alberta. The Canadian government built the [[Great Slave Lake Railway]] which started at Roma, a few kilometres west of the Town of Peace River on the [[Northern Alberta Railways]] and ran north to the southern shores of [[Great Slave Lake]] at [[Hay River, Northwest Territories|Hay River]], Northwest Territories.<ref name=Wonders>{{cite book|last=Wonders|first=William C.|title=Canada's Changing North|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2003|page=296|isbn=978-0-7735-2640-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHsyINzEEgEC&pg=PA296|accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref> It is Canada's most northern railroad.  The federal government's intent was to ease shipment of lead-zinc ore from the Pine Point Mines southwest of the lake.  Currently [[Canadian National Railway]] owns and operates the line.\n\n====Road network====\nThe road system in Peace River is on a [[Grid plan|grid]] where roads are numbered with avenues run east to west and streets run north to south. Postfix letter \"A\" is added to the name numbers of street that do not conform to the [[Grid plan|grid]], lying between two streets that conform. With 100 Avenue and 100 Street located in the downtown core, the avenue numbers increase southwards and street numbers decrease eastwards. Some roads still bear the historical street names assigned in the pioneering days, in addition to the modern road numbering nomenclature, especially in the downtown area.\n\n====Airport====\n{{Main|Peace River Airport}}\nThe town owns and manages a municipal airport, the Peace River Airport {{Airport codes|YPE|CYPE}} located 5 kilometre west on Highway 2. Northern Air has regular flights from it to and from Edmonton International Airport Monday through Friday. They also charter flights from Peace River Airport as well as air ambulance.  [[Peace Air]] once headquartered at the airport ceased operations in 2007.\n\nThe Peace River Airport Steering Committee has been set up to assess viability and regionalization potential the airport. The committee has representatives from the Town of Peace River, Northern Sunrise County, M.D. of Peace No. 135, County of Northern Lights and the Town of [[Grimshaw, Alberta|Grimshaw]], and is working on a business plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/csi12825|title=Rural Community Adaptation Program Approved Projects|publisher=Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development|date=September 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Public transit====\nThe town's Community Services Department managed the Peace River Transit, a small bus network operated by the Bus Company. The 2006 Census indicated that 1.4% of people in the Peace River used public transit to go to work, while 7.3% chose to walk or bike to work (the provincial averages are 9.2% and 7.1% respectively). According to the Peace River Transit Pilot Project Survey, 38% of the lower income earners used Peace River Transit.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/egovdocs/2005/aldc/157263.pdf|title=Peace River Transit Pilot Project Survey Final Report|publisher=Northern Alberta Development Council|date=October 2005}}</ref> Statistics from Community Services Department indicated that the ridership had been on a steady climb since its inception in 2005. By June 2010, the number of rides provided for that month was almost 80% of the total rides provided in the entire year of 2005. Because the transit buses were not wheelchair accessible, special taxi passes were also made available at a discounted rate to seniors, mentally/physically challenged persons, low income individuals/families and students at Northern Lakes College through the Community Services Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013_02_13_TaxiPassinformation.pdf|title=Enhanced Taxi Pass Program General Information|publisher=Town of Peace River|date=January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809224627/http://peaceriver.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013_02_13_TaxiPassinformation.pdf|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> Peace River's transit system was discontinued in early 2011, due in part to high operating costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nadc.gov.ab.ca/Docs/Sustainable-Transit.pdf|title=Developing Sustainable Transit Options For Small Communities|publisher=Northern Alberta Development Council}}</ref> However, the taxi pass program is still available to eligible individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.ca/community-services/public-transportation/|title=Town of Peace River - Public Transportation|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206115419/http://peaceriver.ca/community-services/public-transportation/|archivedate=2013-12-06}}</ref>\n\nAmong the bigger challenges facing the town (and other small towns) with respect to mass transit is the low overall population density and dispersed development that results in a pattern of travel that is less focused on the downtown and hence more difficult to serve by transit. Studies show that for every 1% increase in residential density, there is a 0.22% rise in transit ridership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vtpi.org/tranben.pdf|title=Evaluating Public Transit Benefits and Costs|publisher=Victoria Transport Policy Institute|date=19 Aug 2010}}</ref> However, destination density, such as clustered employment locations, tend to have a larger impact on transit ridership than residential density alone.\n\n=== Utilities ===\nThe Town of Peace River extracts water from [[Peace River (Canada)|the Peace River]] at the Shaftesbury Water Treatment Plant. The treatment process involves clarification, sedimentation, filtration, chlorination and fluoridation.<ref>[http://www.peaceriver.net/departments/waterandwastewatertreatmentplant ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623105757/http://www.peaceriver.net/departments/waterandwastewatertreatmentplant |date=June 23, 2012 }}</ref> The potable water is then pumped to the three reservoirs the town owns. Sanitary waste is piped to the wastewater treatment plant in the north end of town that involves secondary treatment and extended aeration. Residential garbage pickup is contracted out to Allen Bros. Trucking Ltd., a private company.\n\nThe Town of Peace River provides municipal sanitary sewer and treated potable water against a unique set of topographical and climatic conditions. There is a significant annual variation in temperature compounded by dramatic changes in elevation within town that leads to frequent leaks and breaks in water mains and sewer trunks. The dramatic changes in elevation also necessitate a large number of lift stations to pump both treated drinking water and sewage across large distances. When combined with the maintenance issues associated with the unstable soils, these factors lead to very high infrastructure costs for urban development within the valley.\n\n===Health care===\nThe Peace River area is served by the Peace River Community Health Centre, which is a site for Rural Alberta North & Rural Family Medical Training Program for University of Alberta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familymed.med.ualberta.ca/Home/index.cfm |title=Department of Family Medicine |publisher=Familymed.med.ualberta.ca |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref> Other hospitals in the area include the Grimshaw/Berwyn Community Health Complex in Grimshaw, the Manning Community Health Centre in Manning and the Sacred Heart Community Health Centre in McLennan. Peace River Mental Health Clinic in downtown Peace River provides psychiatric care for patients in the region. When very specialized care is required, patients are often transferred to Edmonton via air ambulance. Initially under Peace Country Health Services, these hospitals are now administered by [[Alberta Health Services]].\n\nDrop-in health needs are catered for at the Associate Medical Clinic in downtown Peace River. The clinic is working on plans for a new state-of-the-art medical clinic, Centre of Medical Excellence to be located adjacent to the Peace River Community Health Centre in West Hill. The over {{convert|42000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility is intended to increase both the capacity and the efficiency of medical care in the region. Conceptual plans are located at Associate Medical Clinic website.\n\nThere is a handful of pharmacies, dental offices, chiropractic clinics and optometrists in town.\n\n==Education==\nBoth public and separate schools are available within the Town of Peace River. The Peace River School Division operates eighteen public schools and two outreach campuses in the area. Peace River based schools are Springfield Elementary School, T.A. Norris Middle School, Peace River High School and Outreach Campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.net/index.php/education |accessdate=October 14, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The Holy Family Catholic Regional Division provides elementary to Grade 12 Catholic education programming Peace River schools: Good Shepherd School and Glenmary Catholic Junior/Senior High School.

When the Ice Age ended, many of these groups moved back north following the large herds of grazing animals which were, in turn, following the grasses northward in the warming climate. In the Peace River area, the two major language groups were the [[Athapaskan]] and the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]].\n\nIn 1670, following the arrival of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in [[Eastern Canada]], guns began making their way westward as trade goods and the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] speaking [[Cree]] began pushing the Athapaskan speakers [[Dunne-za]] or Beaver further west. The Beaver in turn pushed the [[Sekani]] deep into the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]] in the mid-18th century. A truce was eventually agreed to by the Cree and the Beaver and the great river they called Unchagah (the Peace River) became the boundary between their hunting territories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calverley.ca/BRIEFHISTORY.html |title=A very brief history of the peace river area |last1=Clare |first1=G |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502212553/http://www.calverley.ca/BRIEFHISTORY.html |archivedate=2011-05-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[North West Company]] pushed westward in the late 18th century in an attempt to reach the [[Pacific Ocean]], creating rivalry with the other major fur-trading company, the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n*1792: [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]] established [[Fort Fork]] on the eastern bank of Peace River just south of its confluence with the Smoky River.\n*1818, the HBC opens the first Fort St. Mary's at the forks of the Peace and the Smoky, it lasted for only one season<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geotourismcanada.com/documents/580.aspx |title=Fort St. Mary's I (Peace River, AB.) |publisher=Geotourismcanada.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref>\n*1820, the HBC built Fort St. Mary's III on the west side of the Peace River, directly across from the mouth of the [[Heart River (Alberta)|Heart River]] (in the present day Town of Peace River).

His \u201cTwelve-Foot Davis\u201d nickname stems from the 12-foot land claim during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush|Cariboo Country gold rush]] in [[British Columbia]] which netted him almost $30,000 worth of gold. He took these profits and staked it all on a trading post close to where the Town of Peace River stands today. It is for this reason that the Town of Peace River is sometimes referred to as the Land of Twelve-Foot Davis.

These parks and the rest of the river valley, including some river islands, provide habitat for wildlife such as moose, deer, bear, coyotes, bats, reptiles, birds and numerous fish species. Maintaining natural areas in the river valley and limiting use to suitable recreational use has minimized impacts to wildlife habitat.\n\nHistorically, the town has been the subject of flooding. However, the town has developed a continuous dike system to prevent flood damage from to 1:100 year flood events and protect against ice-jam floods. As a result, the risk of flooding has been significantly reduced and no longer poses the same threat to the town.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Fog in PR valley.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Early morning fog in the Peace River valley]]\nThe Peace River area is generally characterized by a [[Humid continental climate|continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] [[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|''Dfb'']]) with low year-round precipitation. Its dry climate, which results in reduced humidity, causes the summer heat and winter cold feel less severe than in places with higher humidity.\n\nMoisture coming with Pacific Ocean air is lost over the mountain ranges as precipitation before moving into the area, while air from the Arctic flows uninterrupted into the region. Due to cold air drainage, the river valley is often completely filled with [[Stratus cloud|stratus]] and fog while outside the valley is clear. The fog usually clears in a few hours. Winds in town are channeled along the Peace River valley (towards the northeast or southwest) while winds outside the valley are quite variable. During both summer and winter, the wind patterns outside the valley are mostly from the southwest or north. The passage of a migratory low to the north of Peace River will cause southwest winds to shift around to the north.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/5-P32E.PDF|title= Airport Climatology| publisher= [[Nav Canada]] |date=September 26, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618000047/http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/5-P32E.PDF |archive-date=18 June 2004 }}</ref>\n\nWinters are often cold enough to see the formation of an ice cover on the Peace River from January to late March or early April. The ice cover is composed of juxtaposed [[frazil ice]] pans and break-away border ice pieces that consolidate in the river flow direction. This produces a very jagged surface. The formation of ice cover results in a gradual increase in river water levels in town and is monitored by both Alberta Environment and [[BC Hydro]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bchydro.com/about/our_system/generation/our_facilities/peace.html |title=Our Facilities |publisher=BC Hydro |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611224344/http://www.bchydro.com/about/our_system/generation/our_facilities/peace.html |archive-date=11 June 2011}}</ref> [[BC Hydro]] operates two hydroelectric dams on the Peace River in [[British Columbia]]: the [[W. A. C. Bennett Dam]] and [[Peace Canyon Dam]]. These dams have significant effect on the Peace River's water levels.\n\nSummer frequently features thunderstorms that are preceded with persistent winds and occasionally produce small grain-sized hail. Tornadoes and severe winds are a rarity in the Peace River area, although it is suspected that Grimshaw, a town 20 kilometres to the west, was struck by a tornado on June 30, 2003.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2003/07/02/alta_tornado030702.html|title=Experts study suspected Alberta tornado|publisher=CBC News|date=July 2, 2003}}</ref>\n\nDue to Peace River's northerly latitude, the [[summer solstice]] on June 21 brings 17 hours and 41 minutes of daylight.

image|Peace River.JPG|1250px|Peace River as seen from West Hill. The East Hill is to the left and Judah Hill to the right. [[Greene Valley Provincial Park]] is in the background.}}\nThe Town of Peace River is bounded by the [[Municipal District of Peace No. 135|M.D. of Peace No. 135]] to the west and southwest, [[Northern Sunrise County]] to the east, the [[County of Northern Lights]] to the north and [[Birch Hills County]] further south at the confluence of the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]] and [[Smoky River|Smoky]] Rivers. In recognizing the need to plan for the growth of the Town of Peace River, the M.D. of Peace No. 135, Northern Sunrise County and the County of Northern Lights participated in the Peace River Inter-Municipal Development Plan (IDP) in July 1999. Through the adoption of the Peace River IDP, the four municipalities confirmed their commitment to cooperate and work together for the purpose of realizing the opportunities associated with the future growth of the Peace River area. The IDP addresses the future land use planning of the Peace River area, as well as other matters related to the physical, social and economic development of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.net/images/stories/downloads/bylaws/Intermunicipal%20Development%20Plan.pdf |title=Intermunicipal Development Plan - Bylaw No. 1673 |publisher=Town of Peace River |date=July 1999 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The four municipalities are in the process of updating the IDP.

The joint development planning was a partnership agreement to share the costs of servicing the lands and then jointly collecting taxes instead of the town annexing these lands.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mdpeace.com/inter-municipal-cooperation-agreement/ |title= Inter Municipal Cooperation Agreement| publisher= M.D. of Peace |date=July 29, 2010}}</ref> This was in response to the town's growing need for commercial and industrial land, and also part of its long term plan to have industrial establishments on the scenic banks of the Peace River cede the riverfront to future residential development while gradually relocating to industrial parks now to be located away from the river bank.\n\nWith a land area of {{convert|24.87|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the [[population density]] in the Town of Peace River averages {{convert|253.9|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}<ref name=statcan2006>{{cite web| url= http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=4819038&Geo2=PR&Code2=48&Data=Count&SearchText=Peace%20River&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&GeoLevel=&GeoCode=4819038 | title= Canada 2006 Census: Peace River - Community Profile | author= Statistics Canada| authorlink= Statistics Canada| accessdate= 2007-06-12| date= 2007-03-13 }}</ref>  compared to Grimshaw's {{convert|352.1|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}} and Manning's {{convert|436.1|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. The lower population density of Town of Peace River relative to surrounding communities is attributable, in part to the rugged terrain in the river valley. The town's 2010 Municipal Development Plan indicates that {{convert|14.50|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the land base or 58.3% of the town's total land area is developable and {{convert|8.36|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} has actually been developed. The density based on developed land is {{convert|755.38|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. The existing land base just meets the 30 year requirement of residential development based on the 2006 Peace River Growth study that projected  the population growing to 28,200 citizens. If future residential development occurs at higher than current densities and in more land-efficient manner, the town's existing residential land supply should last even longer. Citadel Park Area Structure Plan for example is on a {{convert|0.14|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} parcel of land with a projection to accommodate 1600 persons,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://peaceriver.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Bylaw-1915-Citadel-Park-ASP-Dec-10-12.pdf|title= Citadel Park Area Structure Plan|publisher= Town of Peace River|year= 2009|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140907170908/http://peaceriver.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Bylaw-1915-Citadel-Park-ASP-Dec-10-12.pdf|archivedate= 2014-09-07}}</ref> for a density of {{convert|11510.80|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. Due to the topographic constraints of the valley as well as the need to protect the natural areas and agricultural lands, the town is committed to optimize the existing developable land base as indicated in the 2010 Municipal Development Plan. Not only does higher density development lead to efficient use of available land and of existing infrastructure, but it also supports public transit.\n\n==== Downtown revitalization ====\n[[File:PR Foot Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|A foot bridge connecting the Riverfront District to South End.]]\nIn 2009, the town engaged Avi Friedman, an architect and professor at McGill School of Architecture on an ambitious downtown revitalization and tourism development master plan. It can be found at the town's website. The highlights of his design recommendations were:\n*Redevelopment of the Riverfront District to include a marina, an upgraded Riverfront Park with lights and paving as well as high density residential development.\n*Opening the south end of Main Street to the Heart River with a ramp up the earthen [[Dyke (construction)|dyke]] and landscaping as well as the addition of an open air public art gallery to act as a counterpoint to the traffic circle on the north end of it.\n*Opening up the west end of 96 Avenue to the river with terraced ramps and landscaping. A commercial/light industrial entity currently occupies parcel of land at the west end of 96 Ave.\n*Creation of a heritage and welcoming park north of 100 Street between 94 Avenue and 96 Avenue adjacent to the Tourist Information Centre run by the Peace River & District Chamber of Commerce. Currently Linc Park occupies a small portion of these lands and is connected to Pat's Creek Trail and Friendship Trail.\n*Densification of Main Street and the downtown in general with a minimum of 3 storey buildings as well as aesthetic additions to Main Street like large-scale awnings and street furniture.\n*Upgrading the Twelve Foot Davis (baseball) Ball Park into a festival square equipped with better sitting and a stage. The baseball diamond currently hosts PeaceFest and Peace River Pow Wow. Peace River Aboriginal Inter-agency Committee made a formal request in June 2008 to erect a dance arbour for hosting traditional Aboriginal events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prrecordgazette.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&e=1873044|title=Council says \"not now\" to arbour request|publisher=Peace River Record Gazette|date=June 3, 2008|access-date=October 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722140429/http://www.prrecordgazette.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&e=1873044|archive-date=July 22, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Neighbourhoods ====\n[[File:PR South End.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An apartment building in the South End of Peace River with Grouard Hill serving as a backdrop..]]\nThe Town of Peace River has various distinct neighbourhoods separated by geographic features of the area. The Downtown core is the civic business, administrative, social services and cultural centre of the town. It is split vaguely into three districts - the Commercial District, a Mixed Commercial/Residential District, and a Riverfront District.\n\nThe Commercial District is centred on the intersection of Main Street (100 Street), which forms part of [[Alberta Highway 744|Highway 744]], and 100 Avenue. It spans from a block on either side of Main Street and along 100 Avenue. The Commercial District consists mostly of government, professional and commercial offices, financial institution, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, retail stores and hotels.\n\nThe Riverfront District borders the Peace River and River Road between 94 Avenue to the north and 102 Avenue to the south adjacent to the Heart River bridge. It is home to restaurants, an enclosed shopping mall, an arts performance hall, a mini-golf facility, hotels, a museum, a convention centre, apartments, parks, trails and a boat launch.\n\nThe Mixed Commercial/Residential District makes the rest of the Downtown and consists of a mixture of low density and high density housing, government offices, professional and commercial offices, recreational facilities, hotels, bars, retail stores and restaurants.\n\nOutside of Downtown core, the South End is the oldest neighbourhood in the town.  It is located immediately south of the Downtown core, across the Heart River bridge, and west of Judah Hill. It is developed in a long and somewhat linear form parallel to the Peace River. The South End consists of mostly older single detached homes, a relatively small number of duplexes and apartments and various seniors' residences including a large seniors' apartment lodge immediately across the Heart River bridge on 103 Avenue, which is managed by the North Peace Housing Foundation. The South End stretches a far as 118 Avenue block after which the bank slopes become too unstable and has resulted in slides in past.\n\nThe North End is located north of the Highway 2 and west of Kauffman Hill, and is also developed in a linear form parallel to the Peace River. The North End is actually two neighbourhoods: Springfield and Norglen, which are seamlessly connected. The town's schools and most of its recreational facilities are located in the North End. In addition to single detached housing, the North End consists of the majority of the town's high density housing. The North End has a boat launch. Bewley Island, a sizable Crown owned island on the Peace River is also located on the North End of town.\n\n[[File:Peace River neighbourhoods.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Peace River neighbourhoods: South End on the front left while Upper West Peace is at the foot of Misery mountain. Lower West Peace almost at river level.]]\n\nWest Peace lies southeast of the old Highway 2 alignment on the west shore of the Peace River. It includes two sub-neighbourhoods - Upper and Lower West Peace - that are divided by Shaftesbury Trail (Highway 684). Upper West Peace is on the west side of Highway 684 to the foot of the Misery Mountain Ski Hill. Lower West Peace is on the east side of Highway 684 and abuts Sisson Island, an 83 Acre privately owned island on the Peace River. Both Upper and Lower West Peace are predominantly developed with low density housing with some interspersed [[medium-density housing]]. Lower West Peace features a boat launch.\n\nThe Pines neighbourhood is located north of Upper and Lower West Peace, generally between the old and current Highway 2 alignments and more specifically across 100 Avenue from the Lions Camp Site. It was named for the numerous pine trees that grew in the area. The pine trees have since been chopped down after being ravaged by pine beetles. The Pines is single detached housing neighbourhood.\n\nRosedale is located to the south of Lower West Peace between Highway 684 and the Peace River. It consists of single detached housing with relatively larger lots on un-paved roads.\n\nShaftesbury Estates is further south of Rosedale separated by a short strip of undeveloped land and St. Germaine Creek along Highway 684 and abutting the Peace River. It is the town's most rapidly growing neighbourhood and consists of single detached housing.\n\nSaddleback Ridge, or Saddleback, is atop the West Hill immediately behind Misery Mountain and south of Highway 2 behind an industrial area. Rolling Hills neighbourhood is often considered to be part of Saddleback, although it is separate neighbourhood of single detached housing with some duplexes and row housing. Saddleback consists mostly of single detached housing, and after a bylaw amendment allowed medium density housing and not high density residential.\n\n[[File:Peace River Saddleback Ridge Estates.jpg|350px|thumb|left|Saddleback Ridge neighbourhood at the foot of Misery Mountain]]\nWestbrook Estates is approximately 1 kilometre south of Saddleback, west of 80 Street separated by a  stretch of undeveloped wilderness with trails through which St. Germain Creek and one of its tributaries cut while flowing to the Peace River. It is flanked by Misery Mountain to the east and Brick Hill on the west side. It consists single detached housing on acreages and lacking in town sewer and potable piped water services.\n\nWest Hill Commercial District extends from 80 Street to 73 Street on either side of Highway 2.

Alberta Triathlon Association sanctioned Tri-River Triathlon in Peace River is also competitive although recreational entrants participate too.\n \nThe Peace River's schools have done well in provincial swimming, volleyball, basketball, badminton and track and field competitions. Recently high school football has emerged as the area of strength. Peace River High School's Peace River Pioneers football team made it to the 2009 and 2010 Alberta Schools' Athletic Association (ASAA) Provincial Finals game where they lost to Brooks Buffalos, and the Cardston Cougars.  The team has won four Mighty Peace Football League (MPFL) Peace Bowls (in 2005, 2008, 2009, and 2010), and one MPFL Athabasca Bowl Championship. The team currently holds the league record for consecutive regular season wins at 26 (ongoing). In the team's nine-year existence they have had six undefeated regular seasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prsd.ab.ca/schools/ta/Pioneers/Pioneers.htm| title=Peace River Pioneers|publisher = Peace River School Division|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103180540/http://www.prsd.ab.ca/schools/ta/Pioneers/Pioneers.htm|archive-date=3 November 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe area is also filled with recreational leagues for a wide range of skills and ages. Most games or matches are held in the evenings and weekends, and include sports such as tennis, soccer, squash, volleyball, softball, curling, basketball, and ice hockey. Most are local but except ice hockey, which is both local and regional.\n\nThe Peace Country Fish & Game Association (PCFGA) owns and manages a 500-metre rifle range, with backstops at 400 metre, 300 metre, 200 metre, 150 metre and 100 metre as well a shotgun range with 2 [[clay pigeon shooting]] launchers and a small arms/pistol range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pcfga.net/about/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712003101/http://pcfga.net/about/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=Peace Country Fish & Game Association |publisher=Pcfga.net |accessdate=2015-05-22 }}</ref> The gun range has a clubhouse that was built during the 2004 Alberta Winter Games in Peace River. PCFGA hosts a variety of both competitive and recreational events throughout summer including [[International Defensive Pistol Association]] and [[Black Powder Cartridge Rifle]] Silhouette.\n\nSummer recreational activities include boating, tubing, hiking, biking, roller blading, quadding and photography. In the winter, tobogganing on the valley hills, snowmobiling, and both downhill and cross-country skiing are favourite activities at Misery Mountain, and nearby trails and parks. There is drop-in basketball at the Al Boomer Rec Centre in winter and at Peace High School in summer. At the end of the ski season, Misery Mountain plays host to Slush Cup. Here, skiers and boarders try to make their way across an icy quickly melting hill side pond.\n\n==Government==\n\n===Municipal government===\nThe town is governed by the seven member Town of Peace River Council consisting of a mayor and six councillors. The mayor is elected separately from the six town councillors, all for four-year terms.\n\nThe administrative head of the town is the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) who not only acts as the policy adviser to the council, but also directs the overall planning, budgeting, management and evaluation of the municipal operations in accordance with the Municipal Government Act, the bylaws of the municipality, and the objectives, policies and programs approved by the council.

While some provide recommendations for town council decision, others have authority to make decisions. Boards and committees providing direction and recommendations to the town council include the Community Services Board, Fire Protection Steering Committee, the Peace River Museum Board, and Off Highway Vehicle Advisory Committee. The Peace River Municipal Library Board, Peace River Airport Review Committee, and the Municipal Planning Commission on the other hand, are decision making boards and committees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.net/index.php/residents/236-committees|title=Boards and Committees|publisher=Town of Peace River|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724003354/http://peaceriver.net/index.php/residents/236-committees|archive-date=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Provincial and federal representation===\nThe Town of Peace River is part of provincial riding of [[Peace River (provincial electoral district)|Peace River]] that is represented by one [[Member of Legislative Assembly]]. In the [[2008 Alberta general election|2008 provincial elections]], the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative Party]] successfully retained the seat they have held since [[1971 Alberta general election|1971 provincial elections]] when [[Al Adair]] ran as a candidate for the party. [[Frank Oberle, Jr.|Frank Oberle Jr.]] who is the representative of the constituency is also the Solicitor General and Public Security Minister.\n\nThe town is located within the federal riding of [[Peace River (electoral district)|Peace River]], represented by one [[Member of Parliament]]. After winning the seat in the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal elections]] with [[Charlie Penson]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] has retained the seat in two elections: [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal elections]] and [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal elections]], with [[Chris Warkentin]] being the flag bearer. The expansive riding of 138,009 persons has an electoral quotient of 138,009 which is significantly higher than the provincial average of 117,513 and national average of 102,639.<ref>[[House of Commons of Canada]]</ref> For the next federal election, scheduled for October 2015, Peace River will become part of the newly created riding of [[Peace River\u2014Westlock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redecoupage-federal-redistribution.ca/content.asp?section=ab&dir=now/reports&document=index&lang=e |title=Final Report \u2013 Alberta - Redistribution Federal Electoral Districts |publisher=Redecoupage-federal-redistribution.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref>\n\n===Policing and crime===\nPolice protection in the Town of Peace River is provided by the Peace River [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] Detachment. The detachment is part of the Peace Regional RCMP Detachment that operates as an integrated detachment and provides services to Peace River, Grimshaw and the surrounding rural communities including the residents of [[Woodland Cree First Nation]] and the [[Lubicon Lake Indian Nation]]. The Peace River RCMP Detachment includes nine officers, which also includes highway patrol, collision analysis, general investigation services, police dog handling, forensic identification, and radio workshop units, providing support services to the detachment and that of the outlying detachments in Northern Alberta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.net/index.php/services/police-services|title=Police Services|publisher=Town of Peace River}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe Peace River RCMP Detachment also supports the following organizations and programs:\n*Victim Services Unit\n*Crime Stoppers\n*Auxiliary Constable Program\n*Youth Justice Committee\n*Law Enforcement Torch Run\n*Peace River Anti-Bullying Committee\n\nFor the 2006 post-censal populations of the 6,462 in the Town of Peace River and the 9 officer force, the town had the equivalent of 139 police officers per 100,000 population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-225-x/2007000/tbl/tbl09.9-eng.htm |title=Table 9.9 Police personnel in municipal police services, Alberta, 2007 |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref> By comparison, in the same year of 2007 the provincial rate was 165 police officers per capita and the national rate was 195.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-225-x/2007000/section1-eng.htm |title=Police Resources in Canada, 2007: Part I Police resources in Canada, provinces/territories and census metropolitan areas |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref> Between May 2007 and May 2008 the number of [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] crimes that were recorded by the Peace Regional RCMP Detachment was 232 while between May 2008 and May 2009 the number was 231.

These highways also provide access to the rich oil and gas fields and forests.\n\nWhat was formerly the [[Northern Alberta Railway]] tracks through the town provide the only rail crossing over the Peace River in Alberta. The Canadian government built the [[Great Slave Lake Railway]] which started at Roma, a few kilometres west of the Town of Peace River on the [[Northern Alberta Railways]] and ran north to the southern shores of [[Great Slave Lake]] at [[Hay River, Northwest Territories|Hay River]], Northwest Territories.<ref name=Wonders>{{cite book|last=Wonders|first=William C.|title=Canada's Changing North|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2003|page=296|isbn=978-0-7735-2640-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHsyINzEEgEC&pg=PA296|accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref> It is Canada's most northern railroad.  The federal government's intent was to ease shipment of lead-zinc ore from the Pine Point Mines southwest of the lake.  Currently [[Canadian National Railway]] owns and operates the line.\n\n====Road network====\nThe road system in Peace River is on a [[Grid plan|grid]] where roads are numbered with avenues run east to west and streets run north to south. Postfix letter \"A\" is added to the name numbers of street that do not conform to the [[Grid plan|grid]], lying between two streets that conform. With 100 Avenue and 100 Street located in the downtown core, the avenue numbers increase southwards and street numbers decrease eastwards. Some roads still bear the historical street names assigned in the pioneering days, in addition to the modern road numbering nomenclature, especially in the downtown area.\n\n====Airport====\n{{Main|Peace River Airport}}\nThe town owns and manages a municipal airport, the Peace River Airport {{Airport codes|YPE|CYPE}} located 5 kilometre west on Highway 2. Northern Air has regular flights from it to and from Edmonton International Airport Monday through Friday. They also charter flights from Peace River Airport as well as air ambulance.  [[Peace Air]] once headquartered at the airport ceased operations in 2007.\n\nThe Peace River Airport Steering Committee has been set up to assess viability and regionalization potential the airport. The committee has representatives from the Town of Peace River, Northern Sunrise County, M.D. of Peace No. 135, County of Northern Lights and the Town of [[Grimshaw, Alberta|Grimshaw]], and is working on a business plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/csi12825|title=Rural Community Adaptation Program Approved Projects|publisher=Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development|date=September 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Public transit====\nThe town's Community Services Department managed the Peace River Transit, a small bus network operated by the Bus Company. The 2006 Census indicated that 1.4% of people in the Peace River used public transit to go to work, while 7.3% chose to walk or bike to work (the provincial averages are 9.2% and 7.1% respectively). According to the Peace River Transit Pilot Project Survey, 38% of the lower income earners used Peace River Transit.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/egovdocs/2005/aldc/157263.pdf|title=Peace River Transit Pilot Project Survey Final Report|publisher=Northern Alberta Development Council|date=October 2005}}</ref> Statistics from Community Services Department indicated that the ridership had been on a steady climb since its inception in 2005. By June 2010, the number of rides provided for that month was almost 80% of the total rides provided in the entire year of 2005. Because the transit buses were not wheelchair accessible, special taxi passes were also made available at a discounted rate to seniors, mentally/physically challenged persons, low income individuals/families and students at Northern Lakes College through the Community Services Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013_02_13_TaxiPassinformation.pdf|title=Enhanced Taxi Pass Program General Information|publisher=Town of Peace River|date=January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809224627/http://peaceriver.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013_02_13_TaxiPassinformation.pdf|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> Peace River's transit system was discontinued in early 2011, due in part to high operating costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nadc.gov.ab.ca/Docs/Sustainable-Transit.pdf|title=Developing Sustainable Transit Options For Small Communities|publisher=Northern Alberta Development Council}}</ref> However, the taxi pass program is still available to eligible individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.ca/community-services/public-transportation/|title=Town of Peace River - Public Transportation|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206115419/http://peaceriver.ca/community-services/public-transportation/|archivedate=2013-12-06}}</ref>\n\nAmong the bigger challenges facing the town (and other small towns) with respect to mass transit is the low overall population density and dispersed development that results in a pattern of travel that is less focused on the downtown and hence more difficult to serve by transit. Studies show that for every 1% increase in residential density, there is a 0.22% rise in transit ridership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vtpi.org/tranben.pdf|title=Evaluating Public Transit Benefits and Costs|publisher=Victoria Transport Policy Institute|date=19 Aug 2010}}</ref> However, destination density, such as clustered employment locations, tend to have a larger impact on transit ridership than residential density alone.\n\n=== Utilities ===\nThe Town of Peace River extracts water from [[Peace River (Canada)|the Peace River]] at the Shaftesbury Water Treatment Plant. The treatment process involves clarification, sedimentation, filtration, chlorination and fluoridation.<ref>[http://www.peaceriver.net/departments/waterandwastewatertreatmentplant ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623105757/http://www.peaceriver.net/departments/waterandwastewatertreatmentplant |date=June 23, 2012 }}</ref> The potable water is then pumped to the three reservoirs the town owns. Sanitary waste is piped to the wastewater treatment plant in the north end of town that involves secondary treatment and extended aeration. Residential garbage pickup is contracted out to Allen Bros. Trucking Ltd., a private company.\n\nThe Town of Peace River provides municipal sanitary sewer and treated potable water against a unique set of topographical and climatic conditions. There is a significant annual variation in temperature compounded by dramatic changes in elevation within town that leads to frequent leaks and breaks in water mains and sewer trunks. The dramatic changes in elevation also necessitate a large number of lift stations to pump both treated drinking water and sewage across large distances. When combined with the maintenance issues associated with the unstable soils, these factors lead to very high infrastructure costs for urban development within the valley.\n\n===Health care===\nThe Peace River area is served by the Peace River Community Health Centre, which is a site for Rural Alberta North & Rural Family Medical Training Program for University of Alberta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familymed.med.ualberta.ca/Home/index.cfm |title=Department of Family Medicine |publisher=Familymed.med.ualberta.ca |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref> Other hospitals in the area include the Grimshaw/Berwyn Community Health Complex in Grimshaw, the Manning Community Health Centre in Manning and the Sacred Heart Community Health Centre in McLennan. Peace River Mental Health Clinic in downtown Peace River provides psychiatric care for patients in the region. When very specialized care is required, patients are often transferred to Edmonton via air ambulance. Initially under Peace Country Health Services, these hospitals are now administered by [[Alberta Health Services]].\n\nDrop-in health needs are catered for at the Associate Medical Clinic in downtown Peace River. The clinic is working on plans for a new state-of-the-art medical clinic, Centre of Medical Excellence to be located adjacent to the Peace River Community Health Centre in West Hill. The over {{convert|42000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility is intended to increase both the capacity and the efficiency of medical care in the region. Conceptual plans are located at Associate Medical Clinic website.\n\nThere is a handful of pharmacies, dental offices, chiropractic clinics and optometrists in town.\n\n==Education==\nBoth public and separate schools are available within the Town of Peace River. The Peace River School Division operates eighteen public schools and two outreach campuses in the area. Peace River based schools are Springfield Elementary School, T.A. Norris Middle School, Peace River High School and Outreach Campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peaceriver.net/index.php/education |accessdate=October 14, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The Holy Family Catholic Regional Division provides elementary to Grade 12 Catholic education programming Peace River schools: Good Shepherd School and Glenmary Catholic Junior/Senior High School.

They operate \u00c9cole des Quatre-Vents, a public school in Peace River. Peace River Adventist Junior Academy is another separate school in town.\n\nPost-secondary education is offered at [[Northern Lakes College]] Peace River Campus. The college has recently expanded the program selection to include trades training in carpentry, electrical, welding and crane and hoisting equipment operator. The Peace River Campus also hosts [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology|NAIT]] administered Boreal Research Institute, a partnership of the private sector, the education system, and the community.\n\nPeace Adult Literacy runs a volunteer adult literacy program.

Quasimodo was born with a [[Kyphosis|hunchback]] and feared by the townspeople as a sort of monster, but he finds sanctuary in an unlikely love that is fulfilled only in death. The role of Quasimodo has been played by many actors in film and stage adaptations, including [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] (1923), [[Charles Laughton]] (1939) and [[Anthony Quinn]] (1956), as well as [[Tom Hulce]] in the [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|1996 Disney animated adaptation]], and most recently [[Michael Arden]] in the 2016 stage musical adaptation. In 2010, a British researcher found evidence suggesting there was a real-life hunchbacked stone carver who worked at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] during the same period Victor Hugo was writing the novel and they may have even known each other.\n\n==In the novel==\nThe deformed Quasimodo is described as \"hideous\" and a \"creation of the devil\". He was born with a severe hunchback, and a giant wart that covers his left eye. He was born to a [[Romani people|Gypsy]] tribe, but due to his monstrous appearance he was switched during infancy with a physically normal baby girl, Agnes. After being discovered, Quasimodo is exorcised by Agnes's mother (who believed that the Gypsies ate her child) and taken to Paris, where he is found abandoned in Notre Dame (on the foundlings' bed, where orphans and unwanted children are left to public charity) on [[Octave of Easter|Quasimodo Sunday]], the First Sunday after Easter, by [[Claude Frollo]], the [[Archdeacon]] of Notre Dame, who adopts the baby, names him after the day the baby was found, and brings him up to be the [[bell-ringer]] of the Cathedral. Due to the loud ringing of the bells, Quasimodo also becomes [[deafness|deaf]] causing Frollo to teach him sign language. Although he is hated for his deformity, it is revealed that he is kind at heart. Though Quasimodo commits acts of violence in the novel, these are only undertaken when he is instructed by others.\n\n[[File:Gustave Brion - Notre-Dame de Paris 1.jpg|thumb|Esmeralda gives a drink to Quasimodo in one of [[Gustave Brion]]'s illustrations]]\nLooked upon by the general populace of [[Paris]] as a monster, he believes that Frollo is the only one who cares for him, and frequently accompanies him when the Archdeacon walks out of Notre Dame. Frollo lusts after a beautiful Gypsy girl named [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]], and enlists Quasimodo in trying to kidnap her (She is later revealed to be Agnes, the baby Quasimodo was switched with). [[Captain Phoebus|Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00e2teaupers]] arrives to stop the kidnapping and captures Quasimodo, unaware that Quasimodo was merely following Frollo's orders. The deaf judge Florian Barbedienne sentences him to an hour of flogging and another hour of humiliation on the pillory. Phoebus ties Quasimodo up and has Pierre Torterue whip him in front of a jeering crowd. When Quasimodo calls to him for help, Frollo allows Quasimodo to be tortured as punishment for failing him.  When Quasimodo calls for water, a kid throws a wet rag at him. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him and she captures his heart.\n\nEsmeralda is later entangled in an attempted murder \u2013 committed by Frollo, who had stabbed Phoebus in a jealous rage after spying on Esmeralda and Phoebus having a night of passion \u2013 and is sentenced to hang. As she is being forced to pray at the steps of Notre Dame just before being marched off to the gallows, Quasimodo, who has been watching the occasion from an upper balcony in Notre Dame, slides down with a rope, and rescues her by taking her up to the top of the cathedral, where he poignantly shouts \"Sanctuary!\" to the onlookers below.\n\nEsmeralda is terrified of Quasimodo at first, but gradually recognizes his kind heart and becomes his friend. He watches over her and protects her, and at one point saves her from Frollo when the mad priest sexually assaults her in her room.\n\nAfter an uneasy respite, a mob of Paris' Truands led by [[Clopin Trouillefou]] storms Notre Dame, and although Quasimodo tries to fend them off by throwing stones and bricks down onto the mob and even pours deadly molten lead, the mob continues attacking until Phoebus and his soldiers arrive to fight and drive off the assailants. Unbeknownst to Quasimodo, Frollo lures Esmeralda outside, where he has her arrested and hanged. When Quasimodo sees Frollo smiling cruelly at Esmeralda's execution, he turns on his master and throws him to his death from the balcony in rage.\n\nQuasimodo cries in despair, lamenting \"There is all that I ever loved!\" He then leaves Notre Dame, never to return, and heads for the [[Gibbet of Montfaucon]] beyond the city walls, passing by the Convent of the [[Filles-Dieu]], a home for 200 reformed prostitutes, and the [[leper colony]] of [[Prison Saint-Lazare|Saint-Lazare]]. After reaching the Gibbet, he lies next to Esmeralda's corpse, where it had been unceremoniously thrown after the execution. He stays at Montfaucon, and eventually dies of starvation, clutching the body of the deceased Esmeralda. Years later, an excavation group exhumes both of their skeletons, which have become intertwined. When they try to separate them, Quasimodo's bones crumble to dust.\n\n==Symbolism==\nIn the novel, he symbolically shows Esmeralda the difference between himself and the self-centered yet handsome [[Captain Phoebus]], with whom the girl has become infatuated. He places two vases in her room: one is a beautiful crystal vase, yet broken and filled with dry, withered flowers; the other a humble pot, yet filled with beautiful, fragrant flowers. Esmeralda takes the withered flowers from the crystal vase and presses them passionately on her heart.<ref>[http://www.readprint.com/chapter-5898/Victor-Hugo Chapter 46 The Hunchback of Notre Dame]</ref>\n\n==Tribute==\nA small sculpture of Quasimodo was once found on Notre Dame, on the exterior of the north transept along the Rue du Clo\u00eetre-Notre-Dame. <!-- Please do not remove this note, I was there recently & our tour guide pointed him out to us.-->\n\n==Adaptations==\nAmong the actors who have played Quasimodo over the years in each adaptation of the novel are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

He was voiced by [[Tom Hulce]] and animated by [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter]]. Unlike in the novel, Quasimodo has two eyes, with his left one only partially covered. He is not deaf, and is capable of fluent speech. He has three [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] gargoyle friends named Victor, Hugo, and Laverne.\n\nIn the beginning of the film, a gypsy mother tries to bring the hunchbacked infant into Notre Dame with her for sanctuary, but the bigoted Judge Claude Frollo chases and inadvertently kills her. Frollo attempts to drown the baby in a nearby well upon seeing his deformity, but the church's Archdeacon stops him and demands that he atone for his crime by raising the child as his son. Frollo, fearing [[God]]'s wrath, reluctantly agrees, and adopts the child in the hope that he will be useful to him one day. Frollo cruelly names the child Quasimodo, which in the film is Latin for \"half-formed.\" Over the years he raises Quasimodo with cruelty, forbidding him to leave the tower and teaching him that the world is a wicked, sinful place, and that the Parisian people will reject him due to his deformity. He also lies to Quasimodo about his mother, telling him she abandoned him as a baby and that anybody else would have drowned him had Frollo not stepped in and adopted him. Quasimodo nevertheless grows up to be a kind-hearted young man who yearns to join the outside world.\n\nQuasimodo sneaks out of the cathedral during the Festival of Fools, where he is crowned the \"King of Fools\" and meets Esmeralda, with whom he falls in love. Two of Frollo's guards ruin the moment where they throw tomatoes at him and bind him to a wheel to torment him. Then everyone joins in. Frollo refuses to help as punishment for his disobedience. Esmeralda takes pity on him and frees him after Phoebus failed to get Frollo to intervene. After Esmeralda escapes, Frollo confronts Quasimodo who apologizes and returns to the bell tower. He later befriends and helps her flee from Frollo's men in gratitude.\n\nFrollo eventually locates the Gypsies and Esmeralda's lover Captain Phoebus at the Court of Miracles. He sentences Esmeralda to death, and has Quasimodo chained up in the bell tower. Quasimodo breaks free, however, and rescues Esmeralda from execution. Phoebus breaks free from his cage and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo's tyranny. From the bell tower, Quasimodo and the gargoyles watch the citizens fighting Frollo's army. They pour molten lead onto the streets, thus preventing Frollo and his soldiers from breaking in. However, Frollo successfully manages to enter the cathedral. He tries to kill Quasimodo, who is mourning Esmeralda, believing her to be dead. The two struggle briefly until Quasimodo throws Frollo to the floor and denounces him, finally seeing him for what he is. Esmeralda awakens and Quasimodo rushes her to safety. He then fights the wrathful Frollo, who taunts him with the truth about his mother. Both fall from the balcony, but Phoebus catches Quasimodo and pulls him to safety, while Frollo falls to his death.\n\nQuasimodo is finally accepted into society by the citizens of Paris as they celebrate Frollo's death and the liberation of the city.\n\n===In the second film===\nIn Disney's 2002 direct-to-video sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'', Quasimodo (again voiced by Hulce) reappears as the protagonist. He remains a bell-ringer, still living in Notre Dame with the gargoyles. This time, he is able to move around Paris freely. He finds love in a beautiful [[circus]] performer named Madellaine (voiced by [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]), who ultimately reveals that she is aware that the gargoyles are alive. His love for Madellaine is briefly strained when he learns she was actually working on behalf of a criminal mastermind named Sarousch who plans to steal a particularly valuable bell, La Fidele, from Notre Dame. Madellaine's true feelings for Quasimodo overcome her loyalty to Sarousch, however, and she aids Quasimodo in bringing Sarousch to justice. Quasimodo forgives Madellaine and the two pledge their love to each other.\n\n===Later appearances===\n* Quasimodo also made some occasional appearances on the [[Disney Channel]] series, ''[[House of Mouse]]''. At one point, [[Jiminy Cricket]], when giving advice to the guests, consoles him by saying that some people find someone special and some people do not, poking fun at the fact that Quasimodo and Esmeralda did not fall in love at the end of the original film.\n* Quasimodo is a very rare [[meetable character]] at the [[Disney Parks and Resorts]].\n* A German musical stage show ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (musical)|Der Gl\u00f6ckner von Notre Dame]]'' (1999) derived from the Disney movie, restores some of the darker elements of the original novel lost in the film: Esmeralda dies from smoke inhalation at the end, Frollo is revealed to have once been a priest in his past (akin to the novel, where he was an archdeacon), and Frollo dies because Quasimodo throws him from the roof rather than falling by accident. \n* Quasimodo appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'' voiced by Ari Rubin. He appears as a supporting character in a world based on the film called \"La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches\" and plays out a more or less the same role as in the film.\n* In 2014 at the La Jolla Playhouse, Disney premiered a new adaptation of ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''. Like the 1999 German Adaptation, the new adaptation was based on movie but it restored some of the themes, characters, and ending of Hugo's original book. It later transferred to PaperMill Playhouse in 2015, but was denied to transfer to a theater on Broadway. The musical also establishes Quasimodo as Frollo's nephew, as his father was Frollo's brother who abandoned the church when he fell in love with a gypsy, only for Quasimodo's mother to die giving birth to him and his father dying of plague shortly after bringing his son to Frollo for protection.\n\n==In popular culture==\n===''Hotel Transylvania''===\n* Quasimodo appears in ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'', voiced by [[Jon Lovitz]]. He is the master chef at the titular hotel who puts up with [[Count Dracula]]'s changing taste buds and has a desire to make a dish out of humans. Quasimodo owns a pet rat named Esmeralda who can sniff out humans and tends to abuse one of the gargoyle waiters. When Quasimodo manages to successfully capture Jonathan, Count Dracula uses his abilities to magically freeze Quasimodo. The abused gargoyle then takes the opportunity to put Quasimodo's finger up his nose. Esmeralda later brought Quasimodo's petrified body to the party where the [[The Fly (George Langelaan)|Fly]] translates his frozen language that revealed that Jonathan is a human. Around the end of the movie, Quasimodo is still frozen as Wayne and Wanda's children are constantly licking him.\n* Although Quasimodo doesn't appear in ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'', he does appear in the video game adaptation where he has reformed.\n* Quasimodo appears in ''[[Hotel Transylvania: The Series]]'' (which takes place four years before the events of the first movie) voiced by [[Scott McCord]].\n\n===''The Muppets''===\n[[The Muppets]] have done spoofs of Quasimodo and his story:\n\n* In episode 509 of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', Mulch played the hunchback during the song \"For Me and My Goyle,\" accompanied by his gargoyle bride.\n* The ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'' episode \"The House That Muppets Built\" featured Baby Gonzo as \"Quasigonzo\".\n* In ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'', a \"Muppet Classic Theater\" sketch called \"The Hunchbear of Notre Dame\" (based on Victor Hugo's novel) featured Bobo the Bear as \"Quasibobo.\" The sketch comes to a halt where Bobo discovers that [[Andie MacDowell]] was cast as a cathedral bell for this sketch instead of a southern belle. Bobo then goes to have a word with the Muppets Tonight writers about this mix-up.\n* The Muppet Parodies 1998 Calendar shows [[Kermit the Frog]] playing Quasimodo in ''The Lunchbox of Notre Dame''. The lunchbox itself is an homage to the Muppets' parody of [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]]'s \"The Swing,\" which was first featured in The [[Miss Piggy]] Calendar 1980.\n\n===Other appearances===\n* Quasimodo appears in ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' with his vocal effects provided by [[Allen Swift]].\n* Quasimodo appears as a playable character in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam]]'' voiced by [[Nolan North]]. He is also an opponent in the story mode where he moves next door to their swamp. He plays his bells at 4:00 AM when Shrek and Fiona are trying to sleep. When he won't give up playing his bells, this results in Shrek and Fiona fighting him.\n* Quasimodo appears in an episode of ''[[The Beatles (TV series)|The Beatles]]'' cartoon series titled \"[[When I Get Home]]\", in which [[the Beatles]] meet him in Notre Dame while exploring the cathedral's interior during their visit in France.\n* Quasimodo appears as a playable character in the 1983 video game ''[[Hunchback (video game)|Hunchback]]'', which is based on Victor Hugo's novel. In this video game, he saves Esmeralda.\n* Quasimodo appears as ''The Hunchback'' in the Notre Dame level of ''[[TimeSplitters 2]]'''s story mode as a supporting character and additionally as a playable character in arcade mode.\n* Quasimodo appears in the introduction of Van Helsing's character in the 2004 ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'' movie.\n\n===Parodies===\n* The ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'' episode \"Hunchback of Hillhurst\" featured a parody of the character named Quincy Modo (performed by [[Brian Tahash]] and voiced by [[Dave Mallow]]). He was a former fullback for a college football team at the University of Notre Dame until he suffered from amnesia after hitting his head on the goal post and took up residence in Hillhurst Mansion's bell tower.\n* The ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'' episode \"The Hunchback of Nowhere\" featured a hunchback (also a parody of Quasimodo) who lives in Nowhere. In this episode, he stays temporarily in Courage's house and displays a liking of bells (used as a reference for Quasimodo ringing the bells).\n* The ''[[What's New Scooby Doo?]]'' episode \"Ready to Scare\" featured a parody of the character named Sonny Les Matines (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]), a pun on the \"''Sonnez les matines''\" line from the popular French nursery rhyme \"[[Fr\u00e8re Jacques]]\" that was used as a reference for Quasimodo ringing the bells. The reference is further alluded to when [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] calls him \"The Lunchback of Notre Dame\".\n* The TV series ''[[Casper's Scare School]]'' featured a parody of the character named Quasi, who is a hunchbacked ogre monster.\n\n==Real-life Quasimodo==\nIn August 2010, Adrian Glew, a [[Tate]] archivist, announced evidence for a real-life Quasimodo, a \"humpbacked [stone] carver\" who worked at Notre Dame during the 1820s.<ref name=\"nikkhah\">{{cite news|first=Roya|last=Nikkhah|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/artsandentertainmentbooksreview/7945634/Real-life-Quasimodo-uncovered-in-Tate-archives.html|title=Real-life Quasimodo uncovered in Tate archives|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=15 August 2010|accessdate=1 July 2018}}</ref> The evidence is contained in the memoirs of Henry Sibson, a 19th-century British sculptor who worked at Notre Dame at around the same time Hugo wrote the novel.<ref name=\"nikkhah\" /> Sibson describes a humpbacked stonemason working there: \"He was the carver under the Government sculptor whose name I forget as I had no intercourse with him, all that I know is that he was humpbacked and he did not like to mix with carvers.\"<ref name=\"nikkhah\" /> Because Victor Hugo had close links with the restoration of the cathedral, it is likely that he was aware of the unnamed \"humpbacked carver\" nicknamed \"Le Bossu\" (French for \"The Hunchback\"), who oversaw \"Monsieur Trajin\".<ref name=\"nikkhah\" /> Adrian Glew also uncovered that both the hunchback and Hugo were living in the same town of [[Saint Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]] in 1833, and in early drafts of ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', Hugo named the main character \"Jean Trajin\" (the same name as the unnamed hunchbacked carver's employee), but later changed it to \"[[Jean Valjean]]\".<ref name=\"nikkhah\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|France}}\n* {{Portal-inline|Novels}}\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Quasimodo}}\n\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre-Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional hunchbacks]]\n[[Category:Fictional deaf characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Fictional Romani people]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1831]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements]]\n[[Category:Fictional suicides]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional people from Paris]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Infobox character\n| color              = pink\n| name               = Quasimodo\n| series             = [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]\n| image              = Hunchback of Notre Dame.jpg\n| caption            = [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] as Quasimodo and [[Patsy Ruth Miller]] as [[Esm\u00e9ralda (The Hunchback of Arthritis)|Esmeralda]] in the 1923 film, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n| first              = The Hunchback Of Notre Dame\n| creator            = [[Victor Hugo]]\n| nickname           = the hunchback of Notre Dame\n| occupation         = [[Bell-ringer]] of [[Notre Dame cathedral]]\n| family             = [[Claude Frollo]] (adoptive father)\n| relatives          = [[Romani people in France|Gypsies]] (biological family)\n| religion           = [[Catholic]]\n| nationality        = [[French people|French]]\n}}\n\n'''Quasimodo''' (from [[Octave of Easter|Quasimodo Sunday]]<ref>{{Cite web |first=Douglas |last=Harper |title=quasimodo (n.) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=quasimodo |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=April 24, 2017}}</ref>) is a fictional character and the main [[protagonist]] of the novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831) by [[Victor Hugo]]. Quasimodo was born with a [[Kyphosis|hunchback]] and feared by the townspeople as a sort of monster, but he finds sanctuary in an unlikely love that is fulfilled only in death. The role of Quasimodo has been played by many actors in film and stage adaptations, including [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] (1923), [[Charles Laughton]] (1939) and [[Anthony Quinn]] (1956), as well as [[Tom Hulce]] in the [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|1996 Disney animated adaptation]], and most recently [[Michael Arden]] in the 2016 stage musical adaptation. In 2010, a British researcher found evidence suggesting there was a real-life hunchbacked stone carver who worked at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] during the same period Victor Hugo was writing the novel and they may have even known each other.\n\n==In the novel==\nThe deformed Quasimodo is described as \"hideous\" and a \"creation of the devil\". He was born with a severe hunchback, and a giant wart that covers his left eye. He was born to a [[Romani people|Gypsy]] tribe, but due to his monstrous appearance he was switched during infancy with a physically normal baby girl, Agnes. After being discovered, Quasimodo is exorcised by Agnes's mother (who believed that the Gypsies ate her child) and taken to Paris, where he is found abandoned in Notre Dame (on the foundlings' bed, where orphans and unwanted children are left to public charity) on [[Octave of Easter|Quasimodo Sunday]], the First Sunday after Easter, by [[Claude Frollo]], the [[Archdeacon]] of Notre Dame, who adopts the baby, names him after the day the baby was found, and brings him up to be the [[bell-ringer]] of the Cathedral. Due to the loud ringing of the bells, Quasimodo also becomes [[deafness|deaf]] causing Frollo to teach him sign language. Although he is hated for his deformity, it is revealed that he is kind at heart. Though Quasimodo commits acts of violence in the novel, these are only undertaken when he is instructed by others.\n\n[[File:Gustave Brion - Notre-Dame de Paris 1.jpg|thumb|Esmeralda gives a drink to Quasimodo in one of [[Gustave Brion]]'s illustrations]]\nLooked upon by the general populace of [[Paris]] as a monster, he believes that Frollo is the only one who cares for him, and frequently accompanies him when the Archdeacon walks out of Notre Dame. Frollo lusts after a beautiful Gypsy girl named [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]], and enlists Quasimodo in trying to kidnap her (She is later revealed to be Agnes, the baby Quasimodo was switched with). [[Captain Phoebus|Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00e2teaupers]] arrives to stop the kidnapping and captures Quasimodo, unaware that Quasimodo was merely following Frollo's orders. The deaf judge Florian Barbedienne sentences him to an hour of flogging and another hour of humiliation on the pillory. Phoebus ties Quasimodo up and has Pierre Torterue whip him in front of a jeering crowd. When Quasimodo calls to him for help, Frollo allows Quasimodo to be tortured as punishment for failing him.  When Quasimodo calls for water, a kid throws a wet rag at him. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him and she captures his heart.\n\nEsmeralda is later entangled in an attempted murder \u2013 committed by Frollo, who had stabbed Phoebus in a jealous rage after spying on Esmeralda and Phoebus having a night of passion \u2013 and is sentenced to hang. As she is being forced to pray at the steps of Notre Dame just before being marched off to the gallows, Quasimodo, who has been watching the occasion from an upper balcony in Notre Dame, slides down with a rope, and rescues her by taking her up to the top of the cathedral, where he poignantly shouts \"Sanctuary!\" to the onlookers below.\n\nEsmeralda is terrified of Quasimodo at first, but gradually recognizes his kind heart and becomes his friend. He watches over her and protects her, and at one point saves her from Frollo when the mad priest sexually assaults her in her room.\n\nAfter an uneasy respite, a mob of Paris' Truands led by [[Clopin Trouillefou]] storms Notre Dame, and although Quasimodo tries to fend them off by throwing stones and bricks down onto the mob and even pours deadly molten lead, the mob continues attacking until Phoebus and his soldiers arrive to fight and drive off the assailants. Unbeknownst to Quasimodo, Frollo lures Esmeralda outside, where he has her arrested and hanged. When Quasimodo sees Frollo smiling cruelly at Esmeralda's execution, he turns on his master and throws him to his death from the balcony in rage.\n\nQuasimodo cries in despair, lamenting \"There is all that I ever loved!\" He then leaves Notre Dame, never to return, and heads for the [[Gibbet of Montfaucon]] beyond the city walls, passing by the Convent of the [[Filles-Dieu]], a home for 200 reformed prostitutes, and the [[leper colony]] of [[Prison Saint-Lazare|Saint-Lazare]]. After reaching the Gibbet, he lies next to Esmeralda's corpse, where it had been unceremoniously thrown after the execution. He stays at Montfaucon, and eventually dies of starvation, clutching the body of the deceased Esmeralda.

Frollo cruelly names the child Quasimodo, which in the film is Latin for \"half-formed.\" Over the years he raises Quasimodo with cruelty, forbidding him to leave the tower and teaching him that the world is a wicked, sinful place, and that the Parisian people will reject him due to his deformity. He also lies to Quasimodo about his mother, telling him she abandoned him as a baby and that anybody else would have drowned him had Frollo not stepped in and adopted him. Quasimodo nevertheless grows up to be a kind-hearted young man who yearns to join the outside world.\n\nQuasimodo sneaks out of the cathedral during the Festival of Fools, where he is crowned the \"King of Fools\" and meets Esmeralda, with whom he falls in love. Two of Frollo's guards ruin the moment where they throw tomatoes at him and bind him to a wheel to torment him. Then everyone joins in. Frollo refuses to help as punishment for his disobedience. Esmeralda takes pity on him and frees him after Phoebus failed to get Frollo to intervene. After Esmeralda escapes, Frollo confronts Quasimodo who apologizes and returns to the bell tower. He later befriends and helps her flee from Frollo's men in gratitude.\n\nFrollo eventually locates the Gypsies and Esmeralda's lover Captain Phoebus at the Court of Miracles. He sentences Esmeralda to death, and has Quasimodo chained up in the bell tower. Quasimodo breaks free, however, and rescues Esmeralda from execution. Phoebus breaks free from his cage and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo's tyranny. From the bell tower, Quasimodo and the gargoyles watch the citizens fighting Frollo's army. They pour molten lead onto the streets, thus preventing Frollo and his soldiers from breaking in. However, Frollo successfully manages to enter the cathedral. He tries to kill Quasimodo, who is mourning Esmeralda, believing her to be dead. The two struggle briefly until Quasimodo throws Frollo to the floor and denounces him, finally seeing him for what he is. Esmeralda awakens and Quasimodo rushes her to safety. He then fights the wrathful Frollo, who taunts him with the truth about his mother. Both fall from the balcony, but Phoebus catches Quasimodo and pulls him to safety, while Frollo falls to his death.\n\nQuasimodo is finally accepted into society by the citizens of Paris as they celebrate Frollo's death and the liberation of the city.\n\n===In the second film===\nIn Disney's 2002 direct-to-video sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'', Quasimodo (again voiced by Hulce) reappears as the protagonist. He remains a bell-ringer, still living in Notre Dame with the gargoyles. This time, he is able to move around Paris freely. He finds love in a beautiful [[circus]] performer named Madellaine (voiced by [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]), who ultimately reveals that she is aware that the gargoyles are alive. His love for Madellaine is briefly strained when he learns she was actually working on behalf of a criminal mastermind named Sarousch who plans to steal a particularly valuable bell, La Fidele, from Notre Dame. Madellaine's true feelings for Quasimodo overcome her loyalty to Sarousch, however, and she aids Quasimodo in bringing Sarousch to justice. Quasimodo forgives Madellaine and the two pledge their love to each other.\n\n===Later appearances===\n* Quasimodo also made some occasional appearances on the [[Disney Channel]] series, ''[[House of Mouse]]''. At one point, [[Jiminy Cricket]], when giving advice to the guests, consoles him by saying that some people find someone special and some people do not, poking fun at the fact that Quasimodo and Esmeralda did not fall in love at the end of the original film.\n* Quasimodo is a very rare [[meetable character]] at the [[Disney Parks and Resorts]].\n* A German musical stage show ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (musical)|Der Gl\u00f6ckner von Notre Dame]]'' (1999) derived from the Disney movie, restores some of the darker elements of the original novel lost in the film: Esmeralda dies from smoke inhalation at the end, Frollo is revealed to have once been a priest in his past (akin to the novel, where he was an archdeacon), and Frollo dies because Quasimodo throws him from the roof rather than falling by accident. \n* Quasimodo appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'' voiced by Ari Rubin. He appears as a supporting character in a world based on the film called \"La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches\" and plays out a more or less the same role as in the film.\n* In 2014 at the La Jolla Playhouse, Disney premiered a new adaptation of ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''. Like the 1999 German Adaptation, the new adaptation was based on movie but it restored some of the themes, characters, and ending of Hugo's original book. It later transferred to PaperMill Playhouse in 2015, but was denied to transfer to a theater on Broadway. The musical also establishes Quasimodo as Frollo's nephew, as his father was Frollo's brother who abandoned the church when he fell in love with a gypsy, only for Quasimodo's mother to die giving birth to him and his father dying of plague shortly after bringing his son to Frollo for protection.\n\n==In popular culture==\n===''Hotel Transylvania''===\n* Quasimodo appears in ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'', voiced by [[Jon Lovitz]]. He is the master chef at the titular hotel who puts up with [[Count Dracula]]'s changing taste buds and has a desire to make a dish out of humans. Quasimodo owns a pet rat named Esmeralda who can sniff out humans and tends to abuse one of the gargoyle waiters. When Quasimodo manages to successfully capture Jonathan, Count Dracula uses his abilities to magically freeze Quasimodo. The abused gargoyle then takes the opportunity to put Quasimodo's finger up his nose. Esmeralda later brought Quasimodo's petrified body to the party where the [[The Fly (George Langelaan)|Fly]] translates his frozen language that revealed that Jonathan is a human. Around the end of the movie, Quasimodo is still frozen as Wayne and Wanda's children are constantly licking him.\n* Although Quasimodo doesn't appear in ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'', he does appear in the video game adaptation where he has reformed.\n* Quasimodo appears in ''[[Hotel Transylvania: The Series]]'' (which takes place four years before the events of the first movie) voiced by [[Scott McCord]].\n\n===''The Muppets''===\n[[The Muppets]] have done spoofs of Quasimodo and his story:\n\n* In episode 509 of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', Mulch played the hunchback during the song \"For Me and My Goyle,\" accompanied by his gargoyle bride.\n* The ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'' episode \"The House That Muppets Built\" featured Baby Gonzo as \"Quasigonzo\".\n* In ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'', a \"Muppet Classic Theater\" sketch called \"The Hunchbear of Notre Dame\" (based on Victor Hugo's novel) featured Bobo the Bear as \"Quasibobo.\" The sketch comes to a halt where Bobo discovers that [[Andie MacDowell]] was cast as a cathedral bell for this sketch instead of a southern belle. Bobo then goes to have a word with the Muppets Tonight writers about this mix-up.\n* The Muppet Parodies 1998 Calendar shows [[Kermit the Frog]] playing Quasimodo in ''The Lunchbox of Notre Dame''. The lunchbox itself is an homage to the Muppets' parody of [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]]'s \"The Swing,\" which was first featured in The [[Miss Piggy]] Calendar 1980.\n\n===Other appearances===\n* Quasimodo appears in ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' with his vocal effects provided by [[Allen Swift]].\n* Quasimodo appears as a playable character in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam]]'' voiced by [[Nolan North]]. He is also an opponent in the story mode where he moves next door to their swamp. He plays his bells at 4:00 AM when Shrek and Fiona are trying to sleep. When he won't give up playing his bells, this results in Shrek and Fiona fighting him.\n* Quasimodo appears in an episode of ''[[The Beatles (TV series)|The Beatles]]'' cartoon series titled \"[[When I Get Home]]\", in which [[the Beatles]] meet him in Notre Dame while exploring the cathedral's interior during their visit in France.\n* Quasimodo appears as a playable character in the 1983 video game ''[[Hunchback (video game)|Hunchback]]'', which is based on Victor Hugo's novel. In this video game, he saves Esmeralda.\n* Quasimodo appears as ''The Hunchback'' in the Notre Dame level of ''[[TimeSplitters 2]]'''s story mode as a supporting character and additionally as a playable character in arcade mode.\n* Quasimodo appears in the introduction of Van Helsing's character in the 2004 ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'' movie.\n\n===Parodies===\n* The ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'' episode \"Hunchback of Hillhurst\" featured a parody of the character named Quincy Modo (performed by [[Brian Tahash]] and voiced by [[Dave Mallow]]). He was a former fullback for a college football team at the University of Notre Dame until he suffered from amnesia after hitting his head on the goal post and took up residence in Hillhurst Mansion's bell tower.\n* The ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'' episode \"The Hunchback of Nowhere\" featured a hunchback (also a parody of Quasimodo) who lives in Nowhere. In this episode, he stays temporarily in Courage's house and displays a liking of bells (used as a reference for Quasimodo ringing the bells).\n* The ''[[What's New Scooby Doo?]]'' episode \"Ready to Scare\" featured a parody of the character named Sonny Les Matines (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]), a pun on the \"''Sonnez les matines''\" line from the popular French nursery rhyme \"[[Fr\u00e8re Jacques]]\" that was used as a reference for Quasimodo ringing the bells. The reference is further alluded to when [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] calls him \"The Lunchback of Notre Dame\".\n* The TV series ''[[Casper's Scare School]]'' featured a parody of the character named Quasi, who is a hunchbacked ogre monster.\n\n==Real-life Quasimodo==\nIn August 2010, Adrian Glew, a [[Tate]] archivist, announced evidence for a real-life Quasimodo, a \"humpbacked [stone] carver\" who worked at Notre Dame during the 1820s.<ref name=\"nikkhah\">{{cite news|first=Roya|last=Nikkhah|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/artsandentertainmentbooksreview/7945634/Real-life-Quasimodo-uncovered-in-Tate-archives.html|title=Real-life Quasimodo uncovered in Tate archives|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=15 August 2010|accessdate=1 July 2018}}</ref> The evidence is contained in the memoirs of Henry Sibson, a 19th-century British sculptor who worked at Notre Dame at around the same time Hugo wrote the novel.<ref name=\"nikkhah\" /> Sibson describes a humpbacked stonemason working there: \"He was the carver under the Government sculptor whose name I forget as I had no intercourse with him, all that I know is that he was humpbacked and he did not like to mix with carvers.\"<ref name=\"nikkhah\" /> Because Victor Hugo had close links with the restoration of the cathedral, it is likely that he was aware of the unnamed \"humpbacked carver\" nicknamed \"Le Bossu\" (French for \"The Hunchback\"), who oversaw \"Monsieur Trajin\".<ref name=\"nikkhah\" /> Adrian Glew also uncovered that both the hunchback and Hugo were living in the same town of [[Saint Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]] in 1833, and in early drafts of ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', Hugo named the main character \"Jean Trajin\" (the same name as the unnamed hunchbacked carver's employee), but later changed it to \"[[Jean Valjean]]\".<ref name=\"nikkhah\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|France}}\n* {{Portal-inline|Novels}}\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Quasimodo}}\n\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre-Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional hunchbacks]]\n[[Category:Fictional deaf characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Fictional Romani people]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1831]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements]]\n[[Category:Fictional suicides]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional people from Paris]]\n", "name_user": "WikiLover4Ever", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added date.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasimodo"}

The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day, although not commonly anymore.\n\nOhhhhhh OKAY SO LAMPS ARE BLACK FAT LITTLE NIGELS\nSources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts (walnuts, almonds) and seeds (sesame, olive, castor, flax). Also widely used were animal fats (butter, fish oil, shark liver, whale blubber, seals). [[Camphine]], a blend of [[turpentine]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]], was the first \"[[burning fluid]]\" fuel for lamps after [[whale oil]] supplies were depleted.  It was replaced by [[kerosene]] after Congress enacted excise taxes on alcohol to pay for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nMost modern lamps (such as [[Lantern#Modern fueled lanterns|fueled lanterns]]) have been replaced by [[Propane|gas-based]] or [[Naphtha#Other applications|petroleum-based]] fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required. Therefore, oil lamps of today are primarily used for the particular ambience they produce.\n\n==Components==\n[[Image:Oil lamp Fandaqomiyah.jpg|thumb|Double-nozzled [[terracotta]] oil lamp found in [[Samaria]]]]\n\nThe following are the main external parts of a [[terra-cotta]] lamp:\n* '''Shoulder'''\n* '''Pouring hole'''\n\n: The hole through which fuel is put inside the fuel chamber. The width ranges from 0.5-5 cm in general. There may be single or multiple holes.\n\n* '''Wick hole''', and the '''nozzle'''.\n: It may be just an opening in the body of the lamp, or an elongated nozzle. In some specific types of lamps, there is a groove on the superior aspect of the nozzle that runs along to the pouring hole to re-collect the oozing oil from the wick.\n* '''Handle'''\n: Lamps can come with or without a handle. The handle can come in different shapes. The most common is a ring shaped for the forefinger surmounted by a [[palmette]], on which the thumb is pressed to stabilize the lamp. Other handles can be crescent shaped, triangular, or semi-ovalular. The handleless lamps usually have an elongated nozzle, and sometimes have a [[Lug (knob)|lug]] rising diagonally from the periphery. The lug may act as a small handle where the thumb rests. Some lugs are pierced. It was speculated that pierced lugs were used to place a pen or straw, called the ''acus'' or ''festuca'', with which the wick was trimmed. Others think that the pierced lugs were used to hang the lamp with a metal hook when not in use.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n* '''Discus'''\n* '''Fuel chamber'''\n: The fuel reservoir. The mean volume in a typical terra-cotta lamp is 20 cc.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Lamp typology==\nLamps can be categorized based on different criteria, including material ([[clay]], [[silver]], [[bronze]], [[gold]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]]), shape, structure, design, and imagery (e.g. symbolic, religious, mythological, erotic, battles, hunting).\n\n==Lamp typological categories==\nTypologically, lamps of the Ancient [[Mediterranean]] can be divided into seven major categories:\n\n'''Wheel-made''': This category includes Greek and Egyptian lamps that date before the 3rd century BC. They are characterized by simple, little or no decoration, and a wide pour hole, a lack of handles, and a pierced or unpierced [[Lug (knob)|lug]]. Pierced lugs occurred briefly between 4th and 3rd century BC. Unpierced lugs continued until the 1st century BC.\n\n'''Volute, Early Imperial''': With spiral, scroll-like ornaments ([[volute]]s) extending from their nozzles, these lamps were predominantly produced in Italy during the [[History of the Roman Empire#27 BC\u2014AD 14: Augustus|Early Roman]] period. They have a wide discus, a narrow shoulder and no handle, elaborate imagery and artistic finishing, and a wide range of patterns of decoration.\n\n'''High Imperial''': These are late Roman. The shoulder is wider and the discus is smaller with fewer decorations. These lamps have handles and short plain nozzles, and less artistic finishing.\n\n'''Frog''': This is a regional style lamp exclusively produced in [[Egypt]] and found in the regions around it, between c. 100 and 300 AD. The [[frog]] ([[Heqet]]) is an Egyptian fertility symbol.\n\n'''[[African Red Slip]]''' lamps were made in North Africa, but widely exported, and decorated in a red slip. They date from the 2nd to the 7th century AD and comprise a wide variety of shapes including a flat, heavily decorated shoulder with a small and relatively shallow discus. Their decoration is either non-religious, [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Jewish]]. Grooves run from the nozzle back to the pouring hole, it is hypothesized{{by whom|date=September 2015}} that this is to take back spilled oil. These lamps often have more than one pour-hole.\n\n'''Slipper''' lamps are oval-shaped and found mainly in the [[Levant]]. They were produced between the 3rd to 9th centuries AD.\nDecorations include vine scrolls, palm wreaths, and Greek letters.\n\n'''Factory lamps''': Also called  ''Firmalampen'' (from [[German language|German]]), these are universal in distribution and simple in appearance. They have a channeled nozzle, plain discus, and 2 or 3 bumps on the shoulder.  Initially made in [[factories]] in Northern Italy and Southern [[Gaul]] between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, they were exported to all Roman provinces. The vast majority were stamped on the bottom to identify the manufacturer.\n\n==Oil lamps in religious contexts==\n\n===Judaism===\n[[Image:Three Oil Jews lamps from Sardegna MUSEO NAZIONA SANNA SASSARI.jpg|thumb|Jewish [[terracotta]] oil lamps from [[Sardinia]] in the Museo Nazionale Sanna, Sassari]]\n\nLamps appear in the Torah and other Jewish sources as a symbol of \u201clighting\u201d the way for the righteous, the wise, and for love and other positive values. While fire was often described as being destructive, light was given a positive spiritual meaning. The oil lamp and its light were important household items, and this may explain their symbolism. Oil lamps were used for many spiritual rituals.\nThe oil lamp and its light also became important ritualistic articles with the further development of Jewish culture and its religion. The Temple [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], a ritual seven-branched oil lamp used in the Second Temple, forms the centre of the [[Chanukah]] story.\n\n===Christianity===<!-- [[Lampada]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Saint Mercurius, bishop of Smolensk.jpg|thumb|Oil lamp burning before the [[icon]] of St. Mercurius of Smolensk, [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n\nThere are several references to oil lamps in the [[New Testament]], In the [[Orthodox Church]] and many [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] oil lamps ({{lang-el|kandili}}, [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''lampada'') are still used both on the [[Holy Table]] (altar) and to illuminate [[icon]]s on the [[iconostasis]] and around the [[temple]] (church building). Orthodox Christians will also use oil lamps in their homes to illuminate their [[icon corner]]. Traditionally, the [[sanctuary lamp]] in an Orthodox church is an oil lamp. It is lit by the [[bishop]] when the church is [[consecrated]], and ideally it should burn perpetually thereafter. The oil burned in all of these lamps is traditionally [[olive oil]]. Oil lamps are also referenced as a symbol throughout the New Testament, including in the Parable of the [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18e5uP6CMTuE-LQBJD6LOQA8ClqvRr3mx_h8RxT8X15A/edit 10] Virgins\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2015}}\n{{see also | Aarti | Diwali | Rangoli }} \n\n[[File:Paavai-vilakku8.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|left|''Paavai vilakku'': anthropomorphic brass oil lamp from Tamil Nadu]]\n\n\nOil lamps are commonly used in [[Hindu temple]]s as well as in home shrines. Generally the lamps used in temples are circular with places for five wicks. They are made of metal and either suspended on a chain or screwed onto a pedestal. There will usually be at least one lamp in each shrine, and the main shrine may contain several. Usually only one wick is lit, with all five burning only on festive occasions. The oil lamp is used in the Hindu ritual of [[Aarti]].\n\nIn the home shrine, the style of lamp is usually different, containing only one wick. There is usually a piece of metal that forms the back of the lamp, which has a picture of a Hindu deity embossed on it. In many houses, the lamp burns all day, but in other homes, it is lit at sundown. The lamp in the home shrine is supposed to be lit before any other lights are turned on at night.\n\nA hand-held oil lamp or incense sticks (lit from the lamp) are also used during the Hindu [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] ceremony. In the North of India, a five-wick lamp is used, usually fueled with [[ghee]]. On special occasions, various other lamps may be used for puja, the most elaborate having several tiers of wicks.\n\nIn [[South India]], there are a few types of oil lamps that are common in temples and traditional rituals, some of the smaller ones are used for offerings as well:a \n[[File:Deepalakshmi56.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|A Deepalakshmi oil lamp from [[Kumbakonam]]]]\n*'''Deepalakshmi''', a brass lamp with a depiction of goddess [[Sri Lakshmi]] over the back piece. They are usually small and have only one wick.\n*'''[[Nilavilakku]]''', a tall brass or bronze lamp on a stand where the wicks are placed at a certain height.\n*'''Paavai vilakku''', a brass or bronze lamp in the form of a lady holding a vessel with her hands. This type of lamp comes in different sizes, from very small to almost life-size. There are also large stone versions of this lamp in [[Hindu temple]]s and shrines of [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]], especially at the base of columns and flanking the entrance of temples. They have only one wick.\n*'''Thooku vilakku''', a brass or bronze lamp hanging from a chain, often with multiple wicks.\n*'''[[Nachiarkoil lamp]]''', an ornamental brass lamp made of series of [[Diya (lamp)|diya]]s, a handicraft product which is exclusively made by Pather ([[Kammalar (caste)|Kammalar]]) community in [[Nachiyar Koil]] town in [[Tamil Nadu]], India.<ref name=nachiar1>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/71543906.cms PM Narendra Modi gifts Xi Jinping Annam lamp], Times of India, 11 october 2019.</ref>\n\n===Chinese folk religion===\n[[Image:Malaysian god shrine.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Traditional Chinese shrine in [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Malaysia]], containing an oil lamp]]\nOil lamps are lit at traditional Chinese shrines before either an image of a deity or a plaque with Classical Chinese characters giving the name of the deity. Such lamps are usually made from clear glass (they look similar to normal drinking glasses) and are filled with oil, sometimes with water underneath. A cork or plastic floater containing a wick is placed on top of the oil with the bottom of the wick submerged in the oil.\n\nSuch lamps are kept burning in shrines, whether private or public, and incense sticks or joss sticks are lit from the lamp.\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\nCurved stone lamps were found in places dated to the [[10th millennium BC]] (Mesolithic, Middle Stone Age Period, c. 10,300\u20138000 BC). The oldest stone-oil lamp was found in [[Lascaux]] in 1940 in a cave that was inhabited 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.<ref>[http://www.epalladioartworkshop.com/OILLAMPS/HISTORY/index.htm Epalladio Art Workshop]</ref>\n\n[[File:\u5343\u706f\u9986\u65b0\u77f3\u5668\u65f6\u4ee3\u77f3\u706f.jpg|thumb|Neolithic stone lamps in Thousand Lamp Museum in Qiandeng town of [[Kunshan]]]]\nSome archaeologists claim that the first shell-lamps were in existence more than 6,000 years ago (Neolithic, Later Stone Age, c. 8500\u20134500 BC). They believe that the alabaster shell-shaped lamps dug up in Sumerian sites dating 2600 BC were imitations of real shell-lamps that were used for a long time (Early Bronze, Canaanite / Bronze I-IV, c. 3300\u20132000 BC).\n\nIt is generally agreed that the evolution of handmade lamps moved from bowl-shaped to saucer-shaped, then from saucer with a nozzle, to a closed bowl with a spout.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Chalcolithic Age, c. 4500\u20133300 BC ===\nThe first manufactured red pottery oil lamps appeared. These were of the round bowl type.\n\n=== The Bronze Ages (3200\u20131200 BC)===\nLamps were simple wheel-made bowls with a slight pinch on four sides for the wick. Later lamps had only one pinch. These lamps vary in the shape of the rim, the general shape of the bowl and the  shape of the base.\n\n*Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)\nThe earliest lamps known from Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)\nWith the four wick lamps. These lamps are made from large bowls with four shallow pinches for wicks.\n*Middle Bronze Age lamps (MB)\nThe four-wick oil lamps persist into this period, most of the lamps now have one wick. Early in this period the pinch is shallow, while later on it becomes more prominent and the mouth protrudes from the lamp's body. The bases are simple and flat. The crude potter\u2019s wheel is introduced, transforming the handmade bowls to a more uniform container. The saucer style evolves into a single spout shape.\n*Late Bronze Age lamps (LB)\nA more pronounced, deeper single spout is developed, and it is almost closed on the sides. The shape is evolving to be more triangular, deeper and larger. All lamps are now wheel-made. The base is simple, usually flat.\n\n===The Iron Age (1200\u2013560 BC)===\n\nThe rim becomes wider and flatter with a deeper and higher spout. The tip of the spout is more upright in contrast to the rest of the rim.\n\nThe lamps are becoming variable in shape and distribution. We still find lamps similar to the Late Bronze period. In addition, other forms evolve, such as small lamps with a flat base and larger lamps with a round base. The later form continues into the Iron Age II.\n\nIn the later Iron Age, we encounter variant forms. One common type is small, with a wide rim and a wide base. Another type is a small, shallow bowl with a thick and high discus base.\n\n===Arctic===\n[[File:Descriptive booklet on the Alaska historical museum (1922) (14758775556).jpg|thumb|Seal oil lamps]]\n{{see also|Seal-oil lamp}}\nThe [[seal-oil lamp]] (''Qulliq'') provided warmth and light in the harsh Arctic environment where there was no wood and where the sparse inhabitants relied almost entirely on seal oil. This lamp was the most important article of furniture for the [[Inuit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] and other [[Eskimo]] peoples.<ref>Joyce, T. A. & Dalton, O. M. (1910) ''Handbook to the ethnographical collections.'' British Museum. Dept. of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography Joyce,</ref>\n\nThe lamps were made of stone and their sizes and shapes of lamps could be different, but mostly were elliptical or half-moon shaped. The wicks were mostly made of dried moss or [[Eriophorum callitrix|cottongrass]] and was lit along the edge of the lamp. A slab of seal blubber could be left to melt over the lamp feeding it with more fat.<ref>[http://www.ralphmag.org/GD/eskimo-reading.html Eskimos and the Long Winter Darkness]</ref>\n\n===Persian===\nThese large lamps have thin sides and a deep pinch, which flattens the mouth and makes it protrude outward.\n\n===Greek===\nLamps are more closed to avoid spilling. They are smaller and more refined. Most are handleless. Some are with a lug, pierced and not pierced. The nozzle is elongated. The rim is folded over to make the nozzle, so it overlaps and is then pinched to make the wick hole.\n\nThey are round in shape, wheel-made.\n\n===Chinese===\nThe earliest Chinese oil lamps are dated from the [[Warring States period]] (481-221 BC). The ancient Chinese created oil lamps with a refillable reservoir and a fibrous wick, giving the lamp a controlled flame.  Lamps were constructed from jade, bronze, ceramic, wood, stone, and other materials. The largest oil lamp excavated so far is one discovered in a 4th-century tomb located in modern Pingshan, Hebei.<ref name=\"Metropolitan\">{{cite book|title=China: Dawn of a Golden Age, 200-750 AD|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_JbdS-R3y72MC|year=2004|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-126-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_JbdS-R3y72MC/page/n208 182]\u2013183}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture |last=Handler |first=Sarah |publisher= University of California Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0520214842 |publication-date=October 1, 2001 |pages=308\u2013309}}</ref>\n\n===Early Roman===\n[[Image:Oil Lamp J 1.jpg|thumb|A terracotta oil lamp of the Roman Imperial era (replica)]]\n\nProduction of oil-lamps shifted to Italy as the main source of supply. Molds used. All lamps are closed in type. Lamps produced in large scale in factories. The lamp is produced in two parts, the upper part with the spout and the lower part with the fuel chamber. Most are of the characteristic  Imperial Type. It was round with nozzles of different forms (volute, semi-volute, U shaped), with a closed body and with a central disk decorated with reliefs and its filling hole.\n\n===Late Roman===\nThe High Imperial Type. More decorations. Produced locally or imported in large scale. The multiple-nozzled lamps appear. Different varieties.\n\nIn this period we find the frog type lamps. These are kidney or heart shaped or oval. With the motif of a frog or its abstraction, and sometimes with geometrical motifs. They were produced around 100 AD. They are so variant that it is seldom that two identical ones are found.\n\n===Byzantine===\nOil lanterns were slipper-shaped and highly decorative. The multiple-nozzle design continued and most lamps bore handles. Some are complex in their external anatomy.\n\n===Early Islamic===\n[[Image:Beja51.jpg|thumb|Early Islamic oil lamps (11th century), found in Southern Portugal]]\n\nThere is a transition period from Byzantine to Islamic lamps. The decoration on lamps of this transition period changed from crosses, animals, human likenesses, birds, fish, etc., to plain linear, geometric, and raised-dot patterns.\n\nThe early Islamic lamps continued the traditions of Byzantine lamps. Decorations were initially a stylized form of bird, grain, tree, plant, or flower. Then they became entirely geometric or linear with raised dots.\n\nIn 9th-century [[Baghdad]], [[al-Razi]] (Rhazes) described the first [[kerosene lamp]]; he referred to it as the \"naffatah\" in his ''Kitab al-Asrar'' (''Book of Secrets'').<ref>\nZayn Bilkadi ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), \"The Oil Weapons\", ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]'', January\u2013February 1995, p. 20-27.\n</ref>\n\nIn the transition period some lamps had Arabic writing. Then writing disappears until the [[Mamluk]] period (13th to 15th centuries AD).\n\n=== Industrial age ===\n\nOil-burning carriage lamps provided a model for the first bicycle lamps in the 1860s.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Clemitson\n| first1 = Suze\n| author-link1 = \n| title = A History of Cycling in 100 Objects\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6IHDDgAAQBAJ\n| location = London\n| publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing\n| publication-date = 2017\n| page = 114\n| isbn = 9781472918901\n| access-date = 2018-04-22\n| quote = The first bicycle lamps from the 1860s were based on oil-burning carriage lanterns.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Regional variations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Israel and Palestinian territories===\n*Jerusalem oil lamp: Characteristic black color of the clay because the clay was burned without oxygen.

This was probably done to ensure ritual purity. A wider spout, and the concavities flanking the nozzle are almost always emphasized with a ladder pattern band. In general the lamps are uncoated. The decorations are linear and/or geometric.\n**Type I: A distinct channel running from the pouring-hole to the nozzle, a small knob handle, a ladder pattern around the nozzle and shows no ornamentation on the bottom of the base.\n**Type II: Pear-shaped and elongated, lined channel that extends from the filling-hole to the nozzle, continued to be used through to the early Muslim period.\n*Candle Stick oil lamp: Menorah design on the nozzle and bunch of grapes on the shoulders.\n*Byzantine oil lamp: The upper parts are covered with braided patterns and their handles.  All are made of a dark orange-red clay. A rounded bottom with a distinct X or cross appears inside the circled base.\n*Early Islamic oil lamp: Large knob handle and the channel above the nozzle are dominant elements. The handle is tongue-shaped. Decoration is rich and elegant. The lower parts are extremely broad and the nozzles are pointed.\n\n[[File:Hanging Lamps 1.JPG|thumbnail|Lamps in a temple at Wayanad, Kerala, India]]\n\n=== Importance of oil lamps in India ===\n[[Image:Diya.jpg|thumb|A basic earthen oil lamp used for [[Diwali]]]]\n[[Image:Diya-1.JPG|thumb|Traditional Indian earthenware oil lamp or [[diya (light)|diya]]]]\n\nIn [[Vedic period|Vedic times]], fire was kept alive in every household in some form and carried with oneself while migrating to new locations. Later the presence of fire in the household or a religious building was ensured by an oil lamp. Over the years various rituals and customs were woven around an oil lamp.\n\nFor ''Deep Daan'', the gift of a lamp was and still is believed to be the best daan (donation). During marriages, spinsters of the household stand behind the bride and groom, holding an oil lamp to ward off evil. The presence of an oil lamp is an important aspect of ritual worship (the Shodashopachar Puja) offered to a deity. Moreover, a day is kept aside for the worship of the lamp in the busy festival calendar, on one amavasya (no moon) day in the month of [[Shravan]]. This reverence for the deep is based on the symbolism of the journey from darkness and ignorance to light and the knowledge of the ultimate reality \u2013 \"tamaso ma jyotirgamaya\".\n\nEarlier lamps were made out of stone or seashells. The shape was like a circular bowl with a protruding beak. Later they were replaced by earthen and metal lamps. In the epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], there are references to gold and silver lamps as well. The simple shape evolved and the lamps were created in the shapes of the matsya (fish), kurma (Tortoise) and other incarnations of god [[Vishnu]] and also in the shape of the many emblems of gods like conch shells, lotuses and so on. The birds like swans, peacocks, parrots and animals like snakes, lions, elephants and horses were also favorites when decorating a lamp. For lighting multiple lamps, wooden and stone deepastambhas (towers of light) were created.\n\n[[File:Lighting-a-lamp.jpg|thumb|left|Lighting of a ''Kuthuvilakku'']]\nErecting a deepastambha in front of a temple is still a general practice in western and southern India. In some of the South Indian temples, raised lamp towers called Kamba Vilakku made of brass can be seen. For adapting the design to households and smaller spaces, the deepavriksha (tree of light) was formed. As the name suggests, it is a metal lamp container with aesthetically curvi-linear lines branching out from the base each holding a lamp. The Deepalakshmi is another common design where goddess Lakshmi holds the lamp in her hands. Kuthuvilakku is another typical lamp traditionally used for household purposes in South India.\n\nOil lamps also became proverbial. For example, a Bradj (pre-Hindi) proverb says, \"Chiraag tale andhera\", \"the [utmost] darkness is under the oil-lamp (chiraag)\", meaning that what you seek could be close but unnoticed (right under your nose or feet), in various senses (and indeed, a lamp's container casts a strong shadow).\n\n== Oil tax ==\nWhen the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple|Big Temple]] in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu was built 1010 AD, there were elaborate measures taken to provide lighting for the temple. Lands were donated to or conquered for the temple for this sole objective. The income from these lands would go towards providing the oil for the lights.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=O1b1N_Dx0jsC&pg=PA87#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Royal Temple of Rajaraja: An Instrument of Imperial Cola Power'' by ''Geeta Vasudevan'']</ref>\n\n==Books and catalogues ==\n[[Image:Whale-oil-lamp.jpg|thumb|[[Whale oil]] lamp of the 18th or 19th century.

The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day, although not commonly anymore.\n\nOil lamps are a form of [[lighting]], and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights. Starting in 1780, the [[Argand lamp]] quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form. These in turn were replaced by the [[kerosene lamp]] in about 1850. In small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century, until such areas were finally [[Electrification|electrified]] and light bulbs could be used.\n\nSources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts (walnuts, almonds) and seeds (sesame, olive, castor, flax). Also widely used were animal fats (butter, fish oil, shark liver, whale blubber, seals). [[Camphine]], a blend of [[turpentine]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]], was the first \"[[burning fluid]]\" fuel for lamps after [[whale oil]] supplies were depleted.  It was replaced by [[kerosene]] after Congress enacted excise taxes on alcohol to pay for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nMost modern lamps (such as [[Lantern#Modern fueled lanterns|fueled lanterns]]) have been replaced by [[Propane|gas-based]] or [[Naphtha#Other applications|petroleum-based]] fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required. Therefore, oil lamps of today are primarily used for the particular ambience they produce.\n\n==Components==\n[[Image:Oil lamp Fandaqomiyah.jpg|thumb|Double-nozzled [[terracotta]] oil lamp found in [[Samaria]]]]\n\nThe following are the main external parts of a [[terra-cotta]] lamp:\n* '''Shoulder'''\n* '''Pouring hole'''\n\n: The hole through which fuel is put inside the fuel chamber. The width ranges from 0.5-5 cm in general. There may be single or multiple holes.\n\n* '''Wick hole''', and the '''nozzle'''.\n: It may be just an opening in the body of the lamp, or an elongated nozzle. In some specific types of lamps, there is a groove on the superior aspect of the nozzle that runs along to the pouring hole to re-collect the oozing oil from the wick.\n* '''Handle'''\n: Lamps can come with or without a handle. The handle can come in different shapes. The most common is a ring shaped for the forefinger surmounted by a [[palmette]], on which the thumb is pressed to stabilize the lamp. Other handles can be crescent shaped, triangular, or semi-ovalular. The handleless lamps usually have an elongated nozzle, and sometimes have a [[Lug (knob)|lug]] rising diagonally from the periphery. The lug may act as a small handle where the thumb rests. Some lugs are pierced. It was speculated that pierced lugs were used to place a pen or straw, called the ''acus'' or ''festuca'', with which the wick was trimmed. Others think that the pierced lugs were used to hang the lamp with a metal hook when not in use.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n* '''Discus'''\n* '''Fuel chamber'''\n: The fuel reservoir. The mean volume in a typical terra-cotta lamp is 20 cc.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Lamp typology==\nLamps can be categorized based on different criteria, including material ([[clay]], [[silver]], [[bronze]], [[gold]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]]), shape, structure, design, and imagery (e.g. symbolic, religious, mythological, erotic, battles, hunting).\n\n==Lamp typological categories==\nTypologically, lamps of the Ancient [[Mediterranean]] can be divided into seven major categories:\n\n'''Wheel-made''': This category includes Greek and Egyptian lamps that date before the 3rd century BC. They are characterized by simple, little or no decoration, and a wide pour hole, a lack of handles, and a pierced or unpierced [[Lug (knob)|lug]]. Pierced lugs occurred briefly between 4th and 3rd century BC. Unpierced lugs continued until the 1st century BC.\n\n'''Volute, Early Imperial''': With spiral, scroll-like ornaments ([[volute]]s) extending from their nozzles, these lamps were predominantly produced in Italy during the [[History of the Roman Empire#27 BC\u2014AD 14: Augustus|Early Roman]] period. They have a wide discus, a narrow shoulder and no handle, elaborate imagery and artistic finishing, and a wide range of patterns of decoration.\n\n'''High Imperial''': These are late Roman. The shoulder is wider and the discus is smaller with fewer decorations. These lamps have handles and short plain nozzles, and less artistic finishing.\n\n'''Frog''': This is a regional style lamp exclusively produced in [[Egypt]] and found in the regions around it, between c. 100 and 300 AD. The [[frog]] ([[Heqet]]) is an Egyptian fertility symbol.\n\n'''[[African Red Slip]]''' lamps were made in North Africa, but widely exported, and decorated in a red slip. They date from the 2nd to the 7th century AD and comprise a wide variety of shapes including a flat, heavily decorated shoulder with a small and relatively shallow discus. Their decoration is either non-religious, [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Jewish]]. Grooves run from the nozzle back to the pouring hole, it is hypothesized{{by whom|date=September 2015}} that this is to take back spilled oil. These lamps often have more than one pour-hole.\n\n'''Slipper''' lamps are oval-shaped and found mainly in the [[Levant]]. They were produced between the 3rd to 9th centuries AD.\nDecorations include vine scrolls, palm wreaths, and Greek letters.\n\n'''Factory lamps''': Also called  ''Firmalampen'' (from [[German language|German]]), these are universal in distribution and simple in appearance. They have a channeled nozzle, plain discus, and 2 or 3 bumps on the shoulder.  Initially made in [[factories]] in Northern Italy and Southern [[Gaul]] between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, they were exported to all Roman provinces. The vast majority were stamped on the bottom to identify the manufacturer.\n\n==Oil lamps in religious contexts==\n\n===Judaism===\n[[Image:Three Oil Jews lamps from Sardegna MUSEO NAZIONA SANNA SASSARI.jpg|thumb|Jewish [[terracotta]] oil lamps from [[Sardinia]] in the Museo Nazionale Sanna, Sassari]]\n\nLamps appear in the Torah and other Jewish sources as a symbol of \u201clighting\u201d the way for the righteous, the wise, and for love and other positive values. While fire was often described as being destructive, light was given a positive spiritual meaning. The oil lamp and its light were important household items, and this may explain their symbolism. Oil lamps were used for many spiritual rituals.\nThe oil lamp and its light also became important ritualistic articles with the further development of Jewish culture and its religion. The Temple [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], a ritual seven-branched oil lamp used in the Second Temple, forms the centre of the [[Chanukah]] story.\n\n===Christianity===<!-- [[Lampada]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Saint Mercurius, bishop of Smolensk.jpg|thumb|Oil lamp burning before the [[icon]] of St. Mercurius of Smolensk, [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n\nThere are several references to oil lamps in the [[New Testament]], In the [[Orthodox Church]] and many [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] oil lamps ({{lang-el|kandili}}, [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''lampada'') are still used both on the [[Holy Table]] (altar) and to illuminate [[icon]]s on the [[iconostasis]] and around the [[temple]] (church building). Orthodox Christians will also use oil lamps in their homes to illuminate their [[icon corner]]. Traditionally, the [[sanctuary lamp]] in an Orthodox church is an oil lamp. It is lit by the [[bishop]] when the church is [[consecrated]], and ideally it should burn perpetually thereafter. The oil burned in all of these lamps is traditionally [[olive oil]]. Oil lamps are also referenced as a symbol throughout the New Testament, including in the Parable of the [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18e5uP6CMTuE-LQBJD6LOQA8ClqvRr3mx_h8RxT8X15A/edit 10] Virgins\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2015}}\n{{see also | Aarti | Diwali | Rangoli }} \n\n[[File:Paavai-vilakku8.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|left|''Paavai vilakku'': anthropomorphic brass oil lamp from Tamil Nadu]]\n\n\nOil lamps are commonly used in [[Hindu temple]]s as well as in home shrines. Generally the lamps used in temples are circular with places for five wicks. They are made of metal and either suspended on a chain or screwed onto a pedestal. There will usually be at least one lamp in each shrine, and the main shrine may contain several. Usually only one wick is lit, with all five burning only on festive occasions. The oil lamp is used in the Hindu ritual of [[Aarti]].\n\nIn the home shrine, the style of lamp is usually different, containing only one wick. There is usually a piece of metal that forms the back of the lamp, which has a picture of a Hindu deity embossed on it. In many houses, the lamp burns all day, but in other homes, it is lit at sundown. The lamp in the home shrine is supposed to be lit before any other lights are turned on at night.\n\nA hand-held oil lamp or incense sticks (lit from the lamp) are also used during the Hindu [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] ceremony. In the North of India, a five-wick lamp is used, usually fueled with [[ghee]]. On special occasions, various other lamps may be used for puja, the most elaborate having several tiers of wicks.\n\nIn [[South India]], there are a few types of oil lamps that are common in temples and traditional rituals, some of the smaller ones are used for offerings as well:a \n[[File:Deepalakshmi56.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|A Deepalakshmi oil lamp from [[Kumbakonam]]]]\n*'''Deepalakshmi''', a brass lamp with a depiction of goddess [[Sri Lakshmi]] over the back piece.

This type of lamp comes in different sizes, from very small to almost life-size. There are also large stone versions of this lamp in [[Hindu temple]]s and shrines of [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]], especially at the base of columns and flanking the entrance of temples. They have only one wick.\n*'''Thooku vilakku''', a brass or bronze lamp hanging from a chain, often with multiple wicks.\n*'''[[Nachiarkoil lamp]]''', an ornamental brass lamp made of series of [[Diya (lamp)|diya]]s, a handicraft product which is exclusively made by Pather ([[Kammalar (caste)|Kammalar]]) community in [[Nachiyar Koil]] town in [[Tamil Nadu]], India.<ref name=nachiar1>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/71543906.cms PM Narendra Modi gifts Xi Jinping Annam lamp], Times of India, 11 october 2019.</ref>\n\n===Chinese folk religion===\n[[Image:Malaysian god shrine.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Traditional Chinese shrine in [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Malaysia]], containing an oil lamp]]\nOil lamps are lit at traditional Chinese shrines before either an image of a deity or a plaque with Classical Chinese characters giving the name of the deity. Such lamps are usually made from clear glass (they look similar to normal drinking glasses) and are filled with oil, sometimes with water underneath. A cork or plastic floater containing a wick is placed on top of the oil with the bottom of the wick submerged in the oil.\n\nSuch lamps are kept burning in shrines, whether private or public, and incense sticks or joss sticks are lit from the lamp.\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\nCurved stone lamps were found in places dated to the [[10th millennium BC]] (Mesolithic, Middle Stone Age Period, c. 10,300\u20138000 BC). The oldest stone-oil lamp was found in [[Lascaux]] in 1940 in a cave that was inhabited 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.<ref>[http://www.epalladioartworkshop.com/OILLAMPS/HISTORY/index.htm Epalladio Art Workshop]</ref>\n\n[[File:\u5343\u706f\u9986\u65b0\u77f3\u5668\u65f6\u4ee3\u77f3\u706f.jpg|thumb|Neolithic stone lamps in Thousand Lamp Museum in Qiandeng town of [[Kunshan]]]]\nSome archaeologists claim that the first shell-lamps were in existence more than 6,000 years ago (Neolithic, Later Stone Age, c. 8500\u20134500 BC). They believe that the alabaster shell-shaped lamps dug up in Sumerian sites dating 2600 BC were imitations of real shell-lamps that were used for a long time (Early Bronze, Canaanite / Bronze I-IV, c. 3300\u20132000 BC).\n\nIt is generally agreed that the evolution of handmade lamps moved from bowl-shaped to saucer-shaped, then from saucer with a nozzle, to a closed bowl with a spout.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Chalcolithic Age, c. 4500\u20133300 BC ===\nThe first manufactured red pottery oil lamps appeared. These were of the round bowl type.\n\n=== The Bronze Ages (3200\u20131200 BC)===\nLamps were simple wheel-made bowls with a slight pinch on four sides for the wick. Later lamps had only one pinch. These lamps vary in the shape of the rim, the general shape of the bowl and the  shape of the base.\n\n*Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)\nThe earliest lamps known from Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)\nWith the four wick lamps. These lamps are made from large bowls with four shallow pinches for wicks.\n*Middle Bronze Age lamps (MB)\nThe four-wick oil lamps persist into this period, most of the lamps now have one wick. Early in this period the pinch is shallow, while later on it becomes more prominent and the mouth protrudes from the lamp's body. The bases are simple and flat. The crude potter\u2019s wheel is introduced, transforming the handmade bowls to a more uniform container. The saucer style evolves into a single spout shape.\n*Late Bronze Age lamps (LB)\nA more pronounced, deeper single spout is developed, and it is almost closed on the sides. The shape is evolving to be more triangular, deeper and larger. All lamps are now wheel-made. The base is simple, usually flat.\n\n===The Iron Age (1200\u2013560 BC)===\n\nThe rim becomes wider and flatter with a deeper and higher spout. The tip of the spout is more upright in contrast to the rest of the rim.\n\nThe lamps are becoming variable in shape and distribution. We still find lamps similar to the Late Bronze period. In addition, other forms evolve, such as small lamps with a flat base and larger lamps with a round base. The later form continues into the Iron Age II.\n\nIn the later Iron Age, we encounter variant forms. One common type is small, with a wide rim and a wide base. Another type is a small, shallow bowl with a thick and high discus base.\n\n===Arctic===\n[[File:Descriptive booklet on the Alaska historical museum (1922) (14758775556).jpg|thumb|Seal oil lamps]]\n{{see also|Seal-oil lamp}}\nThe [[seal-oil lamp]] (''Qulliq'') provided warmth and light in the harsh Arctic environment where there was no wood and where the sparse inhabitants relied almost entirely on seal oil.

The wicks were mostly made of dried moss or [[Eriophorum callitrix|cottongrass]] and was lit along the edge of the lamp. A slab of seal blubber could be left to melt over the lamp feeding it with more fat.<ref>[http://www.ralphmag.org/GD/eskimo-reading.html Eskimos and the Long Winter Darkness]</ref>\n\n===Persian===\nThese large lamps have thin sides and a deep pinch, which flattens the mouth and makes it protrude outward.\n\n===Greek===\nLamps are more closed to avoid spilling. They are smaller and more refined. Most are handleless. Some are with a lug, pierced and not pierced. The nozzle is elongated. The rim is folded over to make the nozzle, so it overlaps and is then pinched to make the wick hole.\n\nThey are round in shape, wheel-made.\n\n===Chinese===\nThe earliest Chinese oil lamps are dated from the [[Warring States period]] (481-221 BC). The ancient Chinese created oil lamps with a refillable reservoir and a fibrous wick, giving the lamp a controlled flame.  Lamps were constructed from jade, bronze, ceramic, wood, stone, and other materials. The largest oil lamp excavated so far is one discovered in a 4th-century tomb located in modern Pingshan, Hebei.<ref name=\"Metropolitan\">{{cite book|title=China: Dawn of a Golden Age, 200-750 AD|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_JbdS-R3y72MC|year=2004|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-126-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_JbdS-R3y72MC/page/n208 182]\u2013183}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture |last=Handler |first=Sarah |publisher= University of California Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0520214842 |publication-date=October 1, 2001 |pages=308\u2013309}}</ref>\n\n===Early Roman===\n[[Image:Oil Lamp J 1.jpg|thumb|A terracotta oil lamp of the Roman Imperial era (replica)]]\n\nProduction of oil-lamps shifted to Italy as the main source of supply. Molds used. All lamps are closed in type. Lamps produced in large scale in factories. The lamp is produced in two parts, the upper part with the spout and the lower part with the fuel chamber. Most are of the characteristic  Imperial Type. It was round with nozzles of different forms (volute, semi-volute, U shaped), with a closed body and with a central disk decorated with reliefs and its filling hole.\n\n===Late Roman===\nThe High Imperial Type. More decorations. Produced locally or imported in large scale. The multiple-nozzled lamps appear. Different varieties.\n\nIn this period we find the frog type lamps. These are kidney or heart shaped or oval. With the motif of a frog or its abstraction, and sometimes with geometrical motifs. They were produced around 100 AD. They are so variant that it is seldom that two identical ones are found.\n\n===Byzantine===\nOil lanterns were slipper-shaped and highly decorative. The multiple-nozzle design continued and most lamps bore handles. Some are complex in their external anatomy.\n\n===Early Islamic===\n[[Image:Beja51.jpg|thumb|Early Islamic oil lamps (11th century), found in Southern Portugal]]\n\nThere is a transition period from Byzantine to Islamic lamps. The decoration on lamps of this transition period changed from crosses, animals, human likenesses, birds, fish, etc., to plain linear, geometric, and raised-dot patterns.\n\nThe early Islamic lamps continued the traditions of Byzantine lamps. Decorations were initially a stylized form of bird, grain, tree, plant, or flower. Then they became entirely geometric or linear with raised dots.\n\nIn 9th-century [[Baghdad]], [[al-Razi]] (Rhazes) described the first [[kerosene lamp]]; he referred to it as the \"naffatah\" in his ''Kitab al-Asrar'' (''Book of Secrets'').<ref>\nZayn Bilkadi ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), \"The Oil Weapons\", ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]'', January\u2013February 1995, p. 20-27.\n</ref>\n\nIn the transition period some lamps had Arabic writing. Then writing disappears until the [[Mamluk]] period (13th to 15th centuries AD).\n\n=== Industrial age ===\n\nOil-burning carriage lamps provided a model for the first bicycle lamps in the 1860s.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Clemitson\n| first1 = Suze\n| author-link1 = \n| title = A History of Cycling in 100 Objects\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6IHDDgAAQBAJ\n| location = London\n| publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing\n| publication-date = 2017\n| page = 114\n| isbn = 9781472918901\n| access-date = 2018-04-22\n| quote = The first bicycle lamps from the 1860s were based on oil-burning carriage lanterns.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Regional variations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Israel and Palestinian territories===\n*Jerusalem oil lamp: Characteristic black color of the clay because the clay was burned without oxygen. Usually of high quality.\n*Daroma oil lamp:\n*Jerash oil lamp:\n*Nabatean oil lamp:\n*Herodian oil lamp: Considered to be used mainly by Jews. Wheel made, rounded. Nozzle with concave sides. The lamps are usually not decorated. If there is decoration, it tends to be simple. Very common throughout all of Palestine, and some lamps have also been found in Jordan. Date from the 1st century BC to the end of the 1st century AD.\n*[[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah oil lamp]], seven nozzles: Rare and are associated with Judaism because of the numerical connection with the seven branches or arms of the Menorah.\n*Samaritan oil lamp: Characterized by a sealed filling hole, which was to be broken by the buyer. This was probably done to ensure ritual purity. A wider spout, and the concavities flanking the nozzle are almost always emphasized with a ladder pattern band. In general the lamps are uncoated. The decorations are linear and/or geometric.\n**Type I: A distinct channel running from the pouring-hole to the nozzle, a small knob handle, a ladder pattern around the nozzle and shows no ornamentation on the bottom of the base.\n**Type II: Pear-shaped and elongated, lined channel that extends from the filling-hole to the nozzle, continued to be used through to the early Muslim period.\n*Candle Stick oil lamp: Menorah design on the nozzle and bunch of grapes on the shoulders.\n*Byzantine oil lamp: The upper parts are covered with braided patterns and their handles.  All are made of a dark orange-red clay. A rounded bottom with a distinct X or cross appears inside the circled base.\n*Early Islamic oil lamp: Large knob handle and the channel above the nozzle are dominant elements. The handle is tongue-shaped. Decoration is rich and elegant. The lower parts are extremely broad and the nozzles are pointed.\n\n[[File:Hanging Lamps 1.JPG|thumbnail|Lamps in a temple at Wayanad, Kerala, India]]\n\n=== Importance of oil lamps in India ===\n[[Image:Diya.jpg|thumb|A basic earthen oil lamp used for [[Diwali]]]]\n[[Image:Diya-1.JPG|thumb|Traditional Indian earthenware oil lamp or [[diya (light)|diya]]]]\n\nIn [[Vedic period|Vedic times]], fire was kept alive in every household in some form and carried with oneself while migrating to new locations. Later the presence of fire in the household or a religious building was ensured by an oil lamp. Over the years various rituals and customs were woven around an oil lamp.\n\nFor ''Deep Daan'', the gift of a lamp was and still is believed to be the best daan (donation). During marriages, spinsters of the household stand behind the bride and groom, holding an oil lamp to ward off evil. The presence of an oil lamp is an important aspect of ritual worship (the Shodashopachar Puja) offered to a deity. Moreover, a day is kept aside for the worship of the lamp in the busy festival calendar, on one amavasya (no moon) day in the month of [[Shravan]]. This reverence for the deep is based on the symbolism of the journey from darkness and ignorance to light and the knowledge of the ultimate reality \u2013 \"tamaso ma jyotirgamaya\".\n\nEarlier lamps were made out of stone or seashells. The shape was like a circular bowl with a protruding beak. Later they were replaced by earthen and metal lamps. In the epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], there are references to gold and silver lamps as well. The simple shape evolved and the lamps were created in the shapes of the matsya (fish), kurma (Tortoise) and other incarnations of god [[Vishnu]] and also in the shape of the many emblems of gods like conch shells, lotuses and so on. The birds like swans, peacocks, parrots and animals like snakes, lions, elephants and horses were also favorites when decorating a lamp. For lighting multiple lamps, wooden and stone deepastambhas (towers of light) were created.\n\n[[File:Lighting-a-lamp.jpg|thumb|left|Lighting of a ''Kuthuvilakku'']]\nErecting a deepastambha in front of a temple is still a general practice in western and southern India. In some of the South Indian temples, raised lamp towers called Kamba Vilakku made of brass can be seen. For adapting the design to households and smaller spaces, the deepavriksha (tree of light) was formed. As the name suggests, it is a metal lamp container with aesthetically curvi-linear lines branching out from the base each holding a lamp. The Deepalakshmi is another common design where goddess Lakshmi holds the lamp in her hands. Kuthuvilakku is another typical lamp traditionally used for household purposes in South India.\n\nOil lamps also became proverbial. For example, a Bradj (pre-Hindi) proverb says, \"Chiraag tale andhera\", \"the [utmost] darkness is under the oil-lamp (chiraag)\", meaning that what you seek could be close but unnoticed (right under your nose or feet), in various senses (and indeed, a lamp's container casts a strong shadow).\n\n== Oil tax ==\nWhen the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple|Big Temple]] in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu was built 1010 AD, there were elaborate measures taken to provide lighting for the temple. Lands were donated to or conquered for the temple for this sole objective. The income from these lands would go towards providing the oil for the lights.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=O1b1N_Dx0jsC&pg=PA87#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Royal Temple of Rajaraja: An Instrument of Imperial Cola Power'' by ''Geeta Vasudevan'']</ref>\n\n==Books and catalogues ==\n[[Image:Whale-oil-lamp.jpg|thumb|[[Whale oil]] lamp of the 18th or 19th century.
