The college comprises a modern, five-storey, multi-function complex and caters for Year 10, 11 and 12 students.\n\nThe college is characterised by its adult learning environment and its different approach to senior secondary education. Noticeably absent are extra-curricular activities, extensive sporting programs, festivals and other activities which are a feature of traditional schools.

There are two lessons per week in each subject, each lesson being 1 hour and 50 minutes, with an informal break in the middle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eynesbury.sa.edu.au/college/index.php/faqs#21 |title=School Day Structure |accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}} Students are not required to be on campus during unscheduled lesson time.<ref name=guide>{{cite web |url=http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/index.php/education/timetables |title=Year 10, 11 and 12 Timetable Information 2015 |accessdate=2015-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302045901/http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/index.php/education/timetables |archive-date=2 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nNew students can commence studies at the start of the first or second semester of Year 10 or Year 11. Students wishing to enrol for Year 12 must begin at the start of the year. These entry points are undertaken after an extensive interview process, where future plans and directions, along with approaches to independent learning, are discussed. Eynesbury supports the notion of individualised programming, and increasing numbers of students undertake subjects at more than one year level. Subject choices are the final phase of the entry process.<ref name=guide/>\n\nThere is an expectation that all students are engaged in full-time study at all times of their enrolment. Part-time study is typically only taken by students in [[Year 13]] who wish to 'top-up' their results from Year 12. Under new legislation in South Australia, from 1 January 2009, all students under 17 years of age are to be engaged in full-time study or full-time work.<ref name=guide/>\n\n====Year 10====\nAll students in Year 10 at Eynesbury study a combination of core and choice subjects. Core subjects are compulsory and include English/English as a Second Language, 'Learning about Thinking', Mathematics, Science and Studies of Society and Environment. These subjects are taken over the whole year. Possible choice subjects are: ASX Stock Exchange Challenge, Business Studies (Financial Literacy), Debating, Creative Writing, Drama, French, Health and Nutrition, Introduction to History, History Through Film, Electronic and Digital Publishing, Physical Education and Visual investigations.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nStudents who earn an A grade in their subjects in Semester 1 may be offered an opportunity to join regular Stage 1 classes in those or related subjects in Semester 2. Some Year 10 subjects may be offered as new SACE Stage 1 credentialed subjects, particularly in Semester 2.  All Year 10 students are involved in the Eynesbury Mentor Program which incorporates the Personal Learning Plan.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Year 11====\nAll students in Year 11 at Eynesbury study a minimum of 110 credits (a whole year program), even if some Stage 1 units have already been completed. Students will be required to select 100 credits in addition to undertaking the Personal Learning Plan (10 credits) if necessary and the start of the Research Project.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe following subjects are offered at Stage 1 level: Accounting, Ancient Studies, Australian and International Politics, Biology, Business and Enterprise, Chemistry, Drama, Economics, English, English as a Second Language (ESL), Environmental Studies, French (Beginners Level), French (Continuers Level), Geography, Information Technology Systems, Japanese (Continuers Level), Legal Studies, Mathematics, Modern History, Physics, Psychology, Visual Arts - Art, Visual Arts - Design.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nSubject changes usually only occur once the first semester of study has been completed. Should a student wish to make a subject change, a request must be put in writing to the Director of Studies halfway through Term 2. After the end of Term 2, subject changes will only be possible in unusual circumstances and at the discretion of the Director of Studies.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Year 12====\nTo be eligible for selection to a university program or course a student must have completed 80 credits of Tertiary Admissions Subjects (TAS). It is expected that all students will complete 80 credits of TAS by the end of Year 12.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe following subjects are offered at Stage 2 level: Accounting, Australian and International Politics, Biology, Business and Enterprise, Chemistry, Chinese (Background Speakers Level), Classical Studies, Drama, Economics, English as a Second Language Studies, English Communications, English Studies, French (Continuers), Geography, Information Technology Studies, Japanese (Continuers), Legal Studies, Mathematical Applications, Mathematical Methods, Mathematical Studies, Specialist Mathematics, Modern History, Physics, Psychology.<ref name=guide/>\n\n===Foundation Studies Program===\nIn 1992, Eynesbury College delivered the first University Foundation Studies Program (FSP) in the state on behalf of the [[University of Adelaide]]. In 1994, [[Flinders University]] and the [[University of South Australia]] joined the program which became the South Australian Universities\u2019 Foundation Studies Program. Foundation students are given provisional admission into the degree of their choice, subject to performance in the Foundation Studies Program. Admission is confirmed when students complete the Program and achieve the necessary entry score for that degree as set by the relevant target university.<ref name=FSP>{{cite web |url=http://www.eibt.sa.edu.au/images/stories/EYNE0041_English%20Brochure%202010-11_web.pdf |title=Your proven pathway to South Australia\u2019s three Universities |accessdate=2011-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706115823/http://www.eibt.sa.edu.au/images/stories/EYNE0041_English%20Brochure%202010-11_web.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTo date, 96% of students who have completed the FSP have gained university places. The South Australian Universities\u2019 Foundation Studies Program is recognised for entry into interstate universities (subject to meeting entry requirements) including the [[University of Melbourne]], the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Monash University]], the [[University of Queensland]] and the [[University of Western Australia]].<ref name=FSP/>\n\nThe Program, consisting of 6 subjects, also enables Australian students to enter directly into First Year bachelor's degree studies at the University of Adelaide without having to complete SACE Stage 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/index.php/programs/senior-high-school.html |title=Australian Students - Foundation Studies Program |accessdate=2011-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213022231/http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/index.php/programs/senior-high-school.html |archive-date=13 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nFSP students may start in January (Standard Program - 12 months), April (Accelerated Program - 8 months) or October (Accelerated Program - 8 months or Extended Program - 15 months).<ref name=FSP/>\n\n====Standard and Accelerated Foundation Studies Programs====\nThe Standard Foundation Studies Program commences in January and is completed in December. Students enrolled in Standard FSP study several of their subjects with Australian Year 12 High School students, e.g. physics, chemistry, biology, economics and others.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nThree courses are compulsory for all FSP students: \n:Language and Communication (4 hours per week - full course), \n:International Studies (2 hours - half course), and \n:Clear Thinking and Logic (2 hours - half course).<ref name=FSP/>\n\n*Students undertaking the Standard FSP (or Stage 2 of the Extended FSP) must take at least three electives from any of the five streams of specialisation. The five streams of specialisation are: \n**Business (Accounting, Economics), \n**Humanities (Australian and International Politics, Environmental Studies, Modern History), \n**Health Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics), \n**Engineering (Additional Mathematics, Mathematics, Physics) and \n**Science (Additional Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology). \n*Students taking the Accelerated FSP (starting in April) must choose at least three electives from the Science, Business, Health Sciences and Engineering streams and Environmental Studies. \n*Students taking the Accelerated FSP (starting in September) must take at least three elective courses from the Engineering and Business streams only. \nStudents attend four hours per week for each elective course.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nAn Accelerated FSP commences in April and ends in December. The Standard and Accelerated programs both lead to the February intake of university. In addition, an Accelerated FSP commencing in September prepares students for mid-year (July) entry to university. The Accelerated FSP is ideally suited to students with above average academic and language skills. The Accelerated courses mostly cover the same content as the Standard FSP, but some applications of theory may be omitted.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nStudent assessments for Standard and Accelerated FSP are based on work completed throughout the year and on a final examination held at the end of the course. Each full course is marked out of 100 and the marks of the two half courses (50 each) are added together and counted as one full course. An aggregate score out of 500 is calculated. For students taking three electives this is a simple addition of all marks. Students must achieve a score of 60% or more in Language and Communication, and 275 overall to be considered for admission, subject to specific degree entry scores and quotas. This provides a base score for consideration for entry to Australian universities.<ref name=FSP/>\n\n====Extended Foundation Studies Program====\nThe Extended FSP is suitable for students who require some additional language development and/or revision in key academic areas. The Extended Program is 4 terms (15 months) in duration. Students take some of the first term (13 weeks) in separate classes specifically designed for Extended Foundation students with a focus on key competencies, skills and content essential for success at Foundation level. During this term, students take three 10-week Core courses (compulsory) and the equivalent of two 10-week Elective courses.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nThe following courses are compulsory: Language and Study Skills, An Introduction to Communication and Critical Thinking, Mathematics. Students select the equivalent of two full courses from the following introductory areas: An Introduction to Biological Sciences (Biology, Chemistry), An Introduction to the Pure Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Additional Mathematics) and An Introduction to International Business (Accounting, Economics).<ref name=FSP/>\n\nIn January, successful Extended Program students join students from the Standard Foundation Studies Program and are integrated into classes with Australian and International Year 12 students for several Elective courses.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nAssessment is conducted in two stages. The first stage is the assessment of Term 1 courses (as listed above). The assessment of Term 2 \u2013 5 courses as per the Standard Foundation Studies Program is the second stage of evaluation. Assessment at both stages is based on 50% continuous assessment and 50% for final examinations. Results in the first stage are used to assess successful transition to the second stage. They are not used for the final assessment in the second stage or transition to university.<ref name=FSP/>\n\n==Scholarships==\nEynesbury offers the equivalent of 6-8 full-time enrolments as scholarships (typically broken down into 2 x 100%, 4 x 50% and 8 x 25%). These scholarships are generally intended for students entering Year 10 or 11 and remain in force for an entire academic career at Eynesbury. Offers are based on an aptitude test, a 200-300 word personal statement, past academic and community achievement in addition to an interview with the principal. The scholarship selection process takes place twice per year in Term 1 and Term 3. Official dates are published in the local press, the Eynesbury website and its newsletter, Eynesbury Times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/index.php/education/scholarships- |title=Scholarships |accessdate=2015-01-13 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Schools|South Australia}}}}\n* [[List of schools in South Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110220010805/http://www.eibt.sa.edu.au/ Eynesbury Institute of Business and Technology website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101121150322/http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/ Eynesbury International website]\n\n[[Category:Private secondary schools in Adelaide]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1989]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:South Australian Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Italianate architecture in Australia]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1881]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=January 2012}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{self-published|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name \t        = Eynesbury Senior College\n| logo \t        = ESClogo.png\n| image         = Eynesbury.JPG\n| image_size    = \n| caption       = The Franklin Street college campus\n| motto         = Many faces, different pathways - one goal...\n| address       = 15-19 [[Franklin Street, Adelaide|Franklin Street]],<br/>[[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]\n| postcode      = 5000\n| country       = Australia\n| coordinates   = {{Coord|34|55|39|S|138|35|54|E|type:edu_region:AU-SA|display=inline,title}}\n| pushpin_map = South Australia\n| pushpin_image =\n| pushpin_mapsize = 270px\n| pushpin_map_alt = \n| pushpin_map_caption = Location in [[South Australia]]\n| pushpin_label = \n| pushpin_label_position = \n| type          = [[Independent school#Australia|Independent]] [[senior high school]]\n| established \t= {{Start date and age|1989}}\n| principal     = Claire Flenley\n| founder       = Tony Stimson\n| affiliation \t=\n| staff         = \n| enrolment     =\n| years         = [[Year 10|10]] - [[Year 12|12]]\n| oversight     = \n| accreditation = \n| mascot        = \n| colours       = \n| newspaper     = Eynesbury Times\n| yearbook      = \n| website \t= {{URL|www.esc.sa.edu.au}}\n}}\n\n'''Eynesbury Senior College''' is an [[Independent school|independent]] [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] [[senior high school]] on [[Franklin Street, Adelaide|Franklin Street]] in the [[Adelaide city centre|city centre]] of [[Adelaide]], the capital of [[South Australia]].

The Eynesbury Institute of Business and Technology (EIBT) moved to the new campus in April 2009 and other programs followed soon after.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/images/stories/eyne0023_new_building_flyer_lores.pdf |title=Coglin Street Campus New Building Flyer |accessdate=2010-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220022102/http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/images/stories/eyne0023_new_building_flyer_lores.pdf |archive-date=20 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n===Senior High School===\nAs a specialist college with students only in Years 10, 11 and 12, emphasis is placed on helping students prepare for tertiary studies. There are two lessons per week in each subject, each lesson being 1 hour and 50 minutes, with an informal break in the middle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eynesbury.sa.edu.au/college/index.php/faqs#21 |title=School Day Structure |accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}} Students are not required to be on campus during unscheduled lesson time.<ref name=guide>{{cite web |url=http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/index.php/education/timetables |title=Year 10, 11 and 12 Timetable Information 2015 |accessdate=2015-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302045901/http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/index.php/education/timetables |archive-date=2 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nNew students can commence studies at the start of the first or second semester of Year 10 or Year 11. Students wishing to enrol for Year 12 must begin at the start of the year. These entry points are undertaken after an extensive interview process, where future plans and directions, along with approaches to independent learning, are discussed. Eynesbury supports the notion of individualised programming, and increasing numbers of students undertake subjects at more than one year level. Subject choices are the final phase of the entry process.<ref name=guide/>\n\nThere is an expectation that all students are engaged in full-time study at all times of their enrolment. Part-time study is typically only taken by students in [[Year 13]] who wish to 'top-up' their results from Year 12. Under new legislation in South Australia, from 1 January 2009, all students under 17 years of age are to be engaged in full-time study or full-time work.<ref name=guide/>\n\n====Year 10====\nAll students in Year 10 at Eynesbury study a combination of core and choice subjects. Core subjects are compulsory and include English/English as a Second Language, 'Learning about Thinking', Mathematics, Science and Studies of Society and Environment. These subjects are taken over the whole year. Possible choice subjects are: ASX Stock Exchange Challenge, Business Studies (Financial Literacy), Debating, Creative Writing, Drama, French, Health and Nutrition, Introduction to History, History Through Film, Electronic and Digital Publishing, Physical Education and Visual investigations.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nStudents who earn an A grade in their subjects in Semester 1 may be offered an opportunity to join regular Stage 1 classes in those or related subjects in Semester 2. Some Year 10 subjects may be offered as new SACE Stage 1 credentialed subjects, particularly in Semester 2.  All Year 10 students are involved in the Eynesbury Mentor Program which incorporates the Personal Learning Plan.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Year 11====\nAll students in Year 11 at Eynesbury study a minimum of 110 credits (a whole year program), even if some Stage 1 units have already been completed. Students will be required to select 100 credits in addition to undertaking the Personal Learning Plan (10 credits) if necessary and the start of the Research Project.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe following subjects are offered at Stage 1 level: Accounting, Ancient Studies, Australian and International Politics, Biology, Business and Enterprise, Chemistry, Drama, Economics, English, English as a Second Language (ESL), Environmental Studies, French (Beginners Level), French (Continuers Level), Geography, Information Technology Systems, Japanese (Continuers Level), Legal Studies, Mathematics, Modern History, Physics, Psychology, Visual Arts - Art, Visual Arts - Design.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nSubject changes usually only occur once the first semester of study has been completed. Should a student wish to make a subject change, a request must be put in writing to the Director of Studies halfway through Term 2. After the end of Term 2, subject changes will only be possible in unusual circumstances and at the discretion of the Director of Studies.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Year 12====\nTo be eligible for selection to a university program or course a student must have completed 80 credits of Tertiary Admissions Subjects (TAS). It is expected that all students will complete 80 credits of TAS by the end of Year 12.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe following subjects are offered at Stage 2 level: Accounting, Australian and International Politics, Biology, Business and Enterprise, Chemistry, Chinese (Background Speakers Level), Classical Studies, Drama, Economics, English as a Second Language Studies, English Communications, English Studies, French (Continuers), Geography, Information Technology Studies, Japanese (Continuers), Legal Studies, Mathematical Applications, Mathematical Methods, Mathematical Studies, Specialist Mathematics, Modern History, Physics, Psychology.<ref name=guide/>\n\n===Foundation Studies Program===\nIn 1992, Eynesbury College delivered the first University Foundation Studies Program (FSP) in the state on behalf of the [[University of Adelaide]]. In 1994, [[Flinders University]] and the [[University of South Australia]] joined the program which became the South Australian Universities\u2019 Foundation Studies Program. Foundation students are given provisional admission into the degree of their choice, subject to performance in the Foundation Studies Program. Admission is confirmed when students complete the Program and achieve the necessary entry score for that degree as set by the relevant target university.<ref name=FSP>{{cite web |url=http://www.eibt.sa.edu.au/images/stories/EYNE0041_English%20Brochure%202010-11_web.pdf |title=Your proven pathway to South Australia\u2019s three Universities |accessdate=2011-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706115823/http://www.eibt.sa.edu.au/images/stories/EYNE0041_English%20Brochure%202010-11_web.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTo date, 96% of students who have completed the FSP have gained university places. The South Australian Universities\u2019 Foundation Studies Program is recognised for entry into interstate universities (subject to meeting entry requirements) including the [[University of Melbourne]], the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Monash University]], the [[University of Queensland]] and the [[University of Western Australia]].<ref name=FSP/>\n\nThe Program, consisting of 6 subjects, also enables Australian students to enter directly into First Year bachelor's degree studies at the University of Adelaide without having to complete SACE Stage 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/index.php/programs/senior-high-school.html |title=Australian Students - Foundation Studies Program |accessdate=2011-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213022231/http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/index.php/programs/senior-high-school.html |archive-date=13 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nFSP students may start in January (Standard Program - 12 months), April (Accelerated Program - 8 months) or October (Accelerated Program - 8 months or Extended Program - 15 months).<ref name=FSP/>\n\n====Standard and Accelerated Foundation Studies Programs====\nThe Standard Foundation Studies Program commences in January and is completed in December. Students enrolled in Standard FSP study several of their subjects with Australian Year 12 High School students, e.g. physics, chemistry, biology, economics and others.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nThree courses are compulsory for all FSP students: \n:Language and Communication (4 hours per week - full course), \n:International Studies (2 hours - half course), and \n:Clear Thinking and Logic (2 hours - half course).<ref name=FSP/>\n\n*Students undertaking the Standard FSP (or Stage 2 of the Extended FSP) must take at least three electives from any of the five streams of specialisation. The five streams of specialisation are: \n**Business (Accounting, Economics), \n**Humanities (Australian and International Politics, Environmental Studies, Modern History), \n**Health Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics), \n**Engineering (Additional Mathematics, Mathematics, Physics) and \n**Science (Additional Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology). \n*Students taking the Accelerated FSP (starting in April) must choose at least three electives from the Science, Business, Health Sciences and Engineering streams and Environmental Studies. \n*Students taking the Accelerated FSP (starting in September) must take at least three elective courses from the Engineering and Business streams only. \nStudents attend four hours per week for each elective course.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nAn Accelerated FSP commences in April and ends in December. The Standard and Accelerated programs both lead to the February intake of university. In addition, an Accelerated FSP commencing in September prepares students for mid-year (July) entry to university. The Accelerated FSP is ideally suited to students with above average academic and language skills. The Accelerated courses mostly cover the same content as the Standard FSP, but some applications of theory may be omitted.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nStudent assessments for Standard and Accelerated FSP are based on work completed throughout the year and on a final examination held at the end of the course. Each full course is marked out of 100 and the marks of the two half courses (50 each) are added together and counted as one full course. An aggregate score out of 500 is calculated. For students taking three electives this is a simple addition of all marks. Students must achieve a score of 60% or more in Language and Communication, and 275 overall to be considered for admission, subject to specific degree entry scores and quotas. This provides a base score for consideration for entry to Australian universities.<ref name=FSP/>\n\n====Extended Foundation Studies Program====\nThe Extended FSP is suitable for students who require some additional language development and/or revision in key academic areas. The Extended Program is 4 terms (15 months) in duration. Students take some of the first term (13 weeks) in separate classes specifically designed for Extended Foundation students with a focus on key competencies, skills and content essential for success at Foundation level. During this term, students take three 10-week Core courses (compulsory) and the equivalent of two 10-week Elective courses.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nThe following courses are compulsory: Language and Study Skills, An Introduction to Communication and Critical Thinking, Mathematics. Students select the equivalent of two full courses from the following introductory areas: An Introduction to Biological Sciences (Biology, Chemistry), An Introduction to the Pure Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Additional Mathematics) and An Introduction to International Business (Accounting, Economics).<ref name=FSP/>\n\nIn January, successful Extended Program students join students from the Standard Foundation Studies Program and are integrated into classes with Australian and International Year 12 students for several Elective courses.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nAssessment is conducted in two stages. The first stage is the assessment of Term 1 courses (as listed above). The assessment of Term 2 \u2013 5 courses as per the Standard Foundation Studies Program is the second stage of evaluation. Assessment at both stages is based on 50% continuous assessment and 50% for final examinations. Results in the first stage are used to assess successful transition to the second stage. They are not used for the final assessment in the second stage or transition to university.<ref name=FSP/>\n\n==Scholarships==\nEynesbury offers the equivalent of 6-8 full-time enrolments as scholarships (typically broken down into 2 x 100%, 4 x 50% and 8 x 25%). These scholarships are generally intended for students entering Year 10 or 11 and remain in force for an entire academic career at Eynesbury. Offers are based on an aptitude test, a 200-300 word personal statement, past academic and community achievement in addition to an interview with the principal. The scholarship selection process takes place twice per year in Term 1 and Term 3. Official dates are published in the local press, the Eynesbury website and its newsletter, Eynesbury Times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/index.php/education/scholarships- |title=Scholarships |accessdate=2015-01-13 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Schools|South Australia}}}}\n* [[List of schools in South Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110220010805/http://www.eibt.sa.edu.au/ Eynesbury Institute of Business and Technology website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101121150322/http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/ Eynesbury International website]\n\n[[Category:Private secondary schools in Adelaide]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1989]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:South Australian Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Italianate architecture in Australia]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1881]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEynesbury House:+SAHR", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eynesbury_Senior_College"}

It is expected to be the second-most noble metal in the periodic system, behind only its neighbour copernicium; its predicted first ionisation energy of 1020&nbsp;kJ/mol almost matches that of the [[noble gas]] [[radon]] at 1037&nbsp;kJ/mol.<ref name=Haire/> Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 11 elements, roentgenium is predicted to show stable +5 and +3 oxidation states, with a less stable +1 state.

The spin-orbit interactions stabilize molecular roentgenium compounds with more bonding 6d electrons; for example, {{chem|RgF|6|-}} is expected to be more stable than {{chem|RgF|4|-}}, which is expected to be more stable than {{chem|RgF|2|-}}.<ref name=Haire/> The stability of {{chem|RgF|6|-}} is homologous to that of {{chem|AuF|6|-}}; the silver analogue {{chem|AgF|6|-}} is unknown and is expected to be only marginally stable to decomposition to {{chem|AgF|4|-}} and F<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, Rg<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub> is expected to be stable to decomposition, exactly analogous to the Au<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, whereas Ag<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub> should be unstable to decomposition to Ag<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>. [[Gold heptafluoride]], AuF<sub>7</sub>, is known as a gold(V) difluorine complex AuF<sub>5</sub>\u00b7F<sub>2</sub>, which is lower in energy than a true gold(VII) heptafluoride would be; RgF<sub>7</sub> is instead calculated to be more stable as a true roentgenium(VII) heptafluoride, although it would be somewhat unstable, its decomposition to Rg<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> releasing a small amount of energy at room temperature.<ref name=hepta/> Roentgenium(I) is expected to be difficult to obtain.<ref name=Haire/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seth |first1=M. |last2=Cooke |first2=F. |last3=Schwerdtfeger |first3=P. |last4=Heully |first4=J.-L. |last5=Pelissier |first5=M. |date=1998 |journal=J.

Due to [[spin-orbit coupling]] between the d electrons, this state is split into a pair of energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d<sup>9</sup>7s<sup>2</sup> level is stabilized to such an extent that it becomes the ground state and the 6d<sup>10</sup>7s<sup>1</sup> level becomes the first excited state.

The spin-orbit interactions stabilize molecular roentgenium compounds with more bonding 6d electrons; for example, {{chem|RgF|6|-}} is expected to be more stable than {{chem|RgF|4|-}}, which is expected to be more stable than {{chem|RgF|2|-}}.<ref name=Haire/> The stability of {{chem|RgF|6|-}} is homologous to that of {{chem|AuF|6|-}}; the silver analogue {{chem|AgF|6|-}} is unknown and is expected to be only marginally stable to decomposition to {{chem|AgF|4|-}} and F<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, Rg<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub> is expected to be stable to decomposition, exactly analogous to the Au<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, whereas Ag<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub> should be unstable to decomposition to Ag<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>. [[Gold heptafluoride]], AuF<sub>7</sub>, is known as a gold(V) difluorine complex AuF<sub>5</sub>\u00b7F<sub>2</sub>, which is lower in energy than a true gold(VII) heptafluoride would be; RgF<sub>7</sub> is instead calculated to be more stable as a true roentgenium(VII) heptafluoride, although it would be somewhat unstable, its decomposition to Rg<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> releasing a small amount of energy at room temperature.<ref name=hepta/> Roentgenium(I) is expected to be difficult to obtain.<ref name=Haire/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seth |first1=M. |last2=Cooke |first2=F. |last3=Schwerdtfeger |first3=P. |last4=Heully |first4=J.-L. |last5=Pelissier |first5=M. |date=1998 |journal=J.

It is also expected to form Rg(I) complexes with [[ammonia]], [[phosphine]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]].<ref name=Hancock/>\n\n===Physical and atomic===\nRoentgenium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the [[body-centered cubic]] structure, unlike its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] which crystallize in the [[face-centered cubic]] structure, due to its being expected to have different electron charge densities from them.<ref name=bcc/> It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 28.7&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of only 22.61&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. This results from roentgenium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough roentgenium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.<ref name=Haire/>\n\nThe stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, all have an outer electron configuration nd<sup>10</sup>(n+1)s<sup>1</sup>. For each of these elements, the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration nd<sup>9</sup>(n+1)s<sup>2</sup>. Due to [[spin-orbit coupling]] between the d electrons, this state is split into a pair of energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d<sup>9</sup>7s<sup>2</sup> level is stabilized to such an extent that it becomes the ground state and the 6d<sup>10</sup>7s<sup>1</sup> level becomes the first excited state. The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance.<ref name=\"e-conf\"/> The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 138&nbsp;pm.<ref name=Haire/>\n\n==Experimental chemistry==\nUnambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of roentgenium has yet to have been established<ref name=\"D\u00fcllmann\">{{cite journal |last1=D\u00fcllmann |first1=Christoph E. |date=2012 |title=Superheavy elements at GSI: a broad research program with element 114 in the focus of physics and chemistry |journal=Radiochimica Acta |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=67\u201374 |doi=10.1524/ract.2011.1842 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59737a9f23da79d23b104c0abfcb9ef0021b8c44 }}</ref> due to the low yields of reactions that produce roentgenium isotopes.<ref name=Haire/> For chemical studies to be carried out on a [[transactinide element|transactinide]], at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1&nbsp;second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week.<ref name=\"DoiX\"/> Even though the half-life of <sup>282</sup>Rg, the most stable confirmed roentgenium isotope, is 100&nbsp;seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of roentgenium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the roentgenium isotopes and allow automated systems to experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of roentgenium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements. However, the experimental chemistry of roentgenium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from [[copernicium]] to [[livermorium]],<ref name=Haire/><ref name=\"D\u00fcllmann\"/><ref name=Eichler>{{cite journal |last=Eichler |first=Robert |date=2013 |title=First foot prints of chemistry on the shore of the Island of Superheavy Elements |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=420 |issue=1 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/420/1/012003 |pages=012003|arxiv=1212.4292 |bibcode=2013JPhCS.420a2003E }}</ref> despite early interest in theoretical predictions due to relativistic effects on the ''n''s subshell in group 11 reaching a maximum at roentgenium.<ref name=Haire/> The isotopes <sup>280</sup>Rg and <sup>281</sup>Rg are promising for chemical experimentation and may be produced as the granddaughters of the [[moscovium]] isotopes <sup>288</sup>Mc and <sup>289</sup>Mc respectively;<ref name=Moody>{{cite book |chapter=Synthesis of Superheavy Elements |last1=Moody |first1=Ken |editor1-first=Matthias |editor1-last=Sch\u00e4del |editor2-first=Dawn |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |edition=2nd |pages=24\u20138 |isbn=9783642374661|date=2013-11-30 }}</ref> their parents are the [[nihonium]] isotopes <sup>284</sup>Nh and <sup>285</sup>Nh, which have already received preliminary chemical investigations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aksenov |first1=Nikolay V. |last2=Steinegger |first2=Patrick |first3=Farid Sh. |last3=Abdullin |first4=Yury V. |last4=Albin |first5=Gospodin A. |last5=Bozhikov |first6=Viktor I. |last6=Chepigin |first7=Robert |last7=Eichler |first8=Vyacheslav Ya. |last8=Lebedev |first9=Alexander Sh. |last9=Mamudarov |first10=Oleg N. |last10=Malyshev |first11=Oleg V. |last11=Petrushkin |first12=Alexander N. |last12=Polyakov |first13=Yury A. |last13=Popov |first14=Alexey V. |last14=Sabel'nikov |first15=Roman N. |last15=Sagaidak |first16=Igor V. |last16=Shirokovsky |first17=Maksim V. |last17=Shumeiko |first18=Gennadii Ya. |last18=Starodub |first19=Yuri S. |last19=Tsyganov |first20=Vladimir K. |last20=Utyonkov |first21=Alexey A. |last21=Voinov |first22=Grigory K. |last22=Vostokin |first23=Alexander |last23=Yeremin |first24=Sergey N. |last24=Dmitriev |date=July 2017 |title=On the volatility of nihonium (Nh, Z = 113) |journal=The European Physical Journal A |volume=53 |issue=158 |pages=158 |doi=10.1140/epja/i2017-12348-8|bibcode=2017EPJA...53..158A |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5a07c41dfd0fc2913510dc843a5bc9a506bc92d4 }}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{cite journal |title=The NUBASE2016 evaluation of nuclear properties |doi=10.1088/1674-1137/41/3/030001 |last1=Audi |first1=G. |last2=Kondev |first2=F.
