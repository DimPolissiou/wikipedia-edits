Henry acquired an increasing role in England's government due to the king's declining health, but disagreements between father and son led to political conflict between the two.

His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415) and saw him come close to conquering France. Taking advantage of political divisions within France, he conquered large portions of the kingdom, resulting in [[Normandy]]'s occupation by the English for the first time since 1345\u20131360. After months of negotiation with [[Charles VI of France]], the [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) recognised Henry V as regent and [[heir apparent]] to the French throne, and he was subsequently married to Charles's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]]. Everything seemed to point to the formation of a [[Dual monarchy of England and France|union between the kingdoms]], [[Personal union|in the person]] of Henry. However, he died two years later and was succeeded by his only child, the infant [[King Henry VI]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry was born in the tower above the gatehouse of [[Monmouth Castle]] in [[Wales]], and for that reason was sometimes called Henry of Monmouth.<ref>{{cite web |last=Allmand |date=23 September 2010 |first=C. |title=Henry V (1386\u20131422) |url=https://archive.is/klEKs |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |type=online |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12952 |ref=harv }}</ref> He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke (later [[Henry IV of England]]) and [[Mary de Bohun]].

Then, as a result of the king's ill health, Henry began to take a wider share in politics. From January 1410, helped by his uncles Henry Beaufort and [[Thomas Beaufort]], legitimised sons of John of Gaunt, he had practical control of the government.<ref name=EB1911/> Both in foreign and domestic policy he differed from the king, who discharged his son from the council in November 1411. The quarrel of father and son was political only, though it is probable that the Beauforts had discussed the abdication of Henry IV. Their opponents certainly endeavoured to defame Prince Henry.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Supposed riotous youth===\nIt may be that the tradition of Henry's riotous youth, immortalised by [[Shakespeare]], is partly due to political enmity. Henry's record of involvement in war and politics, even in his youth, disproves this tradition. The most famous incident, his quarrel with the chief justice, has no contemporary authority and was first related by Sir [[Thomas Elyot]] in 1531.<ref name=EB1911/><ref name= \"Weis1998\">{{Cite book| last= Weis| first= Ren\u00e9| title= Henry IV, part 2| year= 1998| publisher= Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, England | isbn = 0-19-283143-7 | page =27|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>\n\nThe story of [[Falstaff]] originated in Henry's early friendship with Sir [[John Oldcastle]], a supporter of the [[Lollards]]. Shakespeare's Falstaff was originally named \"Oldcastle\", following his main source, ''[[The Famous Victories of Henry V]]''. His descendants objected and the name was changed (the character became a composite of several real persons, including Sir [[John Fastolf]]). That friendship, and the prince's political opposition to [[Thomas Arundel]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], perhaps encouraged Lollard hopes. If so, their disappointment may account for the statements of ecclesiastical writers like [[Thomas Walsingham]] that Henry on becoming king was suddenly changed into a new man.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Patterson| first= Annabel| editor1-last = Hamilton | editor1-first = Donna | editor2-last = Strier | editor2-first = Richard| title= Religion, literature, and politics in post-Reformation England, 1540\u20131688| year= 1996| publisher= Cambridge University Press| location= Cambridge, England| isbn= 0-521-47456-6| pages= 8\u201312| chapter= Sir John Oldcastle and Reformation histiography}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Reign==\n===Accession===\nAfter Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at [[Westminster Abbey]].

A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by [[ecclesiastical]] statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles. This story seems to have no foundation. Old commercial disputes and the support the French had lent to Owain Glynd\u0175r were used as an excuse for war, while the disordered state of France afforded no security for peace.<ref name=EB1911/> The French king, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], was prone to mental illness; at times he thought he was made of glass, and [[Louis, Duke of Guyenne|his eldest surviving son]] was an unpromising prospect. However, it was [[English claims to the French throne|the old dynastic claim to the throne of France]], first pursued by [[Edward III of England]], that justified war with France in English opinion.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Agincourt]], [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], then [[King of Hungary]] and later [[Holy Roman Emperor]], made a visit to Henry in hopes of making peace between England and France. His goal was to persuade Henry to modify his demands against the French. Henry lavishly entertained the emperor and even had him enrolled in the [[Order of the Garter]].

Despite his men-at-arms being exhausted, outnumbered and malnourished, Henry led his men into battle, decisively [[Battle of Agincourt|defeating the French]], who suffered severe losses. It is often argued that the French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, and that this hindered the French advance, allowing them to be sitting targets for the flanking English and Welsh archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. Nevertheless, the victory is seen as Henry's greatest, ranking alongside the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and the [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356) as the greatest English victories of the Hundred Years' War.\n\nDuring the battle,<ref>{{Cite book| last= Hibbert| first= Christopher| authorlink= Christopher Hibbert| title= Agincourt| year= 1964| publisher= Batsford| location= London| page= 114| chapter = During the battle| oclc = 460624273}}</ref> Henry ordered that the French prisoners taken during the battle be put to death, including some of the most illustrious who could have been used for ransom.  Cambridge historian Brett Tingley posits that Henry was concerned that the prisoners might turn on their captors when the English were busy repelling a third wave of enemy troops, thus jeopardising a hard-fought victory.\n\nThe victorious conclusion of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, was only the first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that he felt belonged to the English crown. Agincourt also held out the promise that Henry's pretensions to the French throne might be realised.\n\n=====Diplomacy and command of the sea=====\nCommand of the sea was secured by driving the [[Genoa|Genoese]] allies of the French out of the [[English Channel]].<ref name=EB1911/> While Henry was occupied with peace negotiations in 1416, a French and Genoese fleet surrounded the harbour at the English-garrisoned Harfleur. A French land force also besieged the town. To relieve Harfleur, Henry sent his brother, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]], [[Duke of Bedford]], who raised a fleet and set sail from [[Beachy Head]] on 14 August. The Franco-Genoese fleet was defeated the following day after a gruelling seven-hour battle and Harfleur was relieved. Diplomacy successfully detached [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Sigismund]] from France and the [[Treaty of Canterbury (1416)|Treaty of Canterbury]] in 1416 paved the way to end the [[Western Schism]] in the Church.\n\n=====1417\u201320 campaign=====\n[[File:Marriage of henry and Catherine.jpg|thumb|Late 15th-century depiction of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]]. [[British Library]], London.]]\n\nWith those two potential enemies gone, and after two years of patient preparation following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry renewed the war on a larger scale in 1417. After [[Siege of Caen (1417)|taking Caen]], Lower [[Normandy]] was quickly conquered and [[Rouen]] was cut off from Paris and besieged. [[Siege of Rouen|This siege]] cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king than his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. Rouen, starving and unable to support the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the [[Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War|disputes]] between [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] and [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]]. Henry skilfully played them off one against the other without relaxing his warlike approach.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn January 1419, Rouen fell.<ref name=EB1911/> Those Norman French who had resisted were severely punished: [[Alain Blanchard]], who had hanged English prisoners from the walls of Rouen, was summarily executed; Robert de Livet, [[Rouen Cathedral|Canon of Rouen]], who had excommunicated the English king, was packed off to England and imprisoned for five years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kingsford |date=1901 |first=C. |title=Henry V: The Typical Medi\u00e6val Hero |url=https://archive.org/details/henryvtypicalmed00kinguoft |publisher=GP Putnam's Sons |authorlink=Charles Lethbridge Kingsford |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\nBy August, the English were outside the walls of [[Paris]]. The intrigues of the French parties culminated in the [[assassination of John the Fearless]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], by the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'s partisans at [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne|Montereau]] on 10 September. [[Philip the Good]], the new duke, and the French court threw themselves into Henry's arms. After six months of negotiation, the [[Treaty of Troyes]] recognised Henry as the heir and regent of France (see [[English Kings of France]]),<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |last=Kingsford |first=C. |display=Henry V (1387\u20131422) |volume=13 |wstitle=Henry V. of England |authorlink=Charles Lethbridge Kingsford<!-- |editorlink=Hugh Chisholm--> |mode=cs2 |inline=1}}</ref> and on 2 June 1420 at [[Troyes Cathedral]], he married [[Catherine of Valois]], the French king's daughter. They had only one son, Henry, born on 6 December 1421 at [[Windsor Castle]]. From June to July 1420, Henry's army besieged and took the military fortress castle at Montereau-Fault-Yonne close to Paris. He besieged and captured [[Melun]] in November 1420, returning to England shortly thereafter. In 1428, Charles VII retook Montereau-Fault-Yonne, to once again see the English take it over within a short time. Finally, on 10 October 1437, Charles VII was victorious in regaining Montereau-Fault-Yonne.\n\n=====1421 campaign=====\nWhile he was in England, Henry's brother [[Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence]], led the English forces in France. On 22 March 1421, Thomas led the English to a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] against a Franco-Scottish army. The duke was killed in the battle. On 10 June, Henry sailed back to France to retrieve the situation. It would be his last military campaign. From July to August, Henry's forces besieged and captured [[Dreux]], thus relieving allied forces at [[Chartres]]. On 6 October, his forces [[Siege of Meaux|laid siege]] to [[Meaux]], capturing it on 11 May 1422.\n\n==Death==\nHenry V died suddenly on 31 August 1422, at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]].

Henry acquired an increasing role in England's government due to the king's declining health, but disagreements between father and son led to political conflict between the two. After his father's death in 1413, Henry assumed control of the country and asserted the pending [[English claim to the French throne]].\n\nIn 1415, [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|Henry embarked on war with France]] in the ongoing Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between the two nations. His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415) and saw him come close to conquering France. Taking advantage of political divisions within France, he conquered large portions of the kingdom, resulting in [[Normandy]]'s occupation by the English for the first time since 1345\u20131360. After months of negotiation with [[Charles VI of France]], the [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) recognised Henry V as regent and [[heir apparent]] to the French throne, and he was subsequently married to Charles's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]]. Everything seemed to point to the formation of a [[Dual monarchy of England and France|union between the kingdoms]], [[Personal union|in the person]] of Henry. However, he died two years later and was succeeded by his only child, the infant [[King Henry VI]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry was born in the tower above the gatehouse of [[Monmouth Castle]] in [[Wales]], and for that reason was sometimes called Henry of Monmouth.<ref>{{cite web |last=Allmand |date=23 September 2010 |first=C. |title=Henry V (1386\u20131422) |url=https://archive.is/klEKs |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |type=online |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12952 |ref=harv }}</ref> He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke (later [[Henry IV of England]]) and [[Mary de Bohun]].

Their opponents certainly endeavoured to defame Prince Henry.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Supposed riotous youth===\nIt may be that the tradition of Henry's riotous youth, immortalised by [[Shakespeare]], is partly due to political enmity. Henry's record of involvement in war and politics, even in his youth, disproves this tradition.

His descendants objected and the name was changed (the character became a composite of several real persons, including Sir [[John Fastolf]]). That friendship, and the prince's political opposition to [[Thomas Arundel]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], perhaps encouraged Lollard hopes. If so, their disappointment may account for the statements of ecclesiastical writers like [[Thomas Walsingham]] that Henry on becoming king was suddenly changed into a new man.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Patterson| first= Annabel| editor1-last = Hamilton | editor1-first = Donna | editor2-last = Strier | editor2-first = Richard| title= Religion, literature, and politics in post-Reformation England, 1540\u20131688| year= 1996| publisher= Cambridge University Press| location= Cambridge, England| isbn= 0-521-47456-6| pages= 8\u201312| chapter= Sir John Oldcastle and Reformation histiography}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Reign==\n===Accession===\nAfter Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at [[Westminster Abbey]].

A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by [[ecclesiastical]] statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles.

It is often argued that the French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, and that this hindered the French advance, allowing them to be sitting targets for the flanking English and Welsh archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. Nevertheless, the victory is seen as Henry's greatest, ranking alongside the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and the [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356) as the greatest English victories of the Hundred Years' War.\n\nDuring the battle,<ref>{{Cite book| last= Hibbert| first= Christopher| authorlink= Christopher Hibbert| title= Agincourt| year= 1964| publisher= Batsford| location= London| page= 114| chapter = During the battle| oclc = 460624273}}</ref> Henry ordered that the French prisoners taken during the battle be put to death, including some of the most illustrious who could have been used for ransom.  Cambridge historian Brett Tingley posits that Henry was concerned that the prisoners might turn on their captors when the English were busy repelling a third wave of enemy troops, thus jeopardising a hard-fought victory.\n\nThe victorious conclusion of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, was only the first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that he felt belonged to the English crown. Agincourt also held out the promise that Henry's pretensions to the French throne might be realised.\n\n=====Diplomacy and command of the sea=====\nCommand of the sea was secured by driving the [[Genoa|Genoese]] allies of the French out of the [[English Channel]].<ref name=EB1911/> While Henry was occupied with peace negotiations in 1416, a French and Genoese fleet surrounded the harbour at the English-garrisoned Harfleur. A French land force also besieged the town. To relieve Harfleur, Henry sent his brother, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]], [[Duke of Bedford]], who raised a fleet and set sail from [[Beachy Head]] on 14 August. The Franco-Genoese fleet was defeated the following day after a gruelling seven-hour battle and Harfleur was relieved. Diplomacy successfully detached [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Sigismund]] from France and the [[Treaty of Canterbury (1416)|Treaty of Canterbury]] in 1416 paved the way to end the [[Western Schism]] in the Church.\n\n=====1417\u201320 campaign=====\n[[File:Marriage of henry and Catherine.jpg|thumb|Late 15th-century depiction of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]]. [[British Library]], London.]]\n\nWith those two potential enemies gone, and after two years of patient preparation following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry renewed the war on a larger scale in 1417. After [[Siege of Caen (1417)|taking Caen]], Lower [[Normandy]] was quickly conquered and [[Rouen]] was cut off from Paris and besieged. [[Siege of Rouen|This siege]] cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king than his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. Rouen, starving and unable to support the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the [[Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War|disputes]] between [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] and [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]]. Henry skilfully played them off one against the other without relaxing his warlike approach.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn January 1419, Rouen fell.<ref name=EB1911/> Those Norman French who had resisted were severely punished: [[Alain Blanchard]], who had hanged English prisoners from the walls of Rouen, was summarily executed; Robert de Livet, [[Rouen Cathedral|Canon of Rouen]], who had excommunicated the English king, was packed off to England and imprisoned for five years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kingsford |date=1901 |first=C. |title=Henry V: The Typical Medi\u00e6val Hero |url=https://archive.org/details/henryvtypicalmed00kinguoft |publisher=GP Putnam's Sons |authorlink=Charles Lethbridge Kingsford |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\nBy August, the English were outside the walls of [[Paris]]. The intrigues of the French parties culminated in the [[assassination of John the Fearless]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], by the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'s partisans at [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne|Montereau]] on 10 September. [[Philip the Good]], the new duke, and the French court threw themselves into Henry's arms. After six months of negotiation, the [[Treaty of Troyes]] recognised Henry as the heir and regent of France (see [[English Kings of France]]),<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |last=Kingsford |first=C. |display=Henry V (1387\u20131422) |volume=13 |wstitle=Henry V. of England |authorlink=Charles Lethbridge Kingsford<!-- |editorlink=Hugh Chisholm--> |mode=cs2 |inline=1}}</ref> and on 2 June 1420 at [[Troyes Cathedral]], he married [[Catherine of Valois]], the French king's daughter. They had only one son, Henry, born on 6 December 1421 at [[Windsor Castle]]. From June to July 1420, Henry's army besieged and took the military fortress castle at Montereau-Fault-Yonne close to Paris. He besieged and captured [[Melun]] in November 1420, returning to England shortly thereafter. In 1428, Charles VII retook Montereau-Fault-Yonne, to once again see the English take it over within a short time. Finally, on 10 October 1437, Charles VII was victorious in regaining Montereau-Fault-Yonne.\n\n=====1421 campaign=====\nWhile he was in England, Henry's brother [[Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence]], led the English forces in France. On 22 March 1421, Thomas led the English to a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] against a Franco-Scottish army. The duke was killed in the battle. On 10 June, Henry sailed back to France to retrieve the situation. It would be his last military campaign. From July to August, Henry's forces besieged and captured [[Dreux]], thus relieving allied forces at [[Chartres]]. On 6 October, his forces [[Siege of Meaux|laid siege]] to [[Meaux]], capturing it on 11 May 1422.\n\n==Death==\nHenry V died suddenly on 31 August 1422, at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]]. He was thought to have died from [[dysentery]],<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/henry_v_king.shtml Henry V (c. 1387\u20131422). BBC]</ref> supposedly contracted during the [[siege of Meaux]]. However, a severe and lethal contraction of dysentery would have probably incapacitated him long before the end of August. Another plausible cause of death is [[heatstroke]]; the last day he was active he had been riding in full armour in blistering heat.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castor |first1=Helen |title=Joan of Arc |date=2015 |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn=9780571284634}}</ref>  He was 35 years old and had reigned for nine years.\n\nShortly before his death, Henry V named his brother, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]], regent of France in the name of his son, [[Henry VI of England]], then only a few months old. Henry V did not live to be crowned King of France himself, as he might confidently have expected after the Treaty of Troyes, because the sickly Charles VI, to whom he had been named heir, survived him by two months.\n\nHenry's comrade-in-arms and [[Lord Steward]], [[John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley]], brought Henry's body back to England and bore the [[royal standard]] at his funeral.<ref>{{Citation | last = Wilson | first = Derek | year = 2005 | title = The Uncrowned Kings of England: The Black History of the Dudleys and the Tudor Throne | publisher = Carroll & Graf | isbn = 0-7867-1469-7}}.</ref> Henry V was buried in Westminster Abbey on 7 November 1422.

The non-zero elements are shown in black.]]\n\nIn [[numerical analysis]] and [[scientific computing]], a '''sparse matrix''' or '''sparse array''' is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] in which most of the elements are zero. By contrast, if most of the elements are nonzero, then the matrix is considered '''dense'''. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m \u00d7 n for an m \u00d7 n matrix) is called the '''sparsity''' of the matrix (which is equal to 1 minus the '''density''' of the matrix). Using those definitions, a matrix will be sparse when its sparsity is greater than 0.5.\n\nConceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions. Consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next: this is a sparse system as only adjacent balls are coupled. By contrast, if the same line of balls had springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in [[combinatorics]] and application areas such as [[network theory]], which have a low density of significant data or connections.\n\nLarge sparse matrices often appear in [[scientific]] or [[engineering]] applications when solving [[partial differential equation]]s.\n\nWhen storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a [[computer]], it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized [[algorithm]]s and [[data structure]]s that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix. Specialized computers have been made for sparse matrices,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005148/en/Cerebras-Systems-Unveils-Industry%E2%80%99s-Trillion-Transistor-Chip|title=Cerebras Systems Unveils the Industry\u2019s First Trillion Transistor Chip|quote=The WSE contains 400,000 AI-optimized compute cores.

Sparse data is by nature more easily [[data compression|compressed]] and thus requires significantly less [[computer data storage|storage]]. Some very large sparse matrices are infeasible to manipulate using standard dense-matrix algorithms.\n\n=={{anchor|storage}} Storing a sparse matrix==\n\nA matrix is typically stored as a two-dimensional array. Each entry in the array represents an element {{math|''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} of the matrix and is accessed by the two [[Array data structure|indices]] {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}}. Conventionally, {{math|''i''}} is the row index, numbered from top to bottom, and {{math|''j''}} is the column index, numbered from left to right. For an {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, the amount of memory required to store the matrix in this format is proportional to {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} (disregarding the fact that the dimensions of the matrix also need to be stored).\n\nIn the case of a sparse matrix, substantial memory requirement reductions can be realized by storing only the non-zero entries. Depending on the number and distribution of the non-zero entries, different data structures can be used and yield huge savings in memory when compared to the basic approach. The trade-off is that accessing the individual elements becomes more complex and additional structures are needed to be able to recover the original matrix unambiguously.\n\nFormats can be divided into two groups:\n\n* Those that support efficient modification, such as DOK (Dictionary of keys), LIL (List of lists), or COO (Coordinate list). These are typically used to construct the matrices.\n* Those that support efficient access and matrix operations, such as CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) or CSC (Compressed Sparse Column).\n\n===Dictionary of keys (DOK)===\n\nDOK consists of a [[associative array|dictionary]] that maps {{math|(row, column)}}-[[ordered pair|pairs]] to the value of the elements. Elements that are missing from the dictionary are taken to be zero. The format is good for incrementally constructing a sparse matrix in random order, but poor for iterating over non-zero values in lexicographical order. One typically constructs a matrix in this format and then converts to another more efficient format for processing.<ref>See [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.dok_matrix.html <code>scipy.sparse.dok_matrix</code>]</ref>\n\n===List of lists (LIL)===\n\nLIL stores one list per row, with each entry containing the column index and the value. Typically, these entries are kept sorted by column index for faster lookup. This is another format good for incremental matrix construction.<ref>See [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.lil_matrix.html <code>scipy.sparse.lil_matrix</code>]</ref>\n\n===Coordinate list (COO)===\n\nCOO stores a list of {{math|(row, column, value)}} tuples. Ideally, the entries are sorted first by row index and then by column index, to improve random access times. This is another format that is good for incremental matrix construction.<ref>See [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.html <code>scipy.sparse.coo_matrix</code>]</ref>\n\n===Compressed sparse row (CSR, CRS or Yale format)===\n\nThe ''compressed sparse row'' (CSR) or ''compressed row storage'' (CRS) or Yale format represents a matrix {{math|'''M'''}} by three (one-dimensional) arrays, that respectively contain nonzero values, the extents of rows, and column indices. It is similar to COO, but compresses the row indices, hence the name. This format allows fast row access and matrix-vector multiplications ({{math|'''M'''''x''}}). The CSR format has been in use since at least the mid-1960s, with the first complete description appearing in 1967.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=Ayd\u0131n |last1=Bulu\u00e7 |first2=Jeremy T. |last2=Fineman |first3=Matteo |last3=Frigo |first4=John R. |last4=Gilbert |first5=Charles E. |last5=Leiserson |authorlink5=Charles E. Leiserson |title=Parallel sparse matrix-vector and matrix-transpose-vector multiplication using compressed sparse blocks |year=2009 |conference=ACM Symp. on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures |url=http://gauss.cs.ucsb.edu/~aydin/csb2009.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.211.5256}}</ref>\n\nThe CSR format stores a sparse {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix {{math|'''M'''}} in row form using three (one-dimensional) arrays {{math|(V, COL_INDEX, ROW_INDEX)}}. Let {{math|NNZ}} denote the number of nonzero entries in {{math|'''M'''}}. (Note that [[Zero-based numbering|zero-based indices]] shall be used here.)\n\n* The arrays {{math|V}} and {{math|COL_INDEX}} are of length {{math|NNZ}}, and contain the non-zero values and the column indices of those values respectively.\n\n* The array {{math|ROW_INDEX}} has one element per row in the matrix and encodes the index in {{math|V}} where the given row starts. (It may contain an extra end element which is set to NNZ).\n\nFor example, the matrix\n:: <math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n5 & 8 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 6 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nis a {{math|4 \u00d7 4}} matrix with 4 nonzero elements, hence\n\n    V         = [ 5 8 3 6 ]\n    COL_INDEX = [ 0 1 2 1 ]\n    ROW_INDEX = [ 0 0 2 3 4 ]\n\nTo extract a row, we first define:\n\n    row_start = ROW_INDEX[row]\n    row_end = ROW_INDEX[row + 1]\n\nThen we take slices from V and COL_INDEX starting at row_start and ending at row_end.\n\nTo extract the row 1 (the second row) of this matrix we set <code>row_start=0</code> and <code>row_end=2</code>. Then we make the slices <code>V[0:2] = [5, 8]</code> and <code>COL_INDEX[0:2] = [0, 1]</code>. We now know that in row 1 we have two elements at columns 0 and 1 with values 5 and 8.\n\nIn this case the CSR representation contains 13 entries, compared to 16 in the original matrix. The CSR format saves on memory only when {{math|NNZ < (''m'' (''n'' \u2212 1) \u2212 1) / 2}}.\nAnother example, the matrix\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n10 & 20 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n 0 & 30 &  0 & 40 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n 0 &  0 & 50 & 60 & 70 &  0 \\\\\n 0 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 & 80 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nis a {{math|4 \u00d7 6}} matrix (24 entries) with 8 nonzero elements, so\n\n    V         = [ 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 ]\n    COL_INDEX = [  0  1  1  3  2  3  4  5 ]   \n    ROW_INDEX = [  0  2  4  7  8 ]\n\n\nThe whole is stored as 21 entries.\n\n* {{math|ROW_INDEX}} splits the array {{math|V}} into rows: <code>(10, 20) (30, 40) (50, 60, 70) (80)</code>;\n* {{math|COL_INDEX}} aligns values in columns: <code>(10, 20, ...) (0, 30, 0, 40, ...)(0, 0, 50, 60, 70, 0) (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 80)</code>.\n\nNote that in this format, the first value of {{math|ROW_INDEX}} is always zero and the last is always {{math|NNZ}}, so they are in some sense redundant (although in programming languages where the array length needs to be explicitly stored, {{math|NNZ}} would not be redundant). Nonetheless, this does avoid the need to handle an exceptional case when computing the length of each row, as it guarantees the formula {{math|ROW_INDEX[''i'' + 1] \u2212 ROW_INDEX[''i'']}} works for any row {{math|''i''}}. Moreover, the memory cost of this redundant storage is likely insignificant for a sufficiently large matrix.\n\nThe (old and new) Yale sparse matrix formats are instances of the CSR scheme. The old Yale format works exactly as described above, with three arrays; the new format combines {{math|ROW_INDEX}} and {{math|COL_INDEX}} into a single array and handles the diagonal of the matrix separately.<ref>{{citation |title=Sparse Matrix Multiplication Package (SMMP) |first1=Randolph E. |last1=Bank |first2=Craig C. |last2=Douglas |journal=Advances in Computational Mathematics |volume=1 |year=1993 |url=http://www.mgnet.org/~douglas/Preprints/pub0034.pdf}}</ref>\n\nFor [[Logical matrix | logical]] [[Adjacency matrix | adjacency matrices]], the data array can be omitted, as the existence of an entry in the row array is sufficient to model a binary adjacency relation.\n\nIt is likely known as the Yale format because it was proposed in the 1977 Yale Sparse Matrix Package report from Department of Computer Science at Yale University.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a047724.pdf |title=Yale Sparse Matrix Package |last=Eisenstat  |first=S.

H. |date=April 1977 |language=English |access-date=6 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Compressed sparse column (CSC or CCS)===\n\n[http://netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/node92.html#SECTION00931200000000000000 CSC] is similar to CSR except that values are read first by column, a row index is stored for each value, and column pointers are stored. For example, CSC is {{math|(val, row_ind, col_ptr)}}, where {{math|val}} is an array of the (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) non-zero values of the matrix; {{math|row_ind}} is the row indices corresponding to the values; and, {{math|col_ptr}} is the list of {{math|val}} indexes where each column starts. The name is based on the fact that column index information is compressed relative to the COO format. One typically uses another format (LIL, DOK, COO) for construction. This format is efficient for arithmetic operations, column slicing, and matrix-vector products.  See [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csc_matrix.html scipy.sparse.csc_matrix].\nThis is the traditional format for specifying a sparse matrix in MATLAB (via the [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sparse.html <code>sparse</code>] function).\n\n==Special structure==\n\n===Banded===\n{{main article|Band matrix}}\nAn important special type of sparse matrices is [[band matrix]], defined as follows. The [[lower bandwidth of a matrix]] {{math|'''A'''}} is the smallest number {{math|''p''}} such that the entry {{math|''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} vanishes whenever {{math|''i'' > ''j'' + ''p''}}. Similarly, the [[Band matrix#upper bandwidth|upper bandwidth]] is the smallest number {{math|''p''}} such that {{math|''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> {{=}} 0}} whenever {{math|''i'' < ''j'' \u2212 ''p''}} {{harv|Golub|Van Loan|1996|loc=\u00a71.2.1}}. For example, a [[tridiagonal matrix]] has lower bandwidth {{math|1}} and upper bandwidth {{math|1}}. As another example, the following sparse matrix has lower and upper bandwidth both equal to 3. Notice that zeros are represented with dots for clarity.\n::<math>\n\\left(\n\\begin{smallmatrix}\n  X   &   X   &   X   & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\\\\n  X   &   X   & \\cdot &   X   &   X   & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\\\\n  X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\\\\n\\cdot &   X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot & \\\\\n\\cdot &   X   &   X   & \\cdot &   X   &   X   &   X   & \\\\\n\\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot &   X   &   X   &   X   & \\cdot & \\\\      \n\\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\\\              \n\\end{smallmatrix}\n\\right)\n</math>\n\nMatrices with reasonably small upper and lower bandwidth are known as band matrices and often lend themselves to simpler algorithms than general sparse matrices; or one can sometimes apply dense matrix algorithms and gain efficiency simply by looping over a reduced number of indices.\n\nBy rearranging the rows and columns of a matrix {{math|'''A'''}} it may be possible to obtain a matrix {{math|'''A'''\u2032}} with a lower bandwidth. A number of algorithms are designed for [[Graph bandwidth|bandwidth minimization]].\n\n===Diagonal===\nA very efficient structure for an extreme case of band matrices, the [[diagonal matrix]], is to store just the entries in the [[main diagonal]] as a [[one-dimensional array]], so a diagonal {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix requires only {{math|''n''}} entries.\n\n===Symmetric===\nA symmetric sparse matrix arises as the [[adjacency matrix]] of an [[undirected graph]]; it can be stored efficiently as an [[adjacency list]].\n\n===Block diagonal===\nA [[block-diagonal matrix]] consists of sub-matrices along its diagonal blocks. A block-diagonal matrix '''A''' has the form\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} \n  \\mathbf{A}_1 & 0             & \\cdots & 0            \\\\\n  0            & \\mathbf{A}_2  & \\cdots & 0            \\\\\n  \\vdots       & \\vdots        & \\ddots & \\vdots       \\\\\n  0            & 0             & \\cdots & \\mathbf{A}_n\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nwhere '''A'''<sub>''k''</sub> is a square matrix for all ''k'' = 1, ..., ''n''.\n\n==Reducing fill-in==\n\nThe ''fill-in'' of a matrix are those entries that change from an initial zero to a non-zero value during the execution of an algorithm. To reduce the memory requirements and the number of arithmetic operations used during an algorithm, it is useful to minimize the fill-in by switching rows and columns in the matrix. The [[symbolic Cholesky decomposition]] can be used to calculate the worst possible fill-in before doing the actual [[Cholesky decomposition]].\n\nThere are other methods than the [[Cholesky decomposition]] in use. Orthogonalization methods (such as QR factorization) are common, for example, when solving problems by least squares methods. While the theoretical fill-in is still the same, in practical terms the \"false non-zeros\" can be different for different methods. And symbolic versions of those algorithms can be used in the same manner as the symbolic Cholesky to compute worst case fill-in.\n\n==Solving sparse matrix equations==\n\nBoth [[Iterative method|iterative]] and direct methods exist for sparse matrix solving.\n\nIterative methods, such as [[conjugate gradient]] method and [[GMRES]] utilize fast computations of matrix-vector products <math>Ax_i</math>, where matrix <math>A</math> is sparse. The use of [[preconditioner]]s can significantly accelerate convergence of such iterative methods.\n\n==Software==\n\nMany software libraries support sparse matrices, and provide solvers for sparse matrix equations. The following are open-source:\n* [http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html SuiteSparse], a suite of sparse matrix algorithms, geared toward the direct solution of sparse linear systems.\n* [[Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation|PETSc]], a large C library, containing many different matrix solvers for a variety of matrix storage formats.\n* [[Trilinos]], a large C++ library, with sub-libraries dedicated to the storage of dense and sparse matrices and solution of corresponding linear systems.\n* [[Eigen (C++ library)|Eigen3]] is a C++ library that contains several sparse matrix solvers.

The non-zero elements are shown in black.]]\n\nIn [[numerical analysis]] and [[scientific computing]], a '''sparse matrix''' or '''sparse array''' is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] in which most of the elements are zero. By contrast, if most of the elements are nonzero, then the matrix is considered '''dense'''. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m \u00d7 n for an m \u00d7 n matrix) is called the '''sparsity''' of the matrix (which is equal to 1 minus the '''density''' of the matrix). Using those definitions, a matrix will be sparse when its sparsity is greater than 0.5.\n\nConceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions. Consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next: this is a sparse system as only adjacent balls are coupled. By contrast, if the same line of balls had springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in [[combinatorics]] and application areas such as [[network theory]], which have a low density of significant data or connections.\n\nLarge sparse matrices often appear in [[scientific]] or [[engineering]] applications when solving [[partial differential equation]]s.\n\nWhen storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a [[computer]], it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized [[algorithm]]s and [[data structure]]s that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix. Specialized computers have been made for sparse matrices,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005148/en/Cerebras-Systems-Unveils-Industry%E2%80%99s-Trillion-Transistor-Chip|title=Cerebras Systems Unveils the Industry\u2019s First Trillion Transistor Chip|quote=The WSE contains 400,000 AI-optimized compute cores.

Sparse data is by nature more easily [[data compression|compressed]] and thus requires significantly less [[computer data storage|storage]]. Some very large sparse matrices are infeasible to manipulate using standard dense-matrix algorithms.\n\n=={{anchor|storage}} Storing a sparse matrix==\n\nA matrix is typically stored as a two-dimensional array. Each entry in the array represents an element {{math|''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} of the matrix and is accessed by the two [[Array data structure|indices]] {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}}. Conventionally, {{math|''i''}} is the row index, numbered from top to bottom, and {{math|''j''}} is the column index, numbered from left to right. For an {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, the amount of memory required to store the matrix in this format is proportional to {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} (disregarding the fact that the dimensions of the matrix also need to be stored).\n\nIn the case of a sparse matrix, substantial memory requirement reductions can be realized by storing only the non-zero entries. Depending on the number and distribution of the non-zero entries, different data structures can be used and yield huge savings in memory when compared to the basic approach. The trade-off is that accessing the individual elements becomes more complex and additional structures are needed to be able to recover the original matrix unambiguously.\n\nFormats can be divided into two groups:\n\n* Those that support efficient modification, such as DOK (Dictionary of keys), LIL (List of lists), or COO (Coordinate list). These are typically used to construct the matrices.\n* Those that support efficient access and matrix operations, such as CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) or CSC (Compressed Sparse Column).\n\n===Dictionary of keys (DOK)===\n\nDOK consists of a [[associative array|dictionary]] that maps {{math|(row, column)}}-[[ordered pair|pairs]] to the value of the elements. Elements that are missing from the dictionary are taken to be zero. The format is good for incrementally constructing a sparse matrix in random order, but poor for iterating over non-zero values in lexicographical order. One typically constructs a matrix in this format and then converts to another more efficient format for processing.<ref>See [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.dok_matrix.html <code>scipy.sparse.dok_matrix</code>]</ref>\n\n===List of lists (LIL)===\n\nLIL stores one list per row, with each entry containing the column index and the value. Typically, these entries are kept sorted by column index for faster lookup. This is another format good for incremental matrix construction.<ref>See [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.lil_matrix.html <code>scipy.sparse.lil_matrix</code>]</ref>\n\n===Coordinate list (COO)===\n\nCOO stores a list of {{math|(row, column, value)}} tuples. Ideally, the entries are sorted first by row index and then by column index, to improve random access times. This is another format that is good for incremental matrix construction.<ref>See [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.html <code>scipy.sparse.coo_matrix</code>]</ref>\n\n===Compressed sparse row (CSR, CRS or Yale format)===\n\nThe ''compressed sparse row'' (CSR) or ''compressed row storage'' (CRS) or Yale format represents a matrix {{math|'''M'''}} by three (one-dimensional) arrays, that respectively contain nonzero values, the extents of rows, and column indices. It is similar to COO, but compresses the row indices, hence the name. This format allows fast row access and matrix-vector multiplications ({{math|'''M'''''x''}}). The CSR format has been in use since at least the mid-1960s, with the first complete description appearing in 1967.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=Ayd\u0131n |last1=Bulu\u00e7 |first2=Jeremy T. |last2=Fineman |first3=Matteo |last3=Frigo |first4=John R. |last4=Gilbert |first5=Charles E. |last5=Leiserson |authorlink5=Charles E. Leiserson |title=Parallel sparse matrix-vector and matrix-transpose-vector multiplication using compressed sparse blocks |year=2009 |conference=ACM Symp. on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures |url=http://gauss.cs.ucsb.edu/~aydin/csb2009.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.211.5256}}</ref>\n\nThe CSR format stores a sparse {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix {{math|'''M'''}} in row form using three (one-dimensional) arrays {{math|(V, COL_INDEX, ROW_INDEX)}}. Let {{math|NNZ}} denote the number of nonzero entries in {{math|'''M'''}}. (Note that [[Zero-based numbering|zero-based indices]] shall be used here.)\n\n* The arrays {{math|V}} and {{math|COL_INDEX}} are of length {{math|NNZ}}, and contain the non-zero values and the column indices of those values respectively.\n\n* The array {{math|ROW_INDEX}} has one element per row in the matrix and encodes the index in {{math|V}} where the given row starts. (It may contain an extra end element which is set to NNZ).\n\nFor example, the matrix\n:: <math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n5 & 8 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 6 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nis a {{math|4 \u00d7 4}} matrix with 4 nonzero elements, hence\n\n    V         = [ 5 8 3 6 ]\n    COL_INDEX = [ 0 1 2 1 ]\n    ROW_INDEX = [ 0 0 2 3 4 ]\n\nTo extract a row, we first define:\n\n    row_start = ROW_INDEX[row]\n    row_end = ROW_INDEX[row + 1]\n\nThen we take slices from V and COL_INDEX starting at row_start and ending at row_end.\n\nTo extract the row 1 (the second row) of this matrix we set <code>row_start=0</code> and <code>row_end=2</code>. Then we make the slices <code>V[0:2] = [5, 8]</code> and <code>COL_INDEX[0:2] = [0, 1]</code>. We now know that in row 1 we have two elements at columns 0 and 1 with values 5 and 8.\n\nIn this case the CSR representation contains 13 entries, compared to 16 in the original matrix. The CSR format saves on memory only when {{math|NNZ < (''m'' (''n'' \u2212 1) \u2212 1) / 2}}.\nAnother example, the matrix\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n10 & 20 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n 0 & 30 &  0 & 40 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n 0 &  0 & 50 & 60 & 70 &  0 \\\\\n 0 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 & 80 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nis a {{math|4 \u00d7 6}} matrix (24 entries) with 8 nonzero elements, so\n\n    V         = [ 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 ]\n    COL_INDEX = [  0  1  1  3  2  3  4  5 ]   \n    ROW_INDEX = [  0  2  4  7  8 ]\n\n\nThe whole is stored as 21 entries.\n\n* {{math|ROW_INDEX}} splits the array {{math|V}} into rows: <code>(10, 20) (30, 40) (50, 60, 70) (80)</code>;\n* {{math|COL_INDEX}} aligns values in columns: <code>(10, 20, ...) (0, 30, 0, 40, ...)(0, 0, 50, 60, 70, 0) (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 80)</code>.\n\nNote that in this format, the first value of {{math|ROW_INDEX}} is always zero and the last is always {{math|NNZ}}, so they are in some sense redundant (although in programming languages where the array length needs to be explicitly stored, {{math|NNZ}} would not be redundant). Nonetheless, this does avoid the need to handle an exceptional case when computing the length of each row, as it guarantees the formula {{math|ROW_INDEX[''i'' + 1] \u2212 ROW_INDEX[''i'']}} works for any row {{math|''i''}}. Moreover, the memory cost of this redundant storage is likely insignificant for a sufficiently large matrix.\n\nThe (old and new) Yale sparse matrix formats are instances of the CSR scheme. The old Yale format works exactly as described above, with three arrays; the new format combines {{math|ROW_INDEX}} and {{math|COL_INDEX}} into a single array and handles the diagonal of the matrix separately.<ref>{{citation |title=Sparse Matrix Multiplication Package (SMMP) |first1=Randolph E. |last1=Bank |first2=Craig C. |last2=Douglas |journal=Advances in Computational Mathematics |volume=1 |year=1993 |url=http://www.mgnet.org/~douglas/Preprints/pub0034.pdf}}</ref>\n\nFor [[Logical matrix | logical]] [[Adjacency matrix | adjacency matrices]], the data array can be omitted, as the existence of an entry in the row array is sufficient to model a binary adjacency relation.\n\nIt is likely known as the Yale format because it was proposed in the 1977 Yale Sparse Matrix Package report from Department of Computer Science at Yale University.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a047724.pdf |title=Yale Sparse Matrix Package |last=Eisenstat  |first=S.

H. |date=April 1977 |language=English |access-date=6 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Compressed sparse column (CSC or CCS)===\n\n[http://netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/node92.html#SECTION00931200000000000000 CSC] is similar to CSR except that values are read first by column, a row index is stored for each value, and column pointers are stored. For example, CSC is {{math|(val, row_ind, col_ptr)}}, where {{math|val}} is an array of the (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) non-zero values of the matrix; {{math|row_ind}} is the row indices corresponding to the values; and, {{math|col_ptr}} is the list of {{math|val}} indexes where each column starts. The name is based on the fact that column index information is compressed relative to the COO format. One typically uses another format (LIL, DOK, COO) for construction. This format is efficient for arithmetic operations, column slicing, and matrix-vector products.  See [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csc_matrix.html scipy.sparse.csc_matrix].\nThis is the traditional format for specifying a sparse matrix in MATLAB (via the [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sparse.html <code>sparse</code>] function).\n\n==Special structure==\n\n===Banded===\n{{main article|Band matrix}}\nAn important special type of sparse matrices is [[band matrix]], defined as follows. The [[lower bandwidth of a matrix]] {{math|'''A'''}} is the smallest number {{math|''p''}} such that the entry {{math|''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} vanishes whenever {{math|''i'' > ''j'' + ''p''}}. Similarly, the [[Band matrix#upper bandwidth|upper bandwidth]] is the smallest number {{math|''p''}} such that {{math|''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> {{=}} 0}} whenever {{math|''i'' < ''j'' \u2212 ''p''}} {{harv|Golub|Van Loan|1996|loc=\u00a71.2.1}}. For example, a [[tridiagonal matrix]] has lower bandwidth {{math|1}} and upper bandwidth {{math|1}}. As another example, the following sparse matrix has lower and upper bandwidth both equal to 3. Notice that zeros are represented with dots for clarity.\n::<math>\n\\left(\n\\begin{smallmatrix}\n  X   &   X   &   X   & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\\\\n  X   &   X   & \\cdot &   X   &   X   & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\\\\n  X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\\\\n\\cdot &   X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot & \\\\\n\\cdot &   X   &   X   & \\cdot &   X   &   X   &   X   & \\\\\n\\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot &   X   &   X   &   X   & \\cdot & \\\\      \n\\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot &   X   & \\cdot &   X   & \\\\              \n\\end{smallmatrix}\n\\right)\n</math>\n\nMatrices with reasonably small upper and lower bandwidth are known as band matrices and often lend themselves to simpler algorithms than general sparse matrices; or one can sometimes apply dense matrix algorithms and gain efficiency simply by looping over a reduced number of indices.\n\nBy rearranging the rows and columns of a matrix {{math|'''A'''}} it may be possible to obtain a matrix {{math|'''A'''\u2032}} with a lower bandwidth. A number of algorithms are designed for [[Graph bandwidth|bandwidth minimization]].\n\n===Diagonal===\nA very efficient structure for an extreme case of band matrices, the [[diagonal matrix]], is to store just the entries in the [[main diagonal]] as a [[one-dimensional array]], so a diagonal {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix requires only {{math|''n''}} entries.\n\n===Symmetric===\nA symmetric sparse matrix arises as the [[adjacency matrix]] of an [[undirected graph]]; it can be stored efficiently as an [[adjacency list]].\n\n===Block diagonal===\nA [[block-diagonal matrix]] consists of sub-matrices along its diagonal blocks. A block-diagonal matrix '''A''' has the form\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} \n  \\mathbf{A}_1 & 0             & \\cdots & 0            \\\\\n  0            & \\mathbf{A}_2  & \\cdots & 0            \\\\\n  \\vdots       & \\vdots        & \\ddots & \\vdots       \\\\\n  0            & 0             & \\cdots & \\mathbf{A}_n\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nwhere '''A'''<sub>''k''</sub> is a square matrix for all ''k'' = 1, ..., ''n''.\n\n==Reducing fill-in==\n\nThe ''fill-in'' of a matrix are those entries that change from an initial zero to a non-zero value during the execution of an algorithm. To reduce the memory requirements and the number of arithmetic operations used during an algorithm, it is useful to minimize the fill-in by switching rows and columns in the matrix. The [[symbolic Cholesky decomposition]] can be used to calculate the worst possible fill-in before doing the actual [[Cholesky decomposition]].\n\nThere are other methods than the [[Cholesky decomposition]] in use. Orthogonalization methods (such as QR factorization) are common, for example, when solving problems by least squares methods. While the theoretical fill-in is still the same, in practical terms the \"false non-zeros\" can be different for different methods. And symbolic versions of those algorithms can be used in the same manner as the symbolic Cholesky to compute worst case fill-in.\n\n==Solving sparse matrix equations==\n\nBoth [[Iterative method|iterative]] and direct methods exist for sparse matrix solving.\n\nIterative methods, such as [[conjugate gradient]] method and [[GMRES]] utilize fast computations of matrix-vector products <math>Ax_i</math>, where matrix <math>A</math> is sparse. The use of [[preconditioner]]s can significantly accelerate convergence of such iterative methods.\n\n==Software==\n\nMany software libraries support sparse matrices, and provide solvers for sparse matrix equations. The following are open-source:\n* [http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html SuiteSparse], a suite of sparse matrix algorithms, geared toward the direct solution of sparse linear systems.\n* [[Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation|PETSc]], a large C library, containing many different matrix solvers for a variety of matrix storage formats.\n* [[Trilinos]], a large C++ library, with sub-libraries dedicated to the storage of dense and sparse matrices and solution of corresponding linear systems.\n* [[Eigen (C++ library)|Eigen3]] is a C++ library that contains several sparse matrix solvers.
