The L1A1 was produced under licence and has seen use in the [[Australian Army]], [[Canadian Army]], [[Indian Army]], [[Jamaica Defence Force]], [[Malaysian Army]], [[New Zealand Army]], [[Rhodesian Army]], [[Singapore Army]], [[South African Defence Force]] and the [[British Armed Forces]].<ref>''Small Arms Illustrated'', 2010</ref>\n\nThe original FAL was designed in Belgium, while the components of the \"inch-pattern\" FALs are manufactured to a slightly modified design using British [[imperial units]]. Many sub-assemblies are interchangeable between the two types, while components of those sub-assemblies may not be compatible. Notable incompatibilities include the magazines and the butt-stock, which attach in different ways. Most FALs also use SAE threads for barrels and assemblies.  The only exceptions are early prototype FALs, and the breech threads only on Israeli and Indian FALs. All others have standard Imperial or \"unified\" inch-standard threads throughout. \n\nMost Commonwealth pattern FALs are semi-automatic only. A variant named '''L2A1'''/C2A1 (C2), meant to serve as a [[light machine gun]] in a support role, is also capable of fully automatic fire. Differences from the L1A1/C1 include a heavy barrel, squared front sight (versus the \"V\" on the semi-automatic models), a [[handguard]] that doubles as a foldable [[bipod]], and a larger 30-round magazine although it could also use the normal 20-round magazines. Only Canada and Australia used this variant. However, Australia, the UK and New Zealand used [[Bren light machine gun]]s converted to fire the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] cartridge for use in the support role. Canadian C1s issued to naval and army personnel were also capable of fully automatic fire.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|FN FAL}}\n\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|British L1A1 field stripped]]\nThe L1A1 and other inch-pattern derivatives trace their lineage back to the Allied Rifle Commission of the 1950s, whose intention was to introduce a single rifle and cartridge that would serve as standard issue for all [[NATO]] countries. After briefly adopting the [[EM-2 rifle|Rifle No. 9 Mk 1]] with [[.280 British|a 7&nbsp;mm intermediate cartridge]], the UK, believing that, if they adopted the Belgian FAL and the American 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge, the United States would do the same,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} adopted the L1A1 as a standard issue rifle in 1954. The US, however, did not adopt any variant of the FAL, opting for its own [[M14 rifle]] instead.\n\nThe L1A1 subsequently served as the UK's first-line battle rifle up to the 1980s before being replaced by the 5.56mm [[L85A1]].\n\n===Combat service===\nThe L1A1 and variants have seen use in several conflicts, including as part of the [[Cold War]]. L1A1s have been used by the [[UK Armed Forces|British Armed Forces]] in [[Malayan Emergency|Malaysia]], [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland]], and in the [[Falklands War]] (in opposition to FN FAL-armed Argentine forces), the First [[Gulf War]] (where it was still on issue to some second line British Army units and RAF personnel not yet issued with the [[L85A1]]){{sfn|Rottman|1993|p=20}}, by the State of [[Kuwait]] Army during the First [[Gulf War]],<ref name =\"Gulf Rottman\">{{cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon L.|title=Armies of the Gulf War|date=23 May 1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-85532-277-6|page=53|ref=harv}}</ref> by Australia and New Zealand in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Vietnam War US & Allied Combat Equipments|series=Elite 216|first=Gordon L.|last= Rottman |date=26 Jan 2017|isbn=9781472819055|publisher=Osprey Publishing|ref=harv|page=11}}</ref> by [[Nigeria]]n and [[Biafra]]n forces during [[Nigerian Civil War]] and by Rhodesia{{cn|date=December 2019}} in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].\n\n===Replacement===\nStarting in the mid-1980s, the UK started replacing its 30-year-old L1A1 rifle with the [[5.56\u00d745mm|5.56 NATO]] [[bullpup]] design [[SA80|L85A1]] assault rifle. Australia chose the [[Steyr AUG]] as a replacement in the form of the F88 Austeyr, with New Zealand following suit shortly after. Canada replaced its C1 rifle with the [[AR-15]] variants: the [[Colt Canada C7|C7]] service rifle and C8 carbine. Australia replaced their L2A1 heavy barrel support weapons with M60's and later with an [[FN Minimi]] variant: the F89. Canada also replaced their C2 heavy barrel support weapons with an FN Minimi variant: the C9, respectively.\n\n==Production and use==\n===Australia===\n[[File:Australians OP Crimp Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Australian soldier with an L1A1, near the fighting zone of [[Operation Crimp]], Vietnam]]\n\nThe [[Australian Army]], as a late member of the Allied Rifle Committee along with the United Kingdom and Canada adopted the committee's improved version of the FAL rifle, designated the L1A1 rifle by Australia and Great Britain, and C1 by Canada. The Australian L1A1 is also known as the \"self-loading rifle\" (SLR), and in fully automatic form, the \"automatic rifle\" (AR). The Australian L1A1 features are almost identical to the British L1A1 version of FAL; however, the Australian L1A1 differs from its British counterpart in the design of the upper receiver lightening cuts. The lightening cuts of the Australian L1A1 most closely resembles the later Canadian C1 pattern, rather than the simplified and markedly unique British L1A1 cuts. The Australian L1A1 FAL rifle was in service with Australian forces until it was superseded by the [[F88 Austeyr]] (a licence-built version of the [[Steyr AUG]]) in 1988, though some remained in service with Reserve and training units until late 1990. Some Australian Army units deployed overseas on UN peacekeeping operations in Namibia, the Western Sahara, and Cambodia still used the L1A1 SLR and the [[M16 rifle|M16A1]] rifle throughout the early 1990s. The British and Australian L1A1s, and Canadian C1A1 SLRs were semi-automatic only, unless battlefield conditions mandated that modifications be made.\n\nAustralia, in co-ordination with Canada, developed a heavy-barrel version of the L1A1 as a fully automatic rifle variant, designated L2A1. The Australian heavy-barrel L2A1 was also known as the \"automatic rifle\" (AR). The L2A1 was similar to the FN FAL 50.41/42, but with a unique combined bipod-handguard and a receiver dust-cover mounted tangent rear sight from Canada. The L2A1 was intended to serve a role as a light fully automatic rifle or quasi-squad automatic weapon (SAW). The role of the L2A1 and other heavy barrel FAL variants is essentially the same in concept as the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR) or [[Bren]], but the Bren is far better suited to the role of a fire support base for a section, being designed for the role from the start. In practice many considered the L2A1 inferior to the Bren, as the Bren had a barrel that could be changed, and so could deliver a better continuous rate of fire, and was more accurate and controllable in the role due to its greater weight and better stock configuration. For this reason, Australia and Britain used the 7.62mm-converted L4 series Bren. Most countries that adopted the FAL rejected the heavy barrel FAL, presumably because it did not perform well in the machine gun role. Countries that did embrace the heavy barrel FAL included Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and Israel.\n\nUnique 30-round magazines were developed for the L2A1 rifles.<Ref name=\"TFBA\">https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/10/16/when-government-issue-wasnt-enough-the-australian-btch-variant-of-the-slr/</ref> These 30-round magazines were essentially lengthened versions of the standard 20-round L1A1 magazines, perfectly straight in design. Curved 30-round magazines from the L4A1 7.62 NATO conversion of the Bren are interchangeable with the 30-round L2A1 magazines, however they reputedly gave feeding difficulties due to the additional friction from the curved design as they must be inserted \"upside down\" in the L2A1. The L4A1 Bren magazines were developed as a top-mounted gravity-assisted feed magazine, the opposite of what is required for the L2A1 FAL. This was sometimes sorted out by stretching magazine springs.\n\nThe Australian L1A1/L2A1 rifles were produced by the [[Lithgow Small Arms Factory|Small Arms Factory \u2013 Lithgow]], with approximately 220,000 L1A1 rifles produced between 1959 and 1986. L2A1 production was approximately 10,000 rifles produced between 1962 and 1982. Lithgow exported a large number of L1A1 rifles to many countries in the region. Among the users were New Zealand, Singapore and Papua New Guinea.\n\n[[File:Australian Vietnam War Memorial - Roma Street Parkland, Brisbane - IMG40866.jpg|thumb|upright|left|L1A1 featured at the Australian Vietnamese War Memorial]]\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], the SLR was the standard weapon issued to Australian infantrymen.<ref>Palazzo (2011), p. 49.</ref> Many Australian soldiers preferred the larger calibre weapon over the American [[M16 rifle|M16]] because they felt that the SLR was more reliable and that they could trust the NATO 7.62 round to kill an enemy soldier outright. The Australians' jungle warfare tactics used in Vietnam were informed by their experience in earlier jungle conflicts (e.g., the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the [[Konfrontasi]] campaign in [[Borneo]]) and were considered far more threatening by their Viet Cong opponents than those employed by U.S. forces.<ref>Chanoff and Toai 1996, p. 108.</ref> The Australians considered the strengths and limitations of the SLR and its heavy ammunition load to be better suited to their tactical methods.\n\nAnother product of Australian participation in the conflict in South-East Asia was the field modification of L1A1 and L2A1 rifles by the [[Special Air Service Regiment]] for better handling. Nicknamed \"the Bitch\", these rifles were field modified, often from heavy barrel L2A1 automatic rifles, with their barrels cut off right in front of the gas blocks, and often with the L2A1 bipods removed to install [[XM148 grenade launcher|XM148]] 40&nbsp;mm grenade launchers mounted below the barrels.<Ref name=\"TFBA\"/> The XM148 40&nbsp;mm grenade launchers were obtained from U.S. forces.<Ref name=\"TFBA\"/> For the L1A1, the lack of fully automatic fire resulted in the unofficial conversion of the L1A1 to full-auto capability by using lower receivers from the L2A1, which works by restricting trigger movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://50ae.net/collection/stg58/ |title=FAL STG-58 - 7.62x51 |website=50AE.net |accessdate=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620073223/http://50ae.net/collection/stg58/ |archivedate=20 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAustralia produced a shortened version of the L1A1 designated the L1A1-F1.<ref name=\"LSM\">https://www.lithgowsafmuseum.org.au/milproduction.html</ref> It was intended for easier use by soldiers of smaller stature in jungle combat, as the standard L1A1 is a long, heavy weapon.

They were also issued to female staff cadets at the Royal Military College Duntroon and some other Australian personnel.\n\nIn 1970, a bullpup rifle known as the [[KAL1 general purpose infantry rifle]] was built at the Small Arms Factory Lithgow using parts from the L1A1 rifle. Another version of the rifle was also built in 1973.\n\n===Canada===\n{{quote|Canada adopted the FAL in 1954, the first country in the world to actually ante up and order enough rifles for meaningful troop trials.

Users could fold the trigger guard into the pistol grip, which allowed them to wear mitts when firing the weapon. The Canadian rifle also has a shorter receiver cover than other Commonwealth variants to allow for refilling the magazine by charging it with [[stripper clip]]s.

It served as Canada's standard battle rifle from the early 1950s to 1984, when it began to be phased out in favor of the lighter [[Diemaco C7]], a licence-built version of the [[M16 rifle|M16]], with a number of features borrowed from the A1, A2 and A3 variations of the AR platform assault rifle.\n\nThe Canadians also operated a fully automatic variant, the C2A1, as a section support weapon, which was very similar to the Australian L2A1. It was similar to the FN FAL 50.41/42, but with wooden attachments to the bipod legs that work as a handguard when the legs are folded. The C2A1 used a tangent rear sight attached to the receiver cover with ranges from 200 to 1000 metres. The C1 was equipped with a 20-round magazine and the C2 with a 30-round magazine, although the two were interchangeable. Variants of the initial C1 and the product improved C1A1 were also made for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], which were capable of automatic fire, under the designations C1D and C1A1D.<ref>Ezell, 1988, p. 83</ref> These weapons are identifiable by an ''A'' for \"automatic\", carved or stamped into the butt stock.<ref name=\"SR\"/> Boarding parties for domestic and international searches use the C1D.<ref name=\"SR\"/>\n\n===India===\n[[File:Amar Jawan Jyoti.jpg|thumb|1A1 rifle on top of [[Amar Jawan Jyoti]] memorial in [[New Delhi]], India.]]\n[[File:Guard with a Smile (14844468105).jpg|thumb|SLR with state armed police personnel in 2014]]\nThe '''Rifle 7.62&nbsp;mm 1A1''' which is also known as '''Ishapore 1A1''', is a copy of the UK L1A1 self-loading rifle.

The Labour government of Walter Nash approved the purchase of the L1A1 as a replacement for the No. 4 Mk 1 Lee\u2013Enfield bolt-action rifle in 1959.<ref name=\"NZPDF\">http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/downloads/pdf/force4nz/force4nz_issue5_feb16.pdf</ref> An order for a total of 15,000 L1A1 rifles was subsequently placed with the Lithgow Small Arms Factory in Australia which had been granted a license to produce the L1A1. However the first batch of 500 rifles from this order was not actually delivered to the New Zealand Army until 1960. Thereafter deliveries continued at an increasing pace until the order for all 15,000 rifles was completed in 1965. As with Australian soldiers, the L1A1 was the preferential rifle of New Zealand Army and NZSAS troops during the Vietnam War,<ref name=\"NZPDF\"/><ref>https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/photo/l1a1-self-loading-rifle</ref> over the American M16 during the Vietnam War as they used the same combat tactics as their Australian counterparts.{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=53}} After its adoption by the Army, the Royal New Zealand Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Navy also eventually acquired it. \n\nUnlike L1A1s in Australian service, New Zealand L1A1s later used British black plastic furniture, and some rifles even had a mixture of the two. The carrying handles were frequently cut off. The British SUIT (Sight Unit Infantry Trilux) optical sight was issued to some users in infantry units. The L2A1 heavy barrel variant was also issued as a limited standard, but was not popular due to the problems also encountered by other users of heavy barrel FAL variants. The L4A1 7.62mm conversion of the [[Bren]] was much-preferred in New Zealand service. \n\nThe [[New Zealand Defence Force]] began replacing the L1A1 with the [[Steyr AUG]] [[assault rifle]] in 1988 and were disposed through the Government Disposal Bureau in 1990.<ref>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2568883/Gunmans-stash-included-former-army-rifles</ref><ref>http://navymuseum.co.nz/firearms-in-the-rnzn/</ref> The Steyr AUG was phased out across all three services of the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] in 2016. The [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] still uses the L1A1 for line throwing between ships.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:British FN FAL small.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|L1A1 rifle]]\n\nThe United Kingdom produced its own variant of the FN FAL incorporating the modifications developed by the Allied Rifle Committee, designating it the L1A1 Self Loading Rifle (SLR). The weapons were manufactured by the [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] Enfield, [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|Birmingham Small Arms]], [[Royal Ordnance Factory]] and [[ROF Fazakerley]]. After the production run ceased, replacement components were made by [[Parker Hale]] Limited. The SLR served the [[British Armed Forces]] from 1954 until approximately 1994, being replaced by the [[SA80|L85A1]] from 1985 onwards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref>\n\nThe SLR was designed using [[Imperial units|Imperial measurements]] and included several changes from the standard FN FAL. A significant change from the original FAL was that the L1A1 operates in [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] mode only. Other changes include: the introduction of a folding [[cocking handle]]; an enclosed slotted [[flash suppressor]]; folding [[Iron sight|rear sight]]; sand-clearing modifications to the upper receiver, bolt and bolt carrier; folding [[trigger guard]] to allow use with Arctic mitts; strengthened [[Stock (firearm)|butt]]; enlarged [[safety (firearms)|change lever]] and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine release catch]]; vertical stripping catch to prevent unintended activation; deletion of the automatic hold-open device and the addition of retaining tabs at the rear of the top cover to prevent forward movement of the top cover (and resulting loss of zero) when the L2A1 SUIT was fitted. The flash suppressor is fitted with a [[Bayonet lug|lug]] which allows the fitting of an L1-series [[bayonet]], an L1A1/A2 or L6A1 blank firing attachment or an L1A1/A2 Energa [[rifle grenade]] launcher.\n\nInitial production rifles were fitted with walnut furniture, consisting of the pistol grip, forward handguard, carrying handle and butt.{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=15}} The wood was treated with oil to protect against moisture, but not varnished or polished. Later production weapons were produced with [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic]] furniture.{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=15}} The material used was Maranyl, a [[nylon 6-6]] and [[fiberglass]] composite. The Maranyl parts have a \"pebbled\" anti-slip texture along with a butt has a separate butt-pad, available in four lengths to allow the rifle to be fitted to individual users. There was also a special short butt designed for use with Arctic clothing or body armour, which incorporated fixing points for an Arctic chest sling system. After the introduction of the Maranyl furniture, as extra supplies became available it was retrofitted to older rifles as they underwent scheduled maintenance. However, this resulted in a mixture of wooden and Maranyl furniture within units and often on the same rifle. Wooden furniture was still in use in some [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] units and in limited numbers with the [[RAF]] until at least 1989.\n\nThe SLR [[safety (firearms)|selector]] has two settings (rather than the three that most metric FALs have), [[Safety (firearms)|safety]] and [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], which are marked ''S'' (safe) and ''R'' (repetition.)

[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] magazines were produced with a lug brazed onto the front to engage the recess in the receiver, in place of a smaller pressed dimple on the metric FAL magazine. As a consequence of this, metric FAL magazines can be used with the Commonwealth SLR, but SLR magazines will not fit the metric FAL.<ref name=\"Tilstra2014\">{{cite book |last=Tilstra |first=Russell C. |title=The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSYXAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33 |date=21 March 2014 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-7321-2 |page=33 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the British, Australian and Canadian versions of the FAL being manufactured using machine tools which utilised the Imperial measurement system, they are all of the same basic dimensions. Parts incompatibilities between the original FAL and the L1A1 are due to pattern differences, not due to the different dimensions. Confusions over the differences has given rise to the terminology of \"metric\" and \"inch\" FAL rifles, which originated as a reference to the machine tools which produced them. Despite this, virtually all FAL rifles are of the same basic dimensions, true to the original Belgian FN FAL. In the US, the term \"metric FAL\" refers to guns of the Belgian FAL pattern, whereas \"inch FAL\" refers to ones produced to the Commonwealth L1A1/C1 pattern.{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=13}}<ref>https://www.guns.com/news/2014/03/03/fn-fal-free-worlds-right-arm</ref>\n\n[[File:Century Arms FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Century Arms FN FAL rifle built from an L1A1 parts kit]]\n\nSLRs could be modified at unit level to take two additional sighting systems. The first was the \"[[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] sight,\" formally known as the \"Conversion Kit, 7.62mm Rifle Sight, Trilux, L5A1\" (L5A2 and L5A3 variants with different foresight inserts also existed) and intended for use in [[Close Quarters Battle|close range]] and in poor lighting conditions. The sight incorporated two rear sight aperture leaves and a [[Tritium illumination|permanently glowing tritium]] foresight insert for improved night visibility, which had to be replaced after a period of time due to [[radioactive decay]]. The first rear sight leaf had a 7&nbsp;mm aperture which could be used alone for night shooting or the second leaf could be raised in front of it, superimposing a 2&nbsp;mm aperture for day shooting.<ref>Army Code No 12258 (Revised 1977): User Handbook for Rifle, 7.62mm, L1A1 and 0.22-inch caliber, L12A1 Conversion Kit, 7.62mm Rifle</ref> The second sight was the [[L2A2 SUIT Sight|L2A1 \"Sight Unit, Infantry, Trilux\" (SUIT)]], a 4\u00d7 [[Telescopic sight|optical sight]] which mounted on a rail welded to a top cover.<ref name=\"SAR L1A1\"/> Issued to the British Infantry, Royal Marines and [[RAF Regiment]], the SUIT featured a prismatic offset design, which reduced the length of the sight and improved clearance around the [[Firearm action|action]]. Also, the SUIT helped to reduce [[parallax]] errors and [[Mirage|heat mirage]] from the barrel as it heated up during firing. The aiming mark was an inverted, tapered perspex pillar ending in a point which could be illuminated by a tritium element for use in low light conditions. The inverted sight post allowed rapid target [[Target acquisition|re-acquisition]] after the [[recoil]] of the firearm raised the muzzle. The scope was somewhat heavy, but due to its solid construction was durable and robust.<ref group=nb>During the [[Cold War]], the British SUIT was copied by the [[Soviet Union]] and designated the 1P29 telescopic sight.</ref>\n\nThe SLR was officially replaced in 1985 by the [[bullpup]] design [[SA80|L85A1]] service rifle, firing the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge. The armed forces were re-equipped by 1994 and during this period the L1A1 rifles were gradually phased out. Most were either destroyed or sold, with some going to Sierra Leone. Several thousand were sent to the US and sold as parts kits, and others were refurbished by LuxDefTec in Luxembourg and are still on sale to the European market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luxdeftec.lu |title=Luxembourg Defence Technologie |website=luxdeftec.lu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722155015/http://www.luxdeftec.lu/ |archivedate=22 July 2011 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:L1A1 DM-ST-91-12005.jpg|[[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] with a British L1A1 SLR, during a training exercise as part of the [[Gulf War]]'s [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]\nFile:DD-SD-00-01035.JPEG|Eight Malaysian soldiers with L1A1 rifles in their headquarters, near the airport in Mogadishu during [[Operation Restore Hope]]\nFile:L1A1 SLR1.jpg|A female soldier of the [[Rejimen Askar Wataniah]] with a L1A1 SLR, circa 1990s.\nFile:Voters at the polls - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|An Indian BSF soldier carrying a 7.62mm 1A1 rifle in [[West Bengal]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Conflicts==\nThe L1A1 self-loading rifle has been used in the following conflicts:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Malayan Emergency]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=34}}\n*[[Suez Crisis]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=34}}\n* [[Jebel Akhdar War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=36}}\n*[[Aden Emergency]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=36}}\n*[[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]]<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |last=McNab |first=Chris |title=20th Century Military Uniforms |year=2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|page=243}}</ref>\n*[[Congo Crisis]]<ref>{{cite book|title= Modern African Wars: The Congo 1960\u20132002|last= Abbot|first= Peter|location= Oxford|publisher= [[Osprey Publishing]]|date= February 2014|isbn= 978-1782000761|ref= harv|page= 44}}</ref>\n*[[Vietnam War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|pp=52-55}}\n*[[Dhofar Rebellion]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|pp=38-39}}\n*[[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=51}}\n*[[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968-89)|Communist insurgency in Malaysia]]\n*[[Cambodian Civil War]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n*[[The Troubles]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=40}}\n*[[Rhodesian Bush War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|pp=42-43}}\n*[[Biafran War]]\n*[[Bangladesh Liberation War]]<ref>{{cite news|date=29 December 2017 |title=Arms for freedom|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/bangladesh-liberation-war-1971-muktijuddho-guerrilla-fighter-arms-freedom-1511812|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n*[[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=51}}\n*[[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]<ref name=\"Afghan\"/>\n*[[Falklands War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=34}}\n*[[Sri Lankan Civil War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=51}}\n*[[1971 JVP insurrection|Sri Lankan 1971 Communist insurgency]]\n*[[1987\u20131989 JVP insurrection| Sri Lankan 1987-89 Communist insurgency]]\n*[[Bougainville Civil War]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2NCFQlsC-Y |title=The Real Mr. Pip Harry Baxter on Bougainville - 2 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Gulf War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=34}}\n*[[Sierra Leone Civil War]]<ref name=\"Sierra Leone\"/>\n*[[Nepalese Civil War]]<ref name=\"Survey\">{{cite web|title=Legacies of War in the Company of Peace: Firearms in Nepal |url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/G-Issue-briefs/NAVA-IB2-Legacies-of-War.pdf |location=Geneva |publisher=[[Small Arms Survey]] |date=May 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708052928/http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/G-Issue-briefs/NAVA-IB2-Legacies-of-War.pdf |archivedate= 8 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Kargil War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=51}}\n* [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=52}}\n*[[2013 Lahad Datu standoff]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n}}\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

The L1A1 was produced under licence and has seen use in the [[Australian Army]], [[Canadian Army]], [[Indian Army]], [[Jamaica Defence Force]], [[Malaysian Army]], [[New Zealand Army]], [[Rhodesian Army]], [[Singapore Army]], [[South African Defence Force]] and the [[British Armed Forces]].<ref>''Small Arms Illustrated'', 2010</ref>\n\nThe original FAL was designed in Belgium, while the components of the \"inch-pattern\" FALs are manufactured to a slightly modified design using British [[imperial units]]. Many sub-assemblies are interchangeable between the two types, while components of those sub-assemblies may not be compatible. Notable incompatibilities include the magazines and the butt-stock, which attach in different ways. Most FALs also use SAE threads for barrels and assemblies.  The only exceptions are early prototype FALs, and the breech threads only on Israeli and Indian FALs. All others have standard Imperial or \"unified\" inch-standard threads throughout. \n\nMost Commonwealth pattern FALs are semi-automatic only. A variant named '''L2A1'''/C2A1 (C2), meant to serve as a [[light machine gun]] in a support role, is also capable of fully automatic fire. Differences from the L1A1/C1 include a heavy barrel, squared front sight (versus the \"V\" on the semi-automatic models), a [[handguard]] that doubles as a foldable [[bipod]], and a larger 30-round magazine although it could also use the normal 20-round magazines. Only Canada and Australia used this variant. However, Australia, the UK and New Zealand used [[Bren light machine gun]]s converted to fire the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] cartridge for use in the support role. Canadian C1s issued to naval and army personnel were also capable of fully automatic fire.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|FN FAL}}\n\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|British L1A1 field stripped]]\nThe L1A1 and other inch-pattern derivatives trace their lineage back to the Allied Rifle Commission of the 1950s, whose intention was to introduce a single rifle and cartridge that would serve as standard issue for all [[NATO]] countries. After briefly adopting the [[EM-2 rifle|Rifle No. 9 Mk 1]] with [[.280 British|a 7&nbsp;mm intermediate cartridge]], the UK, believing that, if they adopted the Belgian FAL and the American 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge, the United States would do the same,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} adopted the L1A1 as a standard issue rifle in 1954. The US, however, did not adopt any variant of the FAL, opting for its own [[M14 rifle]] instead.\n\nThe L1A1 subsequently served as the UK's first-line battle rifle up to the 1980s before being replaced by the 5.56mm [[L85A1]].\n\n===Combat service===\nThe L1A1 and variants have seen use in several conflicts, including as part of the [[Cold War]]. L1A1s have been used by the [[UK Armed Forces|British Armed Forces]] in [[Malayan Emergency|Malaysia]], [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland]], and in the [[Falklands War]] (in opposition to FN FAL-armed Argentine forces), the First [[Gulf War]] (where it was still on issue to some second line British Army units and RAF personnel not yet issued with the [[L85A1]]){{sfn|Rottman|1993|p=20}}, by the State of [[Kuwait]] Army during the First [[Gulf War]],<ref name =\"Gulf Rottman\">{{cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon L.|title=Armies of the Gulf War|date=23 May 1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-85532-277-6|page=53|ref=harv}}</ref> by Australia and New Zealand in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Vietnam War US & Allied Combat Equipments|series=Elite 216|first=Gordon L.|last= Rottman |date=26 Jan 2017|isbn=9781472819055|publisher=Osprey Publishing|ref=harv|page=11}}</ref> by [[Nigeria]]n and [[Biafra]]n forces during [[Nigerian Civil War]] and by Rhodesia{{cn|date=December 2019}} in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].\n\n===Replacement===\nStarting in the mid-1980s, the UK started replacing its 30-year-old L1A1 rifle with the [[5.56\u00d745mm|5.56 NATO]] [[bullpup]] design [[SA80|L85A1]] assault rifle. Australia chose the [[Steyr AUG]] as a replacement in the form of the F88 Austeyr, with New Zealand following suit shortly after. Canada replaced its C1 rifle with the [[AR-15]] variants: the [[Colt Canada C7|C7]] service rifle and C8 carbine. Australia replaced their L2A1 heavy barrel support weapons with M60's and later with an [[FN Minimi]] variant: the F89. Canada also replaced their C2 heavy barrel support weapons with an FN Minimi variant: the C9, respectively.\n\n==Production and use==\n===Australia===\n[[File:Australians OP Crimp Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Australian soldier with an L1A1, near the fighting zone of [[Operation Crimp]], Vietnam]]\n\nThe [[Australian Army]], as a late member of the Allied Rifle Committee along with the United Kingdom and Canada adopted the committee's improved version of the FAL rifle, designated the L1A1 rifle by Australia and Great Britain, and C1 by Canada. The Australian L1A1 is also known as the \"self-loading rifle\" (SLR), and in fully automatic form, the \"automatic rifle\" (AR). The Australian L1A1 features are almost identical to the British L1A1 version of FAL; however, the Australian L1A1 differs from its British counterpart in the design of the upper receiver lightening cuts. The lightening cuts of the Australian L1A1 most closely resembles the later Canadian C1 pattern, rather than the simplified and markedly unique British L1A1 cuts. The Australian L1A1 FAL rifle was in service with Australian forces until it was superseded by the [[F88 Austeyr]] (a licence-built version of the [[Steyr AUG]]) in 1988, though some remained in service with Reserve and training units until late 1990. Some Australian Army units deployed overseas on UN peacekeeping operations in Namibia, the Western Sahara, and Cambodia still used the L1A1 SLR and the [[M16 rifle|M16A1]] rifle throughout the early 1990s. The British and Australian L1A1s, and Canadian C1A1 SLRs were semi-automatic only, unless battlefield conditions mandated that modifications be made.\n\nAustralia, in co-ordination with Canada, developed a heavy-barrel version of the L1A1 as a fully automatic rifle variant, designated L2A1. The Australian heavy-barrel L2A1 was also known as the \"automatic rifle\" (AR). The L2A1 was similar to the FN FAL 50.41/42, but with a unique combined bipod-handguard and a receiver dust-cover mounted tangent rear sight from Canada. The L2A1 was intended to serve a role as a light fully automatic rifle or quasi-squad automatic weapon (SAW). The role of the L2A1 and other heavy barrel FAL variants is essentially the same in concept as the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR) or [[Bren]], but the Bren is far better suited to the role of a fire support base for a section, being designed for the role from the start. In practice many considered the L2A1 inferior to the Bren, as the Bren had a barrel that could be changed, and so could deliver a better continuous rate of fire, and was more accurate and controllable in the role due to its greater weight and better stock configuration. For this reason, Australia and Britain used the 7.62mm-converted L4 series Bren. Most countries that adopted the FAL rejected the heavy barrel FAL, presumably because it did not perform well in the machine gun role. Countries that did embrace the heavy barrel FAL included Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and Israel.\n\nUnique 30-round magazines were developed for the L2A1 rifles.<Ref name=\"TFBA\">https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/10/16/when-government-issue-wasnt-enough-the-australian-btch-variant-of-the-slr/</ref> These 30-round magazines were essentially lengthened versions of the standard 20-round L1A1 magazines, perfectly straight in design. Curved 30-round magazines from the L4A1 7.62 NATO conversion of the Bren are interchangeable with the 30-round L2A1 magazines, however they reputedly gave feeding difficulties due to the additional friction from the curved design as they must be inserted \"upside down\" in the L2A1. The L4A1 Bren magazines were developed as a top-mounted gravity-assisted feed magazine, the opposite of what is required for the L2A1 FAL. This was sometimes sorted out by stretching magazine springs.\n\nThe Australian L1A1/L2A1 rifles were produced by the [[Lithgow Small Arms Factory|Small Arms Factory \u2013 Lithgow]], with approximately 220,000 L1A1 rifles produced between 1959 and 1986. L2A1 production was approximately 10,000 rifles produced between 1962 and 1982. Lithgow exported a large number of L1A1 rifles to many countries in the region. Among the users were New Zealand, Singapore and Papua New Guinea.\n\n[[File:Australian Vietnam War Memorial - Roma Street Parkland, Brisbane - IMG40866.jpg|thumb|upright|left|L1A1 featured at the Australian Vietnamese War Memorial]]\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], the SLR was the standard weapon issued to Australian infantrymen.<ref>Palazzo (2011), p. 49.</ref> Many Australian soldiers preferred the larger calibre weapon over the American [[M16 rifle|M16]] because they felt that the SLR was more reliable and that they could trust the NATO 7.62 round to kill an enemy soldier outright. The Australians' jungle warfare tactics used in Vietnam were informed by their experience in earlier jungle conflicts (e.g., the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the [[Konfrontasi]] campaign in [[Borneo]]) and were considered far more threatening by their Viet Cong opponents than those employed by U.S. forces.<ref>Chanoff and Toai 1996, p. 108.</ref> The Australians considered the strengths and limitations of the SLR and its heavy ammunition load to be better suited to their tactical methods.\n\nAnother product of Australian participation in the conflict in South-East Asia was the field modification of L1A1 and L2A1 rifles by the [[Special Air Service Regiment]] for better handling. Nicknamed \"the Bitch\", these rifles were field modified, often from heavy barrel L2A1 automatic rifles, with their barrels cut off right in front of the gas blocks, and often with the L2A1 bipods removed to install [[XM148 grenade launcher|XM148]] 40&nbsp;mm grenade launchers mounted below the barrels.<Ref name=\"TFBA\"/> The XM148 40&nbsp;mm grenade launchers were obtained from U.S. forces.<Ref name=\"TFBA\"/> For the L1A1, the lack of fully automatic fire resulted in the unofficial conversion of the L1A1 to full-auto capability by using lower receivers from the L2A1, which works by restricting trigger movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://50ae.net/collection/stg58/ |title=FAL STG-58 - 7.62x51 |website=50AE.net |accessdate=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620073223/http://50ae.net/collection/stg58/ |archivedate=20 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAustralia produced a shortened version of the L1A1 designated the L1A1-F1.<ref name=\"LSM\">https://www.lithgowsafmuseum.org.au/milproduction.html</ref> It was intended for easier use by soldiers of smaller stature in jungle combat, as the standard L1A1 is a long, heavy weapon. The reduction in length was achieved by installing the shortest butt length (there were three available, short, standard and long), and a flash suppressor that resembled the standard version except it projected a much smaller distance beyond the end of the rifling, and had correspondingly shorter flash eliminator slots.<ref name=\"Article\">http://www.1stbn83rdartyvietnam.com/Australia_New%20Zealand/FN-FAL-L1A1_Rifle.pdf</ref> The effect was to reduce the length of the weapon by 2 1/4&nbsp;inches.<ref name=\"Article\"/> Trials revealed that, despite no reduction in barrel length, accuracy was slightly reduced. The L1A1-F1 was provided to Papua New Guinea,<ref name=\"LSM\"/> and a number were sold to the Royal Hong Kong Police in 1984. They were also issued to female staff cadets at the Royal Military College Duntroon and some other Australian personnel.\n\nIn 1970, a bullpup rifle known as the [[KAL1 general purpose infantry rifle]] was built at the Small Arms Factory Lithgow using parts from the L1A1 rifle.

Users could fold the trigger guard into the pistol grip, which allowed them to wear mitts when firing the weapon. The Canadian rifle also has a shorter receiver cover than other Commonwealth variants to allow for refilling the magazine by charging it with [[stripper clip]]s. It was manufactured under license by the Canadian Arsenals Limited company.<ref name=\"SR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiansoldiers.com/weapons/rifles.htm |title=Service Rifles |website=Canadiansoldiers.com |date= |accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref> Canada was the first country to use the FAL. It served as Canada's standard battle rifle from the early 1950s to 1984, when it began to be phased out in favor of the lighter [[Diemaco C7]], a licence-built version of the [[M16 rifle|M16]], with a number of features borrowed from the A1, A2 and A3 variations of the AR platform assault rifle.\n\nThe Canadians also operated a fully automatic variant, the C2A1, as a section support weapon, which was very similar to the Australian L2A1. It was similar to the FN FAL 50.41/42, but with wooden attachments to the bipod legs that work as a handguard when the legs are folded. The C2A1 used a tangent rear sight attached to the receiver cover with ranges from 200 to 1000 metres. The C1 was equipped with a 20-round magazine and the C2 with a 30-round magazine, although the two were interchangeable. Variants of the initial C1 and the product improved C1A1 were also made for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], which were capable of automatic fire, under the designations C1D and C1A1D.<ref>Ezell, 1988, p. 83</ref> These weapons are identifiable by an ''A'' for \"automatic\", carved or stamped into the butt stock.<ref name=\"SR\"/> Boarding parties for domestic and international searches use the C1D.<ref name=\"SR\"/>\n\n===India===\n[[File:Amar Jawan Jyoti.jpg|thumb|1A1 rifle on top of [[Amar Jawan Jyoti]] memorial in [[New Delhi]], India.]]\n[[File:Guard with a Smile (14844468105).jpg|thumb|SLR with state armed police personnel in 2014]]\nThe '''Rifle 7.62&nbsp;mm 1A1''' which is also known as '''Ishapore 1A1''', is a copy of the UK L1A1 self-loading rifle.

The Labour government of Walter Nash approved the purchase of the L1A1 as a replacement for the No. 4 Mk 1 Lee\u2013Enfield bolt-action rifle in 1959.<ref name=\"NZPDF\">http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/downloads/pdf/force4nz/force4nz_issue5_feb16.pdf</ref> An order for a total of 15,000 L1A1 rifles was subsequently placed with the Lithgow Small Arms Factory in Australia which had been granted a license to produce the L1A1. However the first batch of 500 rifles from this order was not actually delivered to the New Zealand Army until 1960. Thereafter deliveries continued at an increasing pace until the order for all 15,000 rifles was completed in 1965. As with Australian soldiers, the L1A1 was the preferential rifle of New Zealand Army and NZSAS troops during the Vietnam War,<ref name=\"NZPDF\"/><ref>https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/photo/l1a1-self-loading-rifle</ref> over the American M16 during the Vietnam War as they used the same combat tactics as their Australian counterparts.{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=53}} After its adoption by the Army, the Royal New Zealand Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Navy also eventually acquired it. \n\nUnlike L1A1s in Australian service, New Zealand L1A1s later used British black plastic furniture, and some rifles even had a mixture of the two. The carrying handles were frequently cut off. The British SUIT (Sight Unit Infantry Trilux) optical sight was issued to some users in infantry units. The L2A1 heavy barrel variant was also issued as a limited standard, but was not popular due to the problems also encountered by other users of heavy barrel FAL variants. The L4A1 7.62mm conversion of the [[Bren]] was much-preferred in New Zealand service. \n\nThe [[New Zealand Defence Force]] began replacing the L1A1 with the [[Steyr AUG]] [[assault rifle]] in 1988 and were disposed through the Government Disposal Bureau in 1990.<ref>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2568883/Gunmans-stash-included-former-army-rifles</ref><ref>http://navymuseum.co.nz/firearms-in-the-rnzn/</ref> The Steyr AUG was phased out across all three services of the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] in 2016. The [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] still uses the L1A1 for line throwing between ships.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:British FN FAL small.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|L1A1 rifle]]\n\nThe United Kingdom produced its own variant of the FN FAL incorporating the modifications developed by the Allied Rifle Committee, designating it the L1A1 Self Loading Rifle (SLR). The weapons were manufactured by the [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] Enfield, [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|Birmingham Small Arms]], [[Royal Ordnance Factory]] and [[ROF Fazakerley]]. After the production run ceased, replacement components were made by [[Parker Hale]] Limited. The SLR served the [[British Armed Forces]] from 1954 until approximately 1994, being replaced by the [[SA80|L85A1]] from 1985 onwards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref>\n\nThe SLR was designed using [[Imperial units|Imperial measurements]] and included several changes from the standard FN FAL. A significant change from the original FAL was that the L1A1 operates in [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] mode only. Other changes include: the introduction of a folding [[cocking handle]]; an enclosed slotted [[flash suppressor]]; folding [[Iron sight|rear sight]]; sand-clearing modifications to the upper receiver, bolt and bolt carrier; folding [[trigger guard]] to allow use with Arctic mitts; strengthened [[Stock (firearm)|butt]]; enlarged [[safety (firearms)|change lever]] and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine release catch]]; vertical stripping catch to prevent unintended activation; deletion of the automatic hold-open device and the addition of retaining tabs at the rear of the top cover to prevent forward movement of the top cover (and resulting loss of zero) when the L2A1 SUIT was fitted. The flash suppressor is fitted with a [[Bayonet lug|lug]] which allows the fitting of an L1-series [[bayonet]], an L1A1/A2 or L6A1 blank firing attachment or an L1A1/A2 Energa [[rifle grenade]] launcher.\n\nInitial production rifles were fitted with walnut furniture, consisting of the pistol grip, forward handguard, carrying handle and butt.{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=15}} The wood was treated with oil to protect against moisture, but not varnished or polished. Later production weapons were produced with [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic]] furniture.{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=15}} The material used was Maranyl, a [[nylon 6-6]] and [[fiberglass]] composite. The Maranyl parts have a \"pebbled\" anti-slip texture along with a butt has a separate butt-pad, available in four lengths to allow the rifle to be fitted to individual users. There was also a special short butt designed for use with Arctic clothing or body armour, which incorporated fixing points for an Arctic chest sling system. After the introduction of the Maranyl furniture, as extra supplies became available it was retrofitted to older rifles as they underwent scheduled maintenance. However, this resulted in a mixture of wooden and Maranyl furniture within units and often on the same rifle. Wooden furniture was still in use in some [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] units and in limited numbers with the [[RAF]] until at least 1989.\n\nThe SLR [[safety (firearms)|selector]] has two settings (rather than the three that most metric FALs have), [[Safety (firearms)|safety]] and [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], which are marked ''S'' (safe) and ''R'' (repetition.) The magazine from the [[7.62 mm caliber|7.62 mm]] [[L4 light machine gun]] will fit the SLR;<ref name=\"SAR L1A1\">http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2642</ref> however, the L4 magazine was designed for gravity assisted downwards feeding, and can be unreliable with the upwards feeding system of the SLR. [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] magazines were produced with a lug brazed onto the front to engage the recess in the receiver, in place of a smaller pressed dimple on the metric FAL magazine. As a consequence of this, metric FAL magazines can be used with the Commonwealth SLR, but SLR magazines will not fit the metric FAL.<ref name=\"Tilstra2014\">{{cite book |last=Tilstra |first=Russell C. |title=The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSYXAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33 |date=21 March 2014 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-7321-2 |page=33 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the British, Australian and Canadian versions of the FAL being manufactured using machine tools which utilised the Imperial measurement system, they are all of the same basic dimensions. Parts incompatibilities between the original FAL and the L1A1 are due to pattern differences, not due to the different dimensions. Confusions over the differences has given rise to the terminology of \"metric\" and \"inch\" FAL rifles, which originated as a reference to the machine tools which produced them. Despite this, virtually all FAL rifles are of the same basic dimensions, true to the original Belgian FN FAL. In the US, the term \"metric FAL\" refers to guns of the Belgian FAL pattern, whereas \"inch FAL\" refers to ones produced to the Commonwealth L1A1/C1 pattern.{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=13}}<ref>https://www.guns.com/news/2014/03/03/fn-fal-free-worlds-right-arm</ref>\n\n[[File:Century Arms FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Century Arms FN FAL rifle built from an L1A1 parts kit]]\n\nSLRs could be modified at unit level to take two additional sighting systems. The first was the \"[[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] sight,\" formally known as the \"Conversion Kit, 7.62mm Rifle Sight, Trilux, L5A1\" (L5A2 and L5A3 variants with different foresight inserts also existed) and intended for use in [[Close Quarters Battle|close range]] and in poor lighting conditions. The sight incorporated two rear sight aperture leaves and a [[Tritium illumination|permanently glowing tritium]] foresight insert for improved night visibility, which had to be replaced after a period of time due to [[radioactive decay]]. The first rear sight leaf had a 7&nbsp;mm aperture which could be used alone for night shooting or the second leaf could be raised in front of it, superimposing a 2&nbsp;mm aperture for day shooting.<ref>Army Code No 12258 (Revised 1977): User Handbook for Rifle, 7.62mm, L1A1 and 0.22-inch caliber, L12A1 Conversion Kit, 7.62mm Rifle</ref> The second sight was the [[L2A2 SUIT Sight|L2A1 \"Sight Unit, Infantry, Trilux\" (SUIT)]], a 4\u00d7 [[Telescopic sight|optical sight]] which mounted on a rail welded to a top cover.<ref name=\"SAR L1A1\"/> Issued to the British Infantry, Royal Marines and [[RAF Regiment]], the SUIT featured a prismatic offset design, which reduced the length of the sight and improved clearance around the [[Firearm action|action]]. Also, the SUIT helped to reduce [[parallax]] errors and [[Mirage|heat mirage]] from the barrel as it heated up during firing. The aiming mark was an inverted, tapered perspex pillar ending in a point which could be illuminated by a tritium element for use in low light conditions. The inverted sight post allowed rapid target [[Target acquisition|re-acquisition]] after the [[recoil]] of the firearm raised the muzzle. The scope was somewhat heavy, but due to its solid construction was durable and robust.<ref group=nb>During the [[Cold War]], the British SUIT was copied by the [[Soviet Union]] and designated the 1P29 telescopic sight.</ref>\n\nThe SLR was officially replaced in 1985 by the [[bullpup]] design [[SA80|L85A1]] service rifle, firing the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge. The armed forces were re-equipped by 1994 and during this period the L1A1 rifles were gradually phased out. Most were either destroyed or sold, with some going to Sierra Leone. Several thousand were sent to the US and sold as parts kits, and others were refurbished by LuxDefTec in Luxembourg and are still on sale to the European market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luxdeftec.lu |title=Luxembourg Defence Technologie |website=luxdeftec.lu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722155015/http://www.luxdeftec.lu/ |archivedate=22 July 2011 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:L1A1 DM-ST-91-12005.jpg|[[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] with a British L1A1 SLR, during a training exercise as part of the [[Gulf War]]'s [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]\nFile:DD-SD-00-01035.JPEG|Eight Malaysian soldiers with L1A1 rifles in their headquarters, near the airport in Mogadishu during [[Operation Restore Hope]]\nFile:L1A1 SLR1.jpg|A female soldier of the [[Rejimen Askar Wataniah]] with a L1A1 SLR, circa 1990s.\nFile:Voters at the polls - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|An Indian BSF soldier carrying a 7.62mm 1A1 rifle in [[West Bengal]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Conflicts==\nThe L1A1 self-loading rifle has been used in the following conflicts:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Malayan Emergency]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=34}}\n*[[Suez Crisis]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=34}}\n* [[Jebel Akhdar War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=36}}\n*[[Aden Emergency]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=36}}\n*[[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]]<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |last=McNab |first=Chris |title=20th Century Military Uniforms |year=2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|page=243}}</ref>\n*[[Congo Crisis]]<ref>{{cite book|title= Modern African Wars: The Congo 1960\u20132002|last= Abbot|first= Peter|location= Oxford|publisher= [[Osprey Publishing]]|date= February 2014|isbn= 978-1782000761|ref= harv|page= 44}}</ref>\n*[[Vietnam War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|pp=52-55}}\n*[[Dhofar Rebellion]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|pp=38-39}}\n*[[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=51}}\n*[[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968-89)|Communist insurgency in Malaysia]]\n*[[Cambodian Civil War]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n*[[The Troubles]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=40}}\n*[[Rhodesian Bush War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|pp=42-43}}\n*[[Biafran War]]\n*[[Bangladesh Liberation War]]<ref>{{cite news|date=29 December 2017 |title=Arms for freedom|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/bangladesh-liberation-war-1971-muktijuddho-guerrilla-fighter-arms-freedom-1511812|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n*[[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=51}}\n*[[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]<ref name=\"Afghan\"/>\n*[[Falklands War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=34}}\n*[[Sri Lankan Civil War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=51}}\n*[[1971 JVP insurrection|Sri Lankan 1971 Communist insurgency]]\n*[[1987\u20131989 JVP insurrection| Sri Lankan 1987-89 Communist insurgency]]\n*[[Bougainville Civil War]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2NCFQlsC-Y |title=The Real Mr. Pip Harry Baxter on Bougainville - 2 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Gulf War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=34}}\n*[[Sierra Leone Civil War]]<ref name=\"Sierra Leone\"/>\n*[[Nepalese Civil War]]<ref name=\"Survey\">{{cite web|title=Legacies of War in the Company of Peace: Firearms in Nepal |url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/G-Issue-briefs/NAVA-IB2-Legacies-of-War.pdf |location=Geneva |publisher=[[Small Arms Survey]] |date=May 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708052928/http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/G-Issue-briefs/NAVA-IB2-Legacies-of-War.pdf |archivedate= 8 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Kargil War]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=51}}\n* [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]{{sfnp|Cashner|2013|p=52}}\n*[[2013 Lahad Datu standoff]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n}}\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

Cannonball was a founding member of the X-Men's junior team, the [[New Mutants]], and served as [[X-Force]]'s second-in-command and field leader. He eventually joined the X-Men, becoming the first member of a secondary team to \"graduate\". The eldest of a large [[Kentucky]] [[coal mining]] family, several of his siblings, such as [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], [[Melody Guthrie|Aero]], [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]] and [[Jebediah Guthrie|Jeb]], are also mutants and have joined X-Men-related teams.\n\n[[Charlie Heaton]] will portray Cannonball in the upcoming film ''[[The New Mutants (film)|The New Mutants]]'' (2020).\n\n==Publication history==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2019}}\nCreated by writer Chris Claremont and artist [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]], Cannonball first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants (graphic novel)|The New Mutants]]'' graphic novel (September 1982) as a member of [[New Mutants|the titular super-group]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=68}}</ref> McLeod later commented, \"I always liked Cannonball the best [of the New Mutants].

In ''X-Force'' # 44 (1995), Cannonball leaves X-Force to join the X-Men, appearing regularly in ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) # 48-89 and ''Uncanny X-Men'' (volume 1) # 323-355 (1995-1998). He rejoins his friends in X-Force while on an extended road trip in ''X-Force'' # 86 (1998), and stays with the team through issue # 117 (2001), after which the title changes drastically, taken over by the team later to be known as ''[[X-Statix]]''.\n\nCannonball next appears as a member of the ''X-Corporation'' in ''New X-Men'' # 128, 130, 131 and 140 (2002-2003), and then rejoins the X-Men in a splinter team led by Storm in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' (vol. 1) # 24-46 (2003-2004). After the cancellation of ''X-Treme X-Men'', Cannonball appears regularly with the X-Men in the mid to late 2000s, including ''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 1) # 444-447 (2004) and # 466-474 (2006), ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) # 188-204 (2006-2007), ''[[Young X-Men]]'' # 1-6 (2008) and ''[[Secret Invasion]]: X-Men'' # 1-4 (2009).

He would leave the X-Men's base on Utopia to join Wolverine's faction at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning in New York, joining [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s team in ''X-Men: Legacy'' # 260.1-#267 (2012).\n\nCannonball and Sunspot were asked by [[Captain America]] to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], bridging the gap between humans and mutants in the aftermath of the [[Avengers vs. X-Men]] event.

While on the farm, Sam found himself teaming up again with Cable and reformed X-Force against the threat of the [[Skornn]].{{issue|date=July 2018}}\n\nSam has once more joined the active roster of the X-Men, whose team is co-led by [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]].

He has already participated in helping [[X-Men: The 198|the 198]] and fighting the [[Shi'ar]] Death Commandos. He soon suffers the death of his brother [[Icarus (comics)|Jay]], who is killed by William Stryker.

Unbeknownst to them, one of Legion's personalities has the ability to project himself and is stalling them while he prepares to kill Dani only to be stopped by Magik and Magma. They free Dani as Legion retreats, Sam apologizes but gets punched in the face by an angry Dani.

This energy is used as thrust to cause his body to be propelled through the air like a rocket, at great heights and speeds with considerable maneuverability. He can control his speed and direction through sheer act of will. At first, he could only release this energy from his feet and legs, but now he can fire it from almost any part of his body, to a wide variety of effects. This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible \"blast field\" that protects him from bodily harm. He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.\n\nHis power levels have varied over the years - but at his peak, he has been able to absorb (and redirect) the force of one of [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]'s punches.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #341 (February 1997)</ref>\n\nHe may also be a member of the immortal mutant group the [[Externals]], due to his apparent ability to return to life after death.<ref>''X-Force'' #9 (July 1993)</ref>\nFFFFFFFOOOOOOOFFFF\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the [[Age of Apocalypse]] storyline, the Guthrie family was eliminated during the Cullings, with only Sam, Paige, Elisabeth, and Joshua being spared due to their mutant status.

Sam took on the alias Cannonball and became a member of the EMF alongside his sister, Elisabeth, a.k.a. ''Amazon''. He and his sister were particularly violent towards the prisoners of Sinister's breeding pens, as was their superior [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], to whom Cannonball was loyal. When the Elite Mutant Force was taken over by Havok due to Prelate Cyclops' betrayal, Cannonball fought the Bedlam brothers, who sided with the older Summers brother.<ref>''Factor X'' vol. 1 #4</ref> Cannonball and Amazon survived and eventually reunited with [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], whom they rescue from the Seattle Core, and Icarus, and together they set out to fulfill Husk's \"revenge\" against the X-Men for Colossus' abandonment of her in the Core.

Cannonball allows Cable to escape with the child, opting to stay and distract Bishop. Bishop pleads with Sam not to fight, but Cannonball persists, harboring a decades-long grudge against the traitorous former X-Man, and after a long fight, Bishop is forced to kill him using a claw-like tentacle from his new bionic arm (stolen from Forge) to rip out Guthrie's heart. As Cannonball dies, he asks Bishop why, to which Bishop responds, with visions of his future, mutants with M's on their faces and herded into concentration camps, \"To save you\".<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\n===House of M===\nCannonball had no [[House of M]] counterpart because he was traveling through realities with [[Siryn]] and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] when the change wave occurred.

This energy is used as thrust to cause his body to be propelled through the air like a rocket, at great heights and speeds with considerable maneuverability. He can control his speed and direction through sheer act of will. At first, he could only release this energy from his feet and legs, but now he can fire it from almost any part of his body, to a wide variety of effects. This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible \"blast field\" that protects him from bodily harm. He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.\n\nHis power levels have varied over the years - but at his peak, he has been able to absorb (and redirect) the force of one of [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]'s punches.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #341 (February 1997)</ref>\n\nHe may also be a member of the immortal mutant group the [[Externals]], due to his apparent ability to return to life after death.<ref>''X-Force'' #9 (July 1993)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the [[Age of Apocalypse]] storyline, the Guthrie family was eliminated during the Cullings, with only Sam, Paige, Elisabeth, and Joshua being spared due to their mutant status. They were approached by [[Mister Sinister]], who offered them the chance to become part of his Elite Mutant Force. Sam took on the alias Cannonball and became a member of the EMF alongside his sister, Elisabeth, a.k.a. ''Amazon''. He and his sister were particularly violent towards the prisoners of Sinister's breeding pens, as was their superior [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], to whom Cannonball was loyal. When the Elite Mutant Force was taken over by Havok due to Prelate Cyclops' betrayal, Cannonball fought the Bedlam brothers, who sided with the older Summers brother.<ref>''Factor X'' vol. 1 #4</ref> Cannonball and Amazon survived and eventually reunited with [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], whom they rescue from the Seattle Core, and Icarus, and together they set out to fulfill Husk's \"revenge\" against the X-Men for Colossus' abandonment of her in the Core.

Cannonball allows Cable to escape with the child, opting to stay and distract Bishop. Bishop pleads with Sam not to fight, but Cannonball persists, harboring a decades-long grudge against the traitorous former X-Man, and after a long fight, Bishop is forced to kill him using a claw-like tentacle from his new bionic arm (stolen from Forge) to rip out Guthrie's heart. As Cannonball dies, he asks Bishop why, to which Bishop responds, with visions of his future, mutants with M's on their faces and herded into concentration camps, \"To save you\".<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\n===House of M===\nCannonball had no [[House of M]] counterpart because he was traveling through realities with [[Siryn]] and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] when the change wave occurred. However, Wolverine did beat up a young blond man for his motorbike, which was called the 'Cannonball X'.\n\n===Last Avengers Story===\nIn an alternate future, Hank Pym recruits Cannonball to be part of a new Avengers, to fight Ultron and Kang.
