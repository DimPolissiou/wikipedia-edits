The right of Taylor to graduate, to get a job in the fashion industry that she was so passionate about, to get her first apartment, her first car, her first house.

The B-36 is the largest mass-produced [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engined]] aircraft ever built. It had the longest [[wingspan]] of any combat aircraft ever built, at 230&nbsp;ft (70.1&nbsp;m). The B-36 was the first bomber capable of delivering any of the [[nuclear weapon]]s in the U.S. arsenal from inside its four bomb bays without aircraft modifications.

Consolidated asked for a $15 million contract with $800,000 for research and development, mockup, and tooling. Two experimental bombers were proposed, the first to be delivered in 30 months, and the second within another six months. Originally designated Model B-35, the name was changed to B-36 to avoid confusion with the [[Northrop YB-35]] piston-engined flying-wing bomber,<ref name=\"Johnson p.1\"/><ref>Leach 2008, pp. 26\u201328.</ref> against which the B-36 was meant to compete for a production contract.\n\nThroughout its development, the B-36 encountered delays. When the United States entered World War II, Consolidated was ordered to slow B-36 development and greatly increase [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] production. The first mockup was inspected on 20 July 1942, following six months of refinements. A month after the inspection, the project was moved from San Diego, California, to Fort Worth, Texas, which set back development several months. Consolidated changed the tail from a twin-tail to a single, thereby saving {{convert|3850|lb}}, but this change delayed delivery by 120 days.\n\nThe [[tricycle landing gear]] system's initial main gear design, with huge single wheels found to cause significant ground pressure problems, limited the B-36 to operating from just three air bases in the United States: [[Carswell AFB|Carswell Field]] (former [[Carswell AFB]], now [[NAS JRB Fort Worth]]/Carswell Field), adjacent to the Consolidated factory in Fort Worth, Texas; [[Eglin Field]] (now [[Eglin AFB]]), Florida; and [[Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base|Fairfield-Suisun Field]] (now [[Travis AFB]]) in California.<ref>Jenkins 2002, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nAs a result, the Air Force mandated that Consolidated design a four-wheeled [[Bogie#Bogie (aircraft)|bogie]]-type wheel system for each main gear unit instead, which distributed the pressure more evenly and reduced weight by {{convert|1500|lb}}.<ref name=\"Johnson p.1\"/><ref name=globalsecurity1>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-36-production.htm \"Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD): B-36 Peacemaker.\"] globalsecurity.org.

This unusual configuration prevented propeller turbulence from interfering with airflow over the wing, but could also lead to engine overheating due to insufficient airflow around the engines, resulting in inflight [[#Engine fires|engine fires]].\n\nThe large, slow-turning propellers interacted with the high-pressure airflow behind the wings to produce an easily recognizable very-low-frequency pulse at ground level that betrayed approaching flights.\n\n===Addition of jet propulsion===\nBeginning with the B-36D, Convair added a pair of [[General Electric J47]]-19 [[jet engine]]s suspended near the end of each wing; these were also retrofitted to all extant B-36Bs. Consequently, the B-36 was configured to have 10 engines, six radial propeller engines and four jet engines, leading to the B-36 slogan of \"six turnin' and four burnin'&thinsp;\". The B-36 had more engines than any other mass-produced aircraft. The jet pods greatly improved takeoff performance and dash speed over the target. In normal cruising flight, the jet engines were shut down to conserve fuel. When the jet engines were shut down, louvers closed off the front of the pods to reduce drag and to prevent ingestion of sand and dirt. The jet engine louvers were opened and closed by the flight crew in the cockpit, whether the B-36 was on the ground or in the air.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA117 \"Doors Shield Jets From Blowing Dirt\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1950, p. 117.</ref> The two pods with four turbojets and the six piston engines combined gave the B-36 a total of {{convert|40000|hp|kW|abbr=on}} for short periods of time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GtkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA124 \"B-36 Adds Four Jet Engines.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1949, p. 124.</ref>\n\n===Crew===\nThe B-36 had a crew of 15.

It had a redesigned, high-visibility, yet still \"greenhouse-like\" [[bubble canopy]], heavily framed due to its substantial size, which was later adopted for production, and the engines used on the YB-36 were more powerful and more efficient. Altogether, the YB-36 was much closer to the production aircraft.\n\n[[File:XB-36 first flight.jpg|thumb|right|The XB-36 on its first flight]]\n\nThe first few of 21 B-36As were delivered in 1948. They were interim airframes, intended for crew training and later conversion. No defensive armament was fitted, since none was ready. Once later models were available, all B-36As were converted to RB-36E reconnaissance models. The first B-36 variant meant for normal operation was the B-36B, delivered beginning in November 1948. This aircraft met all the 1941 requirements, but had serious problems with engine reliability and maintenance (changing the 336 spark plugs was a task dreaded by ground crews) and with the availability of armaments and spare parts. Later models featured more powerful variants of the R-4360 engine, improved radar, and redesigned crew compartments.\n\nThe four jet engines increased fuel consumption and reduced range. The advent of [[air-to-air missile]]s then rendered conventional gun turrets obsolete. In February 1954, the USAF awarded Convair a contract for a new \"Featherweight\" design program, which significantly reduced weight and crew size. The three configurations were:\n* Featherweight I removed defensive hardware, including the six gun turrets.\n* Featherweight II removed the rear compartment crew comfort features, and all hardware accommodating the [[McDonnell XF-85 Goblin]] [[Parasite aircraft|parasite fighter]].\n* Featherweight III incorporated both configurations I and II.\nThe six turrets eliminated by Featherweight I reduced the aircraft's crew from 15 to 9. Featherweight III had a longer range and an operating ceiling of at least {{convert|47000|ft}}, especially valuable for reconnaissance missions.

In 1947, the Navy attacked congressional funding for the B-36, alleging it failed to meet Pentagon requirements. The Navy held to the pre-eminence of the aircraft carrier in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] during World War II, presuming carrier-based aircraft would be decisive in future wars. To this end, the Navy designed {{USS|United States|CVA-58|6}}, a \"[[supercarrier]]\" capable of launching huge fleets of tactical aircraft or nuclear bombers. It then pushed to have funding transferred from the B-36 to USS ''United States''. The Air Force successfully defended the B-36 project, and ''United States'' was officially cancelled by [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Louis A. Johnson]] in a cost-cutting move. Several high-level Navy officials questioned the government's decision, alleging a conflict of interest because Johnson had once served on Convair's board of directors. The uproar following the cancellation of ''United States'' in 1949 was nicknamed the \"[[Revolt of the Admirals]]\".<ref name=\"revolt\">Barlow 1994, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThe furor, as well as the significant use of aircraft carriers in the [[Korean War]], resulted in the design and procurement of the subsequent {{sclass-|Forrestal|aircraft carrier|4}} of supercarriers, which were of comparable size to ''United States'', but with a design geared towards greater multirole use with composite air wings of fighter, attack, reconnaissance, [[electronic warfare]], [[early warning]] and [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine-warfare]] aircraft.

The RB-36 variants of the B-36 were used for reconnaissance during the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the B-36 bomber variants conducted training and test operations and stood ground and airborne alert, but the latter variants were never used offensively as bombers against hostile forces; it never fired a shot in combat.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Maintenance===\n[[File:B-36 Peacemaker - personnel and equipment.jpg|thumb|Personnel and equipment required to get and keep a B-36 aircraft in the air]]\nThe Wasp Major engines had a prodigious appetite for [[lubricating oil]]; each engine required a dedicated 100-gal (380-l) tank.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Normal maintenance consisted of tedious measures, such as changing the 56 [[spark plug]]s on each of the six engines; the plugs were often fouled by the [[Gasoline#Tetraethyllead|lead]] in the [[Avgas#Grades|145]] [[octane]] anti[[Engine knocking|knock]] fuel required by the [[R-4360]] engines. Thus, each service required changing 336 spark plugs. Another frequent maintenance job was replacing the dozens of [[bomb bay]] light bulbs, which routinely shattered during test firing of the turret guns.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe B-36 was too large to fit in most [[hangar]]s. Since even an aircraft with the range of the B-36 needed to be stationed as close to enemy targets as possible, this meant the plane was largely based in the extreme weather locations of the northern continental United States, Alaska, and the [[Arctic]]. Since the maintenance had to be performed outdoors, the crews were largely exposed to the elements, with temperatures of {{convert|-60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in winters and {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in summers, depending on the airbase location. Special shelters were built so the maintenance crews could be given a modicum of protection. [[Ground crew]]s were at risk of slipping and falling from icy wings, or being blown off the wings by propeller wash running in reverse pitch. The [[wing root]]s were thick enough, at 7&nbsp;ft (2.1&nbsp;m), to enable a [[flight engineer]] to access the engines and landing gear during flight by crawling through the wings. This was possible only at altitudes not requiring [[cabin pressurization|pressurization]].<ref>Morris, Ted.

With a sufficiently light load, the B-36 could fly at least 10,000&nbsp;mi (16,000&nbsp;km) nonstop, and the highest cruising speed of any version, the B-36J-III, was at 230&nbsp;mph (380&nbsp;km/h). Engaging the jet engines could raise the cruising speed to over 400&nbsp;mph (650&nbsp;km/h). Hence, a 40-hour mission, with the jets used only for takeoff and climbing, flew about 9,200&nbsp;mi (15,000&nbsp;km).\n\nDue to its massive size, the B-36 was never considered sprightly or agile; Lieutenant General James Edmundson likened it to \"...sitting on your front porch and flying your house around.\"<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bomb/filmmore/reference/interview/edmund10.html \"Lt.

Its immense size, range, and payload capacity lent itself to use in research and development programs. These included nuclear propulsion studies, and \"parasite\" programs in which the B-36 carried smaller interceptors or reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Miller and Cripliver 1978, pp. 366, 369.</ref>\n\nIn May 1946, the Air Force began the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft project, which was followed in May 1951 by the [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] (ANP) program. The ANP program used modified B-36s to study shielding requirements for an airborne reactor to determine whether a [[nuclear aircraft|nuclear-powered aircraft]] was feasible. Convair modified two B-36s under the MX-1589 project. The Nuclear Test Aircraft was a B-36H-20-CF (serial number 51-5712) that had been damaged in a tornado at [[Carswell AFB]] on 1 September 1952. This aircraft, designated the XB-36H (and later [[Convair NB-36H|NB-36H]]), was modified to carry a {{nowrap|1 MW}}, air-cooled [[nuclear reactor]] in the aft [[bomb bay]], with a four-ton [[lead shield|lead disc shield]] installed in the middle of the aircraft between the reactor and the cockpit. A number of large air intake and exhaust holes were installed in the sides and bottom of the aircraft's rear fuselage to cool the reactor in flight.<ref name=\"Baugher1\"/> On the ground, a crane would be used to remove the {{convert|35000|lb|adj=on}} reactor from the aircraft.

One parasite aircraft was the diminutive [[McDonnell XF-85 Goblin]], which docked using a trapeze system. The concept was tested successfully using a B-29 carrier, but docking proved difficult even for experienced test pilots. Moreover, the XF-85 was seen as no match for contemporary foreign powers' newly developed interceptor aircraft in development and in service; consequently, the project was cancelled.<ref name=\"Baugher2\">Baugher, Joe.

The GRB-36D would ferry the RF-84K to the vicinity of the objective, whereupon the RF-84K would disconnect and begin its mission. Ten GRB-36Ds and 25 RF-84Ks were built and had limited service in 1955\u20131956.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nProjects [[FICON project#Project MX-1016 (Tip Tow)|TIP TOW]] and [[FICON project|Tom-Tom]] involved docking [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|F-84s]] to the wingtips of B-29s and B-36s. The hope was that the increased [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] of the combined aircraft would result in a greater range. Project TIP TOW was cancelled when an EF-84D and a specially modified test EB-29A crashed, killing everyone on both aircraft. This accident was attributed to the EF-84D flipping over onto the wing of the EB-29A. Project Tom-Tom, involving RF-84Fs and a GRB-36D from the FICON project (redesignated JRB-36F), continued for a few months after this crash, but was also cancelled due to the violent [[turbulence]] induced by the [[wingtip vortices]] of the B-36.<ref name=\"tomtom\">Lockett, Brian.

This was the first RB-36 used in the [[Korea]]n theater. While not employed in combat, these RB-36s conducted high-altitude aerial reconnaissance over Chinese [[Manchuria]] and Soviet [[East Asia]].<ref>Hall, R. Cargill. \"The Truth About Overflights: Military Reconnaissance Missions over Russia Before the U-2.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Military History'', Spring 1997.</ref>]]\n\nOne of the SAC's initial missions was to plan strategic aerial reconnaissance on a global scale. The first efforts were in photo-reconnaissance and mapping. Along with the photo-reconnaissance mission, a small [[electronic intelligence]] cadre was operating. Weather reconnaissance was part of the effort, as was long-range detection, the search for Soviet atomic explosions. In the late 1940s, strategic intelligence on Soviet capabilities and intentions was scarce. Before the development of the [[Lockheed U-2]] high-altitude spy plane and orbital reconnaissance satellites [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]], technology and politics limited American reconnaissance efforts to the borders, and not the heartland, of the Soviet Union.<ref>Wack, Fred J. ''The Secret Explorers: Saga of the 46th/72nd Reconnaissance Squadrons''. Self-published, 1990.</ref>\n\nOne of the essential criteria of the early postwar reconnaissance aircraft was the ability to cruise above {{Convert|40000|ft|m}}, a level determined by knowledge of the capability of Soviet [[Radar configurations and types#Detection and search radars|air-defense radar]]. The main Soviet air-defense radar in the 1950s was the American-supplied [[SCR-270 radar|SCR-270]], or locally made copies, which were only effective up to {{Convert|40000|ft|m}} \u2013 in theory, an aircraft cruising above this level would remain undetected.<ref name=\"B361\">Jacobsen 1997 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first aircraft to put this theory to the test was the RB-36D specialized [[Imagery intelligence|photo-reconnaissance]] version of the B-36D. It was outwardly identical to the standard B-36D, but carried a crew of 22 rather than 15, the additional crew members being needed to operate and maintain the photo-reconnaissance equipment that was carried. The forward bomb bay in the bomber was replaced by a pressurized, manned compartment that was filled with 14 cameras. This compartment included a small [[darkroom]], where a photo technician could develop the film. The second bomb bay contained up to 80 T-86 [[photoflash bomb]]s, while the third bay could carry an extra {{convert|3000|USgal|L|order=flip}}, droppable fuel tank. The fourth bomb bay carried [[electronic countermeasure]] equipment. The defensive armament of 16 M-24A-1 20-mm cannons was retained. The extra fuel tanks increased the flight endurance to up to 50 hours.  It had an operational ceiling of {{convert|50000|ft}}. Later, a lightweight version of this aircraft, the RB-36-III, could even reach {{convert|58000|ft|abbr=on}}. RB-36s were distinguished by the bright aluminum finish of the camera compartment (contrasting with the dull magnesium of the rest of the fuselage) and by a series of [[radome|radar domes]] under the aft fuselage, varying in number and placement. When developed, it was the only American aircraft having enough range to fly over the Eurasian land mass from bases in the United States, and size enough to carry the bulky, high-resolution cameras of the day.<ref name=\"B362\">Baugher, Joe.

A special [[Boston Camera|240-inch focal length camera]] (known as the [[Boston Camera]] after the university where it was designed) was tested on 44-92088, the aircraft being redesignated ERB-36D. The long focal length was achieved by using a two-mirror reflection system. The camera was capable of resolving a golf ball at an altitude and side range of {{convert|45000|ft|m}}. That is a slant range over {{convert|63600|ft|m}}. The contact print of this test can be seen at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright Patterson AFB]]. This camera is now with the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at Wright Patterson AFB.<ref name=\"B362\"/>\n\nThe first RB-36D (44-92088) made its initial flight on 18 December 1949, only six months after the first B-36D had flown. It initially flew without the turbojets. The [[28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]] based at [[Ellsworth AFB|Rapid City AFB (later renamed Ellsworth AFB)]], [[South Dakota]], received its first RB-36D on 3 June 1950. Due to severe material shortages, the new RB-36Ds did not become operationally ready until June 1951. The 24th and last RB-36D was delivered in May 1951. A total of 24 RB-36Ds was built. Some RB-36Ds were later modified to the featherweight configuration, in which all but the tail guns were removed. The crew was reduced from 22 to 19. These aircraft were redesignated as RB-36D-III. Modifications were carried out by Convair from February to November 1954.<ref name=\"B362\"/>\n\nWith a range of {{Convert|9300|mi|km}}, RB-36Ds began probing the boundaries of the Soviet Arctic in 1951. Although on-board equipment indicated detection by Soviet radar, interceptions at the B-36's service ceiling would have remained difficult. RB-36 aircraft operating from [[RAF Sculthorpe]] in England made a number of overflights of Soviet Arctic bases, particularly the new nuclear weapons test complex at [[Novaya Zemlya]]. RB-36s performed a number of rarely acknowledged reconnaissance missions and are believed to have frequently penetrated Chinese (and Soviet) [[airspace]] under the direction of General [[Curtis LeMay]].<ref name=\"B361\"/>\n\nIn early 1950, Convair began converting B-36As to a reconnaissance configuration; included in the conversions was the sole YB-36 (42-13571). These converted examples were all redesignated RB-36E. The six R-4360-25 engines were replaced by six R-4360-41s. They were also equipped with the four J-47 jet engines that were fitted to the RB-36D. Its normal crew was 22, which included five gunners to man the 16 M-24A-1 20-mm cannon. The last conversion was completed in July 1951. Later, the USAF also bought 73 long-range reconnaissance versions of the B-36H under the designation RB-36H; 23 were accepted during the first six months of 1952, and the last were delivered by September 1953. More than a third of all B-36s were reconnaissance models.<ref name=\"B362\"/>\n\nAdvances in Soviet air defense systems meant that the RB-36 became limited to flying outside the borders of the Soviet Union, as well as Eastern Europe. By the mid-1950s, the jet-powered Boeing [[RB-47E]] was able to pierce Soviet airspace and conduct a variety of spectacular overflights of the Soviet Union. Some of these flights probed deep into the heart of the Soviet Union, taking photographic and radar recordings of the route attacking SAC bombers would follow to reach their targets. Flights that involved penetrating mainland Russia were termed sensitive intelligence (SENSINT) missions. One RB-47 flew {{convert|450|mi|km}} inland and photographed the city of [[Igarka]] in Siberia.<ref name=\"B361\"/>\n\nAs with the strategic bombardment versions, the RB-36 was phased out of the SAC inventory beginning in 1956, the last being sent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]] in January 1959.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Obsolescence===\n[[File:Yb-52-b-36-carswell.jpg|thumb|XB-52 prototype at Carswell AFB, 1955 shown with a 7th Bomb Wing B-36]]\n[[File:Convair B-36s at AMARC 1958 awaiting scrapping.jpg|thumb|Convair B-36s awaiting their fate at the 3040th Aircraft Storage Depot (now [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group]]) in 1958]]\n\nWith the appearance of the Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] in combat over [[North Korea]] in 1950, USAF propeller-driven bombers were rendered obsolete as strategic offensive weapons. Both the B-36 and the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29/B-50 Superfortresses]] were designed during World War II, prior to the [[jet age]]. A new generation of [[swept-wing]] jet bombers, able to fly higher and faster, was needed to effectively overcome the MiG-15 or subsequent Soviet interceptors if the [[Cold War]] escalated into armed conflict.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAfter fighting in Korea had ceased, [[President Eisenhower]] called for a \"new look\" at national defense. His administration chose to invest in the USAF, especially SAC, retiring nearly all of its B-29/B-50s in favour of the new [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]]. By 1955, the swept-wing [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] was entering the inventory in substantial numbers, which replaced B-36s.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nTwo major factors contributing to the obsolescence of the B-36 and its phaseout were a lack of aerial refueling capability (instead requiring intermediate refueling bases to reach planned targets deep in the Soviet Union.) and its slow speed (making it vulnerable to jet interceptors and thus severely decreasing its likelihood of reaching targets in Soviet territory.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe scrapping of B-36s began in February 1956. Once replaced by B-52s, they were flown directly from operational squadrons to [[Davis\u2013Monthan AFB]], [[Arizona]], where the Mar-Pak Corporation handled their reclamation and destruction. Defense cutbacks in FY 1958 compelled the B-52 procurement process to be stretched out and the B-36 service life to be extended. The B-36s remaining in service were supported with components scavenged from aircraft sent to Davis\u2013Monthan. Further update work was undertaken by Convair at San Diego (Specialized Aircraft Maintenance, SAM-SAC) until 1957 to extend the life and capabilities of the B-36s. By December 1958, only 22 B-36Js were still operational.<ref name=\"B362\"/>\n\nOn 12 February 1959, the last B-36J built, AF Ser.

As Lockheed Martin had no place to display the finished aircraft, and local community efforts in Fort Worth to build a facility to house and maintain the massive aircraft fell short, the NMUSAF retook possession of the aircraft and it was transported to Tucson for loan to the Pima Air and Space Museum.

The B-36 is the largest mass-produced [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engined]] aircraft ever built. It had the longest [[wingspan]] of any combat aircraft ever built, at 230&nbsp;ft (70.1&nbsp;m). The B-36 was the first bomber capable of delivering any of the [[nuclear weapon]]s in the U.S. arsenal from inside its four bomb bays without aircraft modifications. With a range of {{convert|10000|mi|km|abbr=on}} and a maximum payload of {{convert|87200|lb|abbr=on}}, the B-36 was capable of intercontinental flight without refuelling.\n\nEntering service in 1948, the B-36 was the primary [[nuclear weapons delivery]] vehicle of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) until it was replaced by the jet-powered [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] beginning in 1955. All but five aircraft were scrapped.\n\n==Development==\nThe genesis of the B-36 can be traced to early 1941, prior to the entry of the United States into [[World War II]]. At the time, a very real chance apparently existed that [[Battle of Britain|Britain might fall]] to the [[The Blitz|German \"Blitz\"]], making a strategic bombing effort by the [[United States Army Air Corps]] (USAAC) against Germany impossible with the aircraft of the time.<ref name=\"NMUSAF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/197636/convair-b-36j-peacemaker/|title=Convair B-36J Peacemaker|publisher=National Museum of the United States Air Force|date=28 May 2015|accessdate=15 January 2018}}.</ref>\n\nThe United States would need a new class of bomber that would reach [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]] and return to bases in North America,<ref name=\"Taylor, p. 465\">Taylor 1969, p. 465.</ref> necessitating a combat range of at least {{convert|5700|mi|km}}, the length of a [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander, Newfoundland]]\u2013[[Berlin]] round trip. The USAAC therefore sought a bomber of truly intercontinental range,<ref name=\"Johnson p.1\">Johnson 1978, p. 1.</ref><ref>Jacobsen and Wagner 1980, p. 4.</ref> similar to the German [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]]'s (RLM)ultralong-range ''[[Amerikabomber]]'' program, the subject of a 33-page proposal submitted to Reichsmarschall [[Hermann Goering]] on 12 May 1942.\n\nThe USAAC sent out the initial request on 11 April 1941, asking for a {{convert|450|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} top speed, a {{convert|275|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} cruising speed, a service ceiling of {{convert|45000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, beyond the range of ground-based antiaircraft fire, and a maximum range of {{convert|12000|mi|km}} at {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Winchester 2006, p. 49.</ref> These requirements proved too demanding for any short-term design\u2014far exceeding the technology of the day\u2014<ref name=\"Johnson p.1\"/> so on 19 August 1941, they were reduced to a maximum range of {{convert|10000|mi|km|abbr=on}}, an effective [[combat radius]] of {{convert|4000|mi|km|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} bombload, a cruising speed between {{convert|240|and|300|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}}, and a service ceiling of {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"Taylor, p. 465\"/> above the maximum effective altitude of all of [[Nazi Germany]]'s antiaircraft ''flak'' guns, save for the rarely deployed [[12.8&nbsp;cm FlaK 40]] heavy ''flak'' cannon.\n\n===World War II and after===\nAs the Pacific war progressed, the USAAF increasingly needed a bomber capable of reaching Japan from its bases in [[Hawaii]], and the development of the B-36 resumed in earnest. Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]], in discussions with high-ranking officers of the USAAF, decided to waive normal army procurement procedures, and on [[1943 in aviation#July|23 July 1943]] \u2013 some 15 months after the Germans' ''Amerikabomber'' proposal's submission made it to their RLM authority, and coincidentally, the same day that, in Germany, the RLM had ordered the [[Heinkel]] firm to design [[Heinkel He 277#Competing bomber designs|a six-engined version]] of their own, [[BMW 801]]E-powered ''Amerikabomber'' design proposal<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griehl |first1=Manfred |last2=Dressel |first2=Joachim |title=Heinkel He 177 \u2013 277 \u2013 274 |year=1998 |publisher=Airlife Publishing |location=Shrewsbury, UK |isbn=1-85310-364-0 |page=197 }}</ref> \u2013 the USAAF submitted a \"letter of intent\" to Convair, ordering an initial production run of 100 B-36s before the completion and testing of the two prototypes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-36-production.htm |title=Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Systems \u2013 Bombers \u2013 B-36 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=globalsecurity.org |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |access-date=12 December 2016 |quote=Ensuing talks between Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, Assistant Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson, and high-ranking officers of the AAF, led Secretary Stimson to waive customary procurement procedures and to authorize the AAF to order B-36 production without awaiting completion and testing of the two experimental planes then under contract. Therefore, on 19 June, General Arnold directed procurement of 100 B-36s. General Arnold became Commanding General of the AAF in March 1942 and was promoted to four-star general a year later. His order, however, would be cut back or cancelled in the event of excessive production difficulties. The AAF letter of intent for 100 B-36s was signed by Convair on 23 July. The letter of intent of 23 July 1943, supplemented by Letter Contract W33-038 ac-7 on 23 August 1943, gave way 1 year later to a definitive contract. Interestingly, the US government was not liable should a letter of intent be cancelled. This was not so for the more often used letter contract which obligated funds.}}</ref> The first delivery was due in August 1945, and the last in October 1946, but Consolidated (by this time renamed Convair after its 1943 merger with [[Vultee Aircraft]]) delayed delivery. The aircraft was unveiled on 20 August 1945 (three months after [[V-E Day]]), and flew for the first time on 8 August 1946.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/1946-08-15_Biggest_Bomber \"Video: Biggest Bomber, 1946/08/15.\"] [[Universal Newsreel]], 1946.

The modification to allow the use of larger atomic weapons on the B-36 was called the \"Grand Slam Installation\".<ref name=\"grandslam\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-36b.htm \"B-36 Peacemaker.\"] globalsecurity.org.

Its maximum payload was more than four times that of the B-29, and exceeded that of the B-52.\n\nThe B-36 was slow and could not refuel in midair, but could fly missions to targets {{convert|3400|mi}} away and stay aloft as long as 40 hours.<ref name=\"NMUSAF\"/> Moreover, the B-36 was believed to have \"an ace up its sleeve\": a phenomenal cruising altitude for a piston-driven aircraft, made possible by its huge wing area and six 28-cylinder engines, putting it out of range of most of the interceptors of the day, as well as ground-based [[anti-aircraft gun|antiaircraft guns]].<ref name=\"NMUSAF\"/>\n\n===Experimentals and prototypes===\n[[File:B-36aarrivalcarswell1948.jpg|thumb|The huge new XB-36 alongside the first superbomber, the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]: The wings of the 'Peacemaker' were {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} thick at the root.]]\n[[File:Convair XB-36 in flight just after takeoff or just before landing 061128-F-1234S-025.jpg|thumb|The XB-36 showing the giant single tires: Production aircraft had a four-wheel main gear, instead.]]\n[[File:Convair XB-36 main landing gear detail 061128-F-1234S-028.jpg|thumb|right| Closeup of the XB-36's single-wheeled portside main gear unit]]\n\n[[Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation]] (later Convair) and [[Boeing Aircraft Company]] took part in the competition, with Consolidated winning a tender on 16 October 1941. Consolidated asked for a $15 million contract with $800,000 for research and development, mockup, and tooling. Two experimental bombers were proposed, the first to be delivered in 30 months, and the second within another six months. Originally designated Model B-35, the name was changed to B-36 to avoid confusion with the [[Northrop YB-35]] piston-engined flying-wing bomber,<ref name=\"Johnson p.1\"/><ref>Leach 2008, pp. 26\u201328.</ref> against which the B-36 was meant to compete for a production contract.\n\nThroughout its development, the B-36 encountered delays. When the United States entered World War II, Consolidated was ordered to slow B-36 development and greatly increase [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] production. The first mockup was inspected on 20 July 1942, following six months of refinements. A month after the inspection, the project was moved from San Diego, California, to Fort Worth, Texas, which set back development several months. Consolidated changed the tail from a twin-tail to a single, thereby saving {{convert|3850|lb}}, but this change delayed delivery by 120 days.\n\nThe [[tricycle landing gear]] system's initial main gear design, with huge single wheels found to cause significant ground pressure problems, limited the B-36 to operating from just three air bases in the United States: [[Carswell AFB|Carswell Field]] (former [[Carswell AFB]], now [[NAS JRB Fort Worth]]/Carswell Field), adjacent to the Consolidated factory in Fort Worth, Texas; [[Eglin Field]] (now [[Eglin AFB]]), Florida; and [[Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base|Fairfield-Suisun Field]] (now [[Travis AFB]]) in California.<ref>Jenkins 2002, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nAs a result, the Air Force mandated that Consolidated design a four-wheeled [[Bogie#Bogie (aircraft)|bogie]]-type wheel system for each main gear unit instead, which distributed the pressure more evenly and reduced weight by {{convert|1500|lb}}.<ref name=\"Johnson p.1\"/><ref name=globalsecurity1>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-36-production.htm \"Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD): B-36 Peacemaker.\"] globalsecurity.org.

This unusual configuration prevented propeller turbulence from interfering with airflow over the wing, but could also lead to engine overheating due to insufficient airflow around the engines, resulting in inflight [[#Engine fires|engine fires]].\n\nThe large, slow-turning propellers interacted with the high-pressure airflow behind the wings to produce an easily recognizable very-low-frequency pulse at ground level that betrayed approaching flights.\n\n===Addition of jet propulsion===\nBeginning with the B-36D, Convair added a pair of [[General Electric J47]]-19 [[jet engine]]s suspended near the end of each wing; these were also retrofitted to all extant B-36Bs. Consequently, the B-36 was configured to have 10 engines, six radial propeller engines and four jet engines, leading to the B-36 slogan of \"six turnin' and four burnin'&thinsp;\". The B-36 had more engines than any other mass-produced aircraft. The jet pods greatly improved takeoff performance and dash speed over the target. In normal cruising flight, the jet engines were shut down to conserve fuel. When the jet engines were shut down, louvers closed off the front of the pods to reduce drag and to prevent ingestion of sand and dirt. The jet engine louvers were opened and closed by the flight crew in the cockpit, whether the B-36 was on the ground or in the air.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA117 \"Doors Shield Jets From Blowing Dirt\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1950, p. 117.</ref> The two pods with four turbojets and the six piston engines combined gave the B-36 a total of {{convert|40000|hp|kW|abbr=on}} for short periods of time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GtkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA124 \"B-36 Adds Four Jet Engines.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1949, p. 124.</ref>\n\n===Crew===\nThe B-36 had a crew of 15.

The speed and range of the prototype failed to meet the standards set out by the USAAC in 1941.

It had a redesigned, high-visibility, yet still \"greenhouse-like\" [[bubble canopy]], heavily framed due to its substantial size, which was later adopted for production, and the engines used on the YB-36 were more powerful and more efficient. Altogether, the YB-36 was much closer to the production aircraft.\n\n[[File:XB-36 first flight.jpg|thumb|right|The XB-36 on its first flight]]\n\nThe first few of 21 B-36As were delivered in 1948. They were interim airframes, intended for crew training and later conversion. No defensive armament was fitted, since none was ready. Once later models were available, all B-36As were converted to RB-36E reconnaissance models. The first B-36 variant meant for normal operation was the B-36B, delivered beginning in November 1948. This aircraft met all the 1941 requirements, but had serious problems with engine reliability and maintenance (changing the 336 spark plugs was a task dreaded by ground crews) and with the availability of armaments and spare parts. Later models featured more powerful variants of the R-4360 engine, improved radar, and redesigned crew compartments.\n\nThe four jet engines increased fuel consumption and reduced range. The advent of [[air-to-air missile]]s then rendered conventional gun turrets obsolete. In February 1954, the USAF awarded Convair a contract for a new \"Featherweight\" design program, which significantly reduced weight and crew size. The three configurations were:\n* Featherweight I removed defensive hardware, including the six gun turrets.\n* Featherweight II removed the rear compartment crew comfort features, and all hardware accommodating the [[McDonnell XF-85 Goblin]] [[Parasite aircraft|parasite fighter]].\n* Featherweight III incorporated both configurations I and II.\nThe six turrets eliminated by Featherweight I reduced the aircraft's crew from 15 to 9. Featherweight III had a longer range and an operating ceiling of at least {{convert|47000|ft}}, especially valuable for reconnaissance missions. The B-36J-III configuration (the last 14 made) had a single radar-aimed tail turret, extra fuel tanks in the outer wings, and landing gear allowing the maximum gross weight to rise to {{convert|410000|lb}}.\n\nProduction of the B-36 ceased in 1954.<ref>[http://www.cowtown.net/proweb/last_one.htm \"The Last B-36 and the people who saved it from destruction.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014181534/http://www.cowtown.net/proweb/last_one.htm |date=14 October 2007 }} cowtown.net, 1 October 2006.

In 1947, the Navy attacked congressional funding for the B-36, alleging it failed to meet Pentagon requirements. The Navy held to the pre-eminence of the aircraft carrier in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] during World War II, presuming carrier-based aircraft would be decisive in future wars. To this end, the Navy designed {{USS|United States|CVA-58|6}}, a \"[[supercarrier]]\" capable of launching huge fleets of tactical aircraft or nuclear bombers. It then pushed to have funding transferred from the B-36 to USS ''United States''. The Air Force successfully defended the B-36 project, and ''United States'' was officially cancelled by [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Louis A. Johnson]] in a cost-cutting move. Several high-level Navy officials questioned the government's decision, alleging a conflict of interest because Johnson had once served on Convair's board of directors. The uproar following the cancellation of ''United States'' in 1949 was nicknamed the \"[[Revolt of the Admirals]]\".<ref name=\"revolt\">Barlow 1994, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThe furor, as well as the significant use of aircraft carriers in the [[Korean War]], resulted in the design and procurement of the subsequent {{sclass-|Forrestal|aircraft carrier|4}} of supercarriers, which were of comparable size to ''United States'', but with a design geared towards greater multirole use with composite air wings of fighter, attack, reconnaissance, [[electronic warfare]], [[early warning]] and [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine-warfare]] aircraft.

Another frequent maintenance job was replacing the dozens of [[bomb bay]] light bulbs, which routinely shattered during test firing of the turret guns.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe B-36 was too large to fit in most [[hangar]]s. Since even an aircraft with the range of the B-36 needed to be stationed as close to enemy targets as possible, this meant the plane was largely based in the extreme weather locations of the northern continental United States, Alaska, and the [[Arctic]]. Since the maintenance had to be performed outdoors, the crews were largely exposed to the elements, with temperatures of {{convert|-60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in winters and {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in summers, depending on the airbase location. Special shelters were built so the maintenance crews could be given a modicum of protection.

The [[wing root]]s were thick enough, at 7&nbsp;ft (2.1&nbsp;m), to enable a [[flight engineer]] to access the engines and landing gear during flight by crawling through the wings.

Its immense size, range, and payload capacity lent itself to use in research and development programs. These included nuclear propulsion studies, and \"parasite\" programs in which the B-36 carried smaller interceptors or reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Miller and Cripliver 1978, pp. 366, 369.</ref>\n\nIn May 1946, the Air Force began the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft project, which was followed in May 1951 by the [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] (ANP) program. The ANP program used modified B-36s to study shielding requirements for an airborne reactor to determine whether a [[nuclear aircraft|nuclear-powered aircraft]] was feasible. Convair modified two B-36s under the MX-1589 project. The Nuclear Test Aircraft was a B-36H-20-CF (serial number 51-5712) that had been damaged in a tornado at [[Carswell AFB]] on 1 September 1952. This aircraft, designated the XB-36H (and later [[Convair NB-36H|NB-36H]]), was modified to carry a {{nowrap|1 MW}}, air-cooled [[nuclear reactor]] in the aft [[bomb bay]], with a four-ton [[lead shield|lead disc shield]] installed in the middle of the aircraft between the reactor and the cockpit. A number of large air intake and exhaust holes were installed in the sides and bottom of the aircraft's rear fuselage to cool the reactor in flight.<ref name=\"Baugher1\"/> On the ground, a crane would be used to remove the {{convert|35000|lb|adj=on}} reactor from the aircraft. To protect the crew, the highly modified cockpit was encased in lead and rubber, with a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=mid|4=-thick}} [[lead glass|leaded glass]] [[windshield]].<ref name=\"Baugher1\">Baugher, Joe.

One parasite aircraft was the diminutive [[McDonnell XF-85 Goblin]], which docked using a trapeze system. The concept was tested successfully using a B-29 carrier, but docking proved difficult even for experienced test pilots. Moreover, the XF-85 was seen as no match for contemporary foreign powers' newly developed interceptor aircraft in development and in service; consequently, the project was cancelled.<ref name=\"Baugher2\">Baugher, Joe.

The GRB-36D would ferry the RF-84K to the vicinity of the objective, whereupon the RF-84K would disconnect and begin its mission. Ten GRB-36Ds and 25 RF-84Ks were built and had limited service in 1955\u20131956.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nProjects [[FICON project#Project MX-1016 (Tip Tow)|TIP TOW]] and [[FICON project|Tom-Tom]] involved docking [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|F-84s]] to the wingtips of B-29s and B-36s. The hope was that the increased [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] of the combined aircraft would result in a greater range. Project TIP TOW was cancelled when an EF-84D and a specially modified test EB-29A crashed, killing everyone on both aircraft. This accident was attributed to the EF-84D flipping over onto the wing of the EB-29A. Project Tom-Tom, involving RF-84Fs and a GRB-36D from the FICON project (redesignated JRB-36F), continued for a few months after this crash, but was also cancelled due to the violent [[turbulence]] induced by the [[wingtip vortices]] of the B-36.<ref name=\"tomtom\">Lockett, Brian.

This was the first RB-36 used in the [[Korea]]n theater. While not employed in combat, these RB-36s conducted high-altitude aerial reconnaissance over Chinese [[Manchuria]] and Soviet [[East Asia]].<ref>Hall, R. Cargill. \"The Truth About Overflights: Military Reconnaissance Missions over Russia Before the U-2.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Military History'', Spring 1997.</ref>]]\n\nOne of the SAC's initial missions was to plan strategic aerial reconnaissance on a global scale. The first efforts were in photo-reconnaissance and mapping. Along with the photo-reconnaissance mission, a small [[electronic intelligence]] cadre was operating. Weather reconnaissance was part of the effort, as was long-range detection, the search for Soviet atomic explosions. In the late 1940s, strategic intelligence on Soviet capabilities and intentions was scarce. Before the development of the [[Lockheed U-2]] high-altitude spy plane and orbital reconnaissance satellites [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]], technology and politics limited American reconnaissance efforts to the borders, and not the heartland, of the Soviet Union.<ref>Wack, Fred J. ''The Secret Explorers: Saga of the 46th/72nd Reconnaissance Squadrons''. Self-published, 1990.</ref>\n\nOne of the essential criteria of the early postwar reconnaissance aircraft was the ability to cruise above {{Convert|40000|ft|m}}, a level determined by knowledge of the capability of Soviet [[Radar configurations and types#Detection and search radars|air-defense radar]]. The main Soviet air-defense radar in the 1950s was the American-supplied [[SCR-270 radar|SCR-270]], or locally made copies, which were only effective up to {{Convert|40000|ft|m}} \u2013 in theory, an aircraft cruising above this level would remain undetected.<ref name=\"B361\">Jacobsen 1997 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first aircraft to put this theory to the test was the RB-36D specialized [[Imagery intelligence|photo-reconnaissance]] version of the B-36D. It was outwardly identical to the standard B-36D, but carried a crew of 22 rather than 15, the additional crew members being needed to operate and maintain the photo-reconnaissance equipment that was carried. The forward bomb bay in the bomber was replaced by a pressurized, manned compartment that was filled with 14 cameras. This compartment included a small [[darkroom]], where a photo technician could develop the film. The second bomb bay contained up to 80 T-86 [[photoflash bomb]]s, while the third bay could carry an extra {{convert|3000|USgal|L|order=flip}}, droppable fuel tank. The fourth bomb bay carried [[electronic countermeasure]] equipment. The defensive armament of 16 M-24A-1 20-mm cannons was retained. The extra fuel tanks increased the flight endurance to up to 50 hours.  It had an operational ceiling of {{convert|50000|ft}}. Later, a lightweight version of this aircraft, the RB-36-III, could even reach {{convert|58000|ft|abbr=on}}. RB-36s were distinguished by the bright aluminum finish of the camera compartment (contrasting with the dull magnesium of the rest of the fuselage) and by a series of [[radome|radar domes]] under the aft fuselage, varying in number and placement. When developed, it was the only American aircraft having enough range to fly over the Eurasian land mass from bases in the United States, and size enough to carry the bulky, high-resolution cameras of the day.<ref name=\"B362\">Baugher, Joe.

Retrieved: 14 June 2010.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Boston Camera.jpg|thumb|\"The Boston Camera\" on display at the National Museum of the Air Force]]\nThe standard RB-36D carried up to 23 cameras, primarily K-17C, K-22A, K-38, and K-40 cameras. A special [[Boston Camera|240-inch focal length camera]] (known as the [[Boston Camera]] after the university where it was designed) was tested on 44-92088, the aircraft being redesignated ERB-36D. The long focal length was achieved by using a two-mirror reflection system. The camera was capable of resolving a golf ball at an altitude and side range of {{convert|45000|ft|m}}. That is a slant range over {{convert|63600|ft|m}}. The contact print of this test can be seen at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright Patterson AFB]]. This camera is now with the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at Wright Patterson AFB.<ref name=\"B362\"/>\n\nThe first RB-36D (44-92088) made its initial flight on 18 December 1949, only six months after the first B-36D had flown. It initially flew without the turbojets. The [[28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]] based at [[Ellsworth AFB|Rapid City AFB (later renamed Ellsworth AFB)]], [[South Dakota]], received its first RB-36D on 3 June 1950. Due to severe material shortages, the new RB-36Ds did not become operationally ready until June 1951. The 24th and last RB-36D was delivered in May 1951. A total of 24 RB-36Ds was built. Some RB-36Ds were later modified to the featherweight configuration, in which all but the tail guns were removed. The crew was reduced from 22 to 19. These aircraft were redesignated as RB-36D-III. Modifications were carried out by Convair from February to November 1954.<ref name=\"B362\"/>\n\nWith a range of {{Convert|9300|mi|km}}, RB-36Ds began probing the boundaries of the Soviet Arctic in 1951. Although on-board equipment indicated detection by Soviet radar, interceptions at the B-36's service ceiling would have remained difficult. RB-36 aircraft operating from [[RAF Sculthorpe]] in England made a number of overflights of Soviet Arctic bases, particularly the new nuclear weapons test complex at [[Novaya Zemlya]]. RB-36s performed a number of rarely acknowledged reconnaissance missions and are believed to have frequently penetrated Chinese (and Soviet) [[airspace]] under the direction of General [[Curtis LeMay]].<ref name=\"B361\"/>\n\nIn early 1950, Convair began converting B-36As to a reconnaissance configuration; included in the conversions was the sole YB-36 (42-13571). These converted examples were all redesignated RB-36E. The six R-4360-25 engines were replaced by six R-4360-41s. They were also equipped with the four J-47 jet engines that were fitted to the RB-36D. Its normal crew was 22, which included five gunners to man the 16 M-24A-1 20-mm cannon. The last conversion was completed in July 1951. Later, the USAF also bought 73 long-range reconnaissance versions of the B-36H under the designation RB-36H; 23 were accepted during the first six months of 1952, and the last were delivered by September 1953. More than a third of all B-36s were reconnaissance models.<ref name=\"B362\"/>\n\nAdvances in Soviet air defense systems meant that the RB-36 became limited to flying outside the borders of the Soviet Union, as well as Eastern Europe. By the mid-1950s, the jet-powered Boeing [[RB-47E]] was able to pierce Soviet airspace and conduct a variety of spectacular overflights of the Soviet Union. Some of these flights probed deep into the heart of the Soviet Union, taking photographic and radar recordings of the route attacking SAC bombers would follow to reach their targets. Flights that involved penetrating mainland Russia were termed sensitive intelligence (SENSINT) missions. One RB-47 flew {{convert|450|mi|km}} inland and photographed the city of [[Igarka]] in Siberia.<ref name=\"B361\"/>\n\nAs with the strategic bombardment versions, the RB-36 was phased out of the SAC inventory beginning in 1956, the last being sent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]] in January 1959.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Obsolescence===\n[[File:Yb-52-b-36-carswell.jpg|thumb|XB-52 prototype at Carswell AFB, 1955 shown with a 7th Bomb Wing B-36]]\n[[File:Convair B-36s at AMARC 1958 awaiting scrapping.jpg|thumb|Convair B-36s awaiting their fate at the 3040th Aircraft Storage Depot (now [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group]]) in 1958]]\n\nWith the appearance of the Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] in combat over [[North Korea]] in 1950, USAF propeller-driven bombers were rendered obsolete as strategic offensive weapons. Both the B-36 and the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29/B-50 Superfortresses]] were designed during World War II, prior to the [[jet age]]. A new generation of [[swept-wing]] jet bombers, able to fly higher and faster, was needed to effectively overcome the MiG-15 or subsequent Soviet interceptors if the [[Cold War]] escalated into armed conflict.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAfter fighting in Korea had ceased, [[President Eisenhower]] called for a \"new look\" at national defense. His administration chose to invest in the USAF, especially SAC, retiring nearly all of its B-29/B-50s in favour of the new [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]]. By 1955, the swept-wing [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] was entering the inventory in substantial numbers, which replaced B-36s.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nTwo major factors contributing to the obsolescence of the B-36 and its phaseout were a lack of aerial refueling capability (instead requiring intermediate refueling bases to reach planned targets deep in the Soviet Union.) and its slow speed (making it vulnerable to jet interceptors and thus severely decreasing its likelihood of reaching targets in Soviet territory.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe scrapping of B-36s began in February 1956. Once replaced by B-52s, they were flown directly from operational squadrons to [[Davis\u2013Monthan AFB]], [[Arizona]], where the Mar-Pak Corporation handled their reclamation and destruction. Defense cutbacks in FY 1958 compelled the B-52 procurement process to be stretched out and the B-36 service life to be extended. The B-36s remaining in service were supported with components scavenged from aircraft sent to Davis\u2013Monthan. Further update work was undertaken by Convair at San Diego (Specialized Aircraft Maintenance, SAM-SAC) until 1957 to extend the life and capabilities of the B-36s. By December 1958, only 22 B-36Js were still operational.<ref name=\"B362\"/>\n\nOn 12 February 1959, the last B-36J built, AF Ser. No. 52-2827, left [[Biggs Army Airfield#Biggs Air Force Base (1947\u201366)|Biggs AFB]], Texas, where it had been on duty with the [[95th Air Base Wing|95th Heavy Bombardment Wing]], and was flown to [[Greater Southwest International Airport|Amon Carter Field]] in Fort Worth, where it was put on display.

When the museum's current location at Wright-Patterson was being developed in the late 1950s, the cost of moving the bomber was greater than simply flying a different B-36 to the new location and the aircraft was slated to be scrapped.

This aircraft was the final B-36 built, named ''The City of Fort Worth'', and lent to the city of Fort Worth on 12 February 1959. It sat on the field at the [[Greater Southwest International Airport]] until that airfield was closed and the property was redeveloped as a business park adjacent to [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]]. Some attempts were made to begin restoration at that location through the early 1970s. It then moved to the short-lived [[Southwest Aerospace Museum]], which was located between the former [[Carswell Air Force Base]] (now [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth]]) and the former [[General Dynamics]] (now [[Lockheed Martin]]) assembly plant, where it was originally built; some restoration took place while at the plant. As Lockheed Martin had no place to display the finished aircraft, and local community efforts in Fort Worth to build a facility to house and maintain the massive aircraft fell short, the NMUSAF retook possession of the aircraft and it was transported to Tucson for loan to the Pima Air and Space Museum. It was fully restored and reassembled at that museum, just south of Davis\u2013Monthan AFB, and is displayed at that location.<ref>[http://www.pimaair.org/visit/aircraft-by-name/item/convair-b-36j-peacemaker \"B-36 Peacemaker, s/n 52-2827.\"]  Pima Air & Space Museum.

The diocese covers the greater part of [[Gloucestershire]], with small parts of [[Herefordshire]] and [[Wiltshire]]. The cathedral has a stained-glass window depicting the earliest images of [[golf]]. This dates from 1350, over 300 years earlier than the earliest image of golf from Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.foreteevideo.co.uk/Gloucester.html|title= The first Golf record?|accessdate= 16 January 2009|work= A Royal and Ancient Golf History video|publisher= Fore Tee Video|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122154704/http://www.foreteevideo.co.uk/Gloucester.html|archivedate= 22 January 2009}}</ref> There is also a carved image of people playing a ball game, believed by some to be one of the earliest images of [[medieval football]].\n\n===Construction and architecture===\n[[File:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The soaring stained-glass windows behind the high altar]]\n[[File:Gloucester Cathedral - Stained window 6.jpg|thumb|Gloucester Cathedral West Window]]\n[[File:Gloucester Cathedral Vaulted Ceiling.jpg|thumb|Gloucester Cathedral Vaulted Ceiling]]\nThe cathedral, built as the abbey church, consists of a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] nucleus ([[Walter de Lacy (died 1085)|Walter de Lacy]] is buried there), with additions in every style of [[Gothic architecture]]. It is {{convert|420|ft|m}} long, and {{convert|144|ft|m}} wide, with a fine central tower of the 15th century rising to the height of {{convert|225|ft|m|abbr=on}} and topped by four delicate [[pinnacle]]s, a famous landmark. The nave is massive Norman with an [[Early English Period|Early English]] roof; the [[crypt]], under the choir, aisles and chapels, is Norman, as is the [[chapter house]]. The crypt is one of the four [[apsidal]] cathedral crypts in England, the others being at [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]], [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] and [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]].\n\n[[File:Gloucester Cathedral Nave, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The nave looking east toward the choir]]\nThe south porch is in the [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular style]], with a [[Fan vault|fan-vaulted]] roof, as also is the north [[transept]], the south being transitional [[Decorated Period|Decorated Gothic]]. The choir has Perpendicular tracery over Norman work, with an apsidal chapel on each side: the choir vaulting is particularly rich. The late Decorated east window is partly filled with surviving medieval [[stained glass]]. Between the apsidal chapels is a cross [[Lady chapel]], and north of the nave are the [[cloister]]s, the carrels or stalls for the monks' study and writing lying to the south. The cloisters at Gloucester are the earliest surviving [[fan vault]]s, having been designed between 1351 and 1377 by [[Thomas de Cantebrugge]].<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The Perpendicular Style\n | first = John\n | last = Harvey\n | year = 1978\n | publisher = Batsford\n | isbn = 0-7134-1610-6}}\n</ref>\n\nThe most notable monument is the canopied shrine of [[Edward II of England]] who was murdered at nearby [[Berkeley Castle]] (''illustration below''). The building and sanctuary were enriched by the visits of pilgrims to this shrine. In a side-chapel is a monument in coloured [[bog oak]] of [[Robert Curthose]], eldest son of [[William the Conqueror]] and a great benefactor of the abbey, who was interred there. Monuments of [[William Warburton]] (Bishop of Gloucester) and [[Edward Jenner]] (physician) are also worthy of note. The Abbey was the site of the coronation of Henry III, the only monarch since the Norman Conquest not crowned in Westminster Abbey. This is commemorated in a stained-glass window in the south aisle.<ref>The history, art, and architecture of Gloucester Cathedral,David Welander,Sutton, 1991</ref>\n\nBetween 1873 and 1890, and in 1897, the cathedral was extensively [[Victorian restoration|restored]] by [[George Gilbert Scott]].\n\n====Recent construction====\nIn September 2016 Gloucester Cathedral joined the Church of England\u2019s \u2018[[Shrinking the Footprint]]\u2019 campaign. The aim of this campaign is to reduce The Church of England\u2019s carbon emissions collectively, by 80%. In order to help reach this target Gloucester Cathedral commissioned local solar company Mypower to install an array on the nave of Gloucester Cathedral. Purportedly the [[Photovoltaic system|solar array]] will reduce Gloucester Cathedral\u2019s energy costs by 25%.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.mypoweruk.com/gloucester-cathedral-installation/|title= Let there be light - 1000 year old Gloucester Cathedral becomes the oldest building of its type in the world to install solar PV|website= MyPower.com|accessdate= 7 September 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180908015802/https://www.mypoweruk.com/gloucester-cathedral-installation/|archive-date= 8 September 2018|url-status= live}}</ref> The installation was completed by November 2016.

In 1999 [[Nicholson & Co Ltd|Nicholson & Co]] overhauled the organ, when the soundboards, pipework and wind supply were renovated and the computer system was updated. In 2010 Nicholson also added a Trompette Harmonique solo reed.<ref name=organ/>\n\nThe organ comprises four manuals and pedals. It is designed particularly to play from its position on the Quire screen to both East and West sides of the Cathedral. The Swell is situated in the centre of the case at console level and is controlled by two swell pedals, one for each side of the case. Directly above the Swell is the Great organ which is split into East and West divisions; it comprises two separate principal choruses. The fourth manual is a West Positive, mirroring the function of the Choir organ for the West side of the Cathedral.<ref name=organ/>\n\n===Organists===\n{{See also|List of musicians at English cathedrals}}\nIn 1582, Robert Lichfield is recorded as the organist of Gloucester Cathedral. Notable among the organists are composers and choral conductors of the [[Three Choirs Festival]], [[Herbert Brewer]], [[Herbert Sumsion]] and [[John Sanders (musician)|John Sanders]]. [[Herbert Howells]], who was a pupil of Brewer, composed a [[Magnificat and Nunc dimittis (Gloucester)|Magnificat and Nunc dimittis for Gloucester Cathedral]]\n\n===Three Choirs Festival===\nAn annual musical festival, the [[Three Choirs Festival]], is hosted by turns in this cathedral and those of [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]] and [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]] in rotation.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.3choirs.org/|title= Three Choirs Festival|accessdate= 16 January 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/19990418010114/http://www.3choirs.org/|archive-date= 1999-04-18|url-status= dead}}</ref> The Three Choirs is the oldest annual musical festival in the world.\n\n== Clock and bells ==\n=== Clock ===\nThe Cathedral's clock, bells and the chimes are referred to in a repair agreement of 1525.   The present clock, installed in 1898, is by Dent and Co, who built the clock for Big Ben. There is no external dial, but there is a fine Art Nouveau clock face in the north transept, dating from 1903, designed by Henry Wilson.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Verey |first1=David |last2=Brooks |first2=Alan |title=Gloucester:  The cathedral church of the Holy and Indivisible Trinity |date=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-11018-9 |page=23 |edition=3}}</ref>\n\n=== Bells ===\nThe bells were rehung and augmented in 1978 to give a ring of twelve.  The two oldest bells date from before 1420, so they are older than the present tower.

The diocese covers the greater part of [[Gloucestershire]], with small parts of [[Herefordshire]] and [[Wiltshire]]. The cathedral has a stained-glass window depicting the earliest images of [[golf]].

It is {{convert|420|ft|m}} long, and {{convert|144|ft|m}} wide, with a fine central tower of the 15th century rising to the height of {{convert|225|ft|m|abbr=on}} and topped by four delicate [[pinnacle]]s, a famous landmark. The nave is massive Norman with an [[Early English Period|Early English]] roof; the [[crypt]], under the choir, aisles and chapels, is Norman, as is the [[chapter house]]. The crypt is one of the four [[apsidal]] cathedral crypts in England, the others being at [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]], [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] and [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]].\n\n[[File:Gloucester Cathedral Nave, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The nave looking east toward the choir]]\nThe south porch is in the [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular style]], with a [[Fan vault|fan-vaulted]] roof, as also is the north [[transept]], the south being transitional [[Decorated Period|Decorated Gothic]]. The choir has Perpendicular tracery over Norman work, with an apsidal chapel on each side: the choir vaulting is particularly rich. The late Decorated east window is partly filled with surviving medieval [[stained glass]]. Between the apsidal chapels is a cross [[Lady chapel]], and north of the nave are the [[cloister]]s, the carrels or stalls for the monks' study and writing lying to the south. The cloisters at Gloucester are the earliest surviving [[fan vault]]s, having been designed between 1351 and 1377 by [[Thomas de Cantebrugge]].<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The Perpendicular Style\n | first = John\n | last = Harvey\n | year = 1978\n | publisher = Batsford\n | isbn = 0-7134-1610-6}}\n</ref>\n\nThe most notable monument is the canopied shrine of [[Edward II of England]] who was murdered at nearby [[Berkeley Castle]] (''illustration below''). The building and sanctuary were enriched by the visits of pilgrims to this shrine. In a side-chapel is a monument in coloured [[bog oak]] of [[Robert Curthose]], eldest son of [[William the Conqueror]] and a great benefactor of the abbey, who was interred there. Monuments of [[William Warburton]] (Bishop of Gloucester) and [[Edward Jenner]] (physician) are also worthy of note. The Abbey was the site of the coronation of Henry III, the only monarch since the Norman Conquest not crowned in Westminster Abbey.

The aim of this campaign is to reduce The Church of England\u2019s carbon emissions collectively, by 80%. In order to help reach this target Gloucester Cathedral commissioned local solar company Mypower to install an array on the nave of Gloucester Cathedral.

In 2010 Nicholson also added a Trompette Harmonique solo reed.<ref name=organ/>\n\nThe organ comprises four manuals and pedals. It is designed particularly to play from its position on the Quire screen to both East and West sides of the Cathedral. The Swell is situated in the centre of the case at console level and is controlled by two swell pedals, one for each side of the case. Directly above the Swell is the Great organ which is split into East and West divisions; it comprises two separate principal choruses.

[[Sparta]] and its allies defeated an army led by [[Argos]] and [[Athens]].\n\n==Prelude to the battle==\nAfter the conclusion of the alliance between the Argives, Achaeans, Eleans and Athens, the humiliation of the Spartans in the 420 [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]<ref>Elis vetoed the Spartan participation, preventing them from making due sacrifices at Zeus temple (Thucydides, ''[[The History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' 5:49-50)</ref> and the invasion of [[Epidaurus]] by the allies, the Spartans were compelled to move against them, fearing an alliance with Corinth and having amassed an army that was, according to [[Thucydides]], 'the best army ever assembled in Greece to that time'. However, the Spartan king [[Agis II|Agis]] (son of [[Archidamus II|Archidamus]]) instead concluded the first campaign with a truce, without explaining his actions to the army or his allies; the army thus returned home. Immediately afterwards, the Argives denounced the truce and resumed the war, capturing the key town of [[Orchomenus (Arcadia)|Orchomenus]]; as a result, anger at Agis was such that he was on the verge of being fined ydides, ''The History of the Peloponnesian War'' 5:63</ref>  The [[ephors]] consented, but in an unprecedented move, placed Agis under the supervision of ten advisors, called ''[[xysent was required for whatever military action he wished to take.\n==The battle=\nLate in 418, the Argives and their allies marched against [[Tegea]], where a faction was ready to turn the city over to the [[Argive alliance]]. Tegea   controlled the exit from Laconia. Enemy control of the town would mean that the Spartans would be unable to move out of their home city and would effectively mean the demise of the Peloponnesian coalition that fought the [[Peloponnesian War#The \"Archidamian War\"|Archidamian War]].\n\nAgis marched the whole of the Spartan army, together with the [[neodamodeis]] and everyone who was able to fight in Sparta out to [[Tegea]] where he was joined by his allies from [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], and he sent for help from his northern allies, [[ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Boeotia]], [[Phocis]], and [[Locris]]. However, the northern army could not arrive quickly to the scene, as they had not expected the call and would have to pass through enemy territory (Argos and Orchomenus). On the whole, the army of the allies of Sparta would have numbered around 9,000 hoplites.\n\nIn the meantime, the Eleans decided to attack [[Lepreum]], a contested border town with Sparta. So, they chose to withdraw their contingent of 3,000 hoplites. Agis took advantage of it and sent a sixth of his army, with the youngest and the oldest hoplites home to guard Sparta proper. They were called back soon after, as Agis or the xymbouloi realized that the Eleans would soon be back on the side of the Argives, but did not arrive in time for the battle.\n\nAgis could have bided his time inside the walls of Tegea, waiting for ya mum However, he was already discredited and could not show the slightest sign of shying away from battle. So he invaded and ravaged the territory around [[Mantinea]], about 15&nbsp;km north of Tegea and a member of the Argive alliance, in order to force a pitched battle with the Argives and their allies. The Argive army, however, was situated on ground \"steep and hard to get at\" and would not be drawn into battle, probably because the grain harvest had already been stored (the battle probably took place in the end of September 418). Agis, who was desperate for a victory to redeem his embarrassment at Argos, charged ahead; but according to Thucydides, when the armies had closed to a stone's throw, \"one of the elder Spartans\"<ref>Thucydides, ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' 5:65</ref> (the [[xymboulos]] [[Pharax]], according to Diodorus<ref>Diodorus Siculus, ''Library'' 12.79.6</ref>) advised him not to try to correct one error (his former defeat) with another.  The Spartans therefore retreated, and went off to find a way to draw out the Argive army to a battle. So they diverted the Sarandapotamos River to the bed of the smaller Zanovistas river, or, they just filled up the sinkholes in which Zanovistas flowed, in order to flood the Mantinean territory.\n\nInstead of allowing Mantinea to be flooded, the Argive army moved more quickly than the Spartans anticipated, as the Argive hoplites were very angry at their generals for not pursuing the Spartan army and accused them of treason. They surprised their enemies by drawing up as the Spartans emerged from a nearby wood. The Spartans quickly organized themselves, with no time to wait for their other allies. Brasidas' veterans (Brasidas himself had been killed at the [[Battle of Amphipolis]]), and the [[Sciritae]] (an elite unit of Spartan troops) formed the left wing, the Spartans, Arcadians, Heraeans and [[Maenalon|Maenalians]] in the centre, and the Tegeans, who were fighting for their homeland took the position of honour on the right wing. The Argive lines were formed by the Mantineans on the right, the Argives in the centre, and the Athenians on the left. [[Thucydides]] did not know the exact numbers of men on each side, but estimated that there were about 9,000 men on the Spartan side (the Spartan army must have numbered about 3,500, with 600 Sciritae, about 2,000 neodamodeis and Brasideans and about 3,000 Arcadians on the whole) with somewhat fewer men on the Argive and Athenian side (about 8,000), according to [[Donald Kagan]]. Other scholars, such as [[Victor Davis Hanson]], give slightly bigger numbers.\n\nAs the battle began, each side's right wing began to outflank the other's left, due to the erratic movements of each [[hoplite]] trying to cover himself with the shield of the man beside him. Agis tried to strengthen the line by ordering the Sciritae and his left to break off contact from the rest of the army and match the length of the Argive line. To cover the void created, he ordered the companies of Hipponoidas and Aristocles to leave their positions in the center and cover the line. This however was not achieved, for the two captains were unable, or unwilling to complete these manoeuvres on such short notice. This kind of manoeuvre was unprecedented in the history of Greek warfare. Donald Kagan considers it a most ill-advised move and gives credit to the two captains for disobeying orders that would have probably lost the battle for the Spartans. Others consider it a move that could have succeeded.\n\nIn any case, the Mantineans and the right part of the Argives, the elite Argive Thousand entered the gap and routed the Brasideans and the Sciritae and pursued them for a long distance. In the meantime, the Tegeans and the regular Spartan army routed the Athenians and the Arcadians that formed the left part of the Argive army. Most of them did not even stand to fight, but they fled as the Spartans approached; some were even trampled in their hurry to get away before the enemy reached them.\n\nThen the Spartans turned left and broke the Argive right which fled in total disarray. The Spartans did not pursue the enemy for long after the battle was won.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Argive side lost about 1,100 men (700 Argives and Arcadians, 200 Athenians and 200 Mantineans) and the Spartans about 300.\n\nThe Spartans sent an embassy to Argos and the Argives accepted a truce by the terms of which they gave up Orchomenus, all their hostages and joined up with the Spartans in evicting the Athenians from Epidaurus. They also renounced their alliance with Elis and Athens. After deposing the democratic government of Sicyon, the Argive Thousand staged a coup against the democratic rule of Argos, where the democrats' morale was low, because of the bad performance of the common army and the Athenians in the battle. \n\nIn more general terms, the battle was a considerable boost to the Lacedaemonians' morale and prestige, since after the disaster at Pylos they had been considered cowardly and incompetent in battle. Their success at Mantinea marked a reversal of the trend.\n\n==Sources==\n*Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War''. Athens, Philippos Pappas, Nikolaos Philippas; Athens, Papyros. 1953.\n*Kagan, Donald.

[[Sparta]] and its allies defeated an army led by [[Argos]] and [[Athens]].\n\n==Prelude to the battle==\nAfter the conclusion of the alliance between the Argives, Achaeans, Eleans and Athens, the humiliation of the Spartans in the 420 [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]<ref>Elis vetoed the Spartan participation, preventing them from making due sacrifices at Zeus temple (Thucydides, ''[[The History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' 5:49-50)</ref> and the invasion of [[Epidaurus]] by the allies, the Spartans were compelled to move against them, fearing an alliance with Corinth and having amassed an army that was, according to [[Thucydides]], 'the best army ever assembled in Greece to that time'. However, the Spartan king [[Agis II|Agis]] (son of [[Archidamus II|Archidamus]]) instead concluded the first campaign with a truce, without explaining his actions to the army or his allies; the army thus returned home. Immediately afterwards, the Argives denounced the truce and resumed the war, capturing the key town of [[Orchomenus (Arcadia)|Orchomenus]]; as a result, anger at Agis was such that he was on the verge of being fined 100,000 [[drachma]]s and having his house destroyed.  Agis managed to forestall this punishment, promising to redeem himself with a victory elsewhere.<ref>Thucydides, ''The History of the Peloponnesian War'' 5:63</ref>  The [[ephors]] consented, but in an unprecedented move, placed Agis under the supervision of ten advisors, called ''[[xymbouloi]]'', whose consent was required for whatever military action he wished to take.\n\n==The battle==\nLate in 418, the Argives and their allies marched against [[Tegea]], where a faction was ready to turn the city over to the [[Argive alliance]]. Tegea   controlled the exit from Laconia. Enemy control of the town would mean that the Spartans would be unable to move out of their home city and would effectively mean the demise of the Peloponnesian coalition that fought the [[Peloponnesian War#The \"Archidamian War\"|Archidamian War]].\n\nAgis marched the whole of the Spartan army, together with the [[neodamodeis]] and everyone who was able to fight in Sparta out to [[Tegea]] where he was joined by his allies from [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], and he sent for help from his northern allies, [[ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Boeotia]], [[Phocis]], and [[Locris]].
