Unionist postcard 1912]]\n'''Unionism in Ireland''' is a political tradition on the island that professes loyalty to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Crown]] and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from The [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang a United Irish insurgent, Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\n\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]], an insurrection joined in the south by Catholic peasantry.'''\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012. P. 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Linked with England, the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal; and the Catholics would have less inducement to look beyond that indulgence which is consistent with the security of our establishment.<ref>Castlereagh to Sir Laurence Parsons, 28 November 1798, Castlereagh Correspondence, vol. 11, pp. 32-35</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, opposition from within this \"establishment,\" and not least from the King, [[King George III|George III]], obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as \"the very logic of the Union.\"<ref>Bew (2012). p.126</ref> The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and emoluments, he put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nIn decades that followed the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union (1800)]] Protestants of every sectarian persuasion and class reconciled to the loss of an Irish parliament. The legislative union with [[Great Britain]] was seen to not only to occasion their relative prosperity but, as the Roman Catholic majority in Ireland began to stir and gather in a new national movement, also to guarantee their \"liberty.\"\n\n===Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of Nationalist Ireland===\n[[File:Catholic ascendency.jpg|thumb|right|Catholic Emancipation as a world turned upside down: held aloft, Daniel O'Connell promises whigs--symbol of Ascendancy rank and property--for \"ye all.\"]]\nIt took the Union thirty years to deliver on the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829)\u2014to admit Catholics to Parliament--and permit an erosion of the Protestant monopoly on position and influence.  An opportunity, had the Union been earlier \"complete,\" to integrate Catholics through their re-emerging propertied and professional classes as a \"dilute minority\" may have passed. As it was, on the morrow of Emancipation it was clear they had chosen \"another route.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title = Modern Ireland 1600-1972t|last = Foster|first = R.

Emancipated within the jurisdiction of the [[Westminster]] parliament, Catholics had to preface principle with the vindication of an historical right\u2014of the Irish as \u201ca people\u201d deserving of a separate representation.  Ireland was re-imagined as a political nation through popular history, balladry, and literature which chronicled the centuries-long resistance of \"the [[Gaels|Gael]]\" and, when all else was lost, of the \"dark days\" of endurance under the [[Penal Laws]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Inventing the Nation: Ireland|last = Comerford|first = R.V.|publisher = Arnold|year = 2003|isbn=0-340-73112-5|location = London}}</ref> Scarcely avoided was the suggestion that in this \"story of the nation\" Irish Protestants were, as [[John Banim]] (the \"[[Walter Scott]] of Ireland\") proposed, \"half-countrymen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = When God Took Sides: Religion and Identity in Irish History - Unfinished History|last = Elliott|first = Marianne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn=978-0-19-920693-3|location = Oxford|page = 38 }}</ref>\n\nOne response to this imputation of \"foreignness\" to Protestants was inscribed defiantly upon the [[Williamite]] banners of the marching [[Orange Order]]: \"[[Siege of Derry|Derry]], [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]], and the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]],\" \"Sons of Conquerors.\" But short of embracing what Catholics viewed as Ascendancy \"triumphalism,\" the difficulty for Protestants in orientating themselves to the national movement was acute.

This was a revivalist movement that owed much to Ulster-Presbyterian ministries in the United States (from where Cooke received his doctorate). The belief it carried in personal empowerment through faith was to lend itself in Ireland to a politically-charged prosperity gospel. ''In The Mystery Solved: or, Ireland's Miseries; the Grand Cause and Cure'', a work that caused a \"sensation\" on its publication in 1852 (a copy was sent to every member of Parliament, and one was \"graciously accepted\" by Queen Victoria),  Dr. Edward Marcus Dill, a \"General  missionary agent\" of the Presbyterian Assembly, argued that the poverty of Catholic Ireland  was rooted, not in a history of political disability, but in a counterfeit faith.<ref>.{{cite web||author=W.

The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall. In the British [[House of Commons]] Butt was seconded by another maverick from the north, a Catholic convert, [[Joseph Biggar]]. Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern (albeit half-American) Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction--toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North--textiles, engineering, shipbuilding--for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922|last=MacRaild|first=Donald|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0-312-22032-7|location=London}}</ref>--to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922|last=Buckland|first=Patrick|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1973|location=London|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''. Richard English, Graham Walker eds., Macmillan London. pp. 19-40. p. 20</ref> Speakers and observers dwelt on the diversity of creed, class and party represented among the 12,300 delegates attending. As reported by the [[Northern Whig]] there were \"the old tenant-righters of the 'sixties' . . . the sturdy reformers of Antrim. . . the Unitarians of Down, always progressive in their politics . . . the old-fashioned Tories of the Counties . . . modern Conservatives . . .

The Conservatives formed a new ministry.\n\n===Constructive Unionism===\n[[File:Flag of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (1893\u20131907).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]], 1893\u20131907]]\nThe new Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who had expressed the view that \"free representative institutions\" are best confined to \"people who are of [[Nordic race|Teutonic race]],\" believed his government should \"leave Home Rule sleeping the sleep of the unjust.\"<ref>Bardon (2008). p. 418</ref> Irish Conservatives applauded when in 1887 Dublin Castle was given standing power to suspend [[habeas corpus]]. However, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, his nephew [[Gerald Balfour]], determined upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d course, pursuing reforms intended, as some saw it, to \u201ckill home rule with kindness.\u201d\n\nFor the express purpose of relieving poverty and reducing emigration, in the \u201c[[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|congested districts]]\u201d of the west Balfour initiated a programme not only of public works, but of subsidy for local craft industries. A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903. They had ceased to be an effective social or political influence.\n\n==\"The Ulster Option\" 1905-1920==\n===\"The democracy of Ulster\"===\n[[File:Unionist clubs marching down Donegall Square North, Belfast, 9 April 1912 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Unionist march in Belfast, 9 April 1912]]\nIn 1905 the Ulster Unionist Council was established to represent all shades of unionism in the north. Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J. Connolly, The Oxford Companion to Irish History. Oxford University Press. p. 302</ref> (In 1903 its founder, Tom Sloan, had been the only Unionist MP to vote for the Miners' Eight Hour bill).\n\nLoyalist workers were conscious, and resentful, of the imputation that they were the retainers of \u201cbig-house unionists.\u201d  A manifesto signed in the spring of 1914 by two thousand labour men, on behalf of the only \u201cfully organised and articulate\u201d trade unionists in Ireland, repudiated the suggestion of the radical and socialist press that Ulster was being manipulated by \u201can aristocratic plot.\u201d If Sir Edward Carson led in the battle for the Union it was \u201cbecause we, the workers, the people, the democracy of Ulster, have chosen him.\u201d  Chairman of the Boilermakers\u2019 Society, J. Hanna, insisted that it was as the \u201cfreemen and as members of the greatest democracy in Great Britain and Ireland, the organised trade unions of the country,\u201d that \u201cthey would not have Home Rule.\u201d<ref>John Biggs-Davison, ''The Hand is Red''. London, Johnson. 1973. P. 74</ref>\n\nThe difficulty for nationalists and for those, like [[James Connolly]], who believed that class solidarity should draw workers down the path of national independence, was that without having to break political ranks with their employers, workers were beginning to see that \u201cgreatest democracy\u201d was paying dividends. Thanks to the legislative union, in whose defence Unionists among them effectively voted Conservative, workers in Ireland were able to benefit from the majorities found \u201cacross the water\u201d for labour and social reform-\u2014under the a Liberal-majority government from 1906, for the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], for the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] and for the \u201c[[People's Budget]] 1911. \u00a0\n\nThe nationalist cause in the industrial North was not helped by those who suggested that collective bargaining, social security and progressive taxation were principles for which majorities would not be as readily found in a Dublin Parliament. Objecting to an \u201cinefficient and extravagant government . . . which had no parallel in Europe,\u201d ''[[Sinn Fein]]'' President [[Arthur Griffith]] proposed that \u201cimperialism and socialism\u2014forms of the cosmopolitan heresy and in essence one\u2014have offered man the material world.

Athol Press, p.12</ref> For Ulster workers, as for Ulster employers, there was interest and calculation in a common Unionism.\n\nIn an open letter to U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], in 1918 Edward Carson wrote:<ref>{{Cite book|title = Two Irelands Beyond the Sea: Ulster Unionism and America, 1880-1920|last = Flewelling|first = Lindsey|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2018|isbn = 978-1-78694-045-2|location = Oxford|pages = 73\u201374}}</ref><blockquote>The Ulstermen of to-day, forming as they do the chief industrial community in Ireland, are as devoted adherents to the cause of democratic freedom as were their forefathers in the eighteenth century.

A total of 234,046 women signed the Ulster Women's Declaration; 237,368 men signed the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ulster Covenant|last=Gordon|first=Lucy|publisher=Ulster society|year=1989|location=Belfast}}</ref>\n\nUnionist women had been involved in political campaigning from the time of the first Home Rule Bill in 1886. Some were active [[suffragette]]s. [[Isabella Tod]], an anti-Home Rule Liberal and campaigner for girls education, was an early pioneer. In 1873 she founded the Northern Irish branch of the [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]]. Later, while still based in Belfast, this became the [[Irish Women's Suffrage Society]] publishing the weekly ''The Irish Citizen''.<ref>Courtney (2013). pp. 240-241</ref>\n\nNot all IWSS Unionists were impressed by the Women's Declaration. Elizabeth McCracken, a regular contributor to ''The Irish Citizen'' and the [[Belfast News Letter]] noted the failure Unionist women to formulate \"any demand on their own behalf or that of their own sex.\"<ref>History Ireland, Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis, https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/</ref> The Declaration, nonetheless, was a political affirmation of intent by women, organised and publicly staged by women--the Ulster Women's Unionist Council. Founded in January 1911, by 1913, with well over 100,000 members, the UWUC was the largest women's political group in Ireland.\n\nDetermined to \"sink all differences in favour of the Union,\" the UWUC avoided public comment on the suffrage question. But for many women signing the Council's Declaration was a first taste of political involvement. In September 1913 it appeared that the Unionist Council had determined it should not be their last. The Council informed the UWUC that \"the draft articles\" for a Provisional Government to be set up in the event of Home Rule being legislated \"include the franchise for women.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/|title=Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis|accessdate=8 March 2020|author=History Ireland}}</ref> The Irish Parliamentary Party made no such commitment for a Dublin parliament.  In contrast to Ulster Unionists who divided, in 1912 the Nationalists had voted as a block against a \"Conciliation\" Bill that would have conceded the principle of women suffrage, albeit on a highly restrictive property basis.<ref>Burke, Jason (2018), \"Carson's Betrayal of Women?

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23rd, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been--as Carson later accounted it--a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \u201ctypical Irishman\u201d\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland.

The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster.

A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . .

But the plan evoked no nationalist response.<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973). p. 94</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Khaki election]]\" of December 1918, the first Westminster poll since 1910 and the first with all adult males and women from age thirty eligible to vote (the electorate tripled), the IPP was almost wholly replaced in nationalist constituencies by Sinn F\u00e9in. Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held. But in \"Southern Ireland\" this was for parliament which, by British agreement, would now constitute itself as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the twenty-six counties were to have the \"same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of [[Canada]].\"<ref> {{cite web|title= The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921|url=http://www.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm/|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> It was not clear to all parties at the time\u2014civil war ensued\u2014but this was de facto independence.\n\nUnionists in Northern Ireland thus found themselves in the unanticipated and unsought position of having to work a constitutional arrangement that was the \u201cby-product of the desperate attempt by British statesmen\u201d to reconcile \u201cthe determination of the Protestant population of the North to remain firmly and without qualification within the United Kingdom\u201d with the aspirations of the Nationalist majority in Ireland for Irish unity and independence,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lessons of Ulster|last = Utley|first = T.E.|publisher = J.M.

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book|title =Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics|last = Mathews|first = Kevin|publisher = University College Dublin Press|year = 2004|location = Dublin|isbn=978-1904558057|pages = 310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964|last = Lawrence|first = R.J..|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1965|location = Oxford|pages = 40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first act of Northern Ireland legislature was to overturn a British attempt to maximise the representation of a minority-populated \"centre ground.\" In 1919 [[proportional representation]] (PR) had been prescribed for all Irish elections. In the January 1920 urban council elections in Ulster preference voting assisted nationalists to the control of 21 of 45 townships, including [[Omagh]], [[Newry]] and \"what was the greatest blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]].<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref>  In Belfast, where under the old [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]] Unionists had taken 52 of 60 council seats, under PR the nationalists were able to take ten, although perhaps \"most disturbing to Carson and his followers\" was the success of twelve labour candidates (ten for the independent [[Belfast Labour Party]]).<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 20</ref>  In the county, and rural district, council elections that followed in June 1920 nationalists took control of two of the six counties (Fermanagh and, for the first time Tyrone) and 36 of the 55 districts.\n\nThe twelve anti-partitionist MPs returned in May 1921 to the fifty-two member Northern parliament refused to take their seats. They joined nationalist councillors, and large numbers of Catholic school officials and teachers, in pledging themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

It was an almost entirely Protestant force, an excuse the nationalists alleged for arming Orangemen.

Second, the Government accepted an offer from London--understood as a reward for the province's wartime service--to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union.

The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref> \n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled. Unlike the established family firms and skilled-trades apprenticeships that had  been \"a backbone of unionism and protestant privilege,\" the new companies readily employed Catholics and women.<ref>Wichert (1981). pp. 87-89</ref> \n\nUnionist unease was particularly acute in Derry and the west.<ref>{{Cite book |title =Ireland Since 1939, the Persistence of Conflict|last = Patterson|first = Henry|publisher = Penguin|year = 2006|location = Dublin|isbn = 978-1844881048|pages = 126-129}}</ref> Already in 1956 O'Neill's predecessor, [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookborough]], had received a delegation \"on industries\" from Derry Unionists \"anxious that we not get an invasion from the other side.\"<ref>Minute prepared for meeting with the Prime Minister, 13 September 1956, Public Records Office Northern Ireland, PRONI Brookeborough Papers, 5/95/10</ref> \nWhen Derry lost out to Coleraine for siting of the [[Ulster University|New University of Ulster]], and to [[Lurgan]] and [[Portadown]] for [[Craigavon|a new urban-industrial development]], some \"from the other side\" suspected a wider conspiracy. Speaking to Labour MPs in London, John Hume suggested that \"the plan\" was \"to develop the strongly Unionist-Belfast-Coleraine-Portadown triangle and to cause a migration from West to East Ulster, redistributing and scattering the minority to that the Unionist Party will not only maintain but strengthen its position.\"<ref>''Derry Journal'', 6 August 1965, cited in Kingsley (1989) pp. 98-99</ref>\n\nHume, a teacher from Derry, presented himself as a spokesman for an emerging \"third force\": a \"generation of younger Catholics in the North\" frustrated with a \"flags and slogans\" nationalism whose seeming indifference to \"the general welfare of Northern Ireland\" had made \"the task of Unionist ascendancy simpler.\" Determined to engage the \"great social problems of housing, unemployment and emigration\", these new \"political wanderers\" were willing to acknowledge that \"the Protestant tradition in the North is as strong and as legitimate\" as their own (if \"a man wishes Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom [that] does not necessarily make him a bigot or a discriminator\") and that Irish unity, \"if it is to come,\" could be achieved only \"by the will of the Northern majority.\"<ref>John Hume (1964), \"The Northern Catholic I\", ''The Irish Times'' (May 18 ), cited in part in Kingsley (1989) pp. 121-123</ref> Although they appeared to meet Unionists half way, Hume and those who joined him in what he proposed would be \"the emergence of normal politics\" presented the Unionist government with a new challenge. Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism. \n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]. Seeking to \"challenge . . . by more vigorous action than Parliamentary questions and newspaper controversy,\" NICRA decided to carry out a programme of marches.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Belfast and Derry in Revolt: a New History of the Start of the Troubles|last1 = Prince|first1 = Simon|last2 = Warner|first2 = Geoffrey|publisher = Irish Academic Press|year = 2019|location = New Bridge, Ireland|isbn = 9781788550932|pages = 34}}</ref>\n\n\"Resembling a traditional nationalist parade\" (complete with renditions of [[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldiers Song]]), the first march sponsored by NICRA in August 1968 into [[Dungannon]] went off comparatively peacefully.

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]]. \n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics. He had been one of the founders of [[Ulster Protestant Action]] (UPA).

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed. \n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election| general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us. And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more. This places at the heart of the conflict the movement for the \"civil rights of the Catholic/Nationalist community.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil Rights and Peace Agreements |last=Bell |first=Chirstine|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=33}}</ref> It is the belief that many in that community came to support or acquiesce in the Republican return to \"physical force\" in 1970-71 because, in the words of [[Eamonn McCann]], the notion that it was possible to achieve full citizenship within the North \"was beaten out of people's heads by the cops and their semi-official auxiliaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=McCann: War and Peace in Northern Ireland |last=McCann |first=Eamonn |year=1998 |publisher=Hot Press Books |location=Dublin|page=145}}</ref><ref>See also {{Cite book|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |last=) Dochtartaigh |first=Nail|year=1997|publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork}} </ref> \n\nAs an account of The Troubles, this is consistent with the broad support that the two main nationalist parties expressed for the provision in the Agreement for a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.

Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and--Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson. If inadvertently, the civil-rights agitation fostered the perceptions of deteriorating security and legitimacy that contributed not only to the introduction of British troops (August 1969) but also, over the course of 1970-71, to the ascendancy within IRA-Sinn F\u00e9in of an ultra-nationalist [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|\"Provisional\" wing]] committed to a return to republicanism's \"physical force\" tradition.<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 172-198</ref><ref>See also Nelson McCausland (2018), \"Why unionists must ensure that the true origins of the civil rights movement are not forgotten\".

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state.

It articulated what were to be the enduring principles of the British approach to a settlement. <blockquote>It is a fact that an element of the minority in Northern Ireland has hitherto seen itself as simply part of the wider Irish community. The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and hose they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO|}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party]]. Faulkner's later successor as party leader, [[James Molyneaux]], argued that the difficulty for most unionists  was not an arrangement in which \"Protestants and Catholics must consent\"--that \"would be comparatively simple.\" It was that, despite a promise not share power with parties \"whose ''primary'' aim is a united Ireland\",<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first= Barry|year=1984|title=John Hume: Statesman of the Troubles|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=9780856403170|pages=140}}</ref> Faulkner had committed them to agreement with \"Republican Catholics\" <ref>Interview with James Molyneaux, 18 May 1982 quoted in {{cite book|last=O'Malley|first= Padraig |year=1983|title=The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today|pages=17, 26, 39|location=Boston|publisher= Houghton Mifflin|isbn=039534414X}}</ref> \n\nHaving drawn on both the [[Republican Labour Party|Republican]], and [[Northern Ireland Labour Party|Northern Ireland, Labour]] parties, and with a commitment to \"accommodate progressive Protestants,\"  the SDLP had announced themselves as something more than nationalist or republican party.<ref>{{cite book|last=Devlin|first= Paddy|year=1993|title=Straight Left: an Autobiography|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=0856405140|pages=191}}</ref> But with PIRA continuing to draw on fury over internment and Bloody Sunday, Eamonn McCann notes that \"in order to sell the deal to the Catholic community the SDLP had to present it not just as a means of expressing its aspiration towards a united Ireland but a means of achieving it\".<ref>McCann (1980), p. 141</ref> The new Health and Social Service Minister, [[Paddy Devlin]], conceded that \"all other issues were governed\" by a drive to \"get all-Ireland institutions established\" that would \"produce the dynamic that would lead ultimately to an agreed united Ireland.\"<ref>Devlin, p. 205</ref> \n\nThe [[Sunningdale Agreement]] envisaged a Council of Ireland comprising, with equal delegations from Dublin and Belfast, a Council of Ministers with \"executive and harmonising functions\" and a Consultative Assembly with \"advisory and review functions.\" As they would only have a plurality of representation on the Northern side, these created the possibility of Unionists being manoeuvred into a minority position. \"In retrospect\", Devlin regretted his party had not \"adopted a two stage approach, by allowing power sharing at Stormont to establish itself\",<ref>Devlin, p. 252</ref> but by the time he and his colleagues recognised the damage they had caused to Faulkner's position by prioritising the \"Irish Dimension\" it was too late. \n\nWithin a week of taking office as First Minister, opposition to the Sunningdale proposals forced Faulkner to resign as UUP leader. In a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|surprise Westminster election]] at the end of February, his new pro-Agreement grouping, the [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]], was rolled over by a [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]] in which the bulk of his old party stood with William Craig's [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Ulster Vanguard]] and Paisley's new electoral vehicle, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]]. Arguing that they had deprived Faulkner of any semblance of a mandate, the victors called for new Assembly elections. \n\nWhen on 14 May the Assembly defeated a motion rejecting the Sunningdale Agreement, Harry Murray, the shipyard convener for the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] (UWC), a loyalist labour coalition, announced a general strike. Within two weeks the UWC, supported by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and UVF paramilitaries, had an effective stranglehold on energy supplies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Don|year=1994|title=Fourteen May Days:\nThe Inside Story of the Loyalist Strike of 1974|location=Dublin|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|isbn=0717121771}}</ref> Concessions sought by Faulkner were blocked by the SDLP.

From the UUP's James Molyneaux there were the familiar objections to \"something very far removed from straightforward democracy\" and which could give republicans an effective \"veto.\"  But with Paisley calling on unionists not to \"lose sight\" of an opportunity for the \"Ulster people\" to \"freely elect their own Assembly and to begin to bring Direct Rule to account\", there was not blanket rejection.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 372-373</ref> That was to come from nationalists.\n\nJohn Hume dismissed the initiative as \"insulting.\" Not only did it imply, with the 70 percent hurdle, a very much higher degree of unionist unanimity and consent than was required in 1973, it suggested that, for the present at least, the Irish Dimension\" would have adequate \"institutional expression\" in an Intergovernmental Council. \"[W]ithout affecting national sovereignty\" this would link not Belfast, but London to Dublin (and at a time when that relationship had frozen as a result of [[1981 Irish hunger strike|PIRA Hunger Strike]] and Irish sympathies for Argentina in the [[Falklands War]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|year=2003|title= 'Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady|location=London|publisher= Jonathan Cape|pages=426}}</ref> Seconded by the Dublin government, SDLP insisted that without of \"a very strong and positive and concrete expression of the Irish identity\" the proposals were unworkable.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 368-369</ref> \n\nThree years later, London appeared to reverse tack. The Thatcher government chose to give a \"strong and positive\" expression to the Irish Dimension ''in advance'' of agreement on devolution. At [[Hillsborough Castle]] in Northern Ireland, with the [[Taoiseach|Irish Taoiseach]], [[Garret FitzGerald]] Thatcher signed an agreement that again proposed an intergovernmental council. This, however, was to give Dublin, for the first time, a formal consultative role in Northern Ireland and in matters beyond security cooperation. The [[British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference|Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] would invite the Irish government to \"put forward views on proposals\" for major legislation concerning Northern Ireland, and it would have a permanent [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]], including officials from the Republic's [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]], quartered in Northern Ireland itself.\n\nThe possibility of deflecting criticism not only from the Republic but also, in the wake of the Hunger Strike, from the United States was part of the British calculation<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bew|first1=Paul|last2=Patterson|first2=Henry|year=1985|title= The British State and the Ulster Crisis: From Wilson to Thatcher|location=London|publisher= Verso Books|isbn=978-0860918158|pages=112}}</ref><ref>Wichert (1991), pp. 194-195.</ref> But it was also recognised in both London and in Dublin, where John Hume was closely advising Fitzgerald,<ref>{{cite book|last=McKitrick|first=David|year=1993|title= Dispatches from Belfast|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|pages=9}}</ref> that something suggestive of joint British-Irish sovereignty might intensify pressure on unionists to climb down from a position of \"simple majority rule.\" Proposals from The Irish government would be entertained only on \"matters [that] are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland\". If a Stormont executive alone could limit the scope of Dublin's involvement, concerned unionists would have to reconsider what they were prepared to offer northern nationalists by way of an accommodation.\n\nThe unionist reaction, Thatcher recalled in her memoirs, was \"worse than anyone had predicted to me\".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 403.</ref> The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) led an \"Ulster says No\"  campaign against the Agreement, that included strikes, [[civil disobedience]] and a mass resignation of unionist MPs from Westminster and suspensions of district council meetings.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement \u2013 Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=1 April 2020}}.

Standing beside Carson the Tory leader [[Andrew Bonar Law]] declared  \u201cI can imagine no lengths of resistance to which Ulster can go in which I would not be prepared to support her.\u201d Now unionists were facing a Conservative government imposition, and a Westminster Labour opposition committed to Irish unity. Seemingly without political options, and possibly to preempt the initiative passing to the paramilitaries, in November 1986 Paisley (not for the first time) announced his own \"third force\": the [[Ulster Resistance]] Movement (URM) who would \"take direct action as and when required.\" Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined. Despite importing arms, some of which were passed on to the UVF and UDA, for the URM the call for \"action\" never came.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ian Paisley death: He was lauded and reviled ... but a

Party]] led by [[Arlene Foster]], followed by the more moderate [[Ulster Unionist Party]] led by [[Robin Swann]]. Both parties are active across [[Northern Ireland]]. On a smaller level, the [[Progressive Unionist Party]], which is the political wing of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) paramilitary group, attracts some support in the greater Belfast area. [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] is opposed to the current constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland following the [[Belfast Agreement]] and [[St Andrews Agreement]]. The pluralist [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is currently allied to the Ulster Unionist Party. While the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] supports the status quo position of Northern Ireland, it does not define itself as Unionist.\n\nModerate unionists who support the principle of [[Equal Citizenship]] between Northern Ireland and Great Britain have campaigned for mainstream British political parties to organise and contest elections in Northern Ireland. Equal citizenship pressure groups have included the [[Campaign for Equal Citizenship]] (CEC), [[Labour Representation Campaign]], [[Democracy Now (UK pressure group)|Democracy Now]] and, currently, [[Labour - Federation of Labour Groups]]. Momentum for this concept picked up after the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party Conference voted in favour of working in Northern Ireland in 1989.

While nationalism has had a number of Protestant leaders (for instance, [[Henry Grattan]], [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Douglas Hyde]]), unionism was invariably always led by Protestant leaders and politicians. Prior to a decades-long ban, Catholics had been allowed to be members of the UUP as recently as the 1920s, including [[Denis Henry]] (the first [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]), who was a member of the UUP from its foundation in 1905 and a UUP MP for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy\" Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]]. Several generations of one Unionist political family, the Dockrells, won election as [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TDs). The Dublin borough of [[Rathmines]] had a unionist majority up to the late 1920s, when a local government re-organisation abolished all Dublin borough councils. Later, the Earl of Granard and the Provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]] gained appointment to the President of Ireland's advisory body, the [[Council of State]]. Most Irish Unionists, however, simply withdrew from public life, and from the late 1920s there were no self-professed Unionists elected to the Irish parliament until the election of [[Ian Marshall (farmer)|Ian Marshall]] to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43920260|title=Sinn F\u00e9in votes help unionist into Irish senate|last=Adair|first=Gordon|date=27 April 2018|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110222065415/http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/southernunis.htm 1998 Review of \"Crisis and Decline; the fate of the Southern Unionists\"] by [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Unionism in Northern Ireland===\n* [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]\n* [[Politics of Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border]]\n* [[Ulster loyalism]]\n* [[Ulster Scots people]]\n\n===Southern unionism===\n* [[Anglo-Irish people]]\n* [[Reform Group (Ireland)]]\n* [[West Brit]]\n\n===Unionism in Great Britain===\n* [[Scotch-Irish Americans]]\n* [[Unionism in England]]\n* [[Unionism in Scotland]]\n* [[Unionism in the United Kingdom]]\n\n===Unionist political parties===\n* [[Conservative Party (UK)]], officially the Conservative and Unionist Party (1830\u2013present)\n* [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (1905\u2013present)\n* [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (1971\u2013present)\n* [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (1978\u2013present)\n* [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP 1993\u2013present)\n* [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] (2007\u2013present)\n\n* [[Liberal Unionist Party]] (1886\u20131912)\n* [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (1891\u20131922)\n* [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1941\u20131970)\n* [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] (1949\u20131987)\n* [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party]] (1973\u20131978)\n* [[Volunteer Political Party]] (1974\u20131975)\n* [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1974\u20131981)\n* [[United Ulster Unionist Party]] (1975\u20131984)\n* [[Donegal Progressive Party]] (1970s\u20132000s)\n* [[Ulster Popular Unionist Party]] (1980\u20131995)\n* [[Ulster Democratic Party|Ulster (Loyalist) Democratic Party]] (1982\u20132001)\n* [[UK Unionist Party]] (UKUP 1995\u20132007)\n* [[United Unionist Coalition]] (1998\u20132012)\n* [[Northern Ireland Unionist Party]] (1999\u20132008)\n* [[NI21]] (2013\u20132016)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Articles===\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211101921/http://www.obelus.org/index.php?artID=11 Anonymous (2005) Obelus.org \"Ulster Unionism: dead but not gone\"]\n*[https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-dog-that-didnt-bark-southern-unionism-in-pre-and-post-revolutionary-ireland/] \u00d3 Beach\u00e1in, D.

Unionist postcard 1912]]\n'''Unionism in Ireland''' is a political tradition on the island that professes loyalty to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Crown]] and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from The [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang a United Irish insurgent, Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\n\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]], an insurrection joined in the south by Catholic peasantry.'''\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012. P. 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Linked with England, the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal; and the Catholics would have less inducement to look beyond that indulgence which is consistent with the security of our establishment.<ref>Castlereagh to Sir Laurence Parsons, 28 November 1798, Castlereagh Correspondence, vol. 11, pp. 32-35</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, opposition from within this \"establishment,\" and not least from the King, [[King George III|George III]], obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as \"the very logic of the Union.\"<ref>Bew (2012). p.126</ref> The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and emoluments, he put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nIn decades that followed the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union (1800)]] Protestants of every sectarian persuasion and class reconciled to the loss of an Irish parliament. The legislative union with [[Great Britain]] was seen to not only to occasion their relative prosperity but, as the Roman Catholic majority in Ireland began to stir and gather in a new national movement, also to guarantee their \"liberty.\"\n\n===Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of Nationalist Ireland===\n[[File:Catholic ascendency.jpg|thumb|right|Catholic Emancipation as a world turned upside down: held aloft, Daniel O'Connell promises whigs--symbol of Ascendancy rank and property--for \"ye all.\"]]\nIt took the Union thirty years to deliver on the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829)\u2014to admit Catholics to Parliament--and permit an erosion of the Protestant monopoly on position and influence.  An opportunity, had the Union been earlier \"complete,\" to integrate Catholics through their re-emerging propertied and professional classes as a \"dilute minority\" may have passed. As it was, on the morrow of Emancipation it was clear they had chosen \"another route.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title = Modern Ireland 1600-1972t|last = Foster|first = R.

Emancipated within the jurisdiction of the [[Westminster]] parliament, Catholics had to preface principle with the vindication of an historical right\u2014of the Irish as \u201ca people\u201d deserving of a separate representation.  Ireland was re-imagined as a political nation through popular history, balladry, and literature which chronicled the centuries-long resistance of \"the [[Gaels|Gael]]\" and, when all else was lost, of the \"dark days\" of endurance under the [[Penal Laws]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Inventing the Nation: Ireland|last = Comerford|first = R.V.|publisher = Arnold|year = 2003|isbn=0-340-73112-5|location = London}}</ref> Scarcely avoided was the suggestion that in this \"story of the nation\" Irish Protestants were, as [[John Banim]] (the \"[[Walter Scott]] of Ireland\") proposed, \"half-countrymen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = When God Took Sides: Religion and Identity in Irish History - Unfinished History|last = Elliott|first = Marianne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn=978-0-19-920693-3|location = Oxford|page = 38 }}</ref>\n\nOne response to this imputation of \"foreignness\" to Protestants was inscribed defiantly upon the [[Williamite]] banners of the marching [[Orange Order]]: \"[[Siege of Derry|Derry]], [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]], and the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]],\" \"Sons of Conquerors.\" But short of embracing what Catholics viewed as Ascendancy \"triumphalism,\" the difficulty for Protestants in orientating themselves to the national movement was acute. It was made more so by the reality that in the greater part of country the only element around which the movement could reliably build was the Catholic clergy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=MacDonagh|first=Oliver|title=The Politicisation of the Irish Catholic Bishops 1800-1850 |journal=The Historical Journal|date=1975|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37\u201353|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638467?seq=1}}</ref>\n\n===Protestant unity and the New Reformation===\n\n[[Image:Protestant Unity.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1899 penny print of Henry Cooke's 1841 speech in \"reply to Daniel O'Connell\"]]\nIn an incident celebrated by unionists, in 1841, disdaining to engage a \"bully . . . the Cock of the North,\" O\u2019Connell refused the challenge of the then Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly, [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]], to debate Repeal in Belfast.\n<blockquote>Look at the town of Belfast.

This was a revivalist movement that owed much to Ulster-Presbyterian ministries in the United States (from where Cooke received his doctorate). The belief it carried in personal empowerment through faith was to lend itself in Ireland to a politically-charged prosperity gospel. ''In The Mystery Solved: or, Ireland's Miseries; the Grand Cause and Cure'', a work that caused a \"sensation\" on its publication in 1852 (a copy was sent to every member of Parliament, and one was \"graciously accepted\" by Queen Victoria),  Dr. Edward Marcus Dill, a \"General  missionary agent\" of the Presbyterian Assembly, argued that the poverty of Catholic Ireland  was rooted, not in a history of political disability, but in a counterfeit faith.<ref>.{{cite web||author=W.

Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall. In the British [[House of Commons]] Butt was seconded by another maverick from the north, a Catholic convert, [[Joseph Biggar]]. Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern (albeit half-American) Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction--toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North--textiles, engineering, shipbuilding--for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922|last=MacRaild|first=Donald|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0-312-22032-7|location=London}}</ref>--to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922|last=Buckland|first=Patrick|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1973|location=London|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''. Richard English, Graham Walker eds., Macmillan London. pp. 19-40. p. 20</ref> Speakers and observers dwelt on the diversity of creed, class and party represented among the 12,300 delegates attending. As reported by the [[Northern Whig]] there were \"the old tenant-righters of the 'sixties' . . . the sturdy reformers of Antrim. . . the Unitarians of Down, always progressive in their politics . . . the old-fashioned Tories of the Counties . . . modern Conservatives . . .

The Conservatives formed a new ministry.\n\n===Constructive Unionism===\n[[File:Flag of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (1893\u20131907).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]], 1893\u20131907]]\nThe new Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who had expressed the view that \"free representative institutions\" are best confined to \"people who are of [[Nordic race|Teutonic race]],\" believed his government should \"leave Home Rule sleeping the sleep of the unjust.\"<ref>Bardon (2008). p. 418</ref> Irish Conservatives applauded when in 1887 Dublin Castle was given standing power to suspend [[habeas corpus]]. However, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, his nephew [[Gerald Balfour]], determined upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d course, pursuing reforms intended, as some saw it, to \u201ckill home rule with kindness.\u201d\n\nFor the express purpose of relieving poverty and reducing emigration, in the \u201c[[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|congested districts]]\u201d of the west Balfour initiated a programme not only of public works, but of subsidy for local craft industries. A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903. They had ceased to be an effective social or political influence.\n\n==\"The Ulster Option\" 1905-1920==\n===\"The democracy of Ulster\"===\n[[File:Unionist clubs marching down Donegall Square North, Belfast, 9 April 1912 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Unionist march in Belfast, 9 April 1912]]\nIn 1905 the Ulster Unionist Council was established to represent all shades of unionism in the north. Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J. Connolly, The Oxford Companion to Irish History. Oxford University Press. p. 302</ref> (In 1903 its founder, Tom Sloan, had been the only Unionist MP to vote for the Miners' Eight Hour bill).\n\nLoyalist workers were conscious, and resentful, of the imputation that they were the retainers of \u201cbig-house unionists.\u201d  A manifesto signed in the spring of 1914 by two thousand labour men, on behalf of the only \u201cfully organised and articulate\u201d trade unionists in Ireland, repudiated the suggestion of the radical and socialist press that Ulster was being manipulated by \u201can aristocratic plot.\u201d If Sir Edward Carson led in the battle for the Union it was \u201cbecause we, the workers, the people, the democracy of Ulster, have chosen him.\u201d  Chairman of the Boilermakers\u2019 Society, J. Hanna, insisted that it was as the \u201cfreemen and as members of the greatest democracy in Great Britain and Ireland, the organised trade unions of the country,\u201d that \u201cthey would not have Home Rule.\u201d<ref>John Biggs-Davison, ''The Hand is Red''. London, Johnson. 1973. P. 74</ref>\n\nThe difficulty for nationalists and for those, like [[James Connolly]], who believed that class solidarity should draw workers down the path of national independence, was that without having to break political ranks with their employers, workers were beginning to see that \u201cgreatest democracy\u201d was paying dividends. Thanks to the legislative union, in whose defence Unionists among them effectively voted Conservative, workers in Ireland were able to benefit from the majorities found \u201cacross the water\u201d for labour and social reform-\u2014under the a Liberal-majority government from 1906, for the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], for the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] and for the \u201c[[People's Budget]] 1911. \u00a0\n\nThe nationalist cause in the industrial North was not helped by those who suggested that collective bargaining, social security and progressive taxation were principles for which majorities would not be as readily found in a Dublin Parliament. Objecting to an \u201cinefficient and extravagant government . . . which had no parallel in Europe,\u201d ''[[Sinn Fein]]'' President [[Arthur Griffith]] proposed that \u201cimperialism and socialism\u2014forms of the cosmopolitan heresy and in essence one\u2014have offered man the material world. Nationalism has offered him a free soul<ref>\u201dPat Walsh (1994), ''Irish Republicanism and Socialism'', Belfast. Athol Press, p.12</ref> For Ulster workers, as for Ulster employers, there was interest and calculation in a common Unionism.\n\nIn an open letter to U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], in 1918 Edward Carson wrote:<ref>{{Cite book|title = Two Irelands Beyond the Sea: Ulster Unionism and America, 1880-1920|last = Flewelling|first = Lindsey|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2018|isbn = 978-1-78694-045-2|location = Oxford|pages = 73\u201374}}</ref><blockquote>The Ulstermen of to-day, forming as they do the chief industrial community in Ireland, are as devoted adherents to the cause of democratic freedom as were their forefathers in the eighteenth century.

A total of 234,046 women signed the Ulster Women's Declaration; 237,368 men signed the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ulster Covenant|last=Gordon|first=Lucy|publisher=Ulster society|year=1989|location=Belfast}}</ref>\n\nUnionist women had been involved in political campaigning from the time of the first Home Rule Bill in 1886. Some were active [[suffragette]]s. [[Isabella Tod]], an anti-Home Rule Liberal and campaigner for girls education, was an early pioneer. In 1873 she founded the Northern Irish branch of the [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]]. Later, while still based in Belfast, this became the [[Irish Women's Suffrage Society]] publishing the weekly ''The Irish Citizen''.<ref>Courtney (2013). pp. 240-241</ref>\n\nNot all IWSS Unionists were impressed by the Women's Declaration. Elizabeth McCracken, a regular contributor to ''The Irish Citizen'' and the [[Belfast News Letter]] noted the failure Unionist women to formulate \"any demand on their own behalf or that of their own sex.\"<ref>History Ireland, Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis, https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/</ref> The Declaration, nonetheless, was a political affirmation of intent by women, organised and publicly staged by women--the Ulster Women's Unionist Council. Founded in January 1911, by 1913, with well over 100,000 members, the UWUC was the largest women's political group in Ireland.\n\nDetermined to \"sink all differences in favour of the Union,\" the UWUC avoided public comment on the suffrage question. But for many women signing the Council's Declaration was a first taste of political involvement. In September 1913 it appeared that the Unionist Council had determined it should not be their last. The Council informed the UWUC that \"the draft articles\" for a Provisional Government to be set up in the event of Home Rule being legislated \"include the franchise for women.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/|title=Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis|accessdate=8 March 2020|author=History Ireland}}</ref> The Irish Parliamentary Party made no such commitment for a Dublin parliament.  In contrast to Ulster Unionists who divided, in 1912 the Nationalists had voted as a block against a \"Conciliation\" Bill that would have conceded the principle of women suffrage, albeit on a highly restrictive property basis.<ref>Burke, Jason (2018), \"Carson's Betrayal of Women?

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23rd, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been--as Carson later accounted it--a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \u201ctypical Irishman\u201d\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland.

The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4th 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . . We do not seeks to purchase terms by selling our patriotism.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title =Dividing Ireland: World War One and Partition|last = Hennessey|first = Thomas|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|location = London|pages = 72}}</ref>\n\nThat, however, was how Redmond's position came to be perceived on the nationalist side.

Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held. But in \"Southern Ireland\" this was for parliament which, by British agreement, would now constitute itself as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the twenty-six counties were to have the \"same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of [[Canada]].\"<ref> {{cite web|title= The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921|url=http://www.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm/|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> It was not clear to all parties at the time\u2014civil war ensued\u2014but this was de facto independence.\n\nUnionists in Northern Ireland thus found themselves in the unanticipated and unsought position of having to work a constitutional arrangement that was the \u201cby-product of the desperate attempt by British statesmen\u201d to reconcile \u201cthe determination of the Protestant population of the North to remain firmly and without qualification within the United Kingdom\u201d with the aspirations of the Nationalist majority in Ireland for Irish unity and independence,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lessons of Ulster|last = Utley|first = T.E.|publisher = J.M.

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book|title =Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics|last = Mathews|first = Kevin|publisher = University College Dublin Press|year = 2004|location = Dublin|isbn=978-1904558057|pages = 310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964|last = Lawrence|first = R.J..|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1965|location = Oxford|pages = 40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first act of Northern Ireland legislature was to overturn a British attempt to maximise the representation of a minority-populated \"centre ground.\" In 1919 [[proportional representation]] (PR) had been prescribed for all Irish elections. In the January 1920 urban council elections in Ulster preference voting assisted nationalists to the control of 21 of 45 townships, including [[Omagh]], [[Newry]] and \"what was the greatest blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]].<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref>  In Belfast, where under the old [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]] Unionists had taken 52 of 60 council seats, under PR the nationalists were able to take ten, although perhaps \"most disturbing to Carson and his followers\" was the success of twelve labour candidates (ten for the independent [[Belfast Labour Party]]).<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 20</ref>  In the county, and rural district, council elections that followed in June 1920 nationalists took control of two of the six counties (Fermanagh and, for the first time Tyrone) and 36 of the 55 districts.\n\nThe twelve anti-partitionist MPs returned in May 1921 to the fifty-two member Northern parliament refused to take their seats. They joined nationalist councillors, and large numbers of Catholic school officials and teachers, in pledging themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

It was an almost entirely Protestant force, an excuse the nationalists alleged for arming Orangemen.

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref> {{cite web|title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London--understood as a reward for the province's wartime service--to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title = History of Northern Ireland|last = Buckland|first = Patrick|publisher =Gill & Macmillan|year = 1981|location = Dublin|isbn = 9780717110698|pages = 83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security.

A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref> \n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled. Unlike the established family firms and skilled-trades apprenticeships that had  been \"a backbone of unionism and protestant privilege,\" the new companies readily employed Catholics and women.<ref>Wichert (1981). pp. 87-89</ref> \n\nUnionist unease was particularly acute in Derry and the west.<ref>{{Cite book |title =Ireland Since 1939, the Persistence of Conflict|last = Patterson|first = Henry|publisher = Penguin|year = 2006|location = Dublin|isbn = 978-1844881048|pages = 126-129}}</ref> Already in 1956 O'Neill's predecessor, [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookborough]], had received a delegation \"on industries\" from Derry Unionists \"anxious that we not get an invasion from the other side.\"<ref>Minute prepared for meeting with the Prime Minister, 13 September 1956, Public Records Office Northern Ireland, PRONI Brookeborough Papers, 5/95/10</ref> \nWhen Derry lost out to Coleraine for siting of the [[Ulster University|New University of Ulster]], and to [[Lurgan]] and [[Portadown]] for [[Craigavon|a new urban-industrial development]], some \"from the other side\" suspected a wider conspiracy. Speaking to Labour MPs in London, John Hume suggested that \"the plan\" was \"to develop the strongly Unionist-Belfast-Coleraine-Portadown triangle and to cause a migration from West to East Ulster, redistributing and scattering the minority to that the Unionist Party will not only maintain but strengthen its position.\"<ref>''Derry Journal'', 6 August 1965, cited in Kingsley (1989) pp. 98-99</ref>\n\nHume, a teacher from Derry, presented himself as a spokesman for an emerging \"third force\": a \"generation of younger Catholics in the North\" frustrated with a \"flags and slogans\" nationalism whose seeming indifference to \"the general welfare of Northern Ireland\" had made \"the task of Unionist ascendancy simpler.\" Determined to engage the \"great social problems of housing, unemployment and emigration\", these new \"political wanderers\" were willing to acknowledge that \"the Protestant tradition in the North is as strong and as legitimate\" as their own (if \"a man wishes Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom [that] does not necessarily make him a bigot or a discriminator\") and that Irish unity, \"if it is to come,\" could be achieved only \"by the will of the Northern majority.\"<ref>John Hume (1964), \"The Northern Catholic I\", ''The Irish Times'' (May 18 ), cited in part in Kingsley (1989) pp. 121-123</ref> Although they appeared to meet Unionists half way, Hume and those who joined him in what he proposed would be \"the emergence of normal politics\" presented the Unionist government with a new challenge. Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism. \n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]. Seeking to \"challenge . . . by more vigorous action than Parliamentary questions and newspaper controversy,\" NICRA decided to carry out a programme of marches.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Belfast and Derry in Revolt: a New History of the Start of the Troubles|last1 = Prince|first1 = Simon|last2 = Warner|first2 = Geoffrey|publisher = Irish Academic Press|year = 2019|location = New Bridge, Ireland|isbn = 9781788550932|pages = 34}}</ref>\n\n\"Resembling a traditional nationalist parade\" (complete with renditions of [[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldiers Song]]), the first march sponsored by NICRA in August 1968 into [[Dungannon]] went off comparatively peacefully.

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]]. \n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics.

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed. \n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election| general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us. And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more. This places at the heart of the conflict the movement for the \"civil rights of the Catholic/Nationalist community.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil Rights and Peace Agreements |last=Bell |first=Chirstine|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=33}}</ref> It is the belief that many in that community came to support or acquiesce in the Republican return to \"physical force\" in 1970-71 because, in the words of [[Eamonn McCann]], the notion that it was possible to achieve full citizenship within the North \"was beaten out of people's heads by the cops and their semi-official auxiliaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=McCann: War and Peace in Northern Ireland |last=McCann |first=Eamonn |year=1998 |publisher=Hot Press Books |location=Dublin|page=145}}</ref><ref>See also {{Cite book|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |last=) Dochtartaigh |first=Nail|year=1997|publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork}} </ref> \n\nAs an account of The Troubles, this is consistent with the broad support that the two main nationalist parties expressed for the provision in the Agreement for a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.

Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and--Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson. If inadvertently, the civil-rights agitation fostered the perceptions of deteriorating security and legitimacy that contributed not only to the introduction of British troops (August 1969) but also, over the course of 1970-71, to the ascendancy within IRA-Sinn F\u00e9in of an ultra-nationalist [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|\"Provisional\" wing]] committed to a return to republicanism's \"physical force\" tradition.<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 172-198</ref><ref>See also Nelson McCausland (2018), \"Why unionists must ensure that the true origins of the civil rights movement are not forgotten\".

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

It articulated what were to be the enduring principles of the British approach to a settlement. <blockquote>It is a fact that an element of the minority in Northern Ireland has hitherto seen itself as simply part of the wider Irish community. The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and hose they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO|}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party]]. Faulkner's later successor as party leader, [[James Molyneaux]], argued that the difficulty for most unionists  was not an arrangement in which \"Protestants and Catholics must consent\"--that \"would be comparatively simple.\" It was that, despite a promise not share power with parties \"whose ''primary'' aim is a united Ireland\",<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first= Barry|year=1984|title=John Hume: Statesman of the Troubles|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=9780856403170|pages=140}}</ref> Faulkner had committed them to agreement with \"Republican Catholics\" <ref>Interview with James Molyneaux, 18 May 1982 quoted in {{cite book|last=O'Malley|first= Padraig |year=1983|title=The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today|pages=17, 26, 39|location=Boston|publisher= Houghton Mifflin|isbn=039534414X}}</ref> \n\nHaving drawn on both the [[Republican Labour Party|Republican]], and [[Northern Ireland Labour Party|Northern Ireland, Labour]] parties, and with a commitment to \"accommodate progressive Protestants,\"  the SDLP had announced themselves as something more than nationalist or republican party.<ref>{{cite book|last=Devlin|first= Paddy|year=1993|title=Straight Left: an Autobiography|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=0856405140|pages=191}}</ref> But with PIRA continuing to draw on fury over internment and Bloody Sunday, Eamonn McCann notes that \"in order to sell the deal to the Catholic community the SDLP had to present it not just as a means of expressing its aspiration towards a united Ireland but a means of achieving it\".<ref>McCann (1980), p. 141</ref> The new Health and Social Service Minister, [[Paddy Devlin]], conceded that \"all other issues were governed\" by a drive to \"get all-Ireland institutions established\" that would \"produce the dynamic that would lead ultimately to an agreed united Ireland.\"<ref>Devlin, p. 205</ref> \n\nThe [[Sunningdale Agreement]] envisaged a Council of Ireland comprising, with equal delegations from Dublin and Belfast, a Council of Ministers with \"executive and harmonising functions\" and a Consultative Assembly with \"advisory and review functions.\" As they would only have a plurality of representation on the Northern side, these created the possibility of Unionists being manoeuvred into a minority position. \"In retrospect\", Devlin regretted his party had not \"adopted a two stage approach, by allowing power sharing at Stormont to establish itself\",<ref>Devlin, p. 252</ref> but by the time he and his colleagues recognised the damage they had caused to Faulkner's position by prioritising the \"Irish Dimension\" it was too late. \n\nWithin a week of taking office as First Minister, opposition to the Sunningdale proposals forced Faulkner to resign as UUP leader. In a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|surprise Westminster election]] at the end of February, his new pro-Agreement grouping, the [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]], was rolled over by a [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]] in which the bulk of his old party stood with William Craig's [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Ulster Vanguard]] and Paisley's new electoral vehicle, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]]. Arguing that they had deprived Faulkner of any semblance of a mandate, the victors called for new Assembly elections. \n\nWhen on 14 May the Assembly defeated a motion rejecting the Sunningdale Agreement, Harry Murray, the shipyard convener for the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] (UWC), a loyalist labour coalition, announced a general strike. Within two weeks the UWC, supported by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and UVF paramilitaries, had an effective stranglehold on energy supplies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Don|year=1994|title=Fourteen May Days:\nThe Inside Story of the Loyalist Strike of 1974|location=Dublin|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|isbn=0717121771}}</ref> Concessions sought by Faulkner were blocked by the SDLP.

From the UUP's James Molyneaux there were the familiar objections to \"something very far removed from straightforward democracy\" and which could give republicans an effective \"veto.\"  But with Paisley calling on unionists not to \"lose sight\" of an opportunity for the \"Ulster people\" to \"freely elect their own Assembly and to begin to bring Direct Rule to account\", there was not blanket rejection.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 372-373</ref> That was to come from nationalists.\n\nJohn Hume dismissed the initiative as \"insulting.\" Not only did it imply, with the 70 percent hurdle, a very much higher degree of unionist unanimity and consent than was required in 1973, it suggested that, for the present at least, the Irish Dimension\" would have adequate \"institutional expression\" in an Intergovernmental Council. \"[W]ithout affecting national sovereignty\" this would link not Belfast, but London to Dublin (and at a time when that relationship had frozen as a result of [[1981 Irish hunger strike|PIRA Hunger Strike]] and Irish sympathies for Argentina in the [[Falklands War]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|year=2003|title= 'Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady|location=London|publisher= Jonathan Cape|pages=426}}</ref> Seconded by the Dublin government, SDLP insisted that without of \"a very strong and positive and concrete expression of the Irish identity\" the proposals were unworkable.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 368-369</ref> \n\nThree years later, London appeared to reverse tack. The Thatcher government chose to give a \"strong and positive\" expression to the Irish Dimension ''in advance'' of agreement on devolution. At [[Hillsborough Castle]] in Northern Ireland, with the [[Taoiseach|Irish Taoiseach]], [[Garret FitzGerald]] Thatcher signed an agreement that again proposed an intergovernmental council. This, however, was to give Dublin, for the first time, a formal consultative role in Northern Ireland and in matters beyond security cooperation. The [[British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference|Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] would invite the Irish government to \"put forward views on proposals\" for major legislation concerning Northern Ireland, and it would have a permanent [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]], including officials from the Republic's [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]], quartered in Northern Ireland itself.\n\nThe possibility of deflecting criticism not only from the Republic but also, in the wake of the Hunger Strike, from the United States was part of the British calculation<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bew|first1=Paul|last2=Patterson|first1=Henryl|year=1985|title= The British State and the Ulster Crisis: From Wilson to Thatcher|location=London|publisher= Verso Books|isbn=978-0860918158|pages=112}}</ref><ref>Wichert (1991), pp. 194-195.</ref> But it was also recognised in both London and in Dublin, where John Hume was closely advising Fitzgerald,<ref>{{cite book|last=McKitrick|first=David|year=1993|title= Dispatches from Belfast|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|pages=9}}</ref> that something suggestive of joint British-Irish sovereignty might intensify pressure on unionists to climb down from a position of \"simple majority rule.\" Proposals from The Irish government would be entertained only on \"matters [that] are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland\". If a Stormont executive alone could limit the scope of Dublin's involvement, concerned unionists would have to reconsider what they were prepared to offer northern nationalists by way of an accommodation.\n\nThe unionist reaction, Thatcher recalled in her memoirs, was \"worse than anyone had predicted to me\".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 403.</ref> The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) led an \"Ulster says No\"  campaign against the Agreement, that included strikes, [[civil disobedience]] and a mass resignation of unionist MPs from Westminster and suspensions of district council meetings.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement \u2013 Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=1 April 2020}}.

In 1912 Ulster unionists had the Conservatives' fulsome support. Standing beside Carson the Tory leader [[Andrew Bonar Law]] declared  \u201cI can imagine no lengths of resistance to which Ulster can go in which I would not be prepared to support her.\u201d Now unionists were facing a Conservative government imposition, and a Westminster Labour opposition committed to Irish unity. Seemingly without political options, and possibly to preempt the initiative passing to the paramilitaries, in November 1986 Paisley (not for the first time) announced his own \"third force\": the [[Ulster Resistance]] Movement (URM) who would \"take direct action as and when required.\" Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined. Despite importing arms, some of which were passed on to the UVF and UDA, for the URM the call for \"action\" never came.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ian Paisley death: He was lauded and reviled ... but a

Party]] led by [[Arlene Foster]], followed by the more moderate [[Ulster Unionist Party]] led by [[Robin Swann]]. Both parties are active across [[Northern Ireland]]. On a smaller level, the [[Progressive Unionist Party]], which is the political wing of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) paramilitary group, attracts some support in the greater Belfast area. [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] is opposed to the current constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland following the [[Belfast Agreement]] and [[St Andrews Agreement]]. The pluralist [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is currently allied to the Ulster Unionist Party. While the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] supports the status quo position of Northern Ireland, it does not define itself as Unionist.\n\nModerate unionists who support the principle of [[Equal Citizenship]] between Northern Ireland and Great Britain have campaigned for mainstream British political parties to organise and contest elections in Northern Ireland. Equal citizenship pressure groups have included the [[Campaign for Equal Citizenship]] (CEC), [[Labour Representation Campaign]], [[Democracy Now (UK pressure group)|Democracy Now]] and, currently, [[Labour - Federation of Labour Groups]]. Momentum for this concept picked up after the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party Conference voted in favour of working in Northern Ireland in 1989.

While nationalism has had a number of Protestant leaders (for instance, [[Henry Grattan]], [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Douglas Hyde]]), unionism was invariably always led by Protestant leaders and politicians. Prior to a decades-long ban, Catholics had been allowed to be members of the UUP as recently as the 1920s, including [[Denis Henry]] (the first [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]), who was a member of the UUP from its foundation in 1905 and a UUP MP for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy\" Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]]. Several generations of one Unionist political family, the Dockrells, won election as [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TDs). The Dublin borough of [[Rathmines]] had a unionist majority up to the late 1920s, when a local government re-organisation abolished all Dublin borough councils. Later, the Earl of Granard and the Provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]] gained appointment to the President of Ireland's advisory body, the [[Council of State]].

This derives from [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] [[Water well|wells]] of which Wells used to have many, rising through the chalk of the area. The town became Wells-next-the-Sea from ''juxta mare'' in the fourteenth century to distinguish it from other places of the same name. When the [[Wells and Fakenham Railway]] was opened on 1 December 1857, the terminus was given the name of Wells-on-Sea. In 1956 the Wells Urban District Council voted to (re-)adopt the name Wells-next-the-Sea, and this has been the official name since then.<ref>Description of Wells-next-the-Sea [http://www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html]. Retrieved 28 November 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[North Sea]] is now a mile from the town; the main channel which once wandered through marshes, grazed by sheep for hundreds of years, was confined by earthworks to the west in 1859 when Holkham Estate reclaimed some 800 hectares of saltmarsh north-west of Wells with the building of a mile-long bank.<ref>Nature Reserve : The Beach : Holkham Hall and Estate \u2013 North Norfolk, England [http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215011258/http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html |date=15 December 2014 }}</ref> This reclamation was claimed to have reduced the tidal scour though the West Fleet which provided much of the water entered the channel to its north.\n\nBecause the town has no river running through it, Wells relies on the tides to scour the harbour. The problem of siltation had preoccupied the merchants of the town for hundreds of years and occupied the attentions of various engineers, leading eventually to disputes which came to court in the eighteenth century. [[John Coode (engineer)|Sir John Coode]], who had been knighted for his work on the completion of Portland harbour was recruited to solve its siltation problems in the 1880s. No attempted solution proved permanent. The growth of faster marine traffic whose wake washes at the banks of the marshes has widened the channel and reduced tidal flow further.\n\nThe town has been a seaport since before the fourteenth century when it supplied grain to London and subsequently to the miners of the north east in return for which Wells was supplied with coal. Until the nineteenth century, it was easier to carry bulk cargoes by sea than overland. It was a significant port in the sixteenth century with 19 ships over 16 tons burden operating out of Wells in 1580, making it the major port in the area; the main trade was corn.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Port of Wells: 1100 Years of History | author=Pooley, Graham | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-9516120-1-9 }}</ref> Wells was also from early days a manufactury of [[malt]]. At its height the town boasted up to twelve [[Malt house|maltings]], having in 1750 contributed a third of the exports of malt from the country, mostly to Holland,  more than any other port save Yarmouth.\n\nWells was also a fishing port: in 1337 it is recorded as having had thirteen fishing boats; next door Holkham had nine. Its mariners brought first herring and then cod from Iceland in quantity between the fifteenth and seventeenth  centuries. The regulation of the harbour in order to preserve its use was by Act of Parliament in 1663; and in 1769 Harbour Commissioners were appointed with powers over vessels entering and leaving (as they still have today). The Quay was substantially rebuilt in 1845 as part of attempts to improve the town. At the same time, Improvement Commissioners were appointed with the task of making the town commodious and attractive to residents and  the burgeoning tourist trade.  As a small port, it built ships until the late nineteenth century; it never transferred to building motor vessels or to steel hulls. The coming of the railway in 1857 reduced the harbour trade but it revived briefly after the Second World War for the import of fertilizer and animal feed. In 1982 there were 258 ship movements into the harbour.<ref>{{cite book | title= Wells next the Sea: a small port in a wide world | author=Arguile, Roger  | year=2014| isbn=978-1-909796-49-2 }}</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century malting assumed an industrial character dominated by merchants rather than hands-on maltsters. Eventually, the entire estate was acquired by  F. & G. Smith who had maltings in Dereham and Great Ryburgh; they latterly bought out the competition becoming one of the biggest maltsters in the country.  Following the Great War demand began to fall and new methods of production were being used. After a local dispute,  they closed the Wells operation down in 1929. Other agriculture-related enterprises such as the Ipswich-based Eastern Counties Farmers Cooperative were, over the following years,  bought out or closed. The post-war revival of the harbour trade made of the Quay a busy place from the 1960s to the 1990s.  Small coasters, mostly from across the Channel,<ref>{{cite book | title= Favor Parker Shipping Register  23.11.81-31.12.86 }} </ref> brought in fertiliser and animal feed, latterly mostly soya beans until 1992 when changes in government regulations and the increasing size of vessels made the port uneconomic. Wind-farm support began in 2009 with the building of the [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm]].\n\nTourism, which had begun on a small scale a century before became a major draw, based as it was on the Pinewoods Caravan site much expanded post-war.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town has long thrived as a seaport and is now also a [[seaside resort]] with a popular beach that can be reached on foot or by a narrow gauge railway that runs partway alongside the mile-long sea wall north of the harbour. The beach is known for its long flat terrain, abstract sand dunes, varied unique [[beach hut]]s and a [[naturist]] area situated to the west at Holkham. A land-locked brackish pool called Abraham's Bosom was for many years used for pleasure boating and canoeing; it is all that remains of the West Fleet which once drained the Holkham marshes. The beach is backed by dense [[pine]] woods which are part of the [[Holkham National Nature Reserve]]. The woods comprise [[Scots pine]], [[Maritime pine]] and [[Corsican Pine]] growing on sand.<ref>Holkham National Nature Reserve [http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/ holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/]</ref>\n\nMore pinewoods exist to the east of the beach over the shipping channel at an area called the East Hills. This can be accessed on foot at low tide though all of the tidal sands in the area are extremely dangerous due to the speed and currents of the rising tide.  It is not advisable to cross the channel without detailed local knowledge.\n\nThe majority of shops and other such businesses are now found on Staithe Street but up to the 1960s commercial premises were also to be found along High Street which continues south towards St Nicholas's Church. The church burned after a lightning strike in 1879; the exterior shows the original stonework, but the interior, while light and airy, shows the want of stained glass. The Victorian bench ends are worth a look. [[John Fryer (sailor)|John Fryer]], Captain Bligh's [[sailing master]] on [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] was born at Wells, and is buried in the churchyard. His gravestone is in the church porch.\n\nThe distinctive landmark of the seafront is the granary with its overhanging gantry on the quay, started in 1904 and finished in 1905. This has now been converted into flats, having ceased operating as a granary in 1990. The maritime tradition of the town meant it used to have a remarkable number of public houses for a town of its size although many of these have since closed. The northern end of the town used to be notable for parallel 'yards', narrow rows of cottages similar to the northern '[[ginnel]]s', which may derive from the rebuilding of the port in the eleventh century. (The original port is reputed to have been adjacent to the church.) Most of these remain though some have been lost to development and [[slum clearance]]. The 1953 flood affected the northern edge of the town, breaching the beach bank and causing damage to houses in the east end. It also destroyed the pine woods which had been planted in the nineteenth century to stabilise the dunes and which fringed Abraham's Bosom. Today there is a large moving flood gate next to the harbour car park and many of the houses have their own flood defences.\n\nA feature of the town is the area known as The Buttlands, a large green ringed by lime trees. Large elegant Georgian houses overlook The Buttlands, as do the Crown Hotel, Globe Inn and the Wells Catholic Church. If you exit The Buttlands down the hill at its south-west corner you can see Ware Hall,a medieval house which was rebuilt over a period of years from the 1970s by Miss May Savidge, who brought it in parts when she moved from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] in Hertfordshire.<ref>[http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/the_house_that_may_built_1_700239 The house that May built], Eastern Daily Press, 28 November 2007</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n===Railways===\n[[File:Wells next the seamap 1946.png|thumb|250px|right|A map of Wells-next-the-Sea from 1946]]\n[[File:Wells-next-the-sea lifeboat statiion cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station]]]]\n[[File:Wells-next-the-sea lifeboat coming home by Dennis Smith.jpg|thumb|Wells-next-the-Sea lifeboat being towed to the lifeboat house]]\n\nFormerly the town was served by [[Wells-on-Sea railway station]] and was connected to the [[British Rail]] network by two lines. The line westwards towards King's Lynn was never reinstated after damage in the [[North Sea flood of 1953]], while the line to Norwich via Fakenham, Dereham and Wymondham was a victim of the '[[Beeching Axe]]' of the 1960s. The [[Wells and Walsingham Light Railway]], a 10\u00bc inch-gauge railway (the longest of such a gauge in the world), now uses part of the track-bed and has its own separate [[Wells railway station, Norfolk|Wells railway station]].<ref>[http://www.wellswalsinghamrailway.co.uk/ Wellswalsinghamrailway.co.uk]</ref>\n\nThe [[Wells Harbour Railway]]<ref>[http://www.wellsharbourrailway.co.uk/ Wellsharbourrailway.co.uk]</ref> is a separate 10\u00bc inch-gauge railway that takes passengers from the harbour behind the sea wall towards the beach and caravan site.\n\nNear the centre of the town is the former Wells County Primary School (linked by School Lane from High Street). The junior school was relocated to the former Secondary Modern school when a new secondary school, [[Alderman Peel High School]], was built in the late 1960s, part of which is upon the former railway line to the west towards King's Lynn. For several years, these buildings housed a field studies centre.  More recently, though, the former school has been converted to social housing units.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Buses===\nWells was located on the high-profile 'Coasthopper' bus route between [[King's Lynn]] and [[Cromer]]. In April 2018, Stagecoach ceased operations in Norfolk. The Coasthopper service was split into two sections at Wells-next-the-Sea: the section from King's Lynn to Wells was rebranded as the ''Coastliner'' 36, extended inland from Wells to [[Fakenham]], and taken over by [[Lynx (bus company)|Lynx]]; while the section from Wells to Cromer was branded as the 4 and taken over by Sanders Coaches.\n\n==Lifeboat==\nThe [[Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station|current lifeboat station]], housing both an all-weather lifeboat and an inshore rescue boat, is at the harbour entrance. The old lifeboat house, now used as the harbour offices, is at the western end of the quay. A new [[Shannon-class lifeboat|''Shannon''-class lifeboat]] is planned to replace the current boat in 2021 requiring a new much larger lifeboat station; the fate of the current station is uncertain.\n\nIn 1880, in the [[Wells lifeboat disaster]], 11 of the 13 crew drowned, leaving 10 widows and 27 children without fathers. A memorial to the crew stands adjacent to the old lifeboat house.\n\n==Education==\nSchools in the town include Wells-Next-The-Sea Primary and Nursery School and [[Alderman Peel High School]].<ref name=\"DfE\">{{cite web |last1=Coulson |first1=Tim |title=Warning notice to Wells-Next-The-Sea Primary and Nursery School |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/warning-notice-to-wells-next-the-sea-primary-and-nursery-school |website=Gov.UK |publisher=Gov.UK |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=10 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"FCS_new\">{{cite web |title=Alderman Peel High School |url=https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/school/145089/alderman-peel-high-school |website=Find and compare schools in England |publisher=Gov.UK |accessdate=1 October 2018}}</ref> all are now part of the  Wensum Trust which runs 24 schools in North Norfolk.\n\n==Beach==\nThe Wells-next-the-Sea beach, being subject to the ever-changing tides of [[Holkham National Nature Reserve]], makes use of an old war [[Siren (alarm)|siren]] to warn patrons of incoming beach floodings. The siren sounds around 5\u201310 minutes before the tide is predicted to take over the beach to allow users to vacate the area safely.\n\n==Storms==\nWells has been subject to flooding going back to the thirteenth century. In the twentieth century the notorious 1953 floods were followed by a surge almost as dangerous in 1978 for which the town was better prepared. On December 5th 2013 a similar flood occurred which did not affect the west end of the town because of a tidal barrier built in 1980.  [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Cameron]], visited the town on 9 December to inspect the damage created by a [[North Sea flood of 2013|storm surge]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-25303124 BBC news report] Retrieved 10 December 2013</ref>\n\n<br />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nWells-next-the-Sea (Beached Boat).jpg|Beached boat at Wells-next-the-Sea\nUK Wells next the Sea.jpg|Signpost in Wells-next-the-Sea\nWells-next-the-Sea 2.jpg|The [[Wells Harbour]] mouth from the sea wall; the lifeboat house can be seen in the distance\nWells-next-the-Sea 3.jpg|Inland Wells, with view to Wells Harbour\nWellsharbouraug06.JPG|Looking out to the quay on a sunny August 2006 day\nW&WLR Locomotive 3.jpg|The train from Wells arrives at Walsingham station\nBeach huts at Wells-next-the-Sea.jpg|Huts on the beach\nGrey seal on the beach at Wells-next-the-Sea.jpg|Grey seal on the beach\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage|Wells-next-the-Sea}}\n{{commons category|Wells-next-the-Sea}}\n*[http://www.aldermanpeel.norfolk.sch.uk/ Alderman Peel High School]\n*[http://www.wellsharbour.co.uk/backcam.htm Wells web cam]\n*[https://wellsguide.com/ Wells-next-the-Sea information and visitor guide]\n*{{oscoor gbx|TF916437}}\n*[http://easytide.ukho.gov.uk/EasyTide/EasyTide/ShowPrediction.aspx?PortID=0157A&PredictionLength=7 Tide tables] for Wells-next-the-Sea.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061210052225/http://www.norfolkcoast.co.uk/location_norfolk/vp_wellsnextthesea.htm Photographs more details and interesting facts about Wells-next-the-Sea]\n*[http://www.escapeandexplore.co.uk/galleries/wells-next-the-sea.htm?view=link Gallery of Wells-next-the-Sea] \u2013 Photographs of Wells-next-the-Sea\n\n{{Norfolk}}\n{{Civil Parishes of North Norfolk}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wells-next-the-Sea}}\n[[Category:Wells-next-the-Sea]]\n[[Category:Towns in Norfolk]]\n[[Category:North Norfolk]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Norfolk]]\n[[Category:Civil parishes in Norfolk]]\n[[Category:Seaside resorts in England]]\n[[Category:Beaches of Norfolk]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Wells (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2012}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|country                  = England\n|coordinates              = {{coord|52.95|0.85|display=inline,title}}\n|official_name            = Wells-next-the-Sea\n| static_image_name       = Wells-next-the-Sea Quayside Aug 2013.jpg\n| static_image_caption    = The quayside\n| population              = 2,165\n| population_ref          = ([[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]])\n  | area_total_km2        = 16.31\n|shire_district           = [[North Norfolk]]\n|shire_county             = [[Norfolk]]\n|region                   = East of England\n|constituency_westminster = [[North Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|North Norfolk]]\n|post_town                = WELLS-NEXT-THE-SEA\n|postcode_district        = NR23\n|postcode_area            = NR\n|dial_code                = 01328\n|os_grid_reference        = TF 914 430\n}}\n\n'''Wells-next-the-Sea''' is a small town and port on the [[North Norfolk]] coast of England.\n\nThe civil parish has an area of {{convert|16.31|km2|abbr=on}} and in [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001]] had a population of 2,451,<ref name=osnncc>Office for National Statistics & Norfolk County Council (2001).

The town became Wells-next-the-Sea from ''juxta mare'' in the fourteenth century to distinguish it from other places of the same name. When the [[Wells and Fakenham Railway]] was opened on 1 December 1857, the terminus was given the name of Wells-on-Sea. In 1956 the Wells Urban District Council voted to (re-)adopt the name Wells-next-the-Sea, and this has been the official name since then.<ref>Description of Wells-next-the-Sea [http://www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html]. Retrieved 28 November 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[North Sea]] is now a mile from the town; the main channel which once wandered through marshes, grazed by sheep for hundreds of years, was confined by earthworks to the west in 1859 when Holkham Estate reclaimed some 800 hectares of saltmarsh north-west of Wells with the building of a mile-long bank.<ref>Nature Reserve : The Beach : Holkham Hall and Estate \u2013 North Norfolk, England [http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215011258/http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html |date=15 December 2014 }}</ref> This reclamation was claimed to have reduced the tidal scour though the West Fleet which provided much of the water entered the channel to its north.\n\nBecause the town has no river running through it, it relies on the tides to scour the harbour. The problem of siltation had preoccupied the merchants of the town for hundreds of years and occupied the attentions of various engineers, leading eventually to disputes which came to court in the eighteenth century. [[John Coode (engineer)|Sir John Coode]], who had been knighted for his work on the completion of Portland harbour was recruited to solve its siltation problems in the 1880s. No attempted solution proved permanent. The growth of faster marine traffic whose wake washes at the banks of the marshes has widened the channel and reduced tidal flow further.\n\nThe town has been a seaport since before the fourteenth century when it supplied grain to London and subsequently to the miners of the north east in return for which Wells was supplied with coal. Until the nineteenth century, it was easier to carry bulk cargoes by sea than overland. It was a significant port in the sixteenth century with 19 ships over 16 tons burden operating out of Wells in 1580, making it the major port in the area; the main trade was corn.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Port of Wells: 1100 Years of History | author=Pooley, Graham | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-9516120-1-9 }}</ref> Wells was also from early days a manufactury of [[malt]]. At its height the town boasted up to twelve [[Malt house|maltings]], having in 1750 contributed a third of the exports of malt from the country, mostly to Holland,  more than any other port save Yarmouth.\n\nWells was also a fishing port: in 1337 it is recorded as having had thirteen fishing boats; next door Holkham had nine. Its mariners brought first herring and then cod from Iceland in quantity between the fifteenth and seventeenth  centuries. The regulation of the harbour in order to preserve its use was by Act of Parliament in 1663; and in 1769 Harbour Commissioners were appointed with powers over vessels entering and leaving (as they still have today). The Quay was substantially rebuilt in 1845 as part of attempts to improve the town. At the same time, Improvement Commissioners were appointed with the task of making the town commodious and attractive to residents and  the burgeoning tourist trade.  As a small port, it built ships until the late nineteenth century; it never transferred to building motor vessels or to steel hulls. The coming of the railway in 1857 reduced the harbour trade but it revived briefly after the Second World War for the import of fertilizer and animal feed. In 1982 there were 258 ship movements into the harbour.<ref>{{cite book | title= Wells next the Sea: a small port in a wide world | author=Arguile, Roger  | year=2014| isbn=978-1-909796-49-2 }}</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century malting assumed an industrial character dominated by merchants rather than hands-on maltsters. Eventually, the entire estate was acquired by  F. & G. Smith who had maltings in Dereham and Great Ryburgh; they latterly bought out the competition becoming one of the biggest maltsters in the country.  Following the Great War demand began to fall and new methods of production were being used. After a local dispute,  they closed the Wells operation down in 1929. Other agriculture-related enterprises such as the Ipswich-based Eastern Counties Farmers Cooperative were, over the following years,  bought out or closed. The post-war revival of the harbour trade made of the Quay a busy place from the 1960s to the 1990s.  Small coasters, mostly from across the Channel,<ref>{{cite book | title= Favor Parker Shipping Register  23.11.81-31.12.86 }} </ref> brought in fertiliser and animal feed, latterly mostly soya beans until 1992 when changes in government regulations and the increasing size of vessels made the port uneconomic. Wind-farm support began in 2009 with the building of the [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm]].\n\nTourism, which had begun on a small scale a century before became a major draw, based as it was on the Pinewoods Caravan site much expanded post-war.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town has long thrived as a seaport and is now also a [[seaside resort]] with a popular beach that can be reached on foot or by a narrow gauge railway that runs partway alongside the mile-long sea wall north of the harbour. The beach is known for its long flat terrain, abstract sand dunes, varied unique [[beach hut]]s and a [[naturist]] area situated to the west at Holkham. A land-locked brackish pool called Abraham's Bosom was for many years used for pleasure boating and canoeing; it is all that remains of the West Fleet which once drained the Holkham marshes. The beach is backed by dense [[pine]] woods which are part of the [[Holkham National Nature Reserve]]. The woods comprise [[Scots pine]], [[Maritime pine]] and [[Corsican Pine]] growing on sand.<ref>Holkham National Nature Reserve [http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/ holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/]</ref>\n\nMore pinewoods exist to the east of the beach over the shipping channel at an area called the East Hills. This can be accessed on foot at low tide though all of the tidal sands in the area are extremely dangerous due to the speed and currents of the rising tide.  It is not advisable to cross the channel without detailed local knowledge.\n\nThe majority of shops and other such businesses are now found on Staithe Street but up to the 1960s commercial premises were also to be found along High Street which continues south towards St Nicholas's Church. The church burned after a lightning strike in 1879; the exterior shows the original stonework, but the interior, while light and airy, shows the want of stained glass. The Victorian bench ends are worth a look. [[John Fryer (sailor)|John Fryer]], Captain Bligh's [[sailing master]] on [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] was born at Wells, and is buried in the churchyard. His gravestone is in the church porch.\n\nThe distinctive landmark of the seafront is the granary with its overhanging gantry on the quay, started in 1904 and finished in 1905. This has now been converted into flats, having ceased operating as a granary in 1990. The maritime tradition of the town meant it used to have a remarkable number of public houses for a town of its size although many of these have since closed. The northern end of the town used to be notable for parallel 'yards', narrow rows of cottages similar to the northern '[[ginnel]]s', which may derive from the rebuilding of the port in the eleventh century. (The original port is reputed to have been adjacent to the church.) Most of these remain though some have been lost to development and [[slum clearance]]. The 1953 flood affected the northern edge of the town, breaching the beach bank and causing damage to houses in the east end. It also destroyed the pine woods which had been planted in the nineteenth century to stabilise the dunes and which fringed Abraham's Bosom. Today there is a large moving flood gate next to the harbour car park and many of the houses have their own flood defences.\n\nA feature of the town is the area known as The Buttlands, a large green ringed by lime trees. Large elegant Georgian houses overlook The Buttlands, as do the Crown Hotel, Globe Inn and the Wells Catholic Church. If you exit The Buttlands down the hill at its south-west corner you can see Ware Hall,a medieval house which was rebuilt over a period of years from the 1970s by Miss May Savidge, who brought it in parts when she moved from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] in Hertfordshire.<ref>[http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/the_house_that_may_built_1_700239 The house that May built], Eastern Daily Press, 28 November 2007</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n===Railways===\n[[File:Wells next the seamap 1946.png|thumb|250px|right|A map of Wells-next-the-Sea from 1946]]\n[[File:Wells-next-the-sea lifeboat statiion cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station]]]]\n[[File:Wells-next-the-sea lifeboat coming home by Dennis Smith.jpg|thumb|Wells-next-the-Sea lifeboat being towed to the lifeboat house]]\n\nFormerly the town was served by [[Wells-on-Sea railway station]] and was connected to the [[British Rail]] network by two lines. The line westwards towards King's Lynn was never reinstated after damage in the [[North Sea flood of 1953]], while the line to Norwich via Fakenham, Dereham and Wymondham was a victim of the '[[Beeching Axe]]' of the 1960s. The [[Wells and Walsingham Light Railway]], a 10\u00bc inch-gauge railway (the longest of such a gauge in the world), now uses part of the track-bed and has its own separate [[Wells railway station, Norfolk|Wells railway station]].<ref>[http://www.wellswalsinghamrailway.co.uk/ Wellswalsinghamrailway.co.uk]</ref>\n\nThe [[Wells Harbour Railway]]<ref>[http://www.wellsharbourrailway.co.uk/ Wellsharbourrailway.co.uk]</ref> is a separate 10\u00bc inch-gauge railway that takes passengers from the harbour behind the sea wall towards the beach and caravan site.\n\nNear the centre of the town is the former Wells County Primary School (linked by School Lane from High Street). The junior school was relocated to the former Secondary Modern school when a new secondary school, [[Alderman Peel High School]], was built in the late 1960s, part of which is upon the former railway line to the west towards King's Lynn. For several years, these buildings housed a field studies centre.  More recently, though, the former school has been converted to social housing units.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Buses===\nWells was located on the high-profile 'Coasthopper' bus route between [[King's Lynn]] and [[Cromer]]. In April 2018, Stagecoach ceased operations in Norfolk. The Coasthopper service was split into two sections at Wells-next-the-Sea: the section from King's Lynn to Wells was rebranded as the ''Coastliner'' 36, extended inland from Wells to [[Fakenham]], and taken over by [[Lynx (bus company)|Lynx]]; while the section from Wells to Cromer was branded as the 4 and taken over by Sanders Coaches.\n\n==Lifeboat==\nThe [[Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station|current lifeboat station]], housing both an all-weather lifeboat and an inshore rescue boat, is at the harbour entrance. The old lifeboat house, now used as the harbour offices, is at the western end of the quay. A new [[Shannon-class lifeboat|''Shannon''-class lifeboat]] is planned to replace the current boat in 2021 requiring a new much larger lifeboat station; the fate of the current station is uncertain.\n\nIn 1880, in the [[Wells lifeboat disaster]], 11 of the 13 crew drowned, leaving 10 widows and 27 children without fathers. A memorial to the crew stands adjacent to the old lifeboat house.\n\n==Education==\nSchools in the town include Wells-Next-The-Sea Primary and Nursery School and [[Alderman Peel High School]].<ref name=\"DfE\">{{cite web |last1=Coulson |first1=Tim |title=Warning notice to Wells-Next-The-Sea Primary and Nursery School |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/warning-notice-to-wells-next-the-sea-primary-and-nursery-school |website=Gov.UK |publisher=Gov.UK |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=10 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"FCS_new\">{{cite web |title=Alderman Peel High School |url=https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/school/145089/alderman-peel-high-school |website=Find and compare schools in England |publisher=Gov.UK |accessdate=1 October 2018}}</ref> all are now part of the  Wensum Trust which runs 24 schools in North Norfolk.\n\n==Beach==\nThe Wells-next-the-Sea beach, being subject to the ever-changing tides of [[Holkham National Nature Reserve]], makes use of an old war [[Siren (alarm)|siren]] to warn patrons of incoming beach floodings. The siren sounds around 5\u201310 minutes before the tide is predicted to take over the beach to allow users to vacate the area safely.\n\n==Storms==\nWells has been subject to flooding going back to the thirteenth century. In the twentieth century the notorious 1953 floods were followed by a surge almost as dangerous in 1978 for which the town was better prepared. On December 5th 2013 a similar flood occurred which did not affect the west end of the town because of a tidal barrier built in 1980.  [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Cameron]], visited the town on 9 December to inspect the damage created by a [[North Sea flood of 2013|storm surge]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-25303124 BBC news report] Retrieved 10 December 2013</ref>\n\n<br />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nWells-next-the-Sea (Beached Boat).jpg|Beached boat at Wells-next-the-Sea\nUK Wells next the Sea.jpg|Signpost in Wells-next-the-Sea\nWells-next-the-Sea 2.jpg|The [[Wells Harbour]] mouth from the sea wall; the lifeboat house can be seen in the distance\nWells-next-the-Sea 3.jpg|Inland Wells, with view to Wells Harbour\nWellsharbouraug06.JPG|Looking out to the quay on a sunny August 2006 day\nW&WLR Locomotive 3.jpg|The train from Wells arrives at Walsingham station\nBeach huts at Wells-next-the-Sea.jpg|Huts on the beach\nGrey seal on the beach at Wells-next-the-Sea.jpg|Grey seal on the beach\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage|Wells-next-the-Sea}}\n{{commons category|Wells-next-the-Sea}}\n*[http://www.aldermanpeel.norfolk.sch.uk/ Alderman Peel High School]\n*[http://www.wellsharbour.co.uk/backcam.htm Wells web cam]\n*[https://wellsguide.com/ Wells-next-the-Sea information and visitor guide]\n*{{oscoor gbx|TF916437}}\n*[http://easytide.ukho.gov.uk/EasyTide/EasyTide/ShowPrediction.aspx?PortID=0157A&PredictionLength=7 Tide tables] for Wells-next-the-Sea.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061210052225/http://www.norfolkcoast.co.uk/location_norfolk/vp_wellsnextthesea.htm Photographs more details and interesting facts about Wells-next-the-Sea]\n*[http://www.escapeandexplore.co.uk/galleries/wells-next-the-sea.htm?view=link Gallery of Wells-next-the-Sea] \u2013 Photographs of Wells-next-the-Sea\n\n{{Norfolk}}\n{{Civil Parishes of North Norfolk}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wells-next-the-Sea}}\n[[Category:Wells-next-the-Sea]]\n[[Category:Towns in Norfolk]]\n[[Category:North Norfolk]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Norfolk]]\n[[Category:Civil parishes in Norfolk]]\n[[Category:Seaside resorts in England]]\n[[Category:Beaches of Norfolk]]\n", "name_user": "Palmiped", "label": "safe", "comment": "replace it with Wells", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells-next-the-Sea"}

They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League West|West division]]. In 2020, they will move to the new [[The Dimmadome]] after having played at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]] from 1994 to 2019. The team's name is borrowed from the famous [[Texas Ranger Division|law enforcement agency]] of the same name.\n\nThe franchise was established in 1961 as the '''Washington Senators''', an [[expansion team]] awarded to [[Washington, D.C.]], after the city's first AL ballclub, the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|second Washington Senators]], moved to [[Minnesota]] and became the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]] (the [[Washington Senators (1891\u201399)|original Washington Senators]] played primarily in the [[National League]] during the 1890s). After the {{MLBy|1971}} season, the new Senators moved to Arlington, and debuted as the Rangers the following spring.\n\nThe Rangers have made eight appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team then brought home their [[2010 American League Championship Series|first American League pennant]] after beating the [[New York Yankees]] in six games. In the [[2010 World Series]], the franchise's first, the Rangers fell to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, then lost the [[2011 World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Texas Rangers (baseball)}}\n\n===Washington Senators (1961\u20131971)===\nWhen the  [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] moved to [[Minnesota]] in 1960 to become the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]], Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off the twin threats of competition from the proposed [[Continental League]] and loss of its [[Federal Baseball Club v. National League|exemption]] from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. As part of the expansion, the American League added two new teams for the 1961 season\u2013the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]] and a new Washington Senators team. However, the new Senators were (and still are) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. The team played the {{MLBy|1961}} season at old [[Griffith Stadium]] before moving to the new [[District of Columbia Stadium]] under a 10-year lease.\n\n[[File:Richard Nixon throwing out opening pitch at Senators game, 1969.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] throwing [[Opening Day]] [[ceremonial first pitch]] at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on April 7, 1969, with [[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Bob Short]] (right, partially obscured by [[Ralph Houk]])]]\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators: \"Washington: [[Henry Lee III#Political career|first in war, first in peace]] and ''still'' last in the American League.\" Their only winning season was in {{MLBy|1969}} when [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]] managed the club to an 86\u201376 record, placing fourth in the AL East. [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], an [[outfielder]]/[[first baseman]] from 1965 to 1972 known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles. The concurrent rise of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to regular championship contenders (winning their first World Series in {{wsy|1966}}) did not help the Senators' cause either.\n\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Following their brief success in 1969, owner [[Bob Short]] was forced to make many questionable trades to lower the debt he had incurred to pay for the team. By the end of the {{MLBy|1970}} campaign, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (by comparison, the [[New York Yankees]] were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not renew the stadium lease and would move the team elsewhere.\n\nShort was especially receptive to an offer brought up by [[Arlington, Texas]], mayor [[Tom Vandergriff]], who had been trying to obtain a major league sports team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], sought to relocate his baseball team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed and ultimately declined by the other AL team owners. Arlington's [[hole card]] was [[Turnpike Stadium]], a 10,000-seat park which had been built in {{MLBy|1965}} to house the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs]] of the [[Texas League]]. However, it had been built to MLB specifications, and only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate major league crowds.\n\nVandergriff's offer of a multimillion-dollar down payment prompted Short to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, by a vote of 10 to 2, American League owners granted approval to move the franchise to Arlington for the {{MLBy|1972}} season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Minot, Jr.|first=George|title=Short Takes Senators to Texas|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 22, 1971}}</ref> Senators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \"SHORT STINKS\". With the Senators leading 7\u20135 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed [[first base]] and ran off with it.

The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1\u20130 loss at the hands of the [[California Angels]], their 1961 expansion cousins. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels, 5\u20131, for the club's first victory.\n\nIn 1974, the Rangers experienced their first winning season after finishing last in both 1972 and 1973. Under the ownership of [[Brad Corbett]], they finished second in the American League West with an 84\u201376 record, behind the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[Oakland Athletics]]. The [[1974 Texas Rangers season|1974 Rangers]] are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. [[Mike Hargrove]] was awarded [[American League Rookie of the Year]], [[Billy Martin]] was named [[AL Manager of the Year]], [[Jeff Burroughs]] won [[AL MVP]], and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was named the [[Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]] after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. The team posted winning records again from 1977 to 1979 but fell short of reaching the playoffs. The Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in 1981, but wound up losing the first half of the AL West by one-and-a-half games to Oakland at the time of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. Texas went on to finish under .500 each season through 1985.\n\nThe Rangers faced an attendance problem for a few years in Texas, due in part to both the team's inconsistent performance and the oppressive heat and humidity that can encompass the area in the summer. Until the [[Florida Marlins]] arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the majors, with temperatures frequently topping {{convert|100|F-change|0}} throughout the summer. So, the Rangers began playing most of their weekend games between May and September at night, a tradition that continues to this day.\n\n====Valentine, Ryan, and Bush (1985\u20131994)====\n[[File:Nolan Ryan Tiger Stadium 1990 CROP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nolan Ryan]] pitched for the Rangers from 1989 to 1993.]]\n\nManager [[Bobby Valentine]] became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of stellar young rookies such as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Pete Incaviglia]], [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], [[Bobby Witt]], and [[Edwin Correa]], the Rangers finished the season in second place with an 87\u201375 record, just five games behind the division-champion Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th [[strikeout]], 300th [[Win (baseball)|win]], and 6th and 7th [[no-hitter]]s with the Rangers. Despite powerful lineups including the likes of [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], Rub\u00e9n Sierra, [[Julio Franco]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]] and a pitching staff that also included [[Charlie Hough]], Bobby Witt, [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], and [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], Valentine's Rangers never finished above second place and he was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season.\n\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon [[Eddie Chiles]], sold the team to an investment group headed by [[George W. Bush]] for $89 million.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-27/sports/sp-855_1_purchase-agreement Los Angeles Times: \"Chiles Reaches Agreement on Sale of Rangers\"] August 27, 1988</ref> While his own equity in the team was a small one ($500,000), Bush was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment to $600,000 the following year.<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html ESPN: \"A series of beneficial moves\" By Tom Farrey] November 1, 1999</ref> Bush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected [[Governor of Texas]] in 1994, and he sold his stake in the team in 1998. Bush went on to be elected [[President of the United States]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]].\n\nDuring Bush's tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991, on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]).\n\nIn 1993, [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]] took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September; Nolan Ryan also retired after that season. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the AL West prior to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] which prompted commissioner [[Bud Selig]] to cancel the remainder of the season and the playoffs. On July 28, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in major league history in Arlington against the California Angels.\n\n====First division titles (1995\u20132000)====\n[[File:Rangersballparkinarlington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Globe Life Park]]  opened in 1994.]]\n\n[[Johnny Oates]] was hired as the Rangers' manager in 1995. Oates and company helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division Championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the New York Yankees, 3 games to 1. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]] was named AL MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters including Gonz\u00e1lez, [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], and [[Rusty Greer]], but continued to struggle with pitching despite having [[Rick Helling]] and [[Aaron Sele]] on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive AL West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three World Series in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team was to be the last playoff-bound team until 2010. En route to a second-straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28&nbsp;games into the 2001 season.\n\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire [[Tom Hicks]] bought the team for $250 million.<ref name=test>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html George W. Bush and the Texas Rangers], Espn.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-04.</ref>\n\n====The lean years (2001\u20132004)====\n[[File:Michael Young on April 25, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]] was selected for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] seven times (2004\u20132009, 2011).]]\n\nPrior to the 2001 season, star free agent shortstop [[Alex Rodriguez]] was signed by the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in baseball history: a 10-year, $252 million contract. The move was controversial and is frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought that owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle, and manager [[Jerry Narron]] was fired following the 2002 season and was replaced by seasoned manager [[Buck Showalter]]. The 2003 season signified the Rangers' fourth-straight last-place finish, and after a postseason fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning AL MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and infield prospect [[Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias (baseball)|Joaquin Arias]].\n\nThe Rangers battled with the [[Anaheim Angels]] and Oakland Athletics for first place in the AL West for much of the 2004 season. [[Mark Teixeira]], Alfonso Soriano, [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], and [[Hank Blalock]] became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano being selected for the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2004 All-Star Game]]. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2 for 3 with a three-run [[home run]]. Despite a late-season push, the Rangers ended up losing six of their final ten games and finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place.\n\n====Making changes (2005\u20132009)====\n[[File:Nelson Cruz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelson Cruz]], Rangers outfielder from 2006 to 2013]]\n\nIn 2005, the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries. [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] stepped down as general manager following the 2005 season. [[Jon Daniels]] was promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, became the youngest general manager in major league history.\n\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in acquiring new players before and during the 2006 season. New acquisitions included [[Brad Wilkerson]], [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]], [[Kevin Millwood]], [[Carlos Lee]], and [[Nelson Cruz]]. Despite bolstering their roster, the Rangers' 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the AL West. Buck Showalter was dismissed as manager after the season. The team hired Oakland third base coach [[Ron Washington]] as their next manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061105&content_id=1733731|title=Rangers select Washington to manage|first=T.R.|last=Sullivan|publisher=MLB.com|date=2006-11-06|accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref> A change at manager was the first of several moves to strengthen the team in yet another busy offseason. The team lost [[Gary Matthews, Jr.]], [[Mark DeRosa]], [[Carlos Lee]], and Adam Eaton, but gained [[Kenny Lofton]], [[Sammy Sosa]], [[Frank Catalanotto]], and pitchers [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]] and [[Brandon McCarthy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061223&content_id=1767476|title=Rangers acquire McCarthy from Sox|first=T.R.|last=Sullivan|publisher=MLB.com|date=2006-12-23|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>\n\n[[File:D Holland.jpg|thumb|[[Derek Holland]], one of the top pitching prospects to be drafted by Texas, pitched for the Rangers from 2009 to 2016.]]\nThe Rangers struggled offensively early in the 2007 season, despite playing in a notoriously hitter-friendly park. A number of roster moves before the 2007 trade deadline were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. Daniels' objective was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\n\nThe Rangers began the 2008 season exceptionally well, headlined by newcomer [[Josh Hamilton]] who looked to be a threat to win the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Hamilton crushed a first round home run record in the 2008 [[Home Run Derby]] with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' [[Justin Morneau]]. Four Rangers played in the All Star Game: Hamilton, [[Ian Kinsler]], [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]], and Michael Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly.\n\nThe Rangers finished the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79\u201383), yet ended the season second in the AL West, the club's best finish since 1999. The 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first time since 2004. Despite injuries to Josh Hamilton and [[Ian Kinsler]], the Rangers held first place in their division for long stretches of the summer before fading after September 1, losing the division to the Los Angeles Angels. The Rangers finished the season at 87\u201375, their first winning season since 2004 and good enough for second place in the AL West. Michael Young responded to his move to third base by posting one of his best offensive seasons ever while committing just nine errors and earning a sixth-straight All-Star appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=4566 |title=Michael Young Stats \u2013 Texas Rangers \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=1976-10-19 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> Josh Hamilton and [[Nelson Cruz]] were also named 2009 AL All-Stars.\n\n====Rangers Baseball Express, LLC====\nFollowing financial problems, including defaulting on a $525 million loan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finalternatives.com/node/7478 |title=Tom Hicks' Sports Group Defaults On $525 Million In Loans |publisher=FINalternatives |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> [[Tom Hicks]] and Hicks Sports Group reached an agreement to sell the Texas Rangers to group headed by Pittsburgh sports lawyer [[Chuck Greenberg (businessman)|Chuck Greenberg]] and Rangers team president Nolan Ryan for approximately $570 million on January 22, 2010.<ref name=\"mlb.mlb.com\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100122&content_id=7958194&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex&partnerId=rss_tex Hicks' sale of Rangers finalized] ''MLB.com''</ref> Hicks also sold much of the land surrounding Rangers Ballpark to Greenberg and Ryan's group in a separate deal.\n\nHowever, one of HSG's principal lenders, [[Monarch Alternative Capital]], opposed the sale on grounds that the proceeds would not fully repay the defaulted HSG notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4309:brown-time-for-mlb-to-play-hardball-on-the-texas-rangers-sale&catid=26:editorials&Itemid=39 |title=Brown: Time for MLB to Play Hardball on the Texas Rangers Sale |publisher=Bizofbaseball.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> On April 21, Major League Baseball issued a statement declaring the Rangers' sale to be under the control of the Commissioner to expedite the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rangersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/04/mlb-statement-on-rangers-sale.html |title=MLB statement on Rangers sale : Texas Rangers Blog &#124; |work=The Dallas Morning News |publisher=Rangersblog.dallasnews.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |url=http://startelegramsports.typepad.com/foul_territory/2010/04/mlb-says-its-in-control-of-sale.html |title=Foul Territory: MLB says it's in control of sale |publisher=Startelegramsports.typepad.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> As the stalemate between HSG and its creditors continued, the Texas Rangers filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] on May 24.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/05/24/2010-05-24_arod_takes_a_hit_texas_rangers_file_for_bankrupcty_could_cost_yankees_alex_rodri.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=A-Rod takes a hit: Texas Rangers file for bankruptcy, could cost Yankees' Alex Rodriguez $25 million | first1=Bill | last1=Madden | first2=Corky | last2=Siemaszko | date=May 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\">{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2010/05/24/texas-rangers-owe-alex-rodriguez-249-million/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Texas Rangers Owe Alex Rodriguez $24.9 Million | first=Eric | last=Morath | date=May 24, 2010}}</ref> As of that date, the Rangers and HSG had an estimated debt of $575 million.<ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\"/> Much of the unsecured debt was owed in back salary.

He has called games for the club since 1979 beginning on television broadcasts, then moving exclusively to radio beginning in 1985. He became the primary announcer after the late [[Mark Holtz]] moved to television. Currently, Nadel provides play-by-play in the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th innings, and color commentary for the other innings. On December 11, 2013, he was awarded the 2014 [[Ford C.

Rangers games can also be seen on [[MLB on Fox]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]].\n\nSince 2017, [[Dave Raymond]] is the primary television play-by-play announcer and former MLB pitcher [[C. J.

Raymond replaced Steve Busby, who since 1982 on both TV and radio has had various stints in various positions on Rangers broadcasts from play-by-play to color commentary to pre-game and post-game analysis. In June 2012, Busby moved back to television play-by-play after [[Dave Barnett]] left his position as game announcer following an episode in which he experienced speech difficulties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/texas-rangers/rangersheadlines/2012/11/02/broadcaster-dave-barnett-wishes-things-ended-differently-with-rangers|title=Broadcaster Dave Barnett wishes things ended differently with Rangers|date=2012-11-02|work=SportsDay|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}</ref> Beginning in 2016, Raymond substituted for Busby on select games. Previously the primary color commentator, [[Tom Grieve]] still broadcasts many games. A former Rangers player and general manager, Grieve has been in the TV booth since 1995, following the end of his tenure as GM. Another former Ranger, [[Mark McLemore]], has substituted for Grieve in the past<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/texas-rangers/rangersheadlines/2015/03/13/new-voice-joins-texas-rangers-spring-telecasts|title=New voice joins Texas Rangers spring telecasts|date=2015-03-13|work=SportsDay|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}</ref> and often joins the booth for an inning during home games.

They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League West|West division]]. In 2020, they will move to the new [[Globe Life Field]] after having played at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]] from 1994 to 2019. The team's name is borrowed from the famous [[Texas Ranger Division|law enforcement agency]] of the same name.\n\nThe franchise was established in 1961 as the '''Washington Senators''', an [[expansion team]] awarded to [[Washington, D.C.]], after the city's first AL ballclub, the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|second Washington Senators]], moved to [[Minnesota]] and became the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]] (the [[Washington Senators (1891\u201399)|original Washington Senators]] played primarily in the [[National League]] during the 1890s). After the {{MLBy|1971}} season, the new Senators moved to Arlington, and debuted as the Rangers the following spring.\n\nThe Rangers have made eight appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team then brought home their [[2010 American League Championship Series|first American League pennant]] after beating the [[New York Yankees]] in six games. In the [[2010 World Series]], the franchise's first, the Rangers fell to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, then lost the [[2011 World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Texas Rangers (baseball)}}\n\n===Washington Senators (1961\u20131971)===\nWhen the  [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] moved to [[Minnesota]] in 1960 to become the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]], Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off the twin threats of competition from the proposed [[Continental League]] and loss of its [[Federal Baseball Club v. National League|exemption]] from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. As part of the expansion, the American League added two new teams for the 1961 season\u2013the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]] and a new Washington Senators team. However, the new Senators were (and still are) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. The team played the {{MLBy|1961}} season at old [[Griffith Stadium]] before moving to the new [[District of Columbia Stadium]] under a 10-year lease.\n\n[[File:Richard Nixon throwing out opening pitch at Senators game, 1969.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] throwing [[Opening Day]] [[ceremonial first pitch]] at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on April 7, 1969, with [[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Bob Short]] (right, partially obscured by [[Ralph Houk]])]]\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators: \"Washington: [[Henry Lee III#Political career|first in war, first in peace]] and ''still'' last in the American League.\" Their only winning season was in {{MLBy|1969}} when [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]] managed the club to an 86\u201376 record, placing fourth in the AL East. [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], an [[outfielder]]/[[first baseman]] from 1965 to 1972 known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles. The concurrent rise of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to regular championship contenders (winning their first World Series in {{wsy|1966}}) did not help the Senators' cause either.\n\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Following their brief success in 1969, owner [[Bob Short]] was forced to make many questionable trades to lower the debt he had incurred to pay for the team. By the end of the {{MLBy|1970}} campaign, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (by comparison, the [[New York Yankees]] were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not renew the stadium lease and would move the team elsewhere.\n\nShort was especially receptive to an offer brought up by [[Arlington, Texas]], mayor [[Tom Vandergriff]], who had been trying to obtain a major league sports team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], sought to relocate his baseball team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed and ultimately declined by the other AL team owners. Arlington's [[hole card]] was [[Turnpike Stadium]], a 10,000-seat park which had been built in {{MLBy|1965}} to house the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs]] of the [[Texas League]]. However, it had been built to MLB specifications, and only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate major league crowds.\n\nVandergriff's offer of a multimillion-dollar down payment prompted Short to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, by a vote of 10 to 2, American League owners granted approval to move the franchise to Arlington for the {{MLBy|1972}} season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Minot, Jr.|first=George|title=Short Takes Senators to Texas|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 22, 1971}}</ref> Senators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \"SHORT STINKS\". With the Senators leading 7\u20135 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed [[first base]] and ran off with it. With no security in sight and only three bases, [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] crew chief [[Jim Honochick]] forfeited the game to the New York Yankees.<ref name=\"sensforfeit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/history/rfk/articles/baseball.htm|last=McPherson|first=Myra |last2=Huth|first2=Tom|title=Rowdy Fans Hand Senators Final Loss|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last2=Shannon|first2=Bill|last=Kalinsky|first=George|title=The Ballparks|location=New York|publisher=Hawthorn Books, Inc|year=1975|authorlink=George Kalinsky}}</ref> The nation's capital went without Major League Baseball for 33&nbsp;years until the relocation of the [[National League]]'s [[Montreal Expos]] who became the [[Washington Nationals]].\n\n===Texas Rangers (1972\u2013present)===\n\n====First years in Texas (1972\u20131984)====\n[[File:FrankLucchesiFlickr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Lucchesi]], Rangers manager from 1975 to 1977]]\n\nPrior to the [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972 season]], improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, which reopened as [[Arlington Stadium]], in preparation for the inaugural season of the Texas Rangers. The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1\u20130 loss at the hands of the [[California Angels]], their 1961 expansion cousins. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels, 5\u20131, for the club's first victory.\n\nIn 1974, the Rangers experienced their first winning season after finishing last in both 1972 and 1973. Under the ownership of [[Brad Corbett]], they finished second in the American League West with an 84\u201376 record, behind the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[Oakland Athletics]]. The [[1974 Texas Rangers season|1974 Rangers]] are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. [[Mike Hargrove]] was awarded [[American League Rookie of the Year]], [[Billy Martin]] was named [[AL Manager of the Year]], [[Jeff Burroughs]] won [[AL MVP]], and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was named the [[Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]] after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. The team posted winning records again from 1977 to 1979 but fell short of reaching the playoffs. The Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in 1981, but wound up losing the first half of the AL West by one-and-a-half games to Oakland at the time of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. Texas went on to finish under .500 each season through 1985.\n\nThe Rangers faced an attendance problem for a few years in Texas, due in part to both the team's inconsistent performance and the oppressive heat and humidity that can encompass the area in the summer. Until the [[Florida Marlins]] arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the majors, with temperatures frequently topping {{convert|100|F-change|0}} throughout the summer. So, the Rangers began playing most of their weekend games between May and September at night, a tradition that continues to this day.\n\n====Valentine, Ryan, and Bush (1985\u20131994)====\n[[File:Nolan Ryan Tiger Stadium 1990 CROP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nolan Ryan]] pitched for the Rangers from 1989 to 1993.]]\n\nManager [[Bobby Valentine]] became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of stellar young rookies such as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Pete Incaviglia]], [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], [[Bobby Witt]], and [[Edwin Correa]], the Rangers finished the season in second place with an 87\u201375 record, just five games behind the division-champion Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th [[strikeout]], 300th [[Win (baseball)|win]], and 6th and 7th [[no-hitter]]s with the Rangers. Despite powerful lineups including the likes of [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], Rub\u00e9n Sierra, [[Julio Franco]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]] and a pitching staff that also included [[Charlie Hough]], Bobby Witt, [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], and [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], Valentine's Rangers never finished above second place and he was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season.\n\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon [[Eddie Chiles]], sold the team to an investment group headed by [[George W. Bush]] for $89 million.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-27/sports/sp-855_1_purchase-agreement Los Angeles Times: \"Chiles Reaches Agreement on Sale of Rangers\"] August 27, 1988</ref> While his own equity in the team was a small one ($500,000), Bush was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment to $600,000 the following year.<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html ESPN: \"A series of beneficial moves\" By Tom Farrey] November 1, 1999</ref> Bush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected [[Governor of Texas]] in 1994, and he sold his stake in the team in 1998. Bush went on to be elected [[President of the United States]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]].\n\nDuring Bush's tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991, on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]).\n\nIn 1993, [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]] took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September; Nolan Ryan also retired after that season. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the AL West prior to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] which prompted commissioner [[Bud Selig]] to cancel the remainder of the season and the playoffs. On July 28, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in major league history in Arlington against the California Angels.\n\n====First division titles (1995\u20132000)====\n[[File:Rangersballparkinarlington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Globe Life Park]]  opened in 1994.]]\n\n[[Johnny Oates]] was hired as the Rangers' manager in 1995. Oates and company helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division Championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the New York Yankees, 3 games to 1. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]] was named AL MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters including Gonz\u00e1lez, [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], and [[Rusty Greer]], but continued to struggle with pitching despite having [[Rick Helling]] and [[Aaron Sele]] on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive AL West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three World Series in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team was to be the last playoff-bound team until 2010. En route to a second-straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28&nbsp;games into the 2001 season.\n\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire [[Tom Hicks]] bought the team for $250 million.<ref name=test>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html George W. Bush and the Texas Rangers], Espn.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-04.</ref>\n\n====The lean years (2001\u20132004)====\n[[File:Michael Young on April 25, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]] was selected for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] seven times (2004\u20132009, 2011).]]\n\nPrior to the 2001 season, star free agent shortstop [[Alex Rodriguez]] was signed by the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in baseball history: a 10-year, $252 million contract. The move was controversial and is frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought that owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle, and manager [[Jerry Narron]] was fired following the 2002 season and was replaced by seasoned manager [[Buck Showalter]]. The 2003 season signified the Rangers' fourth-straight last-place finish, and after a postseason fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning AL MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and infield prospect [[Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias (baseball)|Joaquin Arias]].\n\nThe Rangers battled with the [[Anaheim Angels]] and Oakland Athletics for first place in the AL West for much of the 2004 season. [[Mark Teixeira]], Alfonso Soriano, [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], and [[Hank Blalock]] became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano being selected for the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2004 All-Star Game]]. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2 for 3 with a three-run [[home run]]. Despite a late-season push, the Rangers ended up losing six of their final ten games and finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place.\n\n====Making changes (2005\u20132009)====\n[[File:Nelson Cruz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelson Cruz]], Rangers outfielder from 2006 to 2013]]\n\nIn 2005, the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries. [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] stepped down as general manager following the 2005 season. [[Jon Daniels]] was promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, became the youngest general manager in major league history.\n\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in acquiring new players before and during the 2006 season. New acquisitions included [[Brad Wilkerson]], [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]], [[Kevin Millwood]], [[Carlos Lee]], and [[Nelson Cruz]]. Despite bolstering their roster, the Rangers' 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the AL West.

A number of roster moves before the 2007 trade deadline were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. Daniels' objective was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\n\nThe Rangers began the 2008 season exceptionally well, headlined by newcomer [[Josh Hamilton]] who looked to be a threat to win the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Hamilton crushed a first round home run record in the 2008 [[Home Run Derby]] with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' [[Justin Morneau]]. Four Rangers played in the All Star Game: Hamilton, [[Ian Kinsler]], [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]], and Michael Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly.\n\nThe Rangers finished the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79\u201383), yet ended the season second in the AL West, the club's best finish since 1999. The 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first time since 2004. Despite injuries to Josh Hamilton and [[Ian Kinsler]], the Rangers held first place in their division for long stretches of the summer before fading after September 1, losing the division to the Los Angeles Angels. The Rangers finished the season at 87\u201375, their first winning season since 2004 and good enough for second place in the AL West. Michael Young responded to his move to third base by posting one of his best offensive seasons ever while committing just nine errors and earning a sixth-straight All-Star appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=4566 |title=Michael Young Stats \u2013 Texas Rangers \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=1976-10-19 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> Josh Hamilton and [[Nelson Cruz]] were also named 2009 AL All-Stars.\n\n====Rangers Baseball Express, LLC====\nFollowing financial problems, including defaulting on a $525 million loan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finalternatives.com/node/7478 |title=Tom Hicks' Sports Group Defaults On $525 Million In Loans |publisher=FINalternatives |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> [[Tom Hicks]] and Hicks Sports Group reached an agreement to sell the Texas Rangers to group headed by Pittsburgh sports lawyer [[Chuck Greenberg (businessman)|Chuck Greenberg]] and Rangers team president Nolan Ryan for approximately $570 million on January 22, 2010.<ref name=\"mlb.mlb.com\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100122&content_id=7958194&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex&partnerId=rss_tex Hicks' sale of Rangers finalized] ''MLB.com''</ref> Hicks also sold much of the land surrounding Rangers Ballpark to Greenberg and Ryan's group in a separate deal.\n\nHowever, one of HSG's principal lenders, [[Monarch Alternative Capital]], opposed the sale on grounds that the proceeds would not fully repay the defaulted HSG notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4309:brown-time-for-mlb-to-play-hardball-on-the-texas-rangers-sale&catid=26:editorials&Itemid=39 |title=Brown: Time for MLB to Play Hardball on the Texas Rangers Sale |publisher=Bizofbaseball.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> On April 21, Major League Baseball issued a statement declaring the Rangers' sale to be under the control of the Commissioner to expedite the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rangersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/04/mlb-statement-on-rangers-sale.html |title=MLB statement on Rangers sale : Texas Rangers Blog &#124; |work=The Dallas Morning News |publisher=Rangersblog.dallasnews.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |url=http://startelegramsports.typepad.com/foul_territory/2010/04/mlb-says-its-in-control-of-sale.html |title=Foul Territory: MLB says it's in control of sale |publisher=Startelegramsports.typepad.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> As the stalemate between HSG and its creditors continued, the Texas Rangers filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] on May 24.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/05/24/2010-05-24_arod_takes_a_hit_texas_rangers_file_for_bankrupcty_could_cost_yankees_alex_rodri.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=A-Rod takes a hit: Texas Rangers file for bankruptcy, could cost Yankees' Alex Rodriguez $25 million | first1=Bill | last1=Madden | first2=Corky | last2=Siemaszko | date=May 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\">{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2010/05/24/texas-rangers-owe-alex-rodriguez-249-million/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Texas Rangers Owe Alex Rodriguez $24.9 Million | first=Eric | last=Morath | date=May 24, 2010}}</ref> As of that date, the Rangers and HSG had an estimated debt of $575 million.<ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\"/> Much of the unsecured debt was owed in back salary.

Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops.  Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical \"virtuous\" or \"vicious\" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fallibility, reflexivity, and the human uncertainty principle|first=George|last=Soros|volume=20|issue=4|pages=309\u2013329|doi=10.1080/1350178x.2013.859415|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|year = 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"A\">{{Cite book|author=Soros, George|title=The New Paradigm for Financial Markets|publisher=Public Affairs|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58648-683-9|url=https://archive.org/details/newparadigmforfi00soro_0}}</ref>\n\n===Arnhold and S.

By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline\u2014we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)<ref>Soros, George (1999).

Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"[[efficient market hypothesis]]\") does not apply in these situations.  Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.<ref name=\"A\" /> He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:<ref name=\"A\" />\n\n# Reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena. Examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include (a) equity leveraging or (b) the [[Trend following|trend-following]] habits of speculators.\n# Reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions; i.e., the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities.\n# Investors' observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes.\n\nA recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.<ref name=\"A\" /> Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses.  More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses.  Lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans \u2013 the value of the houses \u2013 had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively).  Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still.\n\nThis was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.\n\nThe concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Solow|first=Robert|title=The Amateur|journal=The New Republic|date=February 8, 1999|url= }}</ref> but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the ''[[Journal of Economic Methodology]]''.<ref>{{cite journal| editor-last= Hands| editor-first= D.

He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"[[open society]]\" in the past were from communism and fascism (as discussed in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' by his mentor [[Karl Popper]]), the largest current threat is from [[market fundamentalism]].\n\nHe has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.<ref>{{cite book| title= The Bubble of American Supremacy: Correcting the Misuse of American Power| publisher= PublicAffairs| year= 2003| isbn= 978-1-58648-217-6| url= https://archive.org/details/bubbleofamerican00soro}}</ref>\n\n===View of problems in the free market system===\nSoros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries.

Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.<ref>Soros, George.

By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline\u2014we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)<ref>Soros, George (1999).

Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"[[efficient market hypothesis]]\") does not apply in these situations.  Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.<ref name=\"A\" /> He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:<ref name=\"A\" />\n\n# Reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena. Examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include (a) equity leveraging or (b) the [[Trend following|trend-following]] habits of speculators.\n# Reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions; i.e., the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities.\n# Investors' observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes.\n\nA recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.<ref name=\"A\" /> Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses.  More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses.  Lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans \u2013 the value of the houses \u2013 had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively).  Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still.\n\nThis was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.\n\nThe concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Solow|first=Robert|title=The Amateur|journal=The New Republic|date=February 8, 1999|url= }}</ref> but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the ''[[Journal of Economic Methodology]]''.<ref>{{cite journal| editor-last= Hands| editor-first= D.

He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"[[open society]]\" in the past were from communism and fascism (as discussed in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' by his mentor [[Karl Popper]]), the largest current threat is from [[market fundamentalism]].\n\nHe has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.<ref>{{cite book| title= The Bubble of American Supremacy: Correcting the Misuse of American Power| publisher= PublicAffairs| year= 2003| isbn= 978-1-58648-217-6| url= https://archive.org/details/bubbleofamerican00soro}}</ref>\n\n===View of problems in the free market system===\nSoros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries.

Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism.

It was released in 1993 by [[London Records]], the last release the group had on this label. It is also the first album from Bananarama as a duo \u2013 with original members [[Sara Dallin]] and [[Keren Woodward]] continuing after the departure of [[Jacquie O'Sullivan]] in 1991 and the last to feature both [[Sara Dallin]] and [[Keren Woodward]] to play bass guitar on some tracks on the album until ''[[Viva (Bananarama album)|Viva]]''.  ''Please Yourself'' also reunites Bananarama with two-thirds of the [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] production team (Stock and Waterman). Musician Gary Miller was brought in to do keyboards and guitar and would be Bananarama's next collaborator on their next album ''[[Ultra Violet (Bananarama album)|Ultra Violet]]''. The concept of the album was first suggested by Pete Waterman as 'ABBA-Banana', a record that would feature pop songs in the style of [[ABBA]], but updated for the 1990s{{cn|date=September 2018}}.\n\n''Please Yourself'' features songs in a [[Europop]] style. It is the first Bananarama album not to get a release in the United States, and upon its release in the UK, it was panned by critics and charted at a low number forty-six.<ref name=\"occ\"/> There was a limited double CD edition featuring 12\" remix of former hit singles. Dallin and Woodward have later admitted in interviews that they are not fond of this album{{cn|date=September 2018}}. Two of the songs on the album would later be recycled by Pete Waterman over five years later for use with the band [[Steps (group)|Steps]]- \"[[Last Thing on My Mind (Bananarama song)#Steps version|Last Thing on My Mind]]\" would be their second single and the track \"[[Movin' On (Bananarama song)|Movin' On]]\" would be included on their second album ''[[Steptacular]]''.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Sara Dallin]], [[Keren Woodward]], [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]] and [[Pete Waterman]], except where noted.\n\n'''CD and cassette versions'''\n#\"[[Movin' On (Bananarama song)|Movin' On]]\" \u2013 4:38 \n#\"[[Last Thing on My Mind (Bananarama song)|Last Thing on My Mind]]\" \u2013 3:35\n#\"Let Me Love You One More Time\" \u2013 3:39\n#\"[[More, More, More#Bananarama version|More, More, More]]\" \u2013 3:08 <small>(G.

It was released in 1993 by [[London Records]], the last release the group had on this label. It is also the first album from Bananarama as a duo \u2013 with original members [[Sara Dallin]] and [[Keren Woodward]] continuing after the departure of [[Jacquie O'Sullivan]] in 1991 and the last to feature both [[Sara Dallin]] and [[Keren Woodward]] to play bass guitar on some tracks on the album until ''[[Viva (Bananarama album)|Viva]]''.  ''Please Yourself'' also reunites Bananarama with two-thirds of the [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] production team (Stock and Waterman). Musician Gary Miller was brought in to do keyboards and guitar and would be Bananarama's next collaborator on their next album ''[[Ultra Violet (Bananarama album)|Ultra Violet]]''. The concept of the album was first suggested by Pete Waterman as 'ABBA-Banana', a record that would feature pop songs in the style of [[ABBA]], but updated for the 1990s{{cn|date=September 2018}}.\n\n''Please Yourself'' features songs in a [[Europop]] style. It is the first Bananarama album not to get a release in the United States, and upon its release in the UK, it was panned by critics and charted at a low number forty-six.<ref name=\"occ\"/> There was a limited double CD edition featuring 12\" remix of former hit singles. Dallin and Woodward have later admitted in interviews that they are not fond of this album{{cn|date=September 2018}}. Two of the songs on the album would later be recycled by Pete Waterman over five years later for use with the band [[Steps (group)|Steps]]- \"[[Last Thing on My Mind (Bananarama song)#Steps version|Last Thing on My Mind]]\" would be their second single and the track \"[[Movin' On (Bananarama song)|Movin' On]]\" would be included on their second album ''[[Steptacular]]''.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Sara Dallin]], [[Keren Woodward]], [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]] and [[Pete Waterman]], except where noted.\n\n'''CD and cassette versions'''\n#\"[[Movin' On (Bananarama song)|Movin' On]]\" \u2013 4:38 \n#\"[[Last Thing on My Mind (Bananarama song)|Last Thing on My Mind]]\" \u2013 3:35\n#\"Let Me Love You One More Time\" \u2013 3:39\n#\"[[More, More, More#Bananarama version|More, More, More]]\" \u2013 3:08 <small>(G.

French missionaries and traders first appeared in the area during the late 17th century and encountered the [[Ojibwe|Ojibwe (Chippewa)]] living in the area. The first permanent settlement by those other than Native Americans was in 1816 when [[Louis Campau]] established a trading post on the west bank of the Saginaw River.<ref name=wses>{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=Nancy Sajdak|title=West Side, East Side|url=http://www.greatlakesbaymag.com/2014/06/west-side-east-side/|accessdate=January 22, 2015|work=Great Lakes Bay Magazine|issue=June 2014|publisher=Great Lakes Publishing}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the [[United States]] established Fort Saginaw. Campau's trading post was also inhabited by Metis.\n\nDuring Michigan's territorial period, a county and township government were organized at Saginaw. Growth of the settlement was fueled rapidly during the 19th century by the lumber industry. Saginaw was the site of numerous sawmills and served as a port for Great Lakes vessels. What is now the city of Saginaw resulted from the consolidation of the cities of East Saginaw and Saginaw City (West Side) in 1889.\n\n====Fort Saginaw====\n\nIn 1819, [[Lewis Cass]], in the [[Treaty of Saginaw]], negotiated the prerogative for the [[United States]] to own and settle the area with the leaders of the [[Ojibwe]]. In 1820, Campau attempted to expand across to the east bank of the river but was rejected by the Chippewas. In 1822, the [[United States Army]] established a [[fort]] on the west bank of the [[Saginaw River]] and named it Fort Saginaw. Two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] were stationed at the fort. A group of investors purchased some land near the fort and had it [[plat]]ted under the name, Town of Sagana. Due to the extremely harsh seasons and illnesses, Fort Saginaw was abandoned by 1824.<ref name=wses/>\n\nBy the late 1820s, the [[American Fur Company]] was operating a post at Saginaw.\n\nFew plots were sold and after the U.S. Army pulled out, the town languished for most of the following decade. The town was re-platted in December 1830, comprising riverfront from Cass Street, on the south, to Harrison Street, and north to Jefferson. These plots sold slowly. By 1835, only 24 plots had been sold and the remainder were transferred to a new owner, who made another plat in February 1837. However, the financial crisis of the [[Panic of 1837]] dampened interest in purchasing properties. After selling only 58 of the 407 plots, the remainder was sold again in 1841.<ref name=\"leeson\">{{cite book |last=Leeson |first=Michael A. |title=History of Saginaw county, Michigan |origyear=1881 |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad1164.0001.001 |accessdate=2007-04-11 |year=2005 |publisher=University of Michigan Library |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |pages=596+}}</ref>\n\n====Native Americans====\n\nSaginaw was the location of the annual government payment to the Ojibwe and Ottawa of the area, starting in the 1830s. This also attracted many French-Canadian and Euro-American merchants, primarily involved in selling watered down whiskey.<ref>''History of Saginaw County, Michigan'' (Chicago: Charles A. Chapman, 1881) p. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\n====Lumber boom====\n\n[[File:Eddy Lumber Docks 1888.jpg|thumb|Eddy Lumber Docks]]\n\nThe main cause for the founding and subsequent development of Saginaw was the large demand for lumber as the [[United States]] expanded westward. A virgin growth forest principally consisting of white pine trees covered most of Michigan. The convenient access to transportation provided by the [[Saginaw River]] and its numerous tributaries fueled a massive expansion in population and economic activity. As the trees were being cut down in the region, logs were floated down the rivers to sawmills located in Saginaw, destined to be loaded onto ships and later railroad cars.\n[[File:Holland Street Lumber Docks 1888.jpg|thumb|Holland Lumber Docks on Saginaw River 1888]]\n[[File:Lumber Docks in Old Saginaw City at Mackinaw Street 1888.jpg|thumb|Lumber Docks in Saginaw City at Mackinaw Street 1888]]\n\nMultiple settlements comprise present-day Saginaw. On the west side of the river the first settlement around what had been Fort Saginaw developed into Saginaw, which was incorporated as a city in 1857, containing the seat of the Saginaw County government. On the east side of the river a parallel settlement, East Saginaw, developed which was incorporated first as a village in 1855, and then as a city in 1859. Also south of East Saginaw, on the east bank of the river, the village of Salina formed. Salina's name relates to the [[brine]] that led to a growing industry of salt production in the area. Both Saginaw and East Saginaw quickly became a hub for railroad transportation in addition to ships on the Saginaw River.\n[[File:Lumber Docks A.W. Wright 1888.jpg|thumb|Lumber Docks AW Wright along Saginaw River]]\n[[File:Pere Marquette Railroad Station on Potter Street 1888.jpg|thumb|Pere Marquette Railroad Station (Potter Street Station) 1888]]\n\nLumber production peaked by the early 1870s, but had virtually disappeared by the end of the 19th century. In addition to salt production, which experienced an eventual decline as well, growing industries, such as those supporting the area's agriculture and manufacturing, developed.\n\n====Consolidation====\n\n[[File:City Hall built 1890.jpg|thumb|Saginaw City Hall]]\n\nOn June 28, 1889, the [[Michigan]] state legislature passed Act 455 to consolidate the cities of Saginaw and [[East Saginaw, Michigan|East Saginaw]] into a single city.<ref name=\"minutes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saginaw-mi.com/Government/Departments/CityCouncil/Minutes/2005/06-27-05%20Council%20Meeting-NA.doc |title=Minutes of City Council Meeting\u2014June 27, 2005 |accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref><ref name=\"charter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saginaw-mi.com/Government/charter/preface.php |title=City Charter Preface |accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref> Prior to this consolidation, the nearby village of Salina had already become part of East Saginaw. The consolidation of Saginaw became effective with the election of officers on March 12, 1890.<ref name=\"charter\" />\n[[File:Hoyt Public Library in Saginaw.png|thumb|left|The [[Hoyt Library|Hoyt Public Library]], pictured here in June 2006, was built in 1887 by [[Henry Van Brunt#Van Brunt & Howe|Van Brunt & Howe]] of Boston.]]\n\nThe provisions of the [[city charter]] were established by the same act of the legislature that provided for the consolidation. Saginaw was to be governed by a [[city council]] consisting of two [[aldermen]] elected from 21 wards and a mainly ceremonial executive [[mayor]] who was to have fairly weak powers. This was to be, as numerous other elected officials, along with elected or appointed boards, controlled much of the administrative and executive functions of government. The efficient and cohesive functioning of the Saginaw city government also was constrained by remaining rivalries between residents, business owners, and politicians from the former two cities. The distinctions and rivalries between Saginaw's east side and west side persisted into the 20th century in various forms, and continues to influence Saginaw's social, political, economic landscape, even into the 2010s.<ref name=\"rev-150th\">{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Mike |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=June 2007 |title=Saginaw Celebrates its 150th Birthday! |journal=Review Magazine |volume=29 |issue=641 |url=http://review-mag.com/archive/640-649/641/Saginaw150.htm |access-date=2007-11-29 |quote= |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022004509/http://www.review-mag.com/archive/640-649/641/Saginaw150.htm |archive-date=2007-10-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n\n<!-- [[File:Bliss Park (NBY 483).jpg|thumb|Bliss Park in Saginaw, circa 1900s]] Copyright?

Other Michigan cities became suppliers to Detroit factories, sometimes with factories of their own. In Saginaw, the Jackson-Church-Wilcox Company began as a partnership in 1906 for producing [[steering]] gear under the \"Jacox\" brand. Jackson-Church-Wilcox was acquired by [[Buick]] in 1909, and as part of [[General Motors]] became the Jackson, Church and Wilcox Division, the first GM division devoted to parts production. In 1919 the Jacox division was merged with Saginaw Malleable Iron and Central Foundry into GM's Saginaw Products Company. This formed the basis for the Saginaw Steering Gear Division, created in 1928. General Motors and other manufacturers established [[foundries]] and other automobile-related manufacturing facilities in Saginaw, for the production of chemicals and plate glass, as well as metal fabrication. This early development of a symbiotic relationship with the auto industry set the course for the future of the city.<ref name=\"steering\">{{cite web |url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Saginaw_Steering_Division|title=Saginaw Steering Division\u2014Generations of GM|accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Panorama of downtown Saginaw in 1912.jpg|thumb|Panorama of downtown Saginaw, 1912]]\n\n====New governance====\n\nIn 1908, a new [[Michigan Constitution|Michigan state constitution]] was adopted. The new Michigan state constitution mandated increased [[home rule]] powers for local units of government, and the Michigan state legislature enacted the [[Home Rule Cities Act (Michigan)|Home Rule Cities Act]] in 1909. Under this [[statute]], cities were permitted to frame and adopt their own city charters and were given great flexibility in structuring their local governments. The government, under the 1889 charter, had continued to be inefficient and provided for much political infighting. In 1913, a new city charter was adopted with voter approval and which followed a [[City commission government|commission form of city government]] that had gained in popular interest among various cities across the United States in the early 20th century. The new government consisted of five commissioners, each elected separately [[at-large]], who served both as the city council and as the executive heads of various city government departments. One of the commissioners served as the mayor, which was a mostly ceremonial role.\n[[File:Downtown Saginaw 1915.jpg|thumb|Downtown Saginaw about 1915]]\n\nThe 1913 city charter was followed for little more than two decades when the voters of the city again adopted another new city charter in 1935 following the [[Council-manager government|council-manager form of government]]. The government under the 1913 city charter retained some of the independent boards that were given authority independent of the elected city commissioners. This caused some inefficiency and political friction. The economic consequences of the [[Great Depression]] during the 1930s provided the final catalyst for municipal government reform.\n\nIn contrast to the previous government structures, the 1935 charter, having taken effect in 1936, provided for all administration of city government to be headed directly by a single officer, the [[city manager]], who was appointed by, and accountable to a city council of nine members elected as a group by the entire city at-large. The system was designed to address two principal issues with Saginaw's history of municipal government, the inefficiency and politics associated with having executive and administrative authority spread among many different officers and boards, and political rivalries and friction between various geographic areas of the city, mainly the east side and the west side.\n\n====Expansion and growth====\n\n[[File:Former Castle Station post office- Saginaw Michigan.png|thumb|right|The former East Saginaw Post Office, pictured here in June 2006, is now the site of the [[Castle Museum (Saginaw)|Castle Museum of Saginaw County History]] and is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]\n[[File:Aerial View of Downtown Saginaw 1930.jpg|thumb|Aerial View of Downtown Saginaw in 1930]]\n\nDuring much of the 20th century, Saginaw's economy was dominated by manufacturing related to the automotive industry; most notably, manual transmission assemblies, steering gear boxes and power steering pumps.

This population growth included the expanded presence of African Americans and Latinos in Saginaw. Even before the end of the war, the needs of Saginaw's growth became clear, and were met by significant investment in the city's infrastructure. In 1947, Saginaw and the nearby city of [[Midland, Michigan|Midland]] constructed a {{convert|65|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[water supply]] pipeline drawing water from Whitestone Point in [[Lake Huron]] to meet the anticipated needs of the communities. In addition, the cities of Midland and [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]] joined with Saginaw to develop and operate an airport on the site of a former POW camp in nearby [[Tittabawassee Township]], which eventually became [[MBS International Airport]].\n\n====Post World War II====\n\nIn the years following [[World War II]], the Michigan state legislature enacted laws making it increasingly difficult for incorporated cities to expand by annexing territory from neighboring townships. Townships, which had historically served an agrarian, smaller population than that of larger cities, were given the ability to provide nearly all the same services an incorporated city could. Although Midland pursued (and continues to pursue) a policy of \"No annexation, no water,\"<ref name=MidlandMUGAhistory>{{cite web|title=The Midland Urban Growth Area (MUGA)|url=http://www.midland-mi.org/government/departments/planning/planning/muga.htm|publisher=City of Midland Planning Department|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref> Saginaw chose to sell water to neighboring communities under long-term contracts. This allowed the townships to further develop at the expense of the city, the limits of which changed little after consolidation in 1989\u201390. The unintended consequence of this choice was that Saginaw's population stopped growing, new housing development focused on the suburban townships, and businesses eventually followed.\n\n===21st century===\n\n[[File:Flint & Pere Marquette Union Station, East Saginaw, Michigan.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The abandoned [[Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad East Saginaw Depot|Flint & Pere Marquette Union Station]]]]\n\n====Population decline====\n\nManufacturing in Saginaw declined in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to high unemployment in the city. As a result, the city's population diminished dramatically. From 2000 to 2010, the population of Saginaw proper decreased by nearly 10,000. Michigan's population during that period decreased by 0.6% percent, the only U.S. state to lose population during the decade of the 2000s. In addition, Saginaw has faced increasing social problems relating to poverty as a result of its high rate of unemployment. The crime rate has been a major area of concern for the community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census 2010 News U.S. Census Bureau Releases Data on Population Distribution and Change in the U.S. Based on Analysis of 2010|url=http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn124.html|access-date=23 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016002430/http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn124.html|archive-date=16 October 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n====Unemployment and crime====\n\nSaginaw's economic conditions, compounded by the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]], are a significant area of concern for the city's residents. The decline of manufacturing jobs has resulted in higher than average rates of unemployment. Property values in the city have declined, decreasing the amount the city government collects in property taxes. Unemployment in Saginaw peaked in July 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, standing at 23.5%. The unemployment rate dropped to 9.0% as of April 2015; crime has decreased as unemployment has decreased.\n\n====Combating blight====\n\nUnemployment and population loss in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to [[urban decay|urban blight]], specifically a rise in abandoned homes that provided locations for criminal activity. In recent years, city officials, law enforcement, and neighborhood watch associations have made progress in preventing this activity by heavily patrolling target areas and offering rewards for reporting illegal or suspicious activities.\n\nEfforts to reduce blight in Saginaw increased greatly in 2013, with the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] approving a grant to demolish vacant and abandoned properties via the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. The $100 million grant contained $11.2 million set aside for Saginaw, with Detroit receiving $52.3 million, Flint $20.1 million, [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] $3.7 million, and the final $2.5 million going to [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]].<ref name=\"Oosting\">{{cite web |last=Oosting |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/detroit_to_get_bulk_of_federal.html |title=Detroit, Flint and Saginaw get bulk of federal funds awarded to fight blight in 5 Michigan cities |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Michigan Governor]] [[Rick Snyder]] praised the initiative, saying, \"With these federal funds, we'll be able to launch large-scale demolition programs that strike at the blight that is weakening too many neighborhoods in these cities.\" He added, \"This aggressive anti-blight effort will help stabilize neighborhoods that have been struggling for years. As the abandoned properties come down, property values will go up, and crime will go down. That will encourage the people who live in these neighborhoods to stay in their homes and be part of the revitalization of their communities.\"<ref name=\"Oosting\" />\n\nThe Saginaw city government can legally tear down only publicly owned properties, a number that stands above 400. The federal grant provides funds to demolish nearly 950 structures. After the grant's approval, Saginaw city officials announced a program to purchase unwanted, abandoned structures from their owners, which would be then added to the list of homes to tear down. Officials estimate that there are nearly 1,200 privately owned homes within the city limits that are worthy of demolition.<ref name=\"Tower\">{{cite web |last=Tower |first=Mark |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/11/sell_your_run-down_house_for_c.html |title=Sell your run-down house in Saginaw for cash: Owners given chance to unload properties |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to revitalize downtown increased in 2013. CBS television executive and Saginaw native David Strouse announced an investment plan in late 2013 that would save nearly an entire block of buildings slated for demolition at the intersection of Washington and Genesee, the core of downtown Saginaw. The plan called for the renovation and redevelopment of four buildings, creating market-rate apartments on the upper floors and retail space at ground level. In 2012 a similar deal was made for the Bancroft and Eddy apartments at the same intersection. Once [[Section 8 (housing)|Section{{nbsp}}8]] housing, these buildings are being transformed into market-rate apartments and retail space.<ref name=\"Tower2\">{{cite web |last=Tower |first=Mark |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/09/cbs_television_executives_to_d.html |title=CBS Television executive confirms multimillion-dollar plans for historic block in downtown Saginaw |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref>\n\n====Recent economic development====\n\nEconomic development in the region is focused on comparative advantages in innovation, clean energy, and continued manufacturing exports. Compared to other mid-sized communities, Saginaw has a high number of patent applications per job, and more than 81 times the average US share of jobs in photovoltaic technology research and production. The city continues to have a higher proportion of manufacturing jobs than the US average.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/0223_michigan_mid_metros.pdf

French missionaries and traders first appeared in the area during the late 17th century and encountered the [[Ojibwe|Ojibwe (Chippewa)]] living in the area. The first permanent settlement by those other than Native Americans was in 1816 when [[Louis Campau]] established a trading post on the west bank of the Saginaw River.<ref name=wses>{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=Nancy Sajdak|title=West Side, East Side|url=http://www.greatlakesbaymag.com/2014/06/west-side-east-side/|accessdate=January 22, 2015|work=Great Lakes Bay Magazine|issue=June 2014|publisher=Great Lakes Publishing}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the [[United States]] established Fort Saginaw. Campau's trading post was also inhabited by Metis.\n\nDuring Michigan's territorial period, a county and township government were organized at Saginaw. Growth of the settlement was fueled rapidly during the 19th century by the lumber industry. Saginaw was the site of numerous sawmills and served as a port for Great Lakes vessels. What is now the city of Saginaw resulted from the consolidation of the cities of East Saginaw and Saginaw City (West Side) in 1889.\n\n====Fort Saginaw====\n\nIn 1819, [[Lewis Cass]], in the [[Treaty of Saginaw]], negotiated the prerogative for the [[United States]] to own and settle the area with the leaders of the [[Ojibwe]]. In 1820, Campau attempted to expand across to the east bank of the river but was rejected by the Chippewas. In 1822, the [[United States Army]] established a [[fort]] on the west bank of the [[Saginaw River]] and named it Fort Saginaw. Two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] were stationed at the fort. A group of investors purchased some land near the fort and had it [[plat]]ted under the name, Town of Sagana. Due to the extremely harsh seasons and illnesses, Fort Saginaw was abandoned by 1824.<ref name=wses/>\n\nBy the late 1820s, the [[American Fur Company]] was operating a post at Saginaw.\n\nFew plots were sold and after the U.S. Army pulled out, the town languished for most of the following decade. The town was re-platted in December 1830, comprising riverfront from Cass Street, on the south, to Harrison Street, and north to Jefferson. These plots sold slowly. By 1835, only 24 plots had been sold and the remainder were transferred to a new owner, who made another plat in February 1837. However, the financial crisis of the [[Panic of 1837]] dampened interest in purchasing properties. After selling only 58 of the 407 plots, the remainder was sold again in 1841.<ref name=\"leeson\">{{cite book |last=Leeson |first=Michael A. |title=History of Saginaw county, Michigan |origyear=1881 |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad1164.0001.001 |accessdate=2007-04-11 |year=2005 |publisher=University of Michigan Library |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |pages=596+}}</ref>\n\n====Native Americans====\n\nSaginaw was the location of the annual government payment to the Ojibwe and Ottawa of the area, starting in the 1830s.

Chapman, 1881) p. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\n====Lumber boom====\n\n[[File:Eddy Lumber Docks 1888.jpg|thumb|Eddy Lumber Docks]]\n\nThe main cause for the founding and subsequent development of Saginaw was the large demand for lumber as the [[United States]] expanded westward. A virgin growth forest principally consisting of white pine trees covered most of Michigan. The convenient access to transportation provided by the [[Saginaw River]] and its numerous tributaries fueled a massive expansion in population and economic activity. As the trees were being cut down in the region, logs were floated down the rivers to sawmills located in Saginaw, destined to be loaded onto ships and later railroad cars.\n[[File:Holland Street Lumber Docks 1888.jpg|thumb|Holland Lumber Docks on Saginaw River 1888]]\n[[File:Lumber Docks in Old Saginaw City at Mackinaw Street 1888.jpg|thumb|Lumber Docks in Saginaw City at Mackinaw Street 1888]]\n\nMultiple settlements comprise present-day Saginaw. On the west side of the river the first settlement around what had been Fort Saginaw developed into Saginaw, which was incorporated as a city in 1857, containing the seat of the Saginaw County government. On the east side of the river a parallel settlement, East Saginaw, developed which was incorporated first as a village in 1855, and then as a city in 1859. Also south of East Saginaw, on the east bank of the river, the village of Salina formed. Salina's name relates to the [[brine]] that led to a growing industry of salt production in the area. Both Saginaw and East Saginaw quickly became a hub for railroad transportation in addition to ships on the Saginaw River.\n[[File:Lumber Docks A.W. Wright 1888.jpg|thumb|Lumber Docks AW Wright along Saginaw River]]\n[[File:Pere Marquette Railroad Station on Potter Street 1888.jpg|thumb|Pere Marquette Railroad Station (Potter Street Station) 1888]]\n\nLumber production peaked by the early 1870s, but had virtually disappeared by the end of the 19th century. In addition to salt production, which experienced an eventual decline as well, growing industries, such as those supporting the area's agriculture and manufacturing, developed.\n\n====Consolidation====\n\n[[File:City Hall built 1890.jpg|thumb|Saginaw City Hall]]\n\nOn June 28, 1889, the [[Michigan]] state legislature passed Act 455 to consolidate the cities of Saginaw and [[East Saginaw, Michigan|East Saginaw]] into a single city.<ref name=\"minutes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saginaw-mi.com/Government/Departments/CityCouncil/Minutes/2005/06-27-05%20Council%20Meeting-NA.doc |title=Minutes of City Council Meeting\u2014June 27, 2005 |accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref><ref name=\"charter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saginaw-mi.com/Government/charter/preface.php |title=City Charter Preface |accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref> Prior to this consolidation, the nearby village of Salina had already become part of East Saginaw.

Saginaw was to be governed by a [[city council]] consisting of two [[aldermen]] elected from 21 wards and a mainly ceremonial executive [[mayor]] who was to have fairly weak powers. This was to be, as numerous other elected officials, along with elected or appointed boards, controlled much of the administrative and executive functions of government. The efficient and cohesive functioning of the Saginaw city government also was constrained by remaining rivalries between residents, business owners, and politicians from the former two cities. The distinctions and rivalries between Saginaw's east side and west side persisted into the 20th century in various forms, and continues to influence Saginaw's social, political, economic landscape, even into the 2010s.<ref name=\"rev-150th\">{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Mike |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=June 2007 |title=Saginaw Celebrates its 150th Birthday! |journal=Review Magazine |volume=29 |issue=641 |url=http://review-mag.com/archive/640-649/641/Saginaw150.htm |access-date=2007-11-29 |quote= |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022004509/http://www.review-mag.com/archive/640-649/641/Saginaw150.htm |archive-date=2007-10-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n\n<!-- [[File:Bliss Park (NBY 483).jpg|thumb|Bliss Park in Saginaw, circa 1900s]] Copyright?

Other Michigan cities became suppliers to Detroit factories, sometimes with factories of their own. In Saginaw, the Jackson-Church-Wilcox Company began as a partnership in 1906 for producing [[steering]] gear under the \"Jacox\" brand. Jackson-Church-Wilcox was acquired by [[Buick]] in 1909, and as part of [[General Motors]] became the Jackson, Church and Wilcox Division, the first GM division devoted to parts production. In 1919 the Jacox division was merged with Saginaw Malleable Iron and Central Foundry into GM's Saginaw Products Company. This formed the basis for the Saginaw Steering Gear Division, created in 1928. General Motors and other manufacturers established [[foundries]] and other automobile-related manufacturing facilities in Saginaw, for the production of chemicals and plate glass, as well as metal fabrication. This early development of a symbiotic relationship with the auto industry set the course for the future of the city.<ref name=\"steering\">{{cite web |url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Saginaw_Steering_Division|title=Saginaw Steering Division\u2014Generations of GM|accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Panorama of downtown Saginaw in 1912.jpg|thumb|Panorama of downtown Saginaw, 1912]]\n\n====New governance====\n\nIn 1908, a new [[Michigan Constitution|Michigan state constitution]] was adopted. The new Michigan state constitution mandated increased [[home rule]] powers for local units of government, and the Michigan state legislature enacted the [[Home Rule Cities Act (Michigan)|Home Rule Cities Act]] in 1909. Under this [[statute]], cities were permitted to frame and adopt their own city charters and were given great flexibility in structuring their local governments. The government, under the 1889 charter, had continued to be inefficient and provided for much political infighting. In 1913, a new city charter was adopted with voter approval and which followed a [[City commission government|commission form of city government]] that had gained in popular interest among various cities across the United States in the early 20th century. The new government consisted of five commissioners, each elected separately [[at-large]], who served both as the city council and as the executive heads of various city government departments. One of the commissioners served as the mayor, which was a mostly ceremonial role.\n[[File:Downtown Saginaw 1915.jpg|thumb|Downtown Saginaw about 1915]]\n\nThe 1913 city charter was followed for little more than two decades when the voters of the city again adopted another new city charter in 1935 following the [[Council-manager government|council-manager form of government]]. The government under the 1913 city charter retained some of the independent boards that were given authority independent of the elected city commissioners. This caused some inefficiency and political friction. The economic consequences of the [[Great Depression]] during the 1930s provided the final catalyst for municipal government reform.\n\nIn contrast to the previous government structures, the 1935 charter, having taken effect in 1936, provided for all administration of city government to be headed directly by a single officer, the [[city manager]], who was appointed by, and accountable to a city council of nine members elected as a group by the entire city at-large. The system was designed to address two principal issues with Saginaw's history of municipal government, the inefficiency and politics associated with having executive and administrative authority spread among many different officers and boards, and political rivalries and friction between various geographic areas of the city, mainly the east side and the west side.\n\n====Expansion and growth====\n\n[[File:Former Castle Station post office- Saginaw Michigan.png|thumb|right|The former East Saginaw Post Office, pictured here in June 2006, is now the site of the [[Castle Museum (Saginaw)|Castle Museum of Saginaw County History]] and is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]\n[[File:Aerial View of Downtown Saginaw 1930.jpg|thumb|Aerial View of Downtown Saginaw in 1930]]\n\nDuring much of the 20th century, Saginaw's economy was dominated by manufacturing related to the automotive industry; most notably, manual transmission assemblies, steering gear boxes and power steering pumps.

This population growth included the expanded presence of African Americans and Latinos in Saginaw. Even before the end of the war, the needs of Saginaw's growth became clear, and were met by significant investment in the city's infrastructure. In 1947, Saginaw and the nearby city of [[Midland, Michigan|Midland]] constructed a {{convert|65|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[water supply]] pipeline drawing water from Whitestone Point in [[Lake Huron]] to meet the anticipated needs of the communities. In addition, the cities of Midland and [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]] joined with Saginaw to develop and operate an airport on the site of a former POW camp in nearby [[Tittabawassee Township]], which eventually became [[MBS International Airport]].\n\n====Post World War II====\n\nIn the years following [[World War II]], the Michigan state legislature enacted laws making it increasingly difficult for incorporated cities to expand by annexing territory from neighboring townships. Townships, which had historically served an agrarian, smaller population than that of larger cities, were given the ability to provide nearly all the same services an incorporated city could. Although Midland pursued (and continues to pursue) a policy of \"No annexation, no water,\"<ref name=MidlandMUGAhistory>{{cite web|title=The Midland Urban Growth Area (MUGA)|url=http://www.midland-mi.org/government/departments/planning/planning/muga.htm|publisher=City of Midland Planning Department|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref> Saginaw chose to sell water to neighboring communities under long-term contracts. This allowed the townships to further develop at the expense of the city, the limits of which changed little after consolidation in 1989\u201390. The unintended consequence of this choice was that Saginaw's population stopped growing, new housing development focused on the suburban townships, and businesses eventually followed.\n\n===21st century===\n\n[[File:Flint & Pere Marquette Union Station, East Saginaw, Michigan.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The abandoned [[Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad East Saginaw Depot|Flint & Pere Marquette Union Station]]]]\n\n====Population decline====\n\nManufacturing in Saginaw declined in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to high unemployment in the city. As a result, the city's population diminished dramatically. From 2000 to 2010, the population of Saginaw proper decreased by nearly 10,000. Michigan's population during that period decreased by 0.6% percent, the only U.S. state to lose population during the decade of the 2000s. In addition, Saginaw has faced increasing social problems relating to poverty as a result of its high rate of unemployment. The crime rate has been a major area of concern for the community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census 2010 News U.S. Census Bureau Releases Data on Population Distribution and Change in the U.S. Based on Analysis of 2010|url=http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn124.html|access-date=23 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016002430/http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn124.html|archive-date=16 October 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n====Unemployment and crime====\n\nSaginaw's economic conditions, compounded by the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]], are a significant area of concern for the city's residents. The decline of manufacturing jobs has resulted in higher than average rates of unemployment. Property values in the city have declined, decreasing the amount the city government collects in property taxes. Unemployment in Saginaw peaked in July 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, standing at 23.5%. The unemployment rate dropped to 9.0% as of April 2015; crime has decreased as unemployment has decreased.\n\n====Combating blight====\n\nUnemployment and population loss in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to [[urban decay|urban blight]], specifically a rise in abandoned homes that provided locations for criminal activity. In recent years, city officials, law enforcement, and neighborhood watch associations have made progress in preventing this activity by heavily patrolling target areas and offering rewards for reporting illegal or suspicious activities.\n\nEfforts to reduce blight in Saginaw increased greatly in 2013, with the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] approving a grant to demolish vacant and abandoned properties via the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. The $100 million grant contained $11.2 million set aside for Saginaw, with Detroit receiving $52.3 million, Flint $20.1 million, [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] $3.7 million, and the final $2.5 million going to [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]].<ref name=\"Oosting\">{{cite web |last=Oosting |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/detroit_to_get_bulk_of_federal.html |title=Detroit, Flint and Saginaw get bulk of federal funds awarded to fight blight in 5 Michigan cities |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Michigan Governor]] [[Rick Snyder]] praised the initiative, saying, \"With these federal funds, we'll be able to launch large-scale demolition programs that strike at the blight that is weakening too many neighborhoods in these cities.\" He added, \"This aggressive anti-blight effort will help stabilize neighborhoods that have been struggling for years. As the abandoned properties come down, property values will go up, and crime will go down. That will encourage the people who live in these neighborhoods to stay in their homes and be part of the revitalization of their communities.\"<ref name=\"Oosting\" />\n\nThe Saginaw city government can legally tear down only publicly owned properties, a number that stands above 400. The federal grant provides funds to demolish nearly 950 structures. After the grant's approval, Saginaw city officials announced a program to purchase unwanted, abandoned structures from their owners, which would be then added to the list of homes to tear down. Officials estimate that there are nearly 1,200 privately owned homes within the city limits that are worthy of demolition.<ref name=\"Tower\">{{cite web |last=Tower |first=Mark |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/11/sell_your_run-down_house_for_c.html |title=Sell your run-down house in Saginaw for cash: Owners given chance to unload properties |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to revitalize downtown increased in 2013. CBS television executive and Saginaw native David Strouse announced an investment plan in late 2013 that would save nearly an entire block of buildings slated for demolition at the intersection of Washington and Genesee, the core of downtown Saginaw. The plan called for the renovation and redevelopment of four buildings, creating market-rate apartments on the upper floors and retail space at ground level. In 2012 a similar deal was made for the Bancroft and Eddy apartments at the same intersection. Once [[Section 8 (housing)|Section{{nbsp}}8]] housing, these buildings are being transformed into market-rate apartments and retail space.<ref name=\"Tower2\">{{cite web |last=Tower |first=Mark |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/09/cbs_television_executives_to_d.html |title=CBS Television executive confirms multimillion-dollar plans for historic block in downtown Saginaw |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref>\n\n====Recent economic development====\n\nEconomic development in the region is focused on comparative advantages in innovation, clean energy, and continued manufacturing exports. Compared to other mid-sized communities, Saginaw has a high number of patent applications per job, and more than 81 times the average US share of jobs in photovoltaic technology research and production. The city continues to have a higher proportion of manufacturing jobs than the US average.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/0223_michigan_mid_metros.pdf

This system has played a role in the decline of the city. The City of Saginaw, in order to obtain new sources of revenue, sold water to areas outside of the city (especially to the [[Saginaw Charter Township]]).
