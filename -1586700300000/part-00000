{"title_page": "Chidiock Tichborne", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=June 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n'''Chidiock Tichborne''' (after 24 August 1562 \u2013 20 September 1586), erroneously{{cn|date=March 2017}} referred to as Charles, was an English [[Conspiracy (political)|conspirator]] and poet.\n\n==Life==\n\nTichborne was born in [[Southampton]] sometime after 24 August 1562<ref name=\"Phillimore 1904\">Phillimore, Hampshire Parish Records, Vol VI, page 78, marriage of Peter Tychborne, gent to Elizabeth Midleton, 24 August 1562</ref> to [[Roman Catholic]] parents, Peter Tichborne and his wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Middleton).<ref name=\"Penry Williams 1586\">Penry Williams, 'Babington, Anthony (1561\u20131586)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> His birth date has been given as circa 1558 in many sources, though unverified, and thus his age given as 28 at his execution. It is unlikely that he was born before his parents' marriage, so he could have been no more than 23 years old when he died.\n\nChidiock Tichborne descended from Sir Roger de Tichborne, who owned land at [[Tichborne]], near Winchester, in the twelfth century. Chidiock's second cousin and contemporary was [[Sir Benjamin Tichborne, 1st Baronet|Sir Benjamin Tichborne]] who lived at Tichborne Park and was created a [[Tichborne Baronets|Baronet]] by [[King James I of England|King James I]] in 1621. The Tichborne family is ancient and believed to have held land at Tichborne from before the Norman Conquest. In Chidiock's reported oration from the scaffold before his execution he allegedly stated:  \"I am descended from a house, from two hundred years before the Conquest, never stained till this my misfortune\".<ref>Isaac D'Israeli (circa 1859) (1st collected edition 1881) ''Curiosities of Literature'', Vol II, pp177</ref>\n\nChidiock's father Peter appears to have been the youngest son of Henry Tichborne (born circa 1474) and Anne Mervin (or Marvin) but the records are unclear. Peter was clerk of the Crowne at the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in 1554 and was an ardent Catholic supporter. Being the youngest son of a youngest son he was of little means and required to make his own way. He secured an education and the patronage of his distant kinsman, Lord Chidiock Paulet (1521\u20131574, son of the 1st [[Marquess of Winchester]]), after whom he named his son. In later life he spent many years imprisoned unable to pay recusancy fines. Chidiock's mother was Elizabeth Middleton, daughter of William Middleton (grandson of Sir Thomas Middleton of Belso, Kt.) and Elizabeth Potter (daughter of John Potter of Westram). William had been servant to [[John Islip]], Abbot of Westminster, and a banner bearer at Islip's funeral 1532,<ref>Kenning's Masonic Encyclopedia and Handbook of Masonic Archeology, History and Biography (1878) page 299</ref> and later bought lands in Kent.\n\nThe name ''\"Chidiock\"'', pronounced \u2018chidik\u2019, as derived from his father's patron, [[Chidiock Paulet]], originates from a Paulet ancestor, Sir John de Chideock, who owned land at Chideock, a village in Dorset. Chidiock Tichborne was never called Charles \u2013 this is an error that has grown from a misprint in the [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] GCSE English Literature syllabus which has included the Elegy in its early poetry section for several years. Unfortunately, this error persists in much of the educational literature supporting the syllabus.\n\nAt least two of Chidiock's sisters are recorded by name: Dorothy, first wife of Thomas Muttelbury of Jurdens, Somerset;<ref>Visitation Somerset 1623 (1876) page 76</ref> and Mary, second wife of Sir William Kirkham of [[Blagdon, Paignton|Blagdon]] in the parish of [[Paignton]] in Devon.<ref>Visitation of Kent 1574, page 9</ref> At his execution Chidiock mentions his wife Agnes, one child, and his six sisters. In his letter to his wife, written the night before his execution he mentions his sisters \u2013 and also 'my little sister Babb'.<ref>Harl. MSS. 36. 50. as quoted by Isaac D'Israeli, page 177</ref> Another sister is implied in a secret intelligence note to Francis Walsingham, dated 18 September 1586, in which the writer has had conference with \"Jennings of Portsmouth\" who reports that Mr Bruyn of Dorset and Mr Kyrkham of Devon are persons to be suspect as they had married Tychbourn's sisters.<ref>Cal. State Papers, Domestic Series, Reigns of Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth I, 1547-(1625), Vol CXCII, Number 62</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nAfter the succession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] to the throne after the death of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], Chidiock was allowed to practice Catholicism for part of his early life.  However, in 1570 the Queen was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the Pope for her own Protestantism and support of [[Protestant]] causes, most notably the Dutch Rebellion against Spain; in retaliation she ended her relative toleration of the Catholic Church.  Catholicism was made illegal, and Roman Catholics were once more banned by law from practising their religion and Roman Catholic priests risked death for performing their functions.\n[[Image:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Tower of London, Traitor's Gate]]\n\nIn 1583, Tichborne and his father, Peter, were arrested and questioned concerning the use of \"popish relics\", religious objects Tichborne had brought back from a visit he had made abroad without informing the authorities of an intention to travel.<ref name=\"Penry Williams 1586\"/> Though released without charge, records suggest that this was not the last time they were to be questioned by the authorities over their religion. In June 1586 accusations of \"popish practices\" were laid against his family.\n\nIn June 1586, Tichborne agreed to take part in the [[Babington Plot]] to murder Queen Elizabeth and replace her with the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was next in line to the throne.  The plot was foiled by Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], Elizabeth's spymaster, using [[double agent]]s, most notably [[Robert Poley]] who was later witness to the murder of [[Christopher Marlowe]], and though most of the conspirators fled, Tichborne had an injured leg and was forced to remain in London.  On 14 August he was arrested and he was later tried and sentenced to death in [[Westminster Hall]].\n\nWhile in custody in the [[Tower of London]] on 19 September (the eve of his [[execution (legal)|execution]]), Tichborne wrote to his wife Agnes.  The letter contained three [[stanza]]s of poetry that is his best known piece of work, ''Tichborne's Elegy'', also known by its first line ''My Prime of Youth is but a Frost of Cares''.  The poem is a dark look at a life cut short and is a favourite of many scholars to this day. Two other poems are known by him, ''To His Friend'' and ''The Housedove''.\n\nOn 20 September 1586, Tichborne was executed with [[Anthony Babington]], [[John Ballard (Jesuit)|John Ballard]], and four other conspirators. They were eviscerated, [[drawing and quartering|hanged, drawn and quartered]], the mandatory punishment for treason, in St Giles Field.  However, when Elizabeth was informed that these gruesome executions were arousing sympathy for the condemned, she ordered that the remaining seven conspirators were to be hanged until 'quite dead' before being eviscerated.\n\n==Tichborne's poetry==\n\n===Elegy and others===\n\n====Elegy====\n\n<poem>My prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\nMy fruit is fallen, and yet my leaves are green,\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\nI looked for life and saw it was a shade,\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.</poem>\n\nThis is the first printed version from ''Verses of Prayse and Joye'' (1586).  The original text differs slightly: along with other minor differences, the first line of the second verse reads \"The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung,\" and the third line reads \"My youth is gone, and yet I am but young.\"\n\nThe last word in the third line, \"tares,\" refers to a harmful \"weed\" that resembles corn when young, and is a reference to Matt. 13:24\u201330.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tare |title= Tare |publisher= Dictionary.com |accessdate= 12 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====To His Friend (assumed to be Anthony Babington)====\n\n<poem>Good sorrow cease, false hope be gone, misfortune once farewell;\nCome, solemn muse, the sad discourse of our adventures tell.\nA friend I had whose special part made mine affection his;\nWe ruled tides and streams ourselves, no want was in our bliss.\nSix years we sailed, sea-room enough, by many happy lands,\nTill at the length, a stream us took and cast us on the sands.\nThere lodged we were in a gulf of woe, despairing what to do,\nTill at the length, from shore unknown, a Pilot to us drew,\nWhose help did sound our grounded ship from out Caribda's mouth,\nBut unadvised, on Scylla drives; the wind which from the South\nDid blustering blow the fatal blast of our unhappy fall,\nWhere driving, leaves my friend and I to fortune ever thrall;\nWhere we be worse beset with sands and rocks on every side,\nWhere we be quite bereft of aid, of men, of winds, of tide.\nWhere vain it is to hail for help so far from any shore,\nSo far from Pilot's course; despair shall we, therefore?\nNo! God from out his heap of helps on us will some bestow,\nAnd send such mighty surge of seas, or else such blasts to blow\nAs shall remove our grounded ship far from this dangerous place,\nAnd we shall joy each others' chance through God's almighty grace,\nAnd keep ourselves on land secure, our sail on safer seas.\nSweet friend, till then content thy self, and pray for our release.</poem>\n\n====The Housedove====\n\n<poem>A silly housedove happed to fall\namongst a flock of crows,\nWhich fed and filled her harmless craw\namongst her fatal foes.\nThe crafty fowler drew his net \u2013\nall his that he could catch \u2013\nThe crows lament their hellish chance,\nthe dove repents her match.\nBut too, too late! it was her chance\nthe fowler did her spy,\nAnd so did take her for a crow \u2013\nwhich thing caused her to die.</poem>\n\nThe only known manuscript versions of \"To His Friend\" and The Housedove\" are from Edinburgh Library MS Laing, II, 69/24. However, twenty-eight different manuscript versions of the \"Elegy\" (or \"Lament\") are known and there are many variations of the text.\n\n===Comment===\nTichborne's authorship of the Elegy has been disputed, with attributions to others including Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. However it was printed soon after the Babington plot in a volume called ''Verses of Praise and Joy'' in 1586, published by [[John Wolfe (printer)|John Wolfe of London]] to celebrate the Queen's survival and to attack the plotters. In the same volume an answer poem entitled \"Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne\" (\"T. K.'s Hendecasyllabon Against Chidiock Tichborne's Swan Song\") is most likely by the poet and dramatist [[Thomas Kyd]], author of ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''.\n\n====Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne==== \n\n<poem>Thy prime of youth is frozen with thy faults,\nThy feast of joy is finisht with thy fall;\nThy crop of corn is tares availing naughts,\nThy good God knows thy hope, thy hap and all.\nShort were thy days, and shadowed was thy sun,\nT'obscure thy light unluckily begun.\n\nTime trieth truth, and truth hath treason tripped;\nThy faith bare fruit as thou hadst faithless been:\nThy ill spent youth thine after years hath nipt;\nAnd God that saw thee hath preserved our Queen.\nHer thread still holds, thine perished though unspun,\nAnd she shall live when traitors lives are done.\n\nThou soughtst thy death, and found it in desert,\nThou look'dst for life, yet lewdly forc'd it fade:\nThou trodst the earth, and now on earth thou art,\nAs men may wish thou never hadst been made.\nThy glory, and thy glass are timeless run;\nAnd this, O Tychborne, hath thy treason done.</poem>\n\n===Critical appreciation===\n\n====Elegy====\nTichborne's \"Elegy\" (his rhyming, final [[soliloquy]] poem<ref>Hirsch, Edward, ''How to read a Poem'', Harvest Harcourt Inc, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|9780156005661}}</ref>), uses two favourite Renaissance figures of speech \u2013 [[antithesis]] and [[paradox]] \u2013 to crystallise the tragedy of the poet's situation. Antithesis means setting opposites against each other: prime of youth / frost of cares (from the first line). This is typical of Renaissance poetry, as for example in Wyatt's \"I find no peace, and all my war is done\", with the lover freezing/burning. It also appears in the poem by Elizabeth I, \"I grieve and dare not show my discontent\", e.g., \"I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned.\" A paradox is a statement which seems self-contradictory, yet is true, e.g., \"My tale is heard, and yet it was not told\", or \"My glass is full, and now my glass is run.\" Often a Renaissance poem will begin with antithesis to establish circumstances and reveal its themes through paradox.\n\nThe \"Elegy\" is remarkable for being written almost entirely in [[Syllables|monosyllables]]: Every word in the poem is of one syllable, with ten words in each [[Line (poetry)|line]], [[monostich]] style), with the possible exception of the word \"fallen\". However, in early editions it was written as \"fall'n\" which is monosyllabic.<ref>[http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/english/schools/poetry-bank/tichborne University of Buckingham, England.] \"The poem is immediately striking both for its deft use of antithesis, and for its relative brevity and clarity. With the exception of 'fallen' (which in early editions is 'fall'n' and, as the metre indicates, pronounced as a monosyllable) every word in the poem is of one [[syllable]], something that adds to its stark and plain effect.\"</ref>\n\nThe \"Elegy\" has inspired many \"homages\" and \"answers\" including those by Jonathon Robin at allpoetry.com ; a rap version by David A More at www.marlovian.com ; ''After Reading Tichborne's Elegy'' by [[Dick Allen (poet)|Dick Allen]] (2003) and Tichborne's Lexicon by [[Nick Montfort]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickm.com/poems/noncomputational.html|title=Poems by Nick Montfort|website=nickm.com}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Elegy\" has also been set to music many times from the Elizabethan era to the present day by, among others, Michael East, Richard Alison (fl1580-1610, in ''An Hour's Recreation in musicke'', 1606), [[John Mundy (composer)|John Mundy]] (1592) and [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Gounod]] (1873) and more recently Norman Dello Joio (1949) and Jim Clark (see Tichborne's Elegy Poem Animation<ref>http://wn.com/Tichborne's_Elegy_Poem_animation</ref>) and Taylor Momsen. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBNQ1DIod6M|title=The Pretty Reckless - Hangman LYRIC video (with latin translated)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n====The Housedove====\n\n\"The Housedove\" exploits a popular image from the period: Tichborne sees himself as an innocent dove caught among his fellow conspirators, (see Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' 1.5.48). The \"crafty fowler\" is probably Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], the spymaster who manipulated the Babington plot.\n\n==Sources==\n\n*Richard S. M.

The Tichborne family is ancient and believed to have held land at Tichborne from before the Norman Conquest. In Chidiock's reported oration from the scaffold before his execution he allegedly stated:  \"I am descended from a house, from two hundred years before the Conquest, never stained till this my misfortune.\".<ref>Isaac D'Israeli (circa 1859) (1st collected edition 1881) ''Curiosities of Literature'', Vol II, pp177</ref>\n\nChidiock's father Peter appears to have been the youngest son of Henry Tichborne (born circa 1474) and Anne Mervin (or Marvin) but the records are unclear. Peter was clerk of the Crowne at the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in 1554 and was an ardent Catholic supporter. Being the youngest son of a youngest son he was of little means and required to make his own way. He secured an education and the patronage of his distant kinsman, Lord Chidiock Paulet (1521\u20131574, son of the 1st [[Marquess of Winchester]]), after whom he named his son. In later life he spent many years imprisoned unable to pay recusancy fines. Chidiock's mother was Elizabeth Middleton, daughter of William Middleton (grandson of Sir Thomas Middleton of Belso, Kt.) and Elizabeth Potter (daughter of John Potter of Westram). William had been servant to [[John Islip]], Abbot of Westminster, and a banner bearer at Islip's funeral 1532,<ref>Kenning's Masonic Encyclopedia and Handbook of Masonic Archeology, History and Biography (1878) page 299</ref> and later bought lands in Kent.\n\nThe name ''\"Chidiock\"'', pronounced \u2018chidik\u2019, as derived from his father's patron, [[Chidiock Paulet]], originates from a Paulet ancestor, Sir John de Chideock, who owned land at Chideock, a village in Dorset. Chidiock Tichborne was never called Charles \u2013 this is an error that has grown from a misprint in the [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] GCSE English Literature syllabus which has included the Elegy in its early poetry section for several years. Unfortunately, this error persists in much of the educational literature supporting the syllabus.\n\nAt least two of Chidiock's sisters are recorded by name: Dorothy, first wife of Thomas Muttelbury of Jurdens, Somerset;<ref>Visitation Somerset 1623 (1876) page 76</ref> and Mary, second wife of Sir William Kirkham of [[Blagdon, Paignton|Blagdon]] in the parish of [[Paignton]] in Devon.<ref>Visitation of Kent 1574, page 9</ref> At his execution Chidiock mentions his wife Agnes, one child, and his six sisters. In his letter to his wife, written the night before his execution he mentions his sisters \u2013 and also 'my little sister Babb'.<ref>Harl. MSS. 36. 50. as quoted by Isaac D'Israeli, page 177</ref> Another sister is implied in a secret intelligence note to Francis Walsingham, dated 18 September 1586, in which the writer has had conference with \"Jennings of Portsmouth\" who reports that Mr Bruyn of Dorset and Mr Kyrkham of Devon are persons to be suspect as they had married Tychbourn's sisters.<ref>Cal. State Papers, Domestic Series, Reigns of Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth I, 1547-(1625), Vol CXCII, Number 62</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nAfter the succession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] to the throne after the death of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], Chidiock was allowed to practice Catholicism for part of his early life.  However, in 1570 the Queen was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the Pope for her own Protestantism and support of [[Protestant]] causes, most notably the Dutch Rebellion against Spain; in retaliation she ended her relative toleration of the Catholic Church.  Catholicism was made illegal, and Roman Catholics were once more banned by law from practising their religion and Roman Catholic priests risked death for performing their functions.\n[[Image:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Tower of London, Traitor's Gate]]\n\nIn 1583, Tichborne and his father, Peter, were arrested and questioned concerning the use of \"popish relics\", religious objects Tichborne had brought back from a visit he had made abroad without informing the authorities of an intention to travel.<ref name=\"Penry Williams 1586\"/> Though released without charge, records suggest that this was not the last time they were to be questioned by the authorities over their religion. In June 1586 accusations of \"popish practices\" were laid against his family.\n\nIn June 1586, Tichborne agreed to take part in the [[Babington Plot]] to murder Queen Elizabeth and replace her with the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was next in line to the throne.  The plot was foiled by Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], Elizabeth's spymaster, using [[double agent]]s, most notably [[Robert Poley]] who was later witness to the murder of [[Christopher Marlowe]], and though most of the conspirators fled, Tichborne had an injured leg and was forced to remain in London.  On 14 August he was arrested and he was later tried and sentenced to death in [[Westminster Hall]].\n\nWhile in custody in the [[Tower of London]] on 19 September (the eve of his [[execution (legal)|execution]]), Tichborne wrote to his wife Agnes.  The letter contained three [[stanza]]s of poetry that is his best known piece of work, ''Tichborne's Elegy'', also known by its first line ''My Prime of Youth is but a Frost of Cares''.  The poem is a dark look at a life cut short and is a favourite of many scholars to this day. Two other poems are known by him, ''To His Friend'' and ''The Housedove''.\n\nOn 20 September 1586, Tichborne was executed with [[Anthony Babington]], [[John Ballard (Jesuit)|John Ballard]], and four other conspirators. They were eviscerated, [[drawing and quartering|hanged, drawn and quartered]], the mandatory punishment for treason, in St Giles Field.  However, when Elizabeth was informed that these gruesome executions were arousing sympathy for the condemned, she ordered that the remaining seven conspirators were to be hanged until 'quite dead' before being eviscerated.\n\n==Tichborne's poetry==\n\n===Elegy and others===\n\n====Elegy====\n\n<poem>My prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\nMy fruit is fallen, and yet my leaves are green,\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\nI looked for life and saw it was a shade,\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.</poem>\n\nThis is the first printed version from ''Verses of Prayse and Joye'' (1586).  The original text differs slightly: along with other minor differences, the first line of the second verse reads \"The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung,\" and the third line reads \"My youth is gone, and yet I am but young.\"\n\nThe last word in the third line, \"tares,\" refers to a harmful \"weed\" that resembles corn when young, and is a reference to Matt. 13:24\u201330.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tare |title= Tare |publisher= Dictionary.com |accessdate= 12 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====To His Friend (assumed to be Anthony Babington)====\n\n<poem>Good sorrow cease, false hope be gone, misfortune once farewell;\nCome, solemn muse, the sad discourse of our adventures tell.\nA friend I had whose special part made mine affection his;\nWe ruled tides and streams ourselves, no want was in our bliss.\nSix years we sailed, sea-room enough, by many happy lands,\nTill at the length, a stream us took and cast us on the sands.\nThere lodged we were in a gulf of woe, despairing what to do,\nTill at the length, from shore unknown, a Pilot to us drew,\nWhose help did sound our grounded ship from out Caribda's mouth,\nBut unadvised, on Scylla drives; the wind which from the South\nDid blustering blow the fatal blast of our unhappy fall,\nWhere driving, leaves my friend and I to fortune ever thrall;\nWhere we be worse beset with sands and rocks on every side,\nWhere we be quite bereft of aid, of men, of winds, of tide.\nWhere vain it is to hail for help so far from any shore,\nSo far from Pilot's course; despair shall we, therefore?\nNo! God from out his heap of helps on us will some bestow,\nAnd send such mighty surge of seas, or else such blasts to blow\nAs shall remove our grounded ship far from this dangerous place,\nAnd we shall joy each others' chance through God's almighty grace,\nAnd keep ourselves on land secure, our sail on safer seas.\nSweet friend, till then content thy self, and pray for our release.</poem>\n\n====The Housedove====\n\n<poem>A silly housedove happed to fall\namongst a flock of crows,\nWhich fed and filled her harmless craw\namongst her fatal foes.\nThe crafty fowler drew his net \u2013\nall his that he could catch \u2013\nThe crows lament their hellish chance,\nthe dove repents her match.\nBut too, too late! it was her chance\nthe fowler did her spy,\nAnd so did take her for a crow \u2013\nwhich thing caused her to die.</poem>\n\nThe only known manuscript versions of \"To His Friend\" and The Housedove\" are from Edinburgh Library MS Laing, II, 69/24. However, twenty-eight different manuscript versions of the \"Elegy\" (or \"Lament\") are known and there are many variations of the text.\n\n===Comment===\nTichborne's authorship of the Elegy has been disputed, with attributions to others including Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. However it was printed soon after the Babington plot in a volume called ''Verses of Praise and Joy'' in 1586, published by [[John Wolfe (printer)|John Wolfe of London]] to celebrate the Queen's survival and to attack the plotters. In the same volume an answer poem entitled \"Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne\" (\"T. K.'s Hendecasyllabon Against Chidiock Tichborne's Swan Song\") is most likely by the poet and dramatist [[Thomas Kyd]], author of ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''.\n\n====Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne==== \n\n<poem>Thy prime of youth is frozen with thy faults,\nThy feast of joy is finisht with thy fall;\nThy crop of corn is tares availing naughts,\nThy good God knows thy hope, thy hap and all.\nShort were thy days, and shadowed was thy sun,\nT'obscure thy light unluckily begun.\n\nTime trieth truth, and truth hath treason tripped;\nThy faith bare fruit as thou hadst faithless been:\nThy ill spent youth thine after years hath nipt;\nAnd God that saw thee hath preserved our Queen.\nHer thread still holds, thine perished though unspun,\nAnd she shall live when traitors lives are done.\n\nThou soughtst thy death, and found it in desert,\nThou look'dst for life, yet lewdly forc'd it fade:\nThou trodst the earth, and now on earth thou art,\nAs men may wish thou never hadst been made.\nThy glory, and thy glass are timeless run;\nAnd this, O Tychborne, hath thy treason done.</poem>\n\n===Critical appreciation===\n\n====Elegy====\nTichborne's \"Elegy\" (his rhyming, final [[soliloquy]] poem<ref>Hirsch, Edward, ''How to read a Poem'', Harvest Harcourt Inc, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|9780156005661}}</ref>), uses two favourite Renaissance figures of speech \u2013 [[antithesis]] and [[paradox]] \u2013 to crystallise the tragedy of the poet's situation. Antithesis means setting opposites against each other: prime of youth / frost of cares (from the first line). This is typical of Renaissance poetry, as for example in Wyatt's \"I find no peace, and all my war is done\", with the lover freezing/burning. It also appears in the poem by Elizabeth I, \"I grieve and dare not show my discontent\", e.g., \"I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned.\" A paradox is a statement which seems self-contradictory, yet is true, e.g., \"My tale is heard, and yet it was not told\", or \"My glass is full, and now my glass is run.\" Often a Renaissance poem will begin with antithesis to establish circumstances and reveal its themes through paradox.\n\nThe \"Elegy\" is remarkable for being written almost entirely in [[Syllables|monosyllables]]: Every word in the poem is of one syllable, with ten words in each [[Line (poetry)|line]], [[monostich]] style), with the possible exception of the word \"fallen\". However, in early editions it was written as \"fall'n\" which is monosyllabic.<ref>[http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/english/schools/poetry-bank/tichborne University of Buckingham, England.] \"The poem is immediately striking both for its deft use of antithesis, and for its relative brevity and clarity. With the exception of 'fallen' (which in early editions is 'fall'n' and, as the metre indicates, pronounced as a monosyllable) every word in the poem is of one [[syllable]], something that adds to its stark and plain effect.\"</ref>\n\nThe \"Elegy\" has inspired many \"homages\" and \"answers\" including those by Jonathon Robin at allpoetry.com ; a rap version by David A More at www.marlovian.com ; ''After Reading Tichborne's Elegy'' by [[Dick Allen (poet)|Dick Allen]] (2003) and Tichborne's Lexicon by [[Nick Montfort]].<ref>[http://nickm.com/poems/noncomputational.html Montford, Nick.]</ref>\n\nThe \"Elegy\" has also been set to music many times from the Elizabethan era to the present day by, among others, Michael East, Richard Alison (fl1580-1610, in ''An Hour's Recreation in musicke'', 1606), [[John Mundy (composer)|John Mundy]] (1592) and [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Gounod]] (1873) and more recently Norman Dello Joio (1949) and Jim Clark (see [http://wn.com/Tichborne's_Elegy_Poem_animation]) and Taylor Momsen. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBNQ1DIod6M</ref>\n\n====The Housedove====\n\n\"The Housedove\" exploits a popular image from the period: Tichborne sees himself as an innocent dove caught among his fellow conspirators, (see Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' 1.5.48). The \"crafty fowler\" is probably Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], the spymaster who manipulated the Babington plot.\n\n==Sources==\n\n*Richard S. M.

In modern usage, poets of the Scots revival in the 18th century, such as [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] and [[Robert Fergusson]] are also makars.\n\nSince 2002, the term \"makar\" has been revived as the name for a publicly funded poet, first in Edinburgh, followed by Glasgow, Stirling and Dundee, and in 2004 the position of ''The Scots Makar'', in the sense of a Scottish [[poet laureate]], was introduced by the [[Scottish Parliament]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Middle Scots]] {{wikt-lang|sco|makar}} (plural {{lang|sco|makaris}}) is the equivalent of English ''[[:wikt:maker|maker]]''.

Until September 3, it had a limited contact with the [[Wehrmacht]]. It was then ordered to take positions previously held by the Polish 41st Infantry Division. On September 7, it left [[Ostro\u0142\u0119ka]] and was ordered to halt the advance of German [[21st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Infantry Division]] near Nowogrod. The efforts of Polish soldiers were mixed, but on the night of Sept 9-10, it attacked a German armored column, destroying several vehicles and tanks.\n\nDuring the next days the Division was engaged in heavy fights with units of General [[Heinz Guderian]]'s [[XIX Panzer Corps]]. After several bloody skirmishes, the Germans severely wounded Colonel Kossecki. Twenty volunteers, who wanted to take his body from the battleground, were killed by a German machine gun. Kossecki himself survived, but was captured by the Soviets and killed by them probably in 1940 (see: [[Katyn Massacre]]).

Located on the [[Queanbeyan River]], the city is the council seat of the [[Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council]]. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, the Queanbeyan part of the Canberra\u2013Queanbeyan built-up area had a population of 36,348.<ref name=\"Queanbeyan part\"/>\n\nQueanbeyan's economy is based on light construction, manufacturing, service, retail and agriculture. [[Canberra]], Australia's capital, is located just {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} to the west, and Queanbeyan has to some extent become a [[commuter town]]. The word ''Queanbeyan'' is the anglicised form of ''Quinbean'', an Aboriginal word meaning ''\"clear waters\"''. {{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n== History ==\nThe town grew from a squattage held by ex-[[convict]] and inn keeper, Timothy Beard, on the banks of the [[Molonglo River]] in what is now [[Oaks Estate]]. The town centre of Queanbeyan is located on the [[Queanbeyan River]], a tributary of the [[Molonglo River]] and approximately {{Convert|1.4|km||abbr=}} south-southeast of Oaks Estate.\n\nQueanbeyan was officially proclaimed a township in 1838 when the population was about 50. The local [[Queanbeyan Parish|parish]] was also known by that name and later still the member for the electorate of Queanbeyan held a seat in the legislative assembly of the colony of NSW. On 28 November 1837 the Colonial Secretary announced the appointment of Captain Alured Tasker Faunce as resident police magistrate at Queanbeyan. His homestead, called Dodsworth, was situated on the banks of the Queanbeyan river opposite the town.<ref>Errol Lea-Scarlet. Queanbeyan. District and People.

The [[Westpac|Bank of New South Wales]] began service in Queanbeyan in 1878. ''The Golden Age'' (now ''[[The Queanbeyan Age]]'') was Queanbeyan's first newspaper and was founded in 1860 by [[John Gale (journalist)|John Gale]]. In 1880 the residence of John James Wright, the first mayor of Queanbeyan, was constructed along the edge of the Queanbeyan River. In 1982 that building became the Queanbeyan Art Centre.\n\nThe [[Salvation Army]] claimed an outpost in Queanbeyan in 1884.\n\nQueanbeyan, an increasingly successful primary producing district, was proclaimed a Municipality in February 1885 incorporating an area of {{convert|5700|acre|km2}}. The railway reached [[Queanbeyan railway station, New South Wales|Queanbeyan railway station]] in 1887 and it became the junction for the lines going to [[Canberra]] and [[Bombala]]. The town is served by the thrice-daily [[NSW TrainLink]] Xplorer service between Canberra and Sydney.\n\n[[File:Queanbeyan river030.jpg|thumb|right|Bridge near the centre of town over the river]]\n[[File:Queanbeyan royal hotel.jpg|thumb|right|Royal Hotel in Queanbeyan, built 1926]]\n[[File:Queabeyan Solar Farm.jpg|thumb|right|Queanbeyan Solar Farm established 1999]]\n[[File:TheQ.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Q\" \u2013 Queanbeyan Performing Arts Centre]]\n[[File:St Benedicts Queanbeyan.jpg|thumb|right|A former monastery, St Benedicts now houses a number of local businesses]]\n[[File:Queanbeyan City Council Chambers.jpg|thumb|right|Queanbeyan's \"Tidy Town\" awards are proudly displayed on the Queanbeyan Council Chambers Building (c. 1927)]]\n\n[[William Farrer|William James Farrer]], the wheat experimentalist, established Queanbeyan's reputation as an agricultural district with his famous \"Federation\" rust-free strain, developed on his property ''\"Lambrigg\"'' at [[Tharwa]]. Farrer's work was only slowly recognised elsewhere in Australia, but local farmers supported him, particularly in his development of \"Blount's Lambrigg\", another strain which in 1889 gave hope to farmers after the disastrous season of 1887 when crops had failed after heavy Christmas rains.\n\nAt the height of its rural prosperity Queanbeyan boasted sixteen public houses and six flourmills powered by wind, water, horse and steam. The Royal Hotel on Monaro Street opened in 1926.  In Canberra alcohol was prohibited from 1911, at the time of the territory's foundation, until 1928, when Federal Parliament had relocated from Melbourne.  In that period many of the capital's residents crossed the border to drink at one of Queanbeyan's hotels.\n\nQueanbeyan was granted city status on 7 July 1972. On 21 July 1975 the Queen's Bridge was opened. This bridge took pressure off the existing bridge in linking Monaro Street directly to the east. From 1982 to 1989, the [[Canberra Raiders]] [[rugby league]] team played their home games in Queanbeyan, at [[Seiffert Oval]].\n\nSince December 2008, the Australian Defence Forces's HQ [[Joint Operations Command (Australia)|Joint Operations Command]] has been based adjacent to the [[Kowen]] district of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], just south of the [[Kings Highway, Australia|Kings Highway]], about 15&nbsp;km east of Queanbeyan, and 15&nbsp;km south of [[Bungendore, New South Wales]].\n\n==Heritage listings==\nQueanbeyan has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Antill Street: [[Rusten House]]<ref name=nswshr-552>{{cite NSW SHR|5045169|Old Queanbeyan Hospital \u2013 Rusten House|hr=00552|fn=EF11/1680; S90/5904 HC870737|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 69 Collett Street: [[Hibernia Lodge]]<ref name=nswshr-514>{{cite NSW SHR|5045734|Hibernia Lodge|hr=00514|fn=S94/01165 & HC 33350|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 19\u201341 Farrer Place: [[Queanbeyan Showground]]<ref name=nswshr-1890>{{cite NSW SHR|5061375|Queanbeyan Showground|hr=01890|fn=11/06869|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Goulburn-Bombala railway: [[Queanbeyan railway bridges over Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers|Queanbeyan railway bridge]]<ref name=nswshr-1052>{{cite NSW SHR|5012150|Queanbeyan rail bridges over Queanbeyan and Burbong Rivers|hr=01052|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Henderson Road: [[Queanbeyan railway station]]<ref name=nswshr-1226>{{cite NSW SHR|5012149|Queanbeyan Railway Station group|hr=01226|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Morrisett Street: [[Byrnes Mill and Millhouse]]<ref name=nswshr-363>{{cite NSW SHR|5045727|Mill and Millhouse|hr=00363|fn=S90/05128 & HC 32931|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 2 Morisset Street: [[St Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse, Queanbeyan|St Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse]]<ref name=nswshr-2018>{{cite NSW SHR|5062754|St Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse|hr=02018|fn=EF16/800|accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n* Rutledge Street: [[Christ Church, Queanbeyan|Christ Church]]<ref name=nswshr-43>{{cite NSW SHR|5045730|Christ Church Anglican Group|hr=00043|fn=S90/04579 & HC 32123|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 3 Tharwa Road: [[Kawaree]]<ref name=nswshr-365>{{cite NSW SHR|5045699|Kawaree|hr=00365|fn=EF14/5206; S90/1394; HC 32957|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Today ==\nQueanbeyan has two government high schools: Queanbeyan High and Karabar High.

As Veterans from the Boer War were still alive and wanted the 1903 Boer War memorial repaired/replaced, a public subscription was raised and a concrete replica memorial was cast and erected in 1964 in the centre-medium strip in Lowe Street,opposite the back of the Queanbeyan Courthouse. Although the memorial is a replica and although all the Boer War Veterans have since died, the remembrance, sentiment and respect for those who fought in the Boer War remains; Queanbeyan City Council undertakes regular conservation work, and the Queanbeyan RSL places a wreath on the Boer War Memorial each ANZAC DAY.<ref>Queanbeyan Age, 1950s\u20131960s</ref><ref>P.B.

[[Canberra]], Australia's capital, is located just {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} to the west, and Queanbeyan has to some extent become a [[commuter town]]. The word ''Queanbeyan'' is the anglicised form of ''Quinbean'', an Aboriginal word meaning ''\"clear waters\"''. {{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n== History ==\nThe town grew from a squattage held by ex-[[convict]] and inn keeper, Timothy Beard, on the banks of the [[Molonglo River]] in what is now [[Oaks Estate]]. The town centre of Queanbeyan is located on the [[Queanbeyan River]], a tributary of the [[Molonglo River]] and approximately {{Convert|1.4|km||abbr=}} south-southeast of Oaks Estate.\n\nQueanbeyan was officially proclaimed a township in 1838 when the population was about 50. The local [[Queanbeyan Parish|parish]] was also known by that name and later still the member for the electorate of Queanbeyan held a seat in the legislative assembly of the colony of NSW. On 28 November 1837 the Colonial Secretary announced the appointment of Captain Alured Tasker Faunce as resident police magistrate at Queanbeyan. His homestead, called Dodsworth, was situated on the banks of the Queanbeyan river opposite the town.<ref>Errol Lea-Scarlet. Queanbeyan. District and People.

The [[Westpac|Bank of New South Wales]] began service in Queanbeyan in 1878. ''The Golden Age'' (now ''[[The Queanbeyan Age]]'') was Queanbeyan's first newspaper and was founded in 1860 by [[John Gale (journalist)|John Gale]]. In 1880 the residence of John James Wright, the first mayor of Queanbeyan, was constructed along the edge of the Queanbeyan River. In 1982 that building became the Queanbeyan Art Centre.\n\nThe [[Salvation Army]] claimed an outpost in Queanbeyan in 1884.\n\nQueanbeyan, an increasingly successful primary producing district, was proclaimed a Municipality in February 1885 incorporating an area of {{convert|5700|acre|km2}}. The railway reached [[Queanbeyan railway station, New South Wales|Queanbeyan railway station]] in 1887 and it became the junction for the lines going to [[Canberra]] and [[Bombala]]. The town is served by the thrice-daily [[NSW TrainLink]] Xplorer service between Canberra and Sydney.\n\n[[File:Queanbeyan river030.jpg|thumb|right|Bridge near the centre of town over the river]]\n[[File:Queanbeyan royal hotel.jpg|thumb|right|Royal Hotel in Queanbeyan, built 1926]]\n[[File:Queabeyan Solar Farm.jpg|thumb|right|Queanbeyan Solar Farm established 1999]]\n[[File:TheQ.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Q\" \u2013 Queanbeyan Performing Arts Centre]]\n[[File:St Benedicts Queanbeyan.jpg|thumb|right|A former monastery, St Benedicts now houses a number of local businesses]]\n[[File:Queanbeyan City Council Chambers.jpg|thumb|right|Queanbeyan's \"Tidy Town\" awards are proudly displayed on the Queanbeyan Council Chambers Building (c. 1927)]]\n\n[[William Farrer|William James Farrer]], the wheat experimentalist, established Queanbeyan's reputation as an agricultural district with his famous \"Federation\" rust-free strain, developed on his property ''\"Lambrigg\"'' at [[Tharwa]]. Farrer's work was only slowly recognised elsewhere in Australia, but local farmers supported him, particularly in his development of \"Blount's Lambrigg\", another strain which in 1889 gave hope to farmers after the disastrous season of 1887 when crops had failed after heavy Christmas rains.\n\nAt the height of its rural prosperity Queanbeyan boasted sixteen public houses and six flourmills powered by wind, water, horse and steam. The Royal Hotel on Monaro Street opened in 1926.  In Canberra alcohol was prohibited from 1911, at the time of the territory's foundation, until 1928, when Federal Parliament had relocated from Melbourne.  In that period many of the capital's residents crossed the border to drink at one of Queanbeyan's hotels.\n\nQueanbeyan was granted city status on 7 July 1972. On 21 July 1975 the Queen's Bridge was opened. This bridge took pressure off the existing bridge in linking Monaro Street directly to the east. From 1982 to 1989, the [[Canberra Raiders]] [[rugby league]] team played their home games in Queanbeyan, at [[Seiffert Oval]].\n\nSince December 2008, the Australian Defence Forces's HQ [[Joint Operations Command (Australia)|Joint Operations Command]] has been based adjacent to the [[Kowen]] district of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], just south of the [[Kings Highway, Australia|Kings Highway]], about 15&nbsp;km east of Queanbeyan, and 15&nbsp;km south of [[Bungendore, New South Wales]].\n\n==Heritage listings==\nQueanbeyan has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Antill Street: [[Rusten House]]<ref name=nswshr-552>{{cite NSW SHR|5045169|Old Queanbeyan Hospital \u2013 Rusten House|hr=00552|fn=EF11/1680; S90/5904 HC870737|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 69 Collett Street: [[Hibernia Lodge]]<ref name=nswshr-514>{{cite NSW SHR|5045734|Hibernia Lodge|hr=00514|fn=S94/01165 & HC 33350|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 19\u201341 Farrer Place: [[Queanbeyan Showground]]<ref name=nswshr-1890>{{cite NSW SHR|5061375|Queanbeyan Showground|hr=01890|fn=11/06869|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Goulburn-Bombala railway: [[Queanbeyan railway bridges over Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers|Queanbeyan railway bridge]]<ref name=nswshr-1052>{{cite NSW SHR|5012150|Queanbeyan rail bridges over Queanbeyan and Burbong Rivers|hr=01052|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Henderson Road: [[Queanbeyan railway station]]<ref name=nswshr-1226>{{cite NSW SHR|5012149|Queanbeyan Railway Station group|hr=01226|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Morrisett Street: [[Byrnes Mill and Millhouse]]<ref name=nswshr-363>{{cite NSW SHR|5045727|Mill and Millhouse|hr=00363|fn=S90/05128 & HC 32931|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 2 Morisset Street: [[St Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse, Queanbeyan|St Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse]]<ref name=nswshr-2018>{{cite NSW SHR|5062754|St Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse|hr=02018|fn=EF16/800|accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n* Rutledge Street: [[Christ Church, Queanbeyan|Christ Church]]<ref name=nswshr-43>{{cite NSW SHR|5045730|Christ Church Anglican Group|hr=00043|fn=S90/04579 & HC 32123|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 3 Tharwa Road: [[Kawaree]]<ref name=nswshr-365>{{cite NSW SHR|5045699|Kawaree|hr=00365|fn=EF14/5206; S90/1394; HC 32957|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Today ==\nQueanbeyan has two government high schools: Queanbeyan High and Karabar High.

In 1955 the re-erected 1903 Boer War memorial was hit again by the same truck and same driver, Henry Ford, but this time it could not be repaired. As Veterans from the Boer War were still alive and wanted the 1903 Boer War memorial repaired/replaced, a public subscription was raised and a concrete replica memorial was cast and erected in 1964 in the centre-medium strip in Lowe Street,opposite the back of the Queanbeyan Courthouse. Although the memorial is a replica and although all the Boer War Veterans have since died, the remembrance, sentiment and respect for those who fought in the Boer War remains; Queanbeyan City Council undertakes regular conservation work, and the Queanbeyan RSL places a wreath on the Boer War Memorial each ANZAC DAY.<ref>Queanbeyan Age, 1950s\u20131960s</ref><ref>P.B.
