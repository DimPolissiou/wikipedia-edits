This was followed in 1987\u20131988 by his 12-part series ''[[Eddy Current (comics)|Eddy Current]]''. This \"12-hour book\" centers on an escapee from an asylum. Obsessed with the exploits of the superhero \"The Amazing Broccoli,\" Eddy buys a mail-order battery-powered \"Dynamic Fusion Suit\" and sets out to save the world.

St Margaret\u2019s is an independent charitable trust that warmly welcomes girls of all denominations and faiths.\n\nSt Margaret's is a member of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), [[Girls' Schools Association]] and Queen Margaret of Scotland Girls' Schools Association.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Beginnings, 1846-1888 ===\nThe school was first established in 1846 by 21-year-old Ann Stephen as a day school for girls in the drawing room of her parents' house at 1 Union Wynd, where pupils were taught writing, music, sewing, French and German. After 10 years, the school moved to 13 Union Row, where it was extended to a 'day and boarding school'. Miss Stephen retired in 1874, and the school was taken over by two sisters, the Misses Reid, who ran it for just four years.\n\nIn 1878, Mary Andrew became headteacher, teaching French to the girls and insisting that they speak it at all meals and for certain hours in the evening; a fine was imposed on anyone who lapsed. According to the 1881 census, 13 boarders from the age of 11 to 19 lived at the school with Miss Andrew and a governess, a cook and a servant. Sadly, Miss Andrew died at the age of 40 in 1888.\n\n=== St Margaret's 1888-1929 ===\nSisters, Isabella and Jean Duncan, took over in 1888, moving the school to 31 Union Grove as it grew. Pupils were expected to dress with 'a sense of propriety', and an early photograph shows the girls wearing ankle-length skirts and long-sleeved white blouses. Spot checks on deportment and behaviour were made at the end of the school day to check that the girls were behaving in a seemly manner.\n\nIn May 1890, the school made its last move to 17 Albyn Place, where it remains today.\u00a0 A kindergarten class was established and the school was officially named St Margaret's School for Girls.\n\nThe \u2018best\u2019 rooms were the sitting room, with its veranda and stairs leading down to the back garden (the present headteacher\u2019s room), and the great drawing room (present library), with its vast bow-window, highly polished floor and gilt chairs.\n\nFollowing the sisters\u2019 retirement, the newly formed Council appointed Mary C. Bell as the first headteacher of the new independent St Margaret's. Electric lighting and a system of central heating were installed throughout, the big drawing-room was converted into a gymnasium and the assembly hall was turned into a library. The rooms where boarders had slept became classrooms and a staff room was established.\n\nMiss Bell introduced the prefect system, and founded the dramatic club and the debating society. She also started sports day and gymnastic and dancing displays. Two hockey pitches were rented, and tennis courts were borrowed from the Grammar School boarding house until 1926, when ground for two hockey pitches and two netball courts was acquired at King's Gate. Through gifts from Council, three tennis courts were laid out, and a sports pavilion was built. Miss Bell taught the girls of St Margaret's to think for themselves, to acquire a sense of responsibility and to have pride in their school.\n\n=== The School Well Established, 1929-1952 ===\nMiss Bell's successor was Mabel E. Holland and, under her able direction, the school rode out the problems of disruption and evacuation caused by the Second World War. Inheriting a school roll of 134, Miss Holland left with 365 pupils on the books. While maintaining the traditions and standards of the past, Miss Holland introduced new schemes, including a school magazine, ''The Chronicle,'' the building of a school hall, and the purchase of 15 Albyn Place. Meanwhile, the number of girls leaving school with the necessary qualification to attend university was growing steadily. The school hall was built and within a few months of the hall's opening, a passageway - known to this day as 'the pink passage' - was added to connect the new hall with the old school building. By March 1934, enough money had been raised to add extra rooms behind the hall, which doubled as green rooms for dramatic performances and as music practice rooms. The new building also allowed for the introduction of a Nursery Class. This was the first 'West-end' Nursery School in Aberdeen. Miss Holland also introduced the school uniform.\n\nHowever, the Second World War brought Miss Holland and her staff their greatest challenges. On her arrival at school in August 1939, with the new session due to start, Miss Holland was greeted by the news that 17 Albyn Place had been requisitioned for the Food Office.\n\n=== The Boarding Houses, 1856-1989 ===\nFor 133 years, pupils boarded at the school. As the numbers of boarders grew, the school acquired 7, and later No 6 Queen's Gardens. At the junior boarding house, Canmore House, the children were allowed to keep pets and each boarder had a small piece of garden.\n\nWith the coming of war in 1939, the boarding houses were evacuated to the country, for the greater safety of the children and because the school\u2019s buildings were requisitioned. Glenbuchat, 40 miles from Aberdeen on Upper Donside, was the first place of refuge. Here was remoteness indeed, especially for those in Glenbuchat Lodge, where the main road was seven miles away; a horse-drawn sledge was needed to deliver the groceries in the snowy winter of 1939.\n\nIn autumn 1947, (following the sale of the Queen's Gardens properties) the School Council purchased Culter House, which became home to many boarders for 41 years. However, as the number of boarders declined, the decision was taken to discontinue boarding and sell Culter House. After 133 years of boarding, St Margaret's was once more a day school.\n\n=== The post-war years onwards ===\nA long line of distinguished Heads have followed, along with many new improvements: a 'new look' uniform, a new telephone exchange, new lighting and nursery equipment were purchased, a new physics laboratory, a music room, and an improved gym. By 1983, a new six classroom junior block had been added, and in 1989, the Parents' Association was founded, along with the Pupil Council. An impressive new computing room was created and in 1996, St Margaret's built a music suite, a general purpose hall (the GP room), and two new classrooms. A new pavilion at the Summerhill playing fields was opened in 2009.\n\nIn 2015, the school completed its largest estate development in almost 20 years with the opening of its new state-of-the-art science block, which was officially opened by renowned British astrophysicist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who is credited with one of the most significant astronomical discoveries of the 20th century, that of radio pulsars. The new facility comprises four laboratories, a technician\u2019s room and a project room. Shortly after, new art and drama studios were also unveiled, significantly increasing the opportunity and space for pupils studying both discipline\n\n==The School's Crest and Motto==\nIn 1934, the school was granted by the Lord Lyon an achievement of arms. This consists of a shield bearing the arms of St Margaret, Queen of Scotland, surmounted by the three triple-towered castles which symbolise the City of Aberdeen. St Margaret's arms are 'a cross fleury' (a cross with fleurs-de-lys at its four ends) and five martels (heraldic swallows).\n\nThe motto below the shield is Tenez Ferme (hold fast), chosen at the suggestion of Dr Esslemont Adams, a member of the school's Council. The motto refers back to a story in the life of St Margaret. When she was riding pillion behind a seneschal they came to a boggy piece of ground and the seneschal cried out 'Haud siccar'. The Scots was translated into French when the motto was adopted officially as part of the school's coat of arms.\n\n==Academics==\nIn 2018, St Margaret\u2019s celebrated another year of excellent results. The pass rate at Advanced Higher was 96% (A-C grade), with 90% of grades awarded at A or B grade, while the pass rate was 95% at Higher level for S5 pupils (A-C grade), with 88% achieving A or B grade. Pupils in fourth year received a 98% pass rate at National 5, with 90% of candidates achieving at A or B level.\n\n==Houses==\nThe school operates three \u2018houses\u2019, all of which are named after local Scottish castles. Each pupil is allocated a house upon entering the school. They can win points for their house by completing various activities, competing in sports events and demonstrating an \u2018above and beyond\u2019 attitude with the aim of winning the House Shield at the end of the year.\n\nKildrummy: Kildrummy House is named after the great castle of Kildrummy, 35 miles west of Aberdeen, which, even in its ruined state, is a fine historic monument.\n\nCrathes: Crathes Castle, owned by the National Trust, was built by the Burnett family in 1553 and, unlike the other two castles that represent Houses in St Margaret\u2019s, is still standing intact today.\n\nDunnottar: Situated on the cliffs near Stonehaven, Dunnottar Castle is an impressive sight and is well worth a visit.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

St Margaret\u2019s is an independent charitable trust that warmly welcomes girls of all denominations and faiths.\n\nSt Margaret's is a member of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), [[Girls' Schools Association]] and Queen Margaret of Scotland Girls' Schools Association.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Beginnings, 1846-1888 ===\nThe school was first established in 1846 by 21-year-old Ann Stephen as a day school for girls in the drawing room of her parents' house at 1 Union Wynd, where pupils were taught writing, music, sewing, French and German. After 10 years, the school moved to 13 Union Row, where it was extended to a 'day and boarding school'. Miss Stephen retired in 1874, and the school was taken over by two sisters, the Misses Reid, who ran it for just four years.\n\nIn 1878, Mary Andrew became headteacher, teaching French to the girls and insisting that they speak it at all meals and for certain hours in the evening; a fine was imposed on anyone who lapsed. According to the 1881 census, 13 boarders from the age of 11 to 19 lived at the school with Miss Andrew and a governess, a cook and a servant. Sadly, Miss Andrew died at the age of 40 in 1888.\n\n=== St Margaret's 1888-1929 ===\nSisters, Isabella and Jean Duncan, took over in 1888, moving the school to 31 Union Grove as it grew. Pupils were expected to dress with 'a sense of propriety', and an early photograph shows the girls wearing ankle-length skirts and long-sleeved white blouses. Spot checks on deportment and behaviour were made at the end of the school day to check that the girls were behaving in a seemly manner.\n\nIn May 1890, the school made its last move to 17 Albyn Place, where it remains today.\u00a0 A kindergarten class was established and the school was officially named St Margaret's School for Girls.\n\nThe \u2018best\u2019 rooms were the sitting room, with its veranda and stairs leading down to the back garden (the present headteacher\u2019s room), and the great drawing room (present library), with its vast bow-window, highly polished floor and gilt chairs.\n\nFollowing the sisters\u2019 retirement, the newly formed Council appointed Mary C. Bell as the first headteacher of the new independent St Margaret's. Electric lighting and a system of central heating were installed throughout, the big drawing-room was converted into a gymnasium and the assembly hall was turned into a library. The rooms where boarders had slept became classrooms and a staff room was established.\n\nMiss Bell introduced the prefect system, and founded the dramatic club and the debating society. She also started sports day and gymnastic and dancing displays. Two hockey pitches were rented, and tennis courts were borrowed from the Grammar School boarding house until 1926, when ground for two hockey pitches and two netball courts was acquired at King's Gate. Through gifts from Council, three tennis courts were laid out, and a sports pavilion was built. Miss Bell taught the girls of St Margaret's to think for themselves, to acquire a sense of responsibility and to have pride in their school.\n\n=== The School Well Established, 1929-1952 ===\nMiss Bell's successor was Mabel E. Holland and, under her able direction, the school rode out the problems of disruption and evacuation caused by the Second World War. Inheriting a school roll of 134, Miss Holland left with 365 pupils on the books. While maintaining the traditions and standards of the past, Miss Holland introduced new schemes, including a school magazine, ''The Chronicle,'' the building of a school hall, and the purchase of 15 Albyn Place. Meanwhile, the number of girls leaving school with the necessary qualification to attend university was growing steadily. The school hall was built and within a few months of the hall's opening, a passageway - known to this day as 'the pink passage' - was added to connect the new hall with the old school building. By March 1934, enough money had been raised to add extra rooms behind the hall, which doubled as green rooms for dramatic performances and as music practice rooms. The new building also allowed for the introduction of a Nursery Class. This was the first 'West-end' Nursery School in Aberdeen. Miss Holland also introduced the school uniform.\n\nHowever, the Second World War brought Miss Holland and her staff their greatest challenges.

Then, the shadow begins to \"cover\" part of the Moon, turning it a dark red-brown color (typically \u2013 the color can vary based on atmospheric conditions). The Moon appears to be reddish because of [[Rayleigh scattering]] (the same effect that causes sunsets to appear reddish) and the refraction of that light by Earth's atmosphere into its umbra.<ref>{{cite web |title=Visual Appearance of Lunar Eclipses |work=NASA |author=Fred Espenak |author2=Jean Meeus|last-author-amp=yes |url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/appearance.html |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe following simulation shows the approximate appearance of the Moon passing through Earth's shadow.

Then, the shadow begins to \"cover\" part of the Moon, turning it a dark red-brown color (typically \u2013 the color can vary based on atmospheric conditions). The Moon appears to be reddish because of [[Rayleigh scattering]] (the same effect that causes sunsets to appear reddish) and the refraction of that light by Earth's atmosphere into its umbra.<ref>{{cite web |title=Visual Appearance of Lunar Eclipses |work=NASA |author=Fred Espenak |author2=Jean Meeus|last-author-amp=yes |url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/appearance.html |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe following simulation shows the approximate appearance of the Moon passing through Earth's shadow.

Between 1221 and 1226 he founded [[Alberbury Priory]] in Shropshire, which was the smallest and last of the three English houses dependent upon the [[Order of Grandmont]].\n\nAfter his death Fulk became the subject of a popular \"ancestral romance\" in French verse, ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', relating his life as an outlaw and his struggle to regain his patrimony from the king.<ref>T.

The later mediaeval romance ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'' gives his name as \"Warin de Meer\". Whatever his true place of origin it is however generally believed that the head of the Warin family came to England during the reign of [[William the Conqueror]] (1066\u20131087). Neither the father nor his sons were, during that reign, [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] (i.e. important [[vassal]]s or [[English feudal barony|feudal barons]]): rather, their grants of lands were obtained from later kings.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 34</ref>\n\nFulk I (died 1170/1) was rewarded by King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189) for his support of the king's mother [[Empress Matilda]] in [[The Anarchy|her civil war]] with [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] (1135\u20131154): in 1153 Henry conferred upon him the royal [[manor]] of [[Alveston]] in Gloucestershire and in 1149 the manor of Whadborough (in [[Loddington, Leicestershire|Loddington]]<ref>J.

These disputes concerned estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in chief]] from the crown, but also others which he had held from [[Honour of Peverel|the Peverel family]] as [[Lord|overlords]]. They included particularly [[Whittington Castle]], held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Whittington Castle stands on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which before and during the Norman era formed the border between England and [[Wales]]. The site was fortified with a castle by [[William Peverel the Younger]] in 1138 in support of the Empress Matilda.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', p. 35</ref>\n\nIn the late 1140s the [[Marcher lord|lordship]] of [[Whittington, Shropshire|Whittington]], as with [[Oswestry]] and Overton, ceased to be part of England and became a Welsh [[marcher lord]]ship within the [[Kingdom of Powys]].<ref>P.

He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, by his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers, but it was clearly considerable, for in the spring of 1201, when King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Painter, ''The Reign of King John'', p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]] with 100 knights to counter the rebellion of Fulk and of William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Painter, ''The Reign of King John'', pp. 48, 84</ref> In July 1202 Fulk and his men were reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\". One other, Eustace de Kivilly, had been pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', p. 38</ref>\n\n===Settlement and status===\nAfter years as an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned, together with over thirty of his followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, and their cousins.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

A large pair of front flippers powers the turtles through the water. Like other sea turtles, the leatherback has flattened forelimbs adapted for swimming in the open ocean. Claws are absent from both pairs of flippers. The leatherback's flippers are the largest in proportion to its body among extant sea turtles. Leatherback's front flippers can grow up to {{convert|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} in large specimens, the largest flippers (even in comparison to its body) of any sea turtle.\n\nThe leatherback has several characteristics that distinguish it from other sea turtles. Its most notable feature is the lack of a bony [[carapace]]. Instead of [[scute]]s, it has thick, leathery skin with embedded minuscule [[osteoderm]]s. Seven distinct ridges rise from the carapace, crossing from the cranial to caudal margin of the turtle's back. Leatherbacks are unique among [[reptile]]s in that their scales lack [[Beta keratin|\u03b2-keratin]]. The entire turtle's [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] surface is colored dark grey to black, with a scattering of white blotches and spots. Demonstrating [[countershading]], the turtle's underside is lightly colored.<ref name=\"CCC\">{{cite web|title=Species Fact Sheet: Leatherback Sea Turtle |work=Caribbean Conservation Corporation & Sea Turtle Survival League |publisher=Caribbean Conservation Corporation |date=29 December 2005 |url=http://www.cccturtle.org/leatherback.htm |accessdate=6 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928221346/http://www.cccturtle.org/leatherback.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007  }}</ref><ref name=\"ADW\">{{cite web | last =Fontanes| first =F. | title =ADW: ''Dermochelys coriacea'': Information | work=Animal Diversity Web | publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology | year =2003 | url =http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Dermochelys_coriacea.html | accessdate = 17 September 2007 }}</ref> Instead of teeth, the leatherback turtle has points on the [[tomium]] of its upper lip, with backwards spines in its throat (esophagus) to help it swallow food and to stop its prey from escaping once caught. \n[[File: Leatherback turtle oesophagus.jpg|thumb|Oesophagus of a leatherback sea turtle showing spines to retain prey]]\n\n''D. coriacea'' adults average {{convert|1|-|1.75|m|ft|abbr=on}} in curved carapace length (CCL), {{convert|1.83|-|2.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total length, and {{convert|250|to|700|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight.<ref name=\"CCC\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Gerald |title=The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-85112-235-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessbookofan00wood |publisher=Enfield, Middlesex : Guinness Superlatives }}</ref> In the [[Caribbean]], the mean size of adults was reported at {{convert|384|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight and {{convert|1.55|m|ft|abbr=on}} in CCL.<ref name=\"DNR\">http://www.dnr.sc.gov/cwcs/pdf/Leatherbacktutle.pdf</ref> Similarly, those nesting in [[French Guiana]], weighed an average of {{convert|339.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and measured {{convert|1.54|m|ft|abbr=on}} in CCL.<ref name=\"Girondot1996\"/><ref>Georges, J.

Many of the same predators feed on baby turtles as they try to get to the ocean, as well as [[frigatebird]]s and varied [[Bird of prey|raptors]]. Once in the ocean, young leatherbacks still face predation from [[cephalopod]]s, [[Carcharhinidae|requiem sharks]], and various large fish. Despite their lack of a hard shell, the huge adults face fewer serious predators, though they are occasionally overwhelmed and preyed on by very large marine predators such as [[killer whale]]s, [[great white shark]]s, and [[tiger shark]]s. Nesting females have been preyed upon by [[jaguar]]s in the American tropics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Caut | first1 = S. | last2 = Guirlet | first2 = E. | last3 = Jouquet | first3 = P. | last4 = Girondot | first4 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Influence of nest location and yolkless eggs on the hatching success of leatherback turtle clutches in French Guiana | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 84 | issue = 6| pages = 908\u2013916 | doi=10.1139/z06-063}}</ref><ref>Chiang, M. 2003.

A medium-sized adult was observed chasing a shark that had attempted to bite it and then turned its aggression and attacked the boat containing the humans observing the prior interaction.<ref>Ernst, C., J.

Migration occurs between the cold waters where mature leatherbacks feed, to the tropical and subtropical beaches in the regions where they hatch. In the Atlantic, females tagged in French Guiana have been recaptured on the other side of the ocean in Morocco and Spain.<ref name=\"Girondot1996\"/>\n\n====Mating====\n[[Mating]] takes place at sea. Males never leave the water once they enter it, unlike females, which nest on land. After encountering a female (which possibly exudes a [[pheromone]] to signal her reproductive status), the male uses head movements, nuzzling, biting, or flipper movements to determine her receptiveness. Males can mate every year but the females mate every two to three years. [[Fertilization]] is internal, and multiple males usually mate with a single female. This [[polyandry]] does not provide the offspring with any special advantages.<ref name=\"Lee2004\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee PL, Hays GC |title =Polyandry in a marine turtle: Females make the best of a bad job | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume =101 | issue =17 | pages =6530\u20136535 | date =27 April 2004 | doi =10.1073/pnas.0307982101 | pmid =15096623 | pmc =404079 |ref=harv|bibcode =2004PNAS..101.6530L }}</ref>\n\n====Offspring====\n[[File:Ponteluth.jpg|thumb|upright|A leatherback turtle with eggs, photo taken on [[Montjoly]] beach (French Guiana)]]\nWhile other sea turtle species almost always return to their hatching beach, leatherbacks may choose another beach within the region. They choose beaches with soft sand because their softer [[carapace|shells]] and [[plastron]]s are easily damaged by hard rocks. Nesting beaches also have shallower approach angles from the sea. This is a vulnerability for the turtles because such beaches easily erode. They nest at night when the risk of predation and heat stress is lowest. As leatherback turtles spend the vast majority of their lives in the ocean, their eyes are not well adapted to night vision on land. The typical nesting environment includes a dark forested area adjacent to the beach. The contrast between this dark forest and the brighter, moonlit ocean provides directionality for the females. They nest towards the dark and then return to the ocean and the light.\n\n[[File:Baby-leatherback-1.jpg|thumbnail|Baby leatherback turtle]]\nFemales excavate a nest above the high-[[tide]] line with their flippers.

Development then resumes, but embryos remain extremely susceptible to movement-induced mortality until the membranes fully develop after incubating for 20 to 25&nbsp;days.

Birds, small [[mammal]]s, and other opportunists dig up the nests of turtles and consume eggs. [[wader|Shorebirds]] and [[crustacean]]s prey on the hatchings scrambling for the sea. Once they enter the water, they become prey to predatory fish and [[cephalopod]]s.\n\nLeatherbacks have slightly fewer human-related threats than other sea turtle species. Their flesh contains too much oil and fat to be considered palatable, reducing the demand. However, human activity still endangers leatherback turtles in direct and indirect ways. Directly, a few are caught for their meat by subsistence fisheries. Nests are raided by humans in places such as Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"WWFThreats\"/> In the state of [[Florida]], there have been 603 leatherback strandings between 1980 and 2014. Almost one-quarter (23.5%) of leatherback strandings are due to vessel-strike injuries, which is the highest cause of strandings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foley|first=Allen|date=2017|title=Distributions, relative abundances, and mortality factors of sea turtles in Florida during 1980-2014 as determined from strandings|url=|journal=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>[[File: Plastic bag jellyfish.JPG|thumb|Decaying plastic bag resembling jellyfish]]\nLight pollution is a serious threat to sea turtle hatchlings which have a strong attraction to light. Human-generated light from streetlights and buildings causes hatchlings to become disoriented, crawling toward the light and away from the beach. Hatchlings are attracted to light because the lightest area on a natural beach is the horizon over the ocean, the darkest area is the dunes or forest. On Florida's Atlantic coast, some beaches with high turtle nesting density have lost thousands of hatchlings due to artificial light.<ref>{{cite book |last=Safina|first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Safina |title=Voyage of the Turtle: In Pursuit of the Earth's Last Dinosaur |publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-8050-8318-7 |pages=52, 53, 60 }}</ref>\n\nMany human activities indirectly harm ''Dermochelys'' populations.

With leatherback populations declining more quickly than any other large animal in modern history, each turtle is precious.

A large pair of front flippers powers the turtles through the water. Like other sea turtles, the leatherback has flattened forelimbs adapted for swimming in the open ocean. Claws are absent from both pairs of flippers. The leatherback's flippers are the largest in proportion to its body among extant sea turtles.

Its most notable feature is the lack of a bony [[carapace]]. Instead of [[scute]]s, it has thick, leathery skin with embedded minuscule [[osteoderm]]s. Seven distinct ridges rise from the carapace, crossing from the cranial to caudal margin of the turtle's back. Leatherbacks are unique among [[reptile]]s in that their scales lack [[Beta keratin|\u03b2-keratin]].

Many of the same predators feed on baby turtles as they try to get to the ocean, as well as [[frigatebird]]s and varied [[Bird of prey|raptors]]. Once in the ocean, young leatherbacks still face predation from [[cephalopod]]s, [[Carcharhinidae|requiem sharks]], and various large fish. Despite their lack of a hard shell, the huge adults face fewer serious predators, though they are occasionally overwhelmed and preyed on by very large marine predators such as [[killer whale]]s, [[great white shark]]s, and [[tiger shark]]s. Nesting females have been preyed upon by [[jaguar]]s in the American tropics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Caut | first1 = S. | last2 = Guirlet | first2 = E. | last3 = Jouquet | first3 = P. | last4 = Girondot | first4 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Influence of nest location and yolkless eggs on the hatching success of leatherback turtle clutches in French Guiana | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 84 | issue = 6| pages = 908\u2013916 | doi=10.1139/z06-063}}</ref><ref>Chiang, M. 2003.

A medium-sized adult was observed chasing a shark that had attempted to bite it and then turned its aggression and attacked the boat containing the humans observing the prior interaction.<ref>Ernst, C., J.

Migration occurs between the cold waters where mature leatherbacks feed, to the tropical and subtropical beaches in the regions where they hatch. In the Atlantic, females tagged in French Guiana have been recaptured on the other side of the ocean in Morocco and Spain.<ref name=\"Girondot1996\"/>\n\n====Mating====\n[[Mating]] takes place at sea. Males never leave the water once they enter it, unlike females, which nest on land. After encountering a female (which possibly exudes a [[pheromone]] to signal her reproductive status), the male uses head movements, nuzzling, biting, or flipper movements to determine her receptiveness. Males can mate every year but the females mate every two to three years. [[Fertilization]] is internal, and multiple males usually mate with a single female. This [[polyandry]] does not provide the offspring with any special advantages.<ref name=\"Lee2004\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee PL, Hays GC |title =Polyandry in a marine turtle: Females make the best of a bad job | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume =101 | issue =17 | pages =6530\u20136535 | date =27 April 2004 | doi =10.1073/pnas.0307982101 | pmid =15096623 | pmc =404079 |ref=harv|bibcode =2004PNAS..101.6530L }}</ref>\n\n====Offspring====\n[[File:Ponteluth.jpg|thumb|upright|A leatherback turtle with eggs, photo taken on [[Montjoly]] beach (French Guiana)]]\nWhile other sea turtle species almost always return to their hatching beach, leatherbacks may choose another beach within the region. They choose beaches with soft sand because their softer [[carapace|shells]] and [[plastron]]s are easily damaged by hard rocks. Nesting beaches also have shallower approach angles from the sea. This is a vulnerability for the turtles because such beaches easily erode. They nest at night when the risk of predation and heat stress is lowest. As leatherback turtles spend the vast majority of their lives in the ocean, their eyes are not well adapted to night vision on land. The typical nesting environment includes a dark forested area adjacent to the beach. The contrast between this dark forest and the brighter, moonlit ocean provides directionality for the females. They nest towards the dark and then return to the ocean and the light.\n\n[[File:Baby-leatherback-1.jpg|thumbnail|Baby leatherback turtle]]\nFemales excavate a nest above the high-[[tide]] line with their flippers.

Development then resumes, but embryos remain extremely susceptible to movement-induced mortality until the membranes fully develop after incubating for 20 to 25&nbsp;days.

Birds, small [[mammal]]s, and other opportunists dig up the nests of turtles and consume eggs. [[wader|Shorebirds]] and [[crustacean]]s prey on the hatchings scrambling for the sea. Once they enter the water, they become prey to predatory fish and [[cephalopod]]s.\n\nLeatherbacks have slightly fewer human-related threats than other sea turtle species. Their flesh contains too much oil and fat to be considered palatable, reducing the demand. However, human activity still endangers leatherback turtles in direct and indirect ways. Directly, a few are caught for their meat by subsistence fisheries. Nests are raided by humans in places such as Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"WWFThreats\"/> In the state of [[Florida]], there have been 603 leatherback strandings between 1980 and 2014. Almost one-quarter (23.5%) of leatherback strandings are due to vessel-strike injuries, which is the highest cause of strandings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foley|first=Allen|date=2017|title=Distributions, relative abundances, and mortality factors of sea turtles in Florida during 1980-2014 as determined from strandings|url=|journal=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>[[File: Plastic bag jellyfish.JPG|thumb|Decaying plastic bag resembling jellyfish]]\nLight pollution is a serious threat to sea turtle hatchlings which have a strong attraction to light. Human-generated light from streetlights and buildings causes hatchlings to become disoriented, crawling toward the light and away from the beach. Hatchlings are attracted to light because the lightest area on a natural beach is the horizon over the ocean, the darkest area is the dunes or forest. On Florida's Atlantic coast, some beaches with high turtle nesting density have lost thousands of hatchlings due to artificial light.<ref>{{cite book |last=Safina|first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Safina |title=Voyage of the Turtle: In Pursuit of the Earth's Last Dinosaur |publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-8050-8318-7 |pages=52, 53, 60 }}</ref>\n\nMany human activities indirectly harm ''Dermochelys'' populations.

The term has at times been expanded to encompass persons of [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Middle Eastern]] and [[List of ethnic groups of Africa#North Africa|North African]] descent (for example, in the [[US Census]] definition), persons who are often considered non-white in most contexts. The usage of \"white people\" or a \"white race\" for a large group of mainly or exclusively European populations, defined by their [[light skin]], among other physical characteristics, and contrasting with \"[[black people]]\", [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]], and other \"[[colored|coloured]]\" people or \"[[person of color|persons of colour]]\", originated in the 17th century. It was only during the 19th century that this category was transformed in a [[scientific racism|quasi-scientific system]] of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[skin color|skin colour]] relations.\n\nThe concept of a unified white race did not achieve universal acceptance in Europe when it first came into use in the 17th century, or in the centuries afterward. [[Nazi Germany]] regarded some European peoples such as [[Slavs]] as racially distinct from themselves. Prior to the modern age, no European peoples regarded themselves as \"white\", but rather defined their race, ancestry, or ethnicity in terms of their nationality. Moreover, there is no accepted standard for determining the geographic barrier between white and non-white people. Contemporary [[anthropologist]]s and other scientists, while recognizing the reality of biological variation between different human populations, regard the concept of a unified, distinguishable \"white race\" as [[socially constructed]]. As a group with several different potential boundaries, it is an example of a [[fuzzy concept]]. Despite this, \"white\" is still a label in common use in the modern age and is effective in encompassing European people in general.\n\nThe [[Whiteness studies|concept of whiteness]] has particular resonance in the [[Anglosphere]]: e.g., in the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|United States]] ([[White Americans]]), [[Ethnic groups in Canada|Canada]] ([[white Canadians]]), [[Ethnic groups in Australia|Australia]] ([[European Australians|white Australians]]), [[Ethnic groups in New Zealand|New Zealand]] ([[white New Zealanders]]), the [[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] ([[white British]]), and [[Ethnic groups in South Africa|South Africa]] ([[white South Africans]]). In much of the rest of Europe, the distinction between race and nationality is more blurred; when people are asked to describe their race or ancestry, they often describe it in terms of their nationality. Various ideas of ''whiteness'' have been significant to national identity, [[Public policy (law)|public policy]], [[religion]], [[Census|population statistics]], [[racial segregation]], [[affirmative action]], [[eugenics]], racial [[marginalization]], and [[racial quota]]s.\n\nThe term \"white race\" or \"white people\" entered the major European languages in the later 17th century, in the context of [[Racialization|racialized]] [[slavery]] and unequal [[social status]] in the European colonies.

These were augmented by small numbers of free settlers from the [[British Isles]] and other European countries. However, until the mid-19th century, there were few restrictions on immigration, although members of ethnic minorities tended to be assimilated into the [[Anglo-Celtic]] populations.\n\nPeople of many nationalities, including many non-white people, emigrated to Australia during the [[Australian gold rushes|goldrushes]] of the 1850s. However, the vast majority was still white and the goldrushes inspired the [[Lambing Flat riots|first racist activism]] and policy, directed mainly at [[Chinese people]].\n\nFrom the late 19th century, the [[States and territories of Australia|Colonial/State]] and later [[Government of Australia|federal governments]] of Australia restricted all permanent immigration to the country by non-Europeans. These policies became known as the \"[[White Australia policy]]\", which was consolidated and enabled by the [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]],<ref>[http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=16 Immigration Restriction Act 1901] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601201917/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=16 |date=1 June 2011}}.

Whiteness therefore retained a meaning associated with social status for the time being. And during the 19th century, when the [[British Empire]] was at its peak, many of the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[aristocracy]] developed extremely [[chauvinism|chauvinistic]] attitudes to those of lower social rank.\n\n[[Edward Lhuyd]] discovered that [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] are all part of the same language family, which he called \"[[Celtic languages|Celtic]]\", and were distinct from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] English; this can be seen in context with 19th-century [[romantic nationalism]]. On the other hand, the discovery of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] remains also led to a belief that the English were descended from a distinct Germanic lineage that was fundamentally (and racially) different from that of the [[Modern Celts|Celts]]. Early British anthropologists such as [[John Beddoe]] and [[Robert Knox]] emphasised this distinction, and it was common to find texts that claimed that Welsh, Irish and Scottish people are the descendants of the indigenous more \"primitive\" inhabitants of the islands, while the English are the descendants of a more advanced and recent \"Germanic\" migration. Beddoe especially postulated that the Welsh and Irish people are closer to the [[Cro-Magnon]], whom he also considered ''Africanoid'', and it was common to find references to the [[wikt:swarthy|swarthyness]] of the skin of peoples from the west of the islands, by comparison to the more pale skinned and blond English residing in the east. For example, [[Thomas Huxley]]'s ''On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind'' (1870) described Irish, Scots and Welsh peoples as a mixture of ''melanochroi'' (\"dark colored\"), and ''xanthochroi'', while the English were \"xanthochroi\" (\"light colored\").\n\nJust as race reified whiteness in the colonies, so capitalism without social welfare reified whiteness with regards to social class in 19th-century Britain and Ireland; this social distinction of whiteness became, over time, associated with racial difference. For example, George Sims in ''How the poor live'' (1883) wrote of \"a dark continent that is within easy reach of the General Post Office [\u2026] the wild races who inhabit it will, I trust, gain public sympathy as easily as [other] savage tribes\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bonnet|2000|p=31}}</ref>\n\n==== Modern and official use ====\nFrom the early 1700s, Britain received a small-scale immigration of black people due to the [[Slavery in Africa|African slave trade]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2002/race/short_history_of_immigration.stm|title=Short History of Immigration|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> The oldest [[British Chinese|Chinese community in Britain]] (as well as in Europe) dates from the 19th century.<ref name=\"Chinese\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1369|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724204513/http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1369|archivedate=24 July 2009 |title=Culture and Ethnicity Differences in Liverpool&nbsp;\u2013 Chinese Community |publisher=Chambr\u00e9 Hardman Trust |accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref> Since the end of World War II, a substantial immigration from the [[British colonisation of Africa|African]], [[British West Indies|Caribbean]] and [[British Asian|South Asia]]n (namely the [[British Raj]]) [[Crown colony|colonies]] changed the picture more radically,<ref name=\"auto\"/> while the adhesion to the [[European Union]] brought with it a heightened immigration from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migration-flows-a8-and-other-eu-migrants-and-uk|title=Migration Flows of A8 and other EU Migrants to and from the UK|first=Carlos|last=Vargas-Silva|publisher=Migration Observatory, University of Oxford|date=10 April 2014|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nToday the [[Office for National Statistics]] uses the term ''white'' as an ethnic category.

John Wargelin, a pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and a former president of Suomi College, also tells how, when he was a child in Crystal Falls some years earlier, he and his friends were ridiculed and stoned on their way to school. \"Because of our strange language,\" he says, \"we were considered an alien race who had no right to settle in this country.\"</ref> and not seen as white, but \"Asian\". The reasons for this were the arguments and theories about the Finns originally being of [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] instead of \"native\" [[Caucasoid|European]] origin due to the Finnish language belonging to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and not the Indo-European language family.<ref>Eric Dregni, ''Vikings in the attic: In search of Nordic America'', p. 176.</ref>\n\nDuring American history, the process of officially being defined as ''white'' by law often came about in court disputes over pursuit of [[citizenship]]. The Immigration Act of 1790 offered [[naturalization]] only to \"any alien, being a free white person\". In at least 52&nbsp;cases, people denied the status of white by immigration officials sued in court for status as white people. By 1923, courts had vindicated a \"common-knowledge\" standard, concluding that \"scientific evidence\" was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a \"performance-based\" standard, relating to religious practices, education, intermarriage and a community's role in the United States.<ref name=Tehranian>John Tehranian, \"Performing Whiteness: Naturalization Litigation and the Construction of Racial Identity in America,\" ''The Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 109, No. 4.

The term has at times been expanded to encompass persons of [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Middle Eastern]] and [[List of ethnic groups of Africa#North Africa|North African]] descent (for example, in the [[US Census]] definition), persons who are often considered non-white in other contexts. The usage of \"white people\" or a \"white race\" for a large group of mainly or exclusively European populations, defined by their [[light skin]], among other physical characteristics, and contrasting with \"[[black people]]\", [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]], and other \"[[colored]]\" people or \"[[person of color|persons of color]]\", originated in the 17th century. It was only during the 19th century that this vague category was transformed in a [[scientific racism|quasi-scientific system]] of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[skin color]] relations.\n\nThe concept of a unified white race did not achieve universal acceptance in Europe when it first came into use in the 17th century, or in the centuries afterward. [[Nazi Germany]] regarded some European peoples such as [[Slavs]] as racially distinct from themselves. Prior to the modern age, no European peoples regarded themselves as \"white\", but rather defined their race, ancestry, or ethnicity in terms of their nationality. Moreover, there is no accepted standard for determining the geographic barrier between white and non-white people. Contemporary [[anthropologist]]s and other scientists, while recognizing the reality of biological variation between different human populations, regard the concept of a unified, distinguishable \"white race\" as [[socially constructed]]. As a group with several different potential boundaries, it is an example of a [[fuzzy concept]].\n\nThe [[Whiteness studies|concept of whiteness]] has particular resonance in the [[Anglosphere]]: e.g., in the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|United States]] ([[White Americans]]), [[Ethnic groups in Canada|Canada]] ([[white Canadians]]), [[Ethnic groups in Australia|Australia]] ([[European Australians|white Australians]]), [[Ethnic groups in New Zealand|New Zealand]] ([[white New Zealanders]]), the [[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] ([[white British]]), and [[Ethnic groups in South Africa|South Africa]] ([[white South Africans]]). In much of the rest of Europe, the distinction between race and nationality is more blurred; when people are asked to describe their race or ancestry, they often describe it in terms of their nationality. Various [[social construction]]s of ''whiteness'' have been significant to national identity, [[Public policy (law)|public policy]], [[religion]], [[Census|population statistics]], [[racial segregation]], [[affirmative action]], [[white privilege]], [[eugenics]], racial [[marginalization]], and [[racial quota]]s.\n\nThe term \"white race\" or \"white people\" entered the major European languages in the later 17th century, in the context of [[Racialization|racialized]] [[slavery]] and unequal [[social status]] in the European colonies. Description of populations as \"white\" in reference to their skin color predates this notion and is occasionally found in [[Greco-Roman ethnography]] and other ancient or medieval sources, but these societies did not have any notion of a white, pan-European race. Scholarship on [[Race (human categorization)|race]] distinguishes the modern concept from pre-modern descriptions, which focused on physical complexion rather than race.<ref>\"On both sides of the chronological divide between the modern and the pre-modern (wherever it may lie), there is today a remarkable consensus that the earlier vocabularies of difference are innocent of race.\" {{Cite book |last=Nirenberg |first=David |title=The Origins of Racism in the West |chapter=Was there race before modernity?

These were augmented by small numbers of free settlers from the [[British Isles]] and other European countries. However, until the mid-19th century, there were few restrictions on immigration, although members of ethnic minorities tended to be assimilated into the [[Anglo-Celtic]] populations.\n\nPeople of many nationalities, including many non-white people, emigrated to Australia during the [[Australian gold rushes|goldrushes]] of the 1850s. However, the vast majority was still white and the goldrushes inspired the [[Lambing Flat riots|first racist activism]] and policy, directed mainly at [[Chinese people]].\n\nFrom the late 19th century, the [[States and territories of Australia|Colonial/State]] and later [[Government of Australia|federal governments]] of Australia restricted all permanent immigration to the country by non-Europeans. These policies became known as the \"[[White Australia policy]]\", which was consolidated and enabled by the [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]],<ref>[http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=16 Immigration Restriction Act 1901] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601201917/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=16 |date=1 June 2011}}.

Whiteness therefore retained a meaning associated with social status for the time being. And during the 19th century, when the [[British Empire]] was at its peak, many of the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[aristocracy]] developed extremely [[chauvinism|chauvinistic]] attitudes to those of lower social rank.\n\n[[Edward Lhuyd]] discovered that [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] are all part of the same language family, which he called \"[[Celtic languages|Celtic]]\", and were distinct from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] English; this can be seen in context with 19th-century [[romantic nationalism]]. On the other hand, the discovery of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] remains also led to a belief that the English were descended from a distinct Germanic lineage that was fundamentally (and racially) different from that of the [[Modern Celts|Celts]]. Early British anthropologists such as [[John Beddoe]] and [[Robert Knox]] emphasised this distinction, and it was common to find texts that claimed that Welsh, Irish and Scottish people are the descendants of the indigenous more \"primitive\" inhabitants of the islands, while the English are the descendants of a more advanced and recent \"Germanic\" migration. Beddoe especially postulated that the Welsh and Irish people are closer to the [[Cro-Magnon]], whom he also considered ''Africanoid'', and it was common to find references to the [[wikt:swarthy|swarthyness]] of the skin of peoples from the west of the islands, by comparison to the more pale skinned and blond English residing in the east. For example, [[Thomas Huxley]]'s ''On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind'' (1870) described Irish, Scots and Welsh peoples as a mixture of ''melanochroi'' (\"dark colored\"), and ''xanthochroi'', while the English were \"xanthochroi\" (\"light colored\").\n\nJust as race reified whiteness in the colonies, so capitalism without social welfare reified whiteness with regards to social class in 19th-century Britain and Ireland; this social distinction of whiteness became, over time, associated with racial difference. For example, George Sims in ''How the poor live'' (1883) wrote of \"a dark continent that is within easy reach of the General Post Office [\u2026] the wild races who inhabit it will, I trust, gain public sympathy as easily as [other] savage tribes\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bonnet|2000|p=31}}</ref>\n\n==== Modern and official use ====\nFrom the early 1700s, Britain received a small-scale immigration of black people due to the [[Slavery in Africa|African slave trade]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2002/race/short_history_of_immigration.stm|title=Short History of Immigration|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> The oldest [[British Chinese|Chinese community in Britain]] (as well as in Europe) dates from the 19th century.<ref name=\"Chinese\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1369|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724204513/http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1369|archivedate=24 July 2009 |title=Culture and Ethnicity Differences in Liverpool&nbsp;\u2013 Chinese Community |publisher=Chambr\u00e9 Hardman Trust |accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref> Since the end of World War II, a substantial immigration from the [[British colonisation of Africa|African]], [[British West Indies|Caribbean]] and [[British Asian|South Asia]]n (namely the [[British Raj]]) [[Crown colony|colonies]] changed the picture more radically,<ref name=\"auto\"/> while the adhesion to the [[European Union]] brought with it a heightened immigration from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migration-flows-a8-and-other-eu-migrants-and-uk|title=Migration Flows of A8 and other EU Migrants to and from the UK|first=Carlos|last=Vargas-Silva|publisher=Migration Observatory, University of Oxford|date=10 April 2014|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nToday the [[Office for National Statistics]] uses the term ''white'' as an ethnic category.

John Wargelin, a pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and a former president of Suomi College, also tells how, when he was a child in Crystal Falls some years earlier, he and his friends were ridiculed and stoned on their way to school. \"Because of our strange language,\" he says, \"we were considered an alien race who had no right to settle in this country.\"</ref> and not seen as white, but \"Asian\". The reasons for this were the arguments and theories about the Finns originally being of [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] instead of \"native\" [[Caucasoid|European]] origin due to the Finnish language belonging to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and not the Indo-European language family.<ref>Eric Dregni, ''Vikings in the attic: In search of Nordic America'', p. 176.</ref>\n\nDuring American history, the process of officially being defined as ''white'' by law often came about in court disputes over pursuit of [[citizenship]]. The Immigration Act of 1790 offered [[naturalization]] only to \"any alien, being a free white person\". In at least 52&nbsp;cases, people denied the status of white by immigration officials sued in court for status as white people. By 1923, courts had vindicated a \"common-knowledge\" standard, concluding that \"scientific evidence\" was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a \"performance-based\" standard, relating to religious practices, education, intermarriage and a community's role in the United States.<ref name=Tehranian>John Tehranian, \"Performing Whiteness: Naturalization Litigation and the Construction of Racial Identity in America,\" ''The Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 109, No. 4.
