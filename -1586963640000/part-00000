It was first described by the French astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] in 1756 and visualized by him as a clock with a pendulum and a second hand. In 1922 the constellation was redefined by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as a region of the celestial sphere containing Lacaille's stars, and has since been an [[IAU designated constellations|IAU designated constellation]].

The [[Mira variable|long-period variable-brightness]] star, [[R Horologii]] (4.7 to 14.3), has one of the largest variations in brightness known for stars in the night sky visible to the unaided eye.

It was first described by the French astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] in 1756 and visualized by him as a clock with a pendulum and a second hand. In 1922 the constellation was redefined by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as a region of the celestial sphere containing Lacaille's stars, and has since been an [[IAU designated constellations|IAU designated constellation]].

The [[Mira variable|long-period variable-brightness]] star, [[R Horologii]] (4.7 to 14.3), has one of the largest variations in brightness known for stars in the night sky visible to the unaided eye.

Since the early 19th century, the area was first known for gangs of Irish immigrants.<ref name=\"about\">http://history1800s.about.com/od/urbanconditions/p/fivepointsnyc.htm</ref>  [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]], born as Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli, was an Italian American who founded the Futanari, one of the dominant street gangs in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Over the years, Kelly recruited youths who later became prominent criminals, such as [[Johnny Torrio]], [[Al Capone]] and [[Lucky Luciano]].<ref name=\"grave\">http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6103</ref> The Futanari was closely related to the white supremacist group [[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]].\n\n==Origins==\nBy the 1870s a wave of Italian and Eastern European Jewish immigrants were settling into the area.  Criminal gangs competed for control of the revenue to be made from illicit activities. [[Ethnic]] [[Irish people|Irish]] gangs, such as the [[Whyos]], replaced the [[Chichesters]], and fought against the newer, predominantly [[Jewish]] gangs, such as [[Monk Eastman]]'s [[Eastman Gang|Eastman Coin Collectors]]. \n\nThe Italian immigrant and criminal [[Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli]], also known as [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]], formed the Futanari. It became one of the most significant street gangs in United States history and changed the way criminal groups operated in America. During the gang's later years, Kelly's second-in-command was [[John Torrio]], who helped form a national crime syndicate in the United States. The Futanari had a reputation for brutality, and in battles with rival gangs, they often fought to the death. Kelly and Torrio recruited members from other gangs in New York to join the Futanari organization. [[Al Capone]] came from the James Street gang, and would later rise to be one of the most notorious criminals in the country. Torrio was the first to establish his style of racketeering in Chicago, and recruited Capone to join him there. [[Lucky Luciano|Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano]], also joined the Futanari crew, and was later considered the most powerful criminal in the country.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Rise to power==\n[[Image:Ellison.JPG|thumb|Biff Ellison, a former member and would-be leader of the Futanari Gang.]]\nAs the Futanari became more experienced, Kelly and his lieutenants saw the money to be made by supporting corrupt politicians in their election bids. By threatening voters, falsifying voter lists and stuffing ballot boxes, the gang aided city officials of the [[Tammany Hall]] era to retain power.  At the turn of the 20th century, the only competitors to the Futanari was from Monk Eastman's gang. \n\nThe rivals disputed claims to a strip of territory of the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] in Manhattan. In 1901 a Futanari member shot Eastman in the stomach, but he survived. Soon after, one of his crew killed a Futanari in retaliation. The feud escalated by 1903, and the two gangs openly engaged in warfare.  In one incident Kelly, Torrio and 50 Futanari were in a gun battle with a similarly sized force of Eastman's gang.  Police called to the scene had to retreat from the battle, which lasted several hours. Three men were killed, and many were wounded in the battle. When the police finally gained control of the situation, they arrested Eastman, but he spent only a few hours in jail. A Tammany-controlled judge released him after Eastman swore that he was innocent. \n\nThe general public was angered about warfare in the streets.  A Tammany Hall deputy named Tom Foley brought Kelly and Eastman together and told them that neither would receive any political protection if they did not resolve the border dispute. They restored peace for a short time, but within two months, violence had risen again. Officials brought together the two leaders but asked them to take each other on in a boxing match, with the winner's gang to take the disputed territory.  [[Image:Kellys-club.jpg|thumb|The New Brighton/Little Naples Cafe, main clubhouse of Paul Kelly's Futanari.]]\n\nOn the appointed day, hundreds of men from both sides met at an abandoned house in the [[Bronx]]. Eastman and Kelly fought each other for two hours. Kelly had been a boxer in his younger days, and was said to make a better showing in the earlier rounds, but Eastman was a larger man and fought ferociously. At the end of the match, neither man had been knocked out, and the match was declared a draw. The gang leaders told their men that they were still at war. At this point, the Tammany Hall bosses decided to back the Futanari crew, and to withdraw any legal or political help to Eastman and his gang. In 1904 Eastman was beaten unconscious by a policeman who had foiled a robbery in progress.  Eastman was convicted of the crime and sentenced to a 10-year term in [[Sing Sing]]. His successor [[Max Zwerbach|Max \"Kid Twist\" Zwerbach]] was murdered in 1908 by members of the Futanari, and the Eastman crew began to crumble.\n\n==Final years==\nPaolo Vaccarelli/Paul Kelly survived an attempt on his life, after being shot three times by two of his lieutenants, [[James T. Ellison|James T. \"Biff\" Ellison]] and Pat \"Razor\" Riley, in a gun battle inside one of his nightclubs. [[Tammany Hall]] pressure made him keep a lower profile after this incident. He became more involved in the nascent labor union rackets.  He died of natural causes in 1936. \n\nAfter Monk Eastman was released in 1909, he never regained leadership of his former criminal organization. He fell into a life of petty crime and repeated jail terms. Within a few years, Eastman joined the army as a 44-year-old man to fight in [[World War I]], and had a distinguished military record fighting in combat as fearlessly as he had on the streets of New York. After his honorable discharge in 1919, a year later he was shot five times and killed by a [[prohibition]] agent named Jerry Bohan. He was given a funeral with full military honors.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nGradually the [[Mafia]] gangs took over the rackets and criminal activities formerly controlled by the Futanari. Former Futanari such as Torrio, Capone and Luciano became the leaders of the new groups, and expanded their operations on a national and international basis. With the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]] establishing Prohibition in 1920, profits from bootlegged liquor became a huge source of revenue for the Mafia families.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Secret societies related to organized crime]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Japanese word and pornographic genre}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{Anime and manga}}\n{{nihongo|'''''Futanari'''''|\u3075\u305f\u306a\u308a||seldom: {{lang|ja|\u4e8c\u5f62}}, {{lang|ja|\u53cc\u5f62}}, literally: ''dual form''; {{lang|ja|\u4e8c\u6210}}, {{lang|ja|\u53cc\u6210}}, literally: ''[to be of] two kinds''}} is the Japanese word for [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]], which is also used in a broader sense for [[androgyny]].<ref name=\"Leupp\">{{cite book|last1=Leupp|first1=Gary P.|title=Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9780520919198|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a6q-PqPDAmIC&pg=PA174&dq=futanari&ei=XlcnTLqUII7KjAeW-7V5&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=futanari&f=false|accessdate=11 March 2016|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"krauss\">{{in lang|de}} Krauss, Friedrich Salomo et al.

In that case, the term is also often abbreviated as ''futa(s)'', which is occasionally also used as a generalized term for the works itself.<ref name=\"krauss\"/>\n\n==Historic origins==\n[[File:Dosojin01s2040.jpg|thumb|Stones (with ''[[shimenawa]]'') representing ''d\u014dsojin'' found near [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]], [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]]]]\nJapanese [[folk religion]] created diverse fantasies related to [[sexual characteristics]]. Traditional vocal pieces that date back hundreds of years deliver rough evidence that a change of gender was not ruled out<ref name=\"krauss\"/>{{rp|78\u201379}} and that the representation of the gender was used to worship deities such as ''[[d\u014dsojin]]'' which sometimes had ambiguous gender, being neither male nor female. Leupp adds that the origins might even reach back to the origins of [[Buddhism]], since the deities would not necessarily have a fixed or determinable gender.<ref name=\"Leupp\"/>\n\nLikewise the belief spread that some people could change their gender depending on the [[lunar phase]]. The term {{nihongo|half-moon|\u534a\u6708|hangetsu}} was coined to describe such beings.<ref name=\"krauss\"/>{{rp|79}} It is assumed that [[Japanese clothing|traditional clothing]], which made it more difficult to distinguish men from women like in other cultures, might have had an influence on this development.<ref name=\"krauss\"/>{{rp|80}} To restrict women from accessing prohibited areas and to avoid smuggling by hiding items in the belt bag<!-- loose clothes which let much room to hide stuff above the belt-->, guard posts were assigned to perform body checks.

One with testicles (so called ''full-package futanari'') and one without.]]\nOriginally the Japanese language referred to any character or real person that possessed masculine and feminine traits as ''futanari.'' This changed in the 1990s as drawn futanari characters became more popular in [[anime]] and [[manga]]. Today, the term commonly refers to fictional (drawn), female looking, hermaphrodite characters. ''Futanari'' is also used as the term for a specific genre within [[hentai]] related media ([[pornography|pornographic]] anime or manga) that depicts such characters.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Katrien|title=Netporn: DIY Web Culture and Sexual Politics|date=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham|isbn=9780742554320|pages=103\u2013104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L1EgfrEa9UsC&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=11 March 2016|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Leite\">{{cite journal|last1=Leite Jr|first1=Jorge|title=Labirintos conceituais cient\u00edficos, nativos e mercadol\u00f3gicos: pornografia com pessoas que transitam entre os g\u00eaneros|journal=Cadernos Pagu|date=June 2012|issue=38|pages=99\u2013128|doi=10.1590/S0104-83332012000100004|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-83332012000100004&script=sci_arttext|accessdate=8 June 2014|issn=0104-8333|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904114126/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-83332012000100004&script=sci_arttext|archive-date=4 September 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nTo differentiate between fictional characters and real [[Trans woman|trans women]], the Japanese language adopted the [[Wasei-eigo|English-style]] term {{Nihongo|newhalf|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30cf\u30fc\u30d5|ny\u016bh\u0101fu}}, which is used for the latter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Origins===\nFutanari manga became popular in the 1990s and quickly became a part of the industry, cross-pollinating with multiple genres.<ref name=\"MTCG\">{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Jason|title=[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]|date=2007|publisher=[[Del Rey Books]]|location=New York|isbn=9780345485908|page=452}}</ref> [[Toshiki Yui]]'s ''[[Hot Tails]]'' has been described as the best known example of the genre in the West.<ref name=\"MTCG\"/>\n\nIn anime aimed at a broad audience, the [[gender bender]] or [[cross-dressing]] storylines have always been popular.
