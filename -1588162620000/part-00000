Badawi|Ali Badawi]], the long-time chief-[[Archaeology|archaeologist]] for Southern Lebanon at the Directorate-General of Antiquities, it can be generally assumed that all villages around Tyre were established already during [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] like the [[Neolithic|neolithic age]] (5.000 BCE), especially in the fertile area of Ras al-Ain, next to the Tell El-Rashdiyeh (the Hill of Rashidieh).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMany scholars assume that the area of what is now Rashidieh actually used to be the original [[Ushu]] (also transliterated Usu or Uzu), founded on the mainland around 2750 BCE as a walled place.<ref name=\":2\" /> It was later called Palaetyrus (also spelled Palaityros or Palaeotyre), meaning \"Old Tyre\" in [[Ancient Greek]], and played a major role in supplying Island Tyre as its twin sister.<ref name=\":12\" /> One of the reasons to locate Ushu/Palaetyrus in the Rashidieh area is the delineation of its [[acropolis]] by Ancient-Greek [[geographer]] [[Strabo]], who visited Tyre himself.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVery few [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]] were conducted in Rashidieh before the refugee camp was established. However, the collections of the [[National Museum of Beirut]] hold a number of items which were found there. Amongst them is an [[amphora]] with [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] inscriptions dated to the [[Iron Age|Iron Age II]] and a [[Urn|cinerary urn]] dated 775-750 BCE. The latter was an import from [[Cyprus]] and gives evidence that Rashidieh was used as a [[necropolis]] as well.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=A visit to the Museum...

Angered by this rejection and the city's loyalty to [[List of monarchs of Persia|Persian]] king [[Darius the Great]], Alexander started the [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|Siege of Tyre]] despite its reputation as being impregnable. However, the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] conqueror succeeded after seven months by demolishing the old city on the mainland and using its stones to construct a [[causeway]] to the island.<ref name=\":12\" /> This [[isthmus]] increased greatly in width over the centuries because of extensive [[silt]] [[Deposition (geology)|depositions]] on either side, making the former island a permanent [[peninsula]] - based on the ruins and rubble of Palaetyrus.\n\nThe use of the area as a burial ground seems to have continued during [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times: a [[marble]] [[sarcophagus]] from the first or second century CE was discovered there in 1940.

Badawi|Ali Badawi]], the long-time chief-[[Archaeology|archaeologist]] for Southern Lebanon at the Directorate-General of Antiquities, it can be generally assumed that all villages around Tyre were established already during [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] like the [[Neolithic|neolithic age]] (5.000 BCE), especially in the fertile area of Ras al-Ain, next to the Tell El-Rashdiyeh (the Hill of Rashidieh).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMany scholars assume that the area of what is now Rashidieh actually used to be the original [[Ushu]] (also transliterated Usu or Uzu), founded on the mainland around 2750 BCE as a walled place.<ref name=\":2\" /> It was later called Palaetyrus (also spelled Palaityros or Palaeotyre), meaning \"Old Tyre\" in [[Ancient Greek]], and played a major role in supplying Island Tyre as its twin sister.<ref name=\":12\" /> One of the reasons to locate Ushu/Palaetyrus in the Rashidieh area is the delineation of its [[acropolis]] by Ancient-Greek [[geographer]] [[Strabo]], who visited Tyre himself.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVery few [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]] were conducted in Rashidieh before the refugee camp was established. However, the collections of the [[National Museum of Beirut]] hold a number of items which were found there. Amongst them is an [[amphora]] with [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] inscriptions dated to the [[Iron Age|Iron Age II]] and a [[Urn|cinerary urn]] dated 775-750 BCE. The latter was an import from [[Cyprus]] and gives evidence that Rashidieh was used as a [[necropolis]] as well.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=A visit to the Museum...

Angered by this rejection and the city's loyalty to [[List of monarchs of Persia|Persian]] king [[Darius the Great]], Alexander started the [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|Siege of Tyre]] despite its reputation as being impregnable.

In a [[physiology|physiological]] context, fasting may refer to the [[metabolism|metabolic]] status of a person who has not eaten overnight, or to the metabolic state achieved after complete [[digestion]] and absorption of a meal. Several metabolic adjustments occur during fasting. Some [[diagnostic test]]s are used to determine a fasting state. For example, a person is assumed to be fasting once 8\u201312 hours have elapsed since the last meal. Metabolic changes of the fasting state begin after absorption of a meal (typically 8-12 hours after eating).\n\nA [[diagnostic fast]] refers to prolonged fasting from 1 to 100 hours (depending on age) conducted under observation to facilitate the investigation of a health complication, usually [[hypoglycemia]]. Many people may also fast as part of a medical procedure or a check-up, such as preceding a [[colonoscopy]] or [[surgery]]. Fasting may also be part of a religious ritual.\n\n== Health effects ==\n{{See also|Starvation response|Intermittent fasting|Autophagy}}\n\n=== Medical application ===\n{{See also|Preoperative fasting|Body cleansing|Nothing by mouth}}\nFasting is always practiced prior to surgery or other procedures that require [[general anesthesia]] because of the risk of [[pulmonary aspiration]] of gastric contents after induction of anesthesia (i.e., vomiting and inhaling the vomit, causing life-threatening [[aspiration pneumonia]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/WomensHealth/story?id=7161746&page=1 |title=Do You Need to Starve Before Surgery? \u2013 ABC News |date=25 March 2009 |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208095908/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/WomensHealth/story?id=7161746&page=1 |archive-date=8 February 2011 |access-date=18 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/health/minutes/stories/2004/06/17/1137544.htm |title=Fasting before surgery \u2013 Health & Wellbeing |last=Norman |first=Dr |date=17 April 2003 |publisher=Abc.net.au |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529211055/http://www.abc.net.au/health/minutes/stories/2004/06/17/1137544.htm |archive-date=29 May 2010 |access-date=18 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.yestheyrefake.net/anesthesia_full.htm |title=Anesthesia Information (full edition) &#124; From Yes They're Fake! |date=1 January 1994 |publisher=Yestheyrefake.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112015650/http://www.yestheyrefake.net/anesthesia_full.htm |archive-date=12 November 2010 |access-date=18 October 2010}}</ref> Additionally, certain medical tests, such as [[cholesterol]] testing ([[lipid panel]]) or certain [[blood glucose]] measurements require fasting for several hours so that a [[baseline (medicine)|baseline]] can be established.

Eating solid food between meals is not permitted. Fasting is required of the faithful between the ages of 18 and 59 on specified days. Complete abstinence of [[meat]] for the day is required of those 14 and older. Partial [[abstinence]] prescribes that meat be taken only once during the course of the day. Meat is understood not to include fish or cold-blooded animals.\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] had initially relaxed some of the regulations concerning fasting in 1956.  In 1966, [[Pope Paul VI]] in his apostolic constitution ''[[Paenitemini]]'', changed the strictly regulated Catholic fasting requirements. He recommended that fasting be appropriate to the local economic situation, and that all Catholics voluntarily fast and abstain. In the United States, there are only two obligatory days of fast \u2013 Ash Wednesday and [[Good Friday]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year/lent/catholic-information-on-lenten-fast-and-abstinence.cfm |title = Fast & Abstinence}}</ref>. The Fridays of Lent are days of abstinence: eating meat is not allowed. Pastoral teachings since 1966 have urged voluntary fasting during Lent and voluntary abstinence on the other Fridays of the year.  The regulations concerning such activities do not apply when the ability to work or the health of a person would be negatively affected.\n\nPrior to the changes made by Pius XII and Paul VI, fasting and abstinence were more strictly regulated. The church had prescribed that Catholics observe fasting or abstinence on a number of days throughout the year.\n\nIn addition to the fasts mentioned above, Catholics must also observe the [[Eucharistic discipline|Eucharistic Fast]], which involves taking nothing but water and medicines into the body for one hour before receiving the Eucharist. The ancient practice was to fast from midnight until Mass that day, but as Masses after noon and in the evening became common, this was soon modified to fasting for three hours.  Current law requires merely one hour of eucharistic fast, although some Catholics still abide by the older rules.\n\nColloquially, fasting, abstinence, the Eucharistic Fast, and personal sacrificial disciplines such as [[abnegation]] of sweets for Lent are altogether referred to as fasting.\n\nThe Catholic Church has also promoted a [[Black Fast]], in which in addition to water, bread is consumed. Typically, this form of fasting was used only by monks and other religious individuals who practice mortifications and asceticism, but all Catholics are invited to take part in it with the advice and consent of their spiritual director.\n\n==== Anglicanism ====\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]] prescribes certain days as days for fasting and abstinence, \"consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday)\":<ref name=\"Buchanan2006\">{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Colin|title=Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism|date=27 February 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6506-8|page=182|quote=In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, there is a list of \"Days of Fasting, or Abstinence,\" consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday).}}<!--|accessdate=7 June 2015--></ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n'''A Table of the Vigils, Fasts, and Days of Abstinence, to be Observed in the Year.'''\n:The eves ([[vigil]]s) before:\n::The [[Christmas|Nativity of our Lord]].\n::The [[Ritual purification|Purification]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n::The [[Annunciation]] of the Blessed Virgin.\n::[[Easter]] Day.\n::[[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] Day.\n::[[Pentecost]].\n::[[St. Matthias]].\n::[[John the Baptist|St. John Baptist]].\n::[[St. Peter]].\n::[[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]].\n::[[St. Bartholomew]].\n::[[Saint Matthew|St. Matthew]].\n::[[St. Simon]] and [[St. Jude]].\n::[[St. Andrew]].\n::[[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]].\n::[[All Saints' Day]].\n:Note: if any of these Feast-Days fall upon a Monday, then the Vigil or Fast-Day shall be kept upon the Saturday, and not upon the Sunday next before it.\n:Days of Fasting, or Abstinence.\n::I.

One traditional expression of abstinence is to avoid meat on Fridays in Lent or through the entire year, except in the seasons of Christmas and Easter. It is common to undertake some particular act of abstinence during the entire season of Lent.

Generally Lent and Fridays are set aside, though Fridays during Christmastide and Eastertide are sometimes avoided. Often the [[Ember Days]] or [[Rogation Days]] are also specified, and the eves (vigils) of certain feasts.\n\nIn addition to these days of fasting, Anglicans also observe the [[Eucharistic discipline|Eucharistic Fast]]. Saint Augustine's Prayer Book states that the Eucharistic Fast is a \"strict fast from both food and drink from midnight\" that is done in \"in order to receive the Blessed Sacrament as the first food of the day\" in \"homage to our Lord\".<ref name=\"Gavitt1991\"/> It implores Anglicans to fast for some hours before the [[Midnight Mass]] of [[Christmas Eve]], the first liturgy of [[Christmastide]].<ref name=\"Gavitt1991\"/>\n\n==== Eastern Orthodoxy ====\nFor [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, fasting is an important spiritual discipline, found in both the Old Testament and the New, and is tied to the principle in [[Orthodox theology]] of the [[synergy]] between the [[Human body|body]] (Greek: ''soma'') and the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (''pneuma''). That is to say, Orthodox Christians do not see a dichotomy between the body and the soul but rather consider them as a united whole, and they believe that what happens to one affects the other (this is known as the ''psychosomatic union'' between the body and the soul).<ref name=\"LT\" /><ref name=\"TOC\" /> Saint [[Gregory Palamas]] argued that man's body is not an enemy but a partner and collaborator with the soul.

All churches require fasting before one receives [[Holy Communion]]. All churches practice fasting on most Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year as well as observing many other days. Monks and nuns also observe additional fast days not required of the laity.\n\nThe [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] (with the exception of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem) has followed the [[Gregorian Calendar]] since 1923, making it and the Finnish Orthodox church the only Orthodox churches to primarily celebrate [[Easter]] on the same date as [[Western Christianity]]. As a result, the Armenian church's observation of [[Lent]] generally begins and ends before that of other Orthodox churches.\n\n{{Main|Coptic abstinence}}\nWith the exception of the fifty days following [[Easter]] in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], fish is not allowed during [[Lent]], or on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Paramon days. Other than that fish and shellfish are allowed during fasting days.\n\nThe discipline of fasting entails that, apart from Saturdays, Sundays, and holy feasts, one should keep a total fast from all food and drink from midnight the night before to a certain time in the day usually three o'clock in the afternoon (the hour [[Jesus]] died on the Cross). Also, it is preferred that one reduce one's daily intake of food, typically by eating only one full meal a day.\n\nThe [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] generally follows the fasting practices of the Coptic Church however in some cases it follows the Ethiopian Church.\n\nThe [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has an especially rigorous fasting calendar.\n\nFasting in the Ethiopian Church implies abstention from food and drink. No animal products are consumed, including dairy, eggs and meat, and utensils that have touched such products must be washed before touching the strictly vegan foods that are consumed on fast days.  During fast periods, Holy Liturgy (Mass) is held at noon (except on Saturdays and Sundays), and because no food can be consumed before communion, it is traditional for people to abstain from food until mass is over (around 2 to 3 in the afternoon). Every Wednesday and Friday are days of fasting because Wednesday is the day that the Lord was condemned and Friday is the day he was crucified (the Wednesdays and Fridays between Easter Sunday and Pentecost Sunday are an exception as well as when Christmas or Epiphany fall on a Wednesday or a Friday). The fasts that are ordained in the canon of the Church of Ethiopia are:\n\n*1. Lent including Holy Week and the 10-day Fast of the Cross proclaimed by Byzantine Emperor Hereaclus (known as Hudadi, Abiye Tsom or Tsome Eyesus), 56 days.\n*2. Fast of the Apostles, 10\u201340 days, which the Apostles kept after they had received the Holy Spirit. It begins after Pentecost (known as Tsome Hwariat).\n*3. The fast of Assumption of the Holy Virgin, 16 days in August (known as Tsome Filseta).\n*4. Christmas Eve (Gahad ze Lidet) and The Eve of Epiphany, (Gahad ze Timket).\n*5. Advent, 40 days (Known as Tsome Gena that begin with \"Sibket\" on 15th Hedar and ends on Christmas Eve).\n*6. The [[fast of Nineveh]], commemorating the preaching of Jonah. (On the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the third week before Lent.\n*7. All Wednesdays and Fridays of the year except the ones that fall between Easter Sunday and Pentecost Sunday.\n\nIn addition to these, there is the fast of repentance which a person keeps after committing sin, it being imposed as a penance by the priest for seven days, forty days or one year. There is also a fast which a bishop keeps at the time he is consecrated. Also there are fasts that are widely observed but which have not been included in the canon of the church and which are therefore considered strictly optional such as the \"Tsige Tsom\" or Spring Fast, also known as \"Kweskwam Tsom\" which marks the exile of the Holy Family in Egypt.\n\nAll persons above the age of 13 are expected to observe the church fasts.  Most children over age seven are expected to observe at least the Fast of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin. Dispensations are granted to those who are ill.\n\nThe total number of fasting days amounts to about 250 a year.  While many observe the Coptic Church's allowance for fish during the longer fasts, it has increasingly become practice in the Ethiopian Church to abstain from fish during all fasts according to the canons of the Ethiopian Church.\n\nThe observation of [[Lent]] within the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] was once very strict but now is comparatively lenient compared with how it is observed in other Orthodox Churches.\n\n==== Church of the East ====\n\nThe [[Assyrian Church of the East]] practices fasting during [[Lent]], the seven weeks prior to [[Easter]], wherein the faithful abstain from eating eggs, meat and any dairy or animal products. This is preceded by Somikka night.\n\nThe Church of the East strictly observes the Nineveh Fast (Som Baoutha). This annual observance occurs exactly three weeks before the start of Lent. This tradition has been practised by all Christians of Syriac traditions since the 6th century. At that time, a plague afflicted the region of Nineveh, modern-day northern Iraq. The plague devastated the city and the villages surrounding it, and out of desperation the people ran to their [[bishop]] to find a solution. The bishop sought help through the [[Scriptures]] and came upon the story of [[Jonah]] in the [[Old Testament]]. Upon reading the story, the bishop ordered a three-day fast to ask God for forgiveness. At the end of the three days, the plague had miraculously stopped, so on the fourth day the people rejoiced.\n\n==== Lutheran ====\n[[Martin Luther]], the Protestant [[Reformation|Reformer]], held that fasting served to \"kill and subdue the pride and lust of the flesh\".<ref name=\"Gentilcore2015\">{{cite book|last=Gentilcore|first=David|title=Food and Health in Early Modern Europe: Diet, Medicine and Society, 1450-1800|date=19 November 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781472528421|page=125}}</ref> As such, the Lutheran churches often emphasized voluntary fasting over collective fasting, though certain liturgical seasons and holy days were times for communal fasting and abstinence.<ref>Albala, Ken. 2003.

Although Pentecostalism has not classified different types of fasting, certain writers within the movement have done so. Arthur Wallis writes about the \"Normal Fast\" in which pure water alone is consumed.<ref name=\"Wallis, Arthur 1986\">Wallis, Arthur, God's Chosen Fast, Christian Literature Crusade (June 1986)</ref>  The \"Black Fast\" in which nothing, not even water, is consumed is also mentioned. Dr. Curtis Ward points out that undertaking a black fast beyond three days may lead to dehydration, may irreparably damage the kidneys, and result in possible death.<ref>Johnson, William, The Fasting Movement, Bethesda Books, 2003</ref> He further notes that nowhere in the New Testament is it recorded that anyone ever undertook a black fast beyond three days and that one should follow this biblical guideline. In addition to the normal fast and black fast, some undertake what is referred to as the Daniel Fast (or Partial Fast) in which only one type of food (e.g., fruit or fruit and non-starchy vegetables) is consumed.<ref name=\"Wallis, Arthur 1986\" />  In a Daniel Fast, meat is almost always avoided, in following the example of Daniel and his friends' refusal to eat the meat of Gentiles, which had been offered to idols and not slaughtered in a kosher manner. In some circles of Pentecostals, the term \"fast\" is simply used, and the decision to drink water is determined on an individual basis.\n\n==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====\n{{See also|Fast Sunday}}\nFor members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], fasting is total abstinence from food and drink accompanied by prayer.  Members are encouraged to fast on the first Sunday of each month, designated as [[Fast Sunday]]. During Fast Sunday, members fast for two consecutive meals (24 hours); this is usually Sunday breakfast and lunch, thus the fasting occurs between the evening meal on Saturday and the evening meal on Sunday. The money saved by not having to purchase and prepare meals is donated to the church as a [[fast offering]], which is then used to help people in need.<ref>{{cite web|author=Riley M.

Individuals observe different kinds of fasts based on personal beliefs and local customs. Some are listed below:\n* Some Hindus fast on certain days of the month such as [[Ekadasi]], [[Pradosha vrata|Pradosha]], or [[Pornima|Purnima]].\n* Certain days of the week are also set aside for fasting depending on personal belief and favorite deity. For example, devotees of [[Shiva]] tend to fast on Mondays, while devotees of [[Vishnu]] tend to fast on Thursdays and devotees of [[Ayyappa]] tend to fast on Saturdays.\n* Tuesday fasting is common in southern India as well as northwestern India. In the south, it is believed that Tuesday is dedicated to Goddess [[Mariamman]], a form of Goddess [[Shakti]]. Devotees eat before sunrise and drink only liquids between sunrise and sunset. Only liquids between a prescribed period, like water fasting, is half fasting. In the North, Tuesday is dedicated to Lord [[Hanuman]] and devotees are allowed only to consume milk and fruit between sunrise and sunset.\n* Thursday fasting is common among the [[Hindu]]s of northern [[India]]. On Thursdays, devotees listen to a [[narrative|story]] before opening their fast. On the Thursday fasters also worship Vrihaspati Mahadeva. They wear yellow clothes, and meals with yellow colour are preferred. Women worship the [[banana]] tree and water it. Food items are made with yellow-coloured [[ghee]]. Thursday is also dedicated to [[Guru]] and many Hindus who follow a guru will fast on this day.\n* Fasting during religious festivals is also very common. Common examples are [[Maha Shivaratri]] (Most people conduct a strict fast on Maha Shivratri, not even consuming a drop of water ), or the nine days of [[Navratri]] (which occurs twice a year in the months of April and October/November during [[Vijayadashami]] just before [[Diwali]], as per the [[Hindu calendar]]). [[Karwa Chauth]] is a form of fasting practised in some parts of India where married women undertake a fast for the well-being, prosperity, and longevity of their husbands. The fast is broken after the wife views the moon through a sieve. In the fifth month (Shravan Maas) of the Hindu calendar, many celebrate [[Shraavana]]. During this time some will fast on the day of the week that is reserved for worship of their chosen god(s), while others will fast during the entire month.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rudraksha-ratna.com/shravan-month.html |title=Shravan Month, Shravan Maas, Sawan Mahina 2015 |publisher=Rudraksha Ratna |date= |accessdate=11 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116173638/http://www.rudraksha-ratna.com/shravan-month.html |archive-date=16 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* In the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], the month of [[Kartik (month)]], which begins with the day after Deepavali is often a period of frequent (though not necessarily continuous) fasting for some people, especially women. Common occasions for fasting during this month include Mondays for Lord Shiva, the full-moon day of Karthika and the occasion of Naagula Chaviti.\n\nMethods of fasting also vary widely and cover a broad spectrum. If followed strictly, the person fasting does not partake any food or water from the previous day's sunset until 48 minutes after the following day's sunrise. Fasting can also mean limiting oneself to one meal during the day, abstaining from eating certain food types or eating only certain food types. In any case, the fasting person is not supposed to eat or even touch any animal products (i.e., meat, eggs) except [[dairy]] products. Amongst Hindus during fasting, starchy items such as [[Potatoes]], [[Sago]] and [[Sweet potatoes]] are allowed. The other allowed food items include milk products, peanuts and fruits. Peanuts and the starchy items mentioned above originate outside India.\n\nIn [[Shri Vidya]], one is forbidden to fast because the Devi is within them, and starving would in return starve the god. The only exception in Srividya for fasting is on the anniversary of the day one's parents died.\n\n'''[[Mahabharata]]:[[Anushasana Parva]] (Book 13)'''\n\n[[Yudhishthira]] asks [[Bhishma]], \"what constitutes the highest penances?\" Bheeshma states (in section 103) \" ....there is no penance that is superior to abstention from food!

After fasting, one must feed a number of brahmans.

Fasting also includes abstaining from any falsehood in speech and action, abstaining from any ignorant and indecent speech, and from arguing, fighting, and having lustful thoughts. Therefore, fasting strengthens control of impulses and helps develop good [[behavior]]. During the sacred month of Ramadan, believers strive to purify body and soul and increase their ''taqwa'' (good deeds and God-consciousness). This purification of body and soul harmonizes the inner and outer spheres of an individual. Muslims aim to improve their body by reducing food intake and maintaining a healthier lifestyle. Overindulgence in food is discouraged and eating only enough to silence the pain of hunger is encouraged. Muslims believe they should be active, tending to all their commitments and never falling short of any duty. On a moral level, believers strive to attain the most virtuous characteristics and apply them to their daily situations. They try to show compassion, generosity and mercy to others, exercise patience, and control their anger. In essence, Muslims are trying to improve what they believe to be good moral character and habits.\n\n==== Ramadan ====\nFasting is obligatory for every Muslim one month in the year, during [[Ramadan]]. Each day, the fast begins at dawn and ends at sunset. During this time Muslims are asked to remember those who are less fortunate than themselves as well as bringing them closer to God. Non obligatory fasts are two days a week as well as the middle of the month, as recommended by the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nAlthough fasting at Ramadan is ''fard'' (obligatory), exceptions are made for persons in particular circumstances:\n* Prepubescent children; though some parents will encourage their children to fast earlier for shorter periods, so the children get used to fasting.\n* Unconditional vomiting because the food leaves through an unintentional part of the gut.\n* Serious illness; the days lost to illness will have to be made up after recovery.\n* If one is traveling but one must make up any days missed upon arriving at one's destination.\n* A woman during her menstrual period; although she must count the days she missed and make them up later.\n* A woman till forty days after giving birth to child or miscarriage. But she must count the day she missed in Ramadan or they should donate the amount of a normal person's diet for each day missed to the poor or needy.\n* A woman who is pregnant or breast feeding. But she must count the day she missed in Ramadan or they should donate the amount of a normal person's diet for each day missed to the poor or needy.\n* An ill person or old person who is not physically able to fast. They should donate the amount of a normal person's diet for each day missed if they are financially capable.\n* A mentally ill person.\n* For elders who will not be able to fast, a lunch meal (or an equivalent amount of money) is to be donated to the poor or needy for each day of missed fasting.\n\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ramadan.co.uk/resources.php |title=Official Ramadan 2014 website |website=Ramadan.co.uk |date= |accessdate=11 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034220/http://www.ramadan.co.uk/resources.php |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Sunna days ====\nMuslims are suggested to do ''[[sunnah]]'' fasting on particular days:\n\n* Arafah fasting; to do fasting on the ninth of Dh\u016b al-\u1e24ijjah month for those who are not performing hajj.\n* On the first nine day of Dh\u016b al-\u1e24ijjah month.\n* Tasu'a fasting; to do fasting on the ninth of Mu\u1e25arram month to start off the next day fasting so they can differ themselves from the Christian and the Jews.\n* [[Ashura]] fasting; optional fasting on the tenth of Mu\u1e25arram month.\n* Shaww\u0101l fasting; to do fasting 6 days on any day of Shaww\u0101l month.\n* Monday-Thursday fasting; to do fasting every Monday and Thursday, except for the forbidden days.\n* Daud (David) fasting; to do fasting and not to do the fasting the next day, everyday.\n\n==== Forbidden days ====\nFasting is forbidden on these days:<ref>Ismail Kamus (1993).

Traditionally observant Jews fast six days of the year. With the exception of Yom Kippur, fasting is never permitted on [[Shabbat]], for the commandment of keeping Shabbat is biblically ordained and overrides the later rabbinically instituted fast days.  (The optional minor fast of the [[Tenth of Tevet]] could also override the Shabbat, but the current calendar system prevents this from ever occurring.<ref name=teveth10>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/asarabteves/vol1no63.html\n  |title=The Fast of the Tenth of Teves, \"Asara B'Teves\"\n  |last=Prero\n  |first=Yehuda\n  |publisher=Project Genesis\n  |accessdate=1 August 2010\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215192716/http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/asarabteves/vol1no63.html\n  |archive-date=15 December 2010\n  |url-status=live\n  }}</ref>)\n\n[[Yom Kippur]] is considered to be the most important day of the Jewish year-cycle and fasting as a means of repentance is expected of every Jewish man or woman above the age of [[bar mitzvah]] and [[bat mitzvah]] respectively. This is the only fast day mentioned in the [[Torah]] (Leviticus 23:26-32). It is so important to fast on this day, that only those who would be put in mortal danger by fasting are exempt, such as the ill or frail (endangering a life is against a core principle of Judaism). Those that do eat on this day are encouraged to eat as little as possible at a time and to avoid a full meal. For some, fasting on Yom Kippur is considered more important than the prayers of this holy day. If one fasts, even if one is at home in bed, one is considered as having participated in the full religious service.\n\nThe second major day of fasting is [[Tisha B'Av]], the day approximately 2500 years ago on which the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Babylonians destroyed the first Holy Temple in Jerusalem]], as well as on which the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Romans destroyed the second Holy Temple in Jerusalem]] about 2000 years ago, and later after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] when the Jews were banished from Jerusalem, the day of Tisha B'Av was the one allowed exception. Tisha B'Av ends a [[The Three Weeks|three-week mourning period]] beginning with the fast of the [[17th of Tammuz]]. This is also the day when observant Jews remember the many tragedies which have befallen the Jewish people, including the [[Holocaust]].\n\n[[Tisha B'Av]] and [[Yom Kippur]] are the major fasts and are observed from sunset to the following day's dusk. The remaining four fasts are considered minor. Fasting is only observed from sunrise to dusk, and there is more leniency if the fast represents too much of a hardship to a sick or weak person, or pregnant or nursing woman.\n\nThe four public but minor fast days are:\n* The [[Fast of Gedaliah]] on the day after [[Rosh Hashanah]]\n* The Fast of the [[Tenth of Tevet|10th of Tevet]]\n* The Fast of the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz|17th of Tammuz]]\n* The [[Fast of Esther]], which takes place immediately before [[Purim]]\n\nThere are other minor customary fast days, but these are not universally observed, and they include:\n* \"Bahab,\" (literally an acronym for \"Monday, Thursday, Monday\") the first two Mondays and first Thursday of the months [[Cheshvan]] and [[Iyar]] (postponed by a week if Monday is the first of the month.)\n* \"Yom Kippur Katan,\" (literally \"Little Yom Kippur\") the day before every [[Rosh Chodesh]], moved back to Thursday if that day is Saturday\n* The [[Fast of the Firstborn]], on the day before [[Passover]], which applies only to first-born sons; this obligation is usually avoided by participating in a ''[[siyum]]'' and [[Seudat mitzvah|ritual meal]] that takes precedence over fasting.\n\nIt is an [[Ashkenazic]] tradition for a bride and groom to fast on their wedding day before the ceremony as the day represents a personal Yom Kippur.  In some congregations, repentance prayers that are said on Yom Kippur service are included by the bride and groom in their private prayers before the wedding ceremony.\n\nAside from these official days of fasting, Jews may take upon themselves personal or communal fasts, often to seek repentance in the face of tragedy or some impending calamity. For example, a fast is sometimes observed if a [[sefer torah]] is dropped.  The length of the fast varies, and some Jews will reduce the length of the fast through [[tzedakah]], or charitable acts. Mondays and Thursdays are considered especially auspicious days for fasting. Traditionally, one also fasted upon awakening from an unexpected bad dream although this tradition is rarely kept nowadays.\n\nIn the time of the Talmud, drought seems to have been a particularly frequent inspiration for fasts. In modern times as well the [[Israeli Chief Rabbinate]] has occasionally declared fasts in periods of drought.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n[[Sikhism]] does not promote fasting except for medical reasons. The [[Sikh Gurus]] discourage the devotee from engaging in this [[ritual]] as it \"brings no spiritual benefit to the person\". The [[Sikh]] holy Scripture, [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] tell us: ''\"Fasting, daily rituals, and austere self-discipline \u2013 those who keep the practice of these, are rewarded with less than a shell.\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ang 216).\n\nIf you keep fast, then do it a way so that you adopt the compassion, well being and ask for good will of everyone.\n''\"Let your mind be content, and be kind to all beings. In this way, your fast will be successful.\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji, Ang 299)\n\nServe God who alone is your Savior instead indulge into ritual, he is only one who will save you every where:\n''\"I do not keep fasts, nor do I observe the month of Ramadaan. I serve only the One, who will protect me in the end. ||1||\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji, Ang 1136)\n\nIf you keep fast, to count everyday pledge yourself you will act honest, sincere, controls your desires, mediate. This is a way how you make yourself free of five thieves:\n''\"On the ninth day(naomi) of the month, make a vow to speak the Truth, and your sexual desire, anger and desire shall be eaten up. On the tenth day, regulate your ten doors; on the eleventh day, know that the Lord is One. On the twelfth day, the five thieves are subdued, and then, O Nanak, the mind is pleased and appeased. Observe such a fast as this, O Pandit, O religious scholar; of what use are all the other teachings? ||2||\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji, Ang 1245)\n\nGoal of Human is to meet the Lord-groom, so Guru Sahib Ji says:\n''\"One who discards this grain, is practicing hypocrisy. She is neither a happy soul-bride, nor a widow. Those who claim in this world that they live on milk alone, secretly eat whole loads of food. ||3|| Without this grain, time does not pass in peace. Forsaking this grain, one does not meet the Lord of the World.\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji, Ang 873)\n\n''\"Fasting on Ekadashi, adoration of Thakurs (stones) one remains away from Hari engaged in the Maya and omens. Without the Guru's word in the company of Saints one does not get refuge no matter how good one looks.\"'' ([[Bhai Gurdas]] Ji, Vaar 7)\n\n=== Taoism ===\n{{Main|Bigu (grain avoidance)}}\nThe ''bigu'' (\u8f9f\u8c37 \"avoiding grains\") fasting practice originated as a [[Daoist]] technique for becoming a ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' (\u4ed9 \"transcendent; immortal\"), and later became a [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] cure for the ''sanshi'' (\u4e09\u5c38 \"[[Three Corpses]]; the malevolent, life-shortening spirits that supposedly reside in the human body\"). Chinese interpretations of avoiding ''gu'' \"grains; cereals\" have varied historically; meanings range from not eating particular foodstuffs such as [[food grain]], [[Five Cereals (China)]], or [[staple food]] to not eating anything such as [[inedia]], [[breatharianism]], or [[aerophagia]].\n\n=== Yoga ===\nIn [[Yoga]] principle, it is recommended that one maintains a spiritual fast on a particular day each week (Monday or Thursday). A fast should also be maintained on the full moon day of each month. It is essential on the spiritual fasting day not only to abstain from meals, but also to spend the whole day with a positive, spiritual attitude. On the fasting day, intake of solid food is avoided, with water taken as needed.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n=== Japanese history ===\nJapan has used fasting as punishment for meat consumption.  Consumption of domesticated animals was banned by Emperor Tenmu in 675 A.D. from April to September due to Buddhist influences; however, wild game was exempt.<ref name=\"kikko\"/>  Nevertheless, these laws were regularly flouted.  According to the ''[[Engishiki]]'', in the [[Heian Period]], fasts began to be used as punishment for the Buddhist sin of meat consumption, initially for 3 days.  Eating meat other than seafood (defined here simply as \"meat\") was seen by Buddhist elite as a kind of spiritually corrupted practice.  By the [[Kamakura Period]], much stricter enforcement and punishments began, with an order from [[Ise Grand Shrine|Ise Shrine]] for a fast for 100 days for eating wild or domestic animals as defined above, while anyone who ate with someone who ate \"meat\" was required to fast for 21 days, and anyone who ate with someone who ate with someone who consumed \"meat\" was required to fast for 7 days.<ref name=\"kikko\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.kikkoman.co.jp/kiifc/foodculture/pdf_09/e_002_008.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429063516/http://www.kikkoman.co.jp/kiifc/foodculture/pdf_09/e_002_008.pdf |archive-date=29 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==In alternative medicine==\n\nAlthough practitioners of [[alternative medicine]] promote \"[[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|cleansing the body]]\" through fasting,<ref name=Hunger>{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Sharman Apt|last2=Russell|first2=Sharman|title=Hunger: An Unnatural History|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0786722396|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XT2WzJuNPZ8C&pg=PT35|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en|date=1 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031142/https://books.google.de/books?id=XT2WzJuNPZ8C&pg=PT35|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> the concept is [[quackery]] with no scientific basis for its rationale or efficacy.<ref name=bda>{{cite web |url=https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/detoxdiets.pdf |publisher=British Dietetic Association |title=Detox diets |date=May 2016 |last=Porter |first=Sian |quote=The whole idea of detox is nonsense.

In a [[physiology|physiological]] context, fasting may refer to the [[metabolism|metabolic]] status of a person who has not eaten overnight, or to the metabolic state achieved after complete [[digestion]] and absorption of a meal. Several metabolic adjustments occur during fasting. Some [[diagnostic test]]s are used to determine a fasting state. For example, a person is assumed to be fasting once 8\u201312 hours have elapsed since the last meal. Metabolic changes of the fasting state begin after absorption of a meal (typically 3\u20135 hours after eating).\n\nA [[diagnostic fast]] refers to prolonged fasting from 1 to 100 hours (depending on age) conducted under observation to facilitate the investigation of a health complication, usually [[hypoglycemia]]. Many people may also fast as part of a medical procedure or a check-up, such as preceding a [[colonoscopy]] or [[surgery]].

Eating solid food between meals is not permitted. Fasting is required of the faithful between the ages of 18 and 59 on specified days. Complete abstinence of [[meat]] for the day is required of those 14 and older. Partial [[abstinence]] prescribes that meat be taken only once during the course of the day. Meat is understood not to include fish or cold-blooded animals.\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] had initially relaxed some of the regulations concerning fasting in 1956.  In 1966, [[Pope Paul VI]] in his apostolic constitution ''[[Paenitemini]]'', changed the strictly regulated Catholic fasting requirements. He recommended that fasting be appropriate to the local economic situation, and that all Catholics voluntarily fast and abstain. In the United States, there are only two obligatory days of fast \u2013 Ash Wednesday and [[Good Friday]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year/lent/catholic-information-on-lenten-fast-and-abstinence.cfm |title = Fast & Abstinence}}</ref>. The Fridays of Lent are days of abstinence: eating meat is not allowed. Pastoral teachings since 1966 have urged voluntary fasting during Lent and voluntary abstinence on the other Fridays of the year.  The regulations concerning such activities do not apply when the ability to work or the health of a person would be negatively affected.\n\nPrior to the changes made by Pius XII and Paul VI, fasting and abstinence were more strictly regulated. The church had prescribed that Catholics observe fasting or abstinence on a number of days throughout the year.\n\nIn addition to the fasts mentioned above, Catholics must also observe the [[Eucharistic discipline|Eucharistic Fast]], which involves taking nothing but water and medicines into the body for one hour before receiving the Eucharist. The ancient practice was to fast from midnight until Mass that day, but as Masses after noon and in the evening became common, this was soon modified to fasting for three hours.  Current law requires merely one hour of eucharistic fast, although some Catholics still abide by the older rules.\n\nColloquially, fasting, abstinence, the Eucharistic Fast, and personal sacrificial disciplines such as [[abnegation]] of sweets for Lent are altogether referred to as fasting.\n\nThe Catholic Church has also promoted a [[Black Fast]], in which in addition to water, bread is consumed. Typically, this form of fasting was used only by monks and other religious individuals who practice mortifications and asceticism, but all Catholics are invited to take part in it with the advice and consent of their spiritual director.\n\n==== Anglicanism ====\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]] prescribes certain days as days for fasting and abstinence, \"consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday)\":<ref name=\"Buchanan2006\">{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Colin|title=Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism|date=27 February 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6506-8|page=182|quote=In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, there is a list of \"Days of Fasting, or Abstinence,\" consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday).}}<!--|accessdate=7 June 2015--></ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n'''A Table of the Vigils, Fasts, and Days of Abstinence, to be Observed in the Year.'''\n:The eves ([[vigil]]s) before:\n::The [[Christmas|Nativity of our Lord]].\n::The [[Ritual purification|Purification]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n::The [[Annunciation]] of the Blessed Virgin.\n::[[Easter]] Day.\n::[[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] Day.\n::[[Pentecost]].\n::[[St. Matthias]].\n::[[John the Baptist|St. John Baptist]].\n::[[St. Peter]].\n::[[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]].\n::[[St. Bartholomew]].\n::[[Saint Matthew|St. Matthew]].\n::[[St. Simon]] and [[St. Jude]].\n::[[St. Andrew]].\n::[[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]].\n::[[All Saints' Day]].\n:Note: if any of these Feast-Days fall upon a Monday, then the Vigil or Fast-Day shall be kept upon the Saturday, and not upon the Sunday next before it.\n:Days of Fasting, or Abstinence.\n::I.

One traditional expression of abstinence is to avoid meat on Fridays in Lent or through the entire year, except in the seasons of Christmas and Easter. It is common to undertake some particular act of abstinence during the entire season of Lent. This self-discipline may be helpful at other times, as an act of solidarity with those who are in need or as a bodily expression of prayer.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor=Daniel Cobb, Derek Olsen|title=Saint Augustine's Prayer Book|pages=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nIn the process of revising the [[Book of Common Prayer]] in various provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]] the specification of abstinence or fast for certain days has been retained. Generally Lent and Fridays are set aside, though Fridays during Christmastide and Eastertide are sometimes avoided. Often the [[Ember Days]] or [[Rogation Days]] are also specified, and the eves (vigils) of certain feasts.\n\nIn addition to these days of fasting, Anglicans also observe the [[Eucharistic discipline|Eucharistic Fast]]. Saint Augustine's Prayer Book states that the Eucharistic Fast is a \"strict fast from both food and drink from midnight\" that is done in \"in order to receive the Blessed Sacrament as the first food of the day\" in \"homage to our Lord\".<ref name=\"Gavitt1991\"/> It implores Anglicans to fast for some hours before the [[Midnight Mass]] of [[Christmas Eve]], the first liturgy of [[Christmastide]].<ref name=\"Gavitt1991\"/>\n\n==== Eastern Orthodoxy ====\nFor [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, fasting is an important spiritual discipline, found in both the Old Testament and the New, and is tied to the principle in [[Orthodox theology]] of the [[synergy]] between the [[Human body|body]] (Greek: ''soma'') and the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (''pneuma''). That is to say, Orthodox Christians do not see a dichotomy between the body and the soul but rather consider them as a united whole, and they believe that what happens to one affects the other (this is known as the ''psychosomatic union'' between the body and the soul).<ref name=\"LT\" /><ref name=\"TOC\" /> Saint [[Gregory Palamas]] argued that man's body is not an enemy but a partner and collaborator with the soul.

John Wesley, for example, believed that the prudentials of early Methodism were so necessary to guard its principles that to lose the first would be also to lose the second. His immediate followers should have listened to his caution, as should we.

All churches require fasting before one receives [[Holy Communion]]. All churches practice fasting on most Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year as well as observing many other days. Monks and nuns also observe additional fast days not required of the laity.\n\nThe [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] (with the exception of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem) has followed the [[Gregorian Calendar]] since 1923, making it and the Finnish Orthodox church the only Orthodox churches to primarily celebrate [[Easter]] on the same date as [[Western Christianity]]. As a result, the Armenian church's observation of [[Lent]] generally begins and ends before that of other Orthodox churches.\n\n{{Main|Coptic abstinence}}\nWith the exception of the fifty days following [[Easter]] in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], fish is not allowed during [[Lent]], or on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Paramon days. Other than that fish and shellfish are allowed during fasting days.\n\nThe discipline of fasting entails that, apart from Saturdays, Sundays, and holy feasts, one should keep a total fast from all food and drink from midnight the night before to a certain time in the day usually three o'clock in the afternoon (the hour [[Jesus]] died on the Cross). Also, it is preferred that one reduce one's daily intake of food, typically by eating only one full meal a day.\n\nThe [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] generally follows the fasting practices of the Coptic Church however in some cases it follows the Ethiopian Church.\n\nThe [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has an especially rigorous fasting calendar.\n\nFasting in the Ethiopian Church implies abstention from food and drink. No animal products are consumed, including dairy, eggs and meat, and utensils that have touched such products must be washed before touching the strictly vegan foods that are consumed on fast days.  During fast periods, Holy Liturgy (Mass) is held at noon (except on Saturdays and Sundays), and because no food can be consumed before communion, it is traditional for people to abstain from food until mass is over (around 2 to 3 in the afternoon). Every Wednesday and Friday are days of fasting because Wednesday is the day that the Lord was condemned and Friday is the day he was crucified (the Wednesdays and Fridays between Easter Sunday and Pentecost Sunday are an exception as well as when Christmas or Epiphany fall on a Wednesday or a Friday). The fasts that are ordained in the canon of the Church of Ethiopia are:\n\n*1. Lent including Holy Week and the 10-day Fast of the Cross proclaimed by Byzantine Emperor Hereaclus (known as Hudadi, Abiye Tsom or Tsome Eyesus), 56 days.\n*2. Fast of the Apostles, 10\u201340 days, which the Apostles kept after they had received the Holy Spirit. It begins after Pentecost (known as Tsome Hwariat).\n*3. The fast of Assumption of the Holy Virgin, 16 days in August (known as Tsome Filseta).\n*4. Christmas Eve (Gahad ze Lidet) and The Eve of Epiphany, (Gahad ze Timket).\n*5. Advent, 40 days (Known as Tsome Gena that begin with \"Sibket\" on 15th Hedar and ends on Christmas Eve).\n*6. The [[fast of Nineveh]], commemorating the preaching of Jonah. (On the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the third week before Lent.\n*7. All Wednesdays and Fridays of the year except the ones that fall between Easter Sunday and Pentecost Sunday.\n\nIn addition to these, there is the fast of repentance which a person keeps after committing sin, it being imposed as a penance by the priest for seven days, forty days or one year. There is also a fast which a bishop keeps at the time he is consecrated. Also there are fasts that are widely observed but which have not been included in the canon of the church and which are therefore considered strictly optional such as the \"Tsige Tsom\" or Spring Fast, also known as \"Kweskwam Tsom\" which marks the exile of the Holy Family in Egypt.\n\nAll persons above the age of 13 are expected to observe the church fasts.  Most children over age seven are expected to observe at least the Fast of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin. Dispensations are granted to those who are ill.\n\nThe total number of fasting days amounts to about 250 a year.  While many observe the Coptic Church's allowance for fish during the longer fasts, it has increasingly become practice in the Ethiopian Church to abstain from fish during all fasts according to the canons of the Ethiopian Church.\n\nThe observation of [[Lent]] within the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] was once very strict but now is comparatively lenient compared with how it is observed in other Orthodox Churches.\n\n==== Church of the East ====\n\nThe [[Assyrian Church of the East]] practices fasting during [[Lent]], the seven weeks prior to [[Easter]], wherein the faithful abstain from eating eggs, meat and any dairy or animal products. This is preceded by Somikka night.\n\nThe Church of the East strictly observes the Nineveh Fast (Som Baoutha). This annual observance occurs exactly three weeks before the start of Lent. This tradition has been practised by all Christians of Syriac traditions since the 6th century. At that time, a plague afflicted the region of Nineveh, modern-day northern Iraq. The plague devastated the city and the villages surrounding it, and out of desperation the people ran to their [[bishop]] to find a solution. The bishop sought help through the [[Scriptures]] and came upon the story of [[Jonah]] in the [[Old Testament]]. Upon reading the story, the bishop ordered a three-day fast to ask God for forgiveness. At the end of the three days, the plague had miraculously stopped, so on the fourth day the people rejoiced.\n\n==== Lutheran ====\n[[Martin Luther]], the Protestant [[Reformation|Reformer]], held that fasting served to \"kill and subdue the pride and lust of the flesh\".<ref name=\"Gentilcore2015\">{{cite book|last=Gentilcore|first=David|title=Food and Health in Early Modern Europe: Diet, Medicine and Society, 1450-1800|date=19 November 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781472528421|page=125}}</ref> As such, the Lutheran churches often emphasized voluntary fasting over collective fasting, though certain liturgical seasons and holy days were times for communal fasting and abstinence.<ref>Albala, Ken. 2003.

Although Pentecostalism has not classified different types of fasting, certain writers within the movement have done so. Arthur Wallis writes about the \"Normal Fast\" in which pure water alone is consumed.<ref name=\"Wallis, Arthur 1986\">Wallis, Arthur, God's Chosen Fast, Christian Literature Crusade (June 1986)</ref>  The \"Black Fast\" in which nothing, not even water, is consumed is also mentioned. Dr. Curtis Ward points out that undertaking a black fast beyond three days may lead to dehydration, may irreparably damage the kidneys, and result in possible death.<ref>Johnson, William, The Fasting Movement, Bethesda Books, 2003</ref> He further notes that nowhere in the New Testament is it recorded that anyone ever undertook a black fast beyond three days and that one should follow this biblical guideline. In addition to the normal fast and black fast, some undertake what is referred to as the Daniel Fast (or Partial Fast) in which only one type of food (e.g., fruit or fruit and non-starchy vegetables) is consumed.<ref name=\"Wallis, Arthur 1986\" />  In a Daniel Fast, meat is almost always avoided, in following the example of Daniel and his friends' refusal to eat the meat of Gentiles, which had been offered to idols and not slaughtered in a kosher manner. In some circles of Pentecostals, the term \"fast\" is simply used, and the decision to drink water is determined on an individual basis.\n\n==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====\n{{See also|Fast Sunday}}\nFor members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], fasting is total abstinence from food and drink accompanied by prayer.  Members are encouraged to fast on the first Sunday of each month, designated as [[Fast Sunday]]. During Fast Sunday, members fast for two consecutive meals (24 hours); this is usually Sunday breakfast and lunch, thus the fasting occurs between the evening meal on Saturday and the evening meal on Sunday. The money saved by not having to purchase and prepare meals is donated to the church as a [[fast offering]], which is then used to help people in need.<ref>{{cite web|author=Riley M.

Individuals observe different kinds of fasts based on personal beliefs and local customs. Some are listed below:\n* Some Hindus fast on certain days of the month such as [[Ekadasi]], [[Pradosha vrata|Pradosha]], or [[Pornima|Purnima]].\n* Certain days of the week are also set aside for fasting depending on personal belief and favorite deity. For example, devotees of [[Shiva]] tend to fast on Mondays, while devotees of [[Vishnu]] tend to fast on Thursdays and devotees of [[Ayyappa]] tend to fast on Saturdays.\n* Tuesday fasting is common in southern India as well as northwestern India. In the south, it is believed that Tuesday is dedicated to Goddess [[Mariamman]], a form of Goddess [[Shakti]]. Devotees eat before sunrise and drink only liquids between sunrise and sunset. Only liquids between a prescribed period, like water fasting, is half fasting. In the North, Tuesday is dedicated to Lord [[Hanuman]] and devotees are allowed only to consume milk and fruit between sunrise and sunset.\n* Thursday fasting is common among the [[Hindu]]s of northern [[India]]. On Thursdays, devotees listen to a [[narrative|story]] before opening their fast. On the Thursday fasters also worship Vrihaspati Mahadeva. They wear yellow clothes, and meals with yellow colour are preferred. Women worship the [[banana]] tree and water it. Food items are made with yellow-coloured [[ghee]]. Thursday is also dedicated to [[Guru]] and many Hindus who follow a guru will fast on this day.\n* Fasting during religious festivals is also very common. Common examples are [[Maha Shivaratri]] (Most people conduct a strict fast on Maha Shivratri, not even consuming a drop of water ), or the nine days of [[Navratri]] (which occurs twice a year in the months of April and October/November during [[Vijayadashami]] just before [[Diwali]], as per the [[Hindu calendar]]). [[Karwa Chauth]] is a form of fasting practised in some parts of India where married women undertake a fast for the well-being, prosperity, and longevity of their husbands. The fast is broken after the wife views the moon through a sieve. In the fifth month (Shravan Maas) of the Hindu calendar, many celebrate [[Shraavana]]. During this time some will fast on the day of the week that is reserved for worship of their chosen god(s), while others will fast during the entire month.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rudraksha-ratna.com/shravan-month.html |title=Shravan Month, Shravan Maas, Sawan Mahina 2015 |publisher=Rudraksha Ratna |date= |accessdate=11 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116173638/http://www.rudraksha-ratna.com/shravan-month.html |archive-date=16 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* In the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], the month of [[Kartik (month)]], which begins with the day after Deepavali is often a period of frequent (though not necessarily continuous) fasting for some people, especially women. Common occasions for fasting during this month include Mondays for Lord Shiva, the full-moon day of Karthika and the occasion of Naagula Chaviti.\n\nMethods of fasting also vary widely and cover a broad spectrum. If followed strictly, the person fasting does not partake any food or water from the previous day's sunset until 48 minutes after the following day's sunrise. Fasting can also mean limiting oneself to one meal during the day, abstaining from eating certain food types or eating only certain food types. In any case, the fasting person is not supposed to eat or even touch any animal products (i.e., meat, eggs) except [[dairy]] products. Amongst Hindus during fasting, starchy items such as [[Potatoes]], [[Sago]] and [[Sweet potatoes]] are allowed. The other allowed food items include milk products, peanuts and fruits. Peanuts and the starchy items mentioned above originate outside India.\n\nIn [[Shri Vidya]], one is forbidden to fast because the Devi is within them, and starving would in return starve the god. The only exception in Srividya for fasting is on the anniversary of the day one's parents died.\n\n'''[[Mahabharata]]:[[Anushasana Parva]] (Book 13)'''\n\n[[Yudhishthira]] asks [[Bhishma]], \"what constitutes the highest penances?\" Bheeshma states (in section 103) \" ....there is no penance that is superior to abstention from food!

Fasting also includes abstaining from any falsehood in speech and action, abstaining from any ignorant and indecent speech, and from arguing, fighting, and having lustful thoughts. Therefore, fasting strengthens control of impulses and helps develop good [[behavior]]. During the sacred month of Ramadan, believers strive to purify body and soul and increase their ''taqwa'' (good deeds and God-consciousness). This purification of body and soul harmonizes the inner and outer spheres of an individual. Muslims aim to improve their body by reducing food intake and maintaining a healthier lifestyle. Overindulgence in food is discouraged and eating only enough to silence the pain of hunger is encouraged. Muslims believe they should be active, tending to all their commitments and never falling short of any duty. On a moral level, believers strive to attain the most virtuous characteristics and apply them to their daily situations. They try to show compassion, generosity and mercy to others, exercise patience, and control their anger. In essence, Muslims are trying to improve what they believe to be good moral character and habits.\n\n==== Ramadan ====\nFasting is obligatory for every Muslim one month in the year, during [[Ramadan]]. Each day, the fast begins at dawn and ends at sunset. During this time Muslims are asked to remember those who are less fortunate than themselves as well as bringing them closer to God. Non obligatory fasts are two days a week as well as the middle of the month, as recommended by the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nAlthough fasting at Ramadan is ''fard'' (obligatory), exceptions are made for persons in particular circumstances:\n* Prepubescent children; though some parents will encourage their children to fast earlier for shorter periods, so the children get used to fasting.\n* Unconditional vomiting because the food leaves through an unintentional part of the gut.\n* Serious illness; the days lost to illness will have to be made up after recovery.\n* If one is traveling but one must make up any days missed upon arriving at one's destination.\n* A woman during her menstrual period; although she must count the days she missed and make them up later.\n* A woman till forty days after giving birth to child or miscarriage. But she must count the day she missed in Ramadan or they should donate the amount of a normal person's diet for each day missed to the poor or needy.\n* A woman who is pregnant or breast feeding. But she must count the day she missed in Ramadan or they should donate the amount of a normal person's diet for each day missed to the poor or needy.\n* An ill person or old person who is not physically able to fast. They should donate the amount of a normal person's diet for each day missed if they are financially capable.\n* A mentally ill person.\n* For elders who will not be able to fast, a lunch meal (or an equivalent amount of money) is to be donated to the poor or needy for each day of missed fasting.\n\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ramadan.co.uk/resources.php |title=Official Ramadan 2014 website |website=Ramadan.co.uk |date= |accessdate=11 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034220/http://www.ramadan.co.uk/resources.php |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Sunna days ====\nMuslims are suggested to do ''[[sunnah]]'' fasting on particular days:\n\n* Arafah fasting; to do fasting on the ninth of Dh\u016b al-\u1e24ijjah month for those who are not performing hajj.\n* On the first nine day of Dh\u016b al-\u1e24ijjah month.\n* Tasu'a fasting; to do fasting on the ninth of Mu\u1e25arram month to start off the next day fasting so they can differ themselves from the Christian and the Jews.\n* [[Ashura]] fasting; optional fasting on the tenth of Mu\u1e25arram month.\n* Shaww\u0101l fasting; to do fasting 6 days on any day of Shaww\u0101l month.\n* Monday-Thursday fasting; to do fasting every Monday and Thursday, except for the forbidden days.\n* Daud (David) fasting; to do fasting and not to do the fasting the next day, everyday.\n\n==== Forbidden days ====\nFasting is forbidden on these days:<ref>Ismail Kamus (1993).

Traditionally observant Jews fast six days of the year. With the exception of Yom Kippur, fasting is never permitted on [[Shabbat]], for the commandment of keeping Shabbat is biblically ordained and overrides the later rabbinically instituted fast days.  (The optional minor fast of the [[Tenth of Tevet]] could also override the Shabbat, but the current calendar system prevents this from ever occurring.<ref name=teveth10>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/asarabteves/vol1no63.html\n  |title=The Fast of the Tenth of Teves, \"Asara B'Teves\"\n  |last=Prero\n  |first=Yehuda\n  |publisher=Project Genesis\n  |accessdate=1 August 2010\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215192716/http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/asarabteves/vol1no63.html\n  |archive-date=15 December 2010\n  |url-status=live\n  }}</ref>)\n\n[[Yom Kippur]] is considered to be the most important day of the Jewish year-cycle and fasting as a means of repentance is expected of every Jewish man or woman above the age of [[bar mitzvah]] and [[bat mitzvah]] respectively. This is the only fast day mentioned in the [[Torah]] (Leviticus 23:26-32). It is so important to fast on this day, that only those who would be put in mortal danger by fasting are exempt, such as the ill or frail (endangering a life is against a core principle of Judaism). Those that do eat on this day are encouraged to eat as little as possible at a time and to avoid a full meal. For some, fasting on Yom Kippur is considered more important than the prayers of this holy day. If one fasts, even if one is at home in bed, one is considered as having participated in the full religious service.\n\nThe second major day of fasting is [[Tisha B'Av]], the day approximately 2500 years ago on which the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Babylonians destroyed the first Holy Temple in Jerusalem]], as well as on which the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Romans destroyed the second Holy Temple in Jerusalem]] about 2000 years ago, and later after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] when the Jews were banished from Jerusalem, the day of Tisha B'Av was the one allowed exception. Tisha B'Av ends a [[The Three Weeks|three-week mourning period]] beginning with the fast of the [[17th of Tammuz]]. This is also the day when observant Jews remember the many tragedies which have befallen the Jewish people, including the [[Holocaust]].\n\n[[Tisha B'Av]] and [[Yom Kippur]] are the major fasts and are observed from sunset to the following day's dusk. The remaining four fasts are considered minor. Fasting is only observed from sunrise to dusk, and there is more leniency if the fast represents too much of a hardship to a sick or weak person, or pregnant or nursing woman.\n\nThe four public but minor fast days are:\n* The [[Fast of Gedaliah]] on the day after [[Rosh Hashanah]]\n* The Fast of the [[Tenth of Tevet|10th of Tevet]]\n* The Fast of the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz|17th of Tammuz]]\n* The [[Fast of Esther]], which takes place immediately before [[Purim]]\n\nThere are other minor customary fast days, but these are not universally observed, and they include:\n* \"Bahab,\" (literally an acronym for \"Monday, Thursday, Monday\") the first two Mondays and first Thursday of the months [[Cheshvan]] and [[Iyar]] (postponed by a week if Monday is the first of the month.)\n* \"Yom Kippur Katan,\" (literally \"Little Yom Kippur\") the day before every [[Rosh Chodesh]], moved back to Thursday if that day is Saturday\n* The [[Fast of the Firstborn]], on the day before [[Passover]], which applies only to first-born sons; this obligation is usually avoided by participating in a ''[[siyum]]'' and [[Seudat mitzvah|ritual meal]] that takes precedence over fasting.\n\nIt is an [[Ashkenazic]] tradition for a bride and groom to fast on their wedding day before the ceremony as the day represents a personal Yom Kippur.  In some congregations, repentance prayers that are said on Yom Kippur service are included by the bride and groom in their private prayers before the wedding ceremony.\n\nAside from these official days of fasting, Jews may take upon themselves personal or communal fasts, often to seek repentance in the face of tragedy or some impending calamity. For example, a fast is sometimes observed if a [[sefer torah]] is dropped.  The length of the fast varies, and some Jews will reduce the length of the fast through [[tzedakah]], or charitable acts. Mondays and Thursdays are considered especially auspicious days for fasting. Traditionally, one also fasted upon awakening from an unexpected bad dream although this tradition is rarely kept nowadays.\n\nIn the time of the Talmud, drought seems to have been a particularly frequent inspiration for fasts. In modern times as well the [[Israeli Chief Rabbinate]] has occasionally declared fasts in periods of drought.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n[[Sikhism]] does not promote fasting except for medical reasons. The [[Sikh Gurus]] discourage the devotee from engaging in this [[ritual]] as it \"brings no spiritual benefit to the person\". The [[Sikh]] holy Scripture, [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] tell us: ''\"Fasting, daily rituals, and austere self-discipline \u2013 those who keep the practice of these, are rewarded with less than a shell.\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ang 216).\n\nIf you keep fast, then do it a way so that you adopt the compassion, well being and ask for good will of everyone.\n''\"Let your mind be content, and be kind to all beings. In this way, your fast will be successful.\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji, Ang 299)\n\nServe God who alone is your Savior instead indulge into ritual, he is only one who will save you every where:\n''\"I do not keep fasts, nor do I observe the month of Ramadaan. I serve only the One, who will protect me in the end. ||1||\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji, Ang 1136)\n\nIf you keep fast, to count everyday pledge yourself you will act honest, sincere, controls your desires, mediate. This is a way how you make yourself free of five thieves:\n''\"On the ninth day(naomi) of the month, make a vow to speak the Truth, and your sexual desire, anger and desire shall be eaten up. On the tenth day, regulate your ten doors; on the eleventh day, know that the Lord is One. On the twelfth day, the five thieves are subdued, and then, O Nanak, the mind is pleased and appeased. Observe such a fast as this, O Pandit, O religious scholar; of what use are all the other teachings? ||2||\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji, Ang 1245)\n\nGoal of Human is to meet the Lord-groom, so Guru Sahib Ji says:\n''\"One who discards this grain, is practicing hypocrisy. She is neither a happy soul-bride, nor a widow. Those who claim in this world that they live on milk alone, secretly eat whole loads of food. ||3|| Without this grain, time does not pass in peace. Forsaking this grain, one does not meet the Lord of the World.\"'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji, Ang 873)\n\n''\"Fasting on Ekadashi, adoration of Thakurs (stones) one remains away from Hari engaged in the Maya and omens. Without the Guru's word in the company of Saints one does not get refuge no matter how good one looks.\"'' ([[Bhai Gurdas]] Ji, Vaar 7)\n\n=== Taoism ===\n{{Main|Bigu (grain avoidance)}}\nThe ''bigu'' (\u8f9f\u8c37 \"avoiding grains\") fasting practice originated as a [[Daoist]] technique for becoming a ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' (\u4ed9 \"transcendent; immortal\"), and later became a [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] cure for the ''sanshi'' (\u4e09\u5c38 \"[[Three Corpses]]; the malevolent, life-shortening spirits that supposedly reside in the human body\"). Chinese interpretations of avoiding ''gu'' \"grains; cereals\" have varied historically; meanings range from not eating particular foodstuffs such as [[food grain]], [[Five Cereals (China)]], or [[staple food]] to not eating anything such as [[inedia]], [[breatharianism]], or [[aerophagia]].\n\n=== Yoga ===\nIn [[Yoga]] principle, it is recommended that one maintains a spiritual fast on a particular day each week (Monday or Thursday). A fast should also be maintained on the full moon day of each month. It is essential on the spiritual fasting day not only to abstain from meals, but also to spend the whole day with a positive, spiritual attitude. On the fasting day, intake of solid food is avoided, with water taken as needed.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n=== Japanese history ===\nJapan has used fasting as punishment for meat consumption.  Consumption of domesticated animals was banned by Emperor Tenmu in 675 A.D. from April to September due to Buddhist influences; however, wild game was exempt.<ref name=\"kikko\"/>  Nevertheless, these laws were regularly flouted.  According to the ''[[Engishiki]]'', in the [[Heian Period]], fasts began to be used as punishment for the Buddhist sin of meat consumption, initially for 3 days.  Eating meat other than seafood (defined here simply as \"meat\") was seen by Buddhist elite as a kind of spiritually corrupted practice.  By the [[Kamakura Period]], much stricter enforcement and punishments began, with an order from [[Ise Grand Shrine|Ise Shrine]] for a fast for 100 days for eating wild or domestic animals as defined above, while anyone who ate with someone who ate \"meat\" was required to fast for 21 days, and anyone who ate with someone who ate with someone who consumed \"meat\" was required to fast for 7 days.<ref name=\"kikko\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.kikkoman.co.jp/kiifc/foodculture/pdf_09/e_002_008.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429063516/http://www.kikkoman.co.jp/kiifc/foodculture/pdf_09/e_002_008.pdf |archive-date=29 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==In alternative medicine==\n\nAlthough practitioners of [[alternative medicine]] promote \"[[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|cleansing the body]]\" through fasting,<ref name=Hunger>{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Sharman Apt|last2=Russell|first2=Sharman|title=Hunger: An Unnatural History|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0786722396|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XT2WzJuNPZ8C&pg=PT35|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en|date=1 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031142/https://books.google.de/books?id=XT2WzJuNPZ8C&pg=PT35|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> the concept is [[quackery]] with no scientific basis for its rationale or efficacy.<ref name=bda>{{cite web |url=https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/detoxdiets.pdf |publisher=British Dietetic Association |title=Detox diets |date=May 2016 |last=Porter |first=Sian |quote=The whole idea of detox is nonsense.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.  The other consortium comprised [[IVG Immobilien|IVG]], [[Vienna Airport|Flughafen Wien AG]], Dorsch-Consult, [[Commerzbank]] and [[Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations|Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts]]. On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder.

Inspectors have uncovered many examples of poor workmanship due to a lack of proper supervision and documentation, most notably concerning the wiring. Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.<ref name=\"failures\" /> The {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire is leaking.<ref name=\"leaking\">{{cite news| url=https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/zeitung-brandschutzanlage-am-ber-undicht-091259096.html |title=Zeitung: Brandschutzanlage am BER undicht| date=18 May 2014| work=Yahoo!

The underground railway station also needed a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains might suck smoke into the station, so air flow guidance was needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport could not decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt, and the airport thus needed to join in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would conduct an intensive investigation into the construction plans.

Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers.

The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].

Marketing of the real estate began in autumn 2006 and beginning in 2009 offices, hotels, car rentals, four parking decks with a capacity of 10,000, restaurants and retail spaces were built here.\n\nTo the north is the ''BER Business Park Berlin'' with a planned area of {{convert|109|ha}} for industrial and commercial use as well as congress centers. A further ''Business Park North'' was proposed as a future use of the area of the old Sch\u00f6nefeld terminal. However, so far there are no definite plans for the future use of this area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Controversies==\nIn September 2010 [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] published aircraft arrival and departure paths for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents. This prompted a wave of protests and a lawsuit that the courts rejected.<ref name=warner>{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-749894.html| work=Der Spiegel| title=Resistance Builds to Planned Flight Paths at New Berlin Airport| date=3 November 2011| first=Mary Beth| last=Warner}}</ref>\n\nBoth the expansion of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport into BER and the quality of the connection to the railway network are the subject of public debate. The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.

On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder.

The most significant cause for the continuing delays has been the fire protection and alarm system. In the terminal building, the system was not built according to the [[construction permit]] and failed the [[Technischer \u00dcberwachungsverein|mandatory acceptance test]] necessary to open the airport. FBB proposed an interim solution employing up to 700 human fire spotters, which the building supervision department of the local [[Dahme-Spreewald]] district rejected.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joshua Hammer Reprints |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-07-23/how-berlin-s-futuristic-airport-became-a-6-billion-embarrassment |title=How Berlin's Futuristic Airport Became a $6 Billion Embarrassment |publisher=Bloomberg |date=23 July 2015}}</ref> Inspectors uncovered flaws in the wiring, programming and implementation of the highly complex system designed by [[Siemens]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]. The system automatically controls sprinklers, smoke extractors and fire doors.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> For aesthetic reasons, designers decided that the terminal would have smoke extraction ducts in its ceiling but that they would not exhaust to its rooftop.

Inspectors have uncovered many examples of poor workmanship due to a lack of proper supervision and documentation, most notably concerning the wiring. Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.<ref name=\"failures\" /> The {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire is leaking.<ref name=\"leaking\">{{cite news| url=https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/zeitung-brandschutzanlage-am-ber-undicht-091259096.html |title=Zeitung: Brandschutzanlage am BER undicht| date=18 May 2014| work=Yahoo!

In its assessment report issued on 29 July 2014, T\u00dcV found that some lightning rods were missing and that the back-up generator powering the sprinkler system did not provide adequate power.

The underground railway station also needed a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains might suck smoke into the station, so air flow guidance was needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport could not decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt, and the airport thus needed to join in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would conduct an intensive investigation into the construction plans.

They are the same company which designed the hexagonal Terminal A at Tegel Airport which opened in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} At BER the terminal sits between the two runways, creating a so-called ''midfield airport'' above the underground train station. The terminal has four public levels designated 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe [[Airport check-in|check-in area]] is located in the public area at Level 1 and houses 118 counters organised in eight clusters, called ''check-in isles''. Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers. [[Securitas (Swedish security company)|Securitas Germany]] will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 [[jet bridge]]s with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. Lufthansa and [[Air France]]/[[KLM]] will operate [[airport lounge]]s in the main pier which will also be open for passengers of the respective [[airline alliance|alliance partners]].<ref name=\"Handbuch\">{{cite book|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/DE/GeschaeftskundenUndPartner/Touristik/Handbuch_Flughafen_Berlin_Brandenburg_deutsch.pdf |title=Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg Handbuch |publisher=Berliner Flughafen-Gesellschaft mbH |accessdate=6 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417010130/http://www.berlin-airport.de/DE/GeschaeftskundenUndPartner/Touristik/Handbuch_Flughafen_Berlin_Brandenburg_deutsch.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:120513-BER-innen.JPG|thumb|The main hall of the terminal]]\nThe south pier was reserved for near-exclusive use of defunct [[Air Berlin]] and its [[Oneworld]] partners.

The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|highway 96a]] along the north side of the airport is being expanded to four lanes towards [[Potsdam]].\n\nFour car parks and a car rental centre will be completed by the opening of BER. Around 10,000 parking spaces will be available in four [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nA study released in September 2016 attested that BER will double the amount of vehicular traffic, causing frequent traffic jams on the [[Autobahn]] once the airport opens. The A100 and A113 do not have enough lanes to support the expected volume of traffic. The approach to BER was deemed insufficient for the expected traffic and will lead to heavy congestion on the highways throughout south-central Berlin.

In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents.

The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.

It was produced by some of Japan's larger studios, including [[Big West Advertising|Big West]], [[Tatsunoko Production]], [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] and [[Video and Audio Project|VAP]].\n\n''Tylor'' consists of a 26-episodes TV series directed by [[K\u014dichi Mashimo]], and a sequel [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] series of 10 episodes directed by Mashimo and Naoyuki Yoshinaga. The TV show premiered in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] between January 25, 1993 and July 19, 1993, and was broadcast across Latin America by the television network, Magic Kids. Both series were broadcast across the United States by [[AZN Television]]. ''Tylor'' is distributed across [[North America]] by [[The Right Stuf International]].\n\n[[Enterbrain]] published a 3-volume [[manga]] miniseries in 2001; the light novels hasn't been translated.\n\nA short anime series, titled {{nihongo|''The Irresponsible Galaxy\u2606Tylor''|\u7121\u8cac\u4efb\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u2606\u30bf\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc|Musekinin Gyarakush\u012b\u2606Tair\u0101}} and produced by [[Seven (animation studio)|Seven]], aired from July 11 to September 26, 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a distant, highly technological future, Tylor, the title character, is a mysterious young man without a real purpose in life, a state of mind that is very hard to determine, and a knack for accidentally getting out of near-death situations with a childishly cavalier attitude. He sometimes does not even seem to realize when he is in danger, which is actually an asset to him on many occasions.\n\nTylor stumbles his way into the United Planets Space Force and soon gains command of a destroyer after resolving a hostage dispute and saving a retired admiral. Despite being given a decrepit and underpowered ship (the Soyokaze), thanks to brilliant strokes of luck, Tylor manages to destroy a patrol group. This is quickly followed by a sneak attack on another patrol group, performed while Tylor was playing the role of a consummate, professional soldier. The admiralty, attempting to kill Tylor, present him with a medal modified with a device to trick the Raalgon fleet into believing the Soyokaze is an entire fleet. Tylor loses the medal in UPSF HQ, and the Raalgons destroy the admiralty's super-weapon instead.\n\nThe Soyokaze is then sent to a demotion sector, despite the fervent hopes of its crew. There, Tylor and Yamamoto encounter the ghost of the former captain, who vanishes due to depression after seeing Tylor's behavior. The Admiral of the fleet, who actually drove the prior Captain to suicide, rescinds Tylor's demotion after seeing Tylor with the former captain's pipe, thinking he is now aware of the admiral's crime. Tylor is then captured by the Raalgon fleet, who plan to execute him to boost morale. After escaping his cell, Tylor encounters the Empress of the Raalgon, Azalyn, in plain dress, and spends the day entertaining her. She stops his execution, and his jailors implant microchip in his brain to control him.\n\nMeanwhile, the crew of the Soyokaze has been imprisoned by the brass. They manage to escape captivity and invade the Melva, the main Raalgon ship, to get Tylor back. During the fight, Tylor saves Azalyn from a bomb that her treacherous Prime Minister Wang had detonated to gain power for himself. Tylor is badly injured, and Azalyn tells the Raalgon that she is going with Tylor back to the Soyokaze in order to make sure he is all right. After the doctor saves Tylor, Azalyn returns to her people.\n\nTylor then rendezvouses with the main fleet, where he is branded a traitor for letting Azalyn return. He is sentenced to death by a firing squad. However, Tylor convinces the brass that he can defeat the Raalgon, and they reluctantly allow him to take complete command. After coming to a stand-off with Dom, Tylor manages to spill no blood and stop the fighting for the time being. After the death of Admiral Hanner, whom Tylor had adored and talked with, Tylor becomes sullen and announces he will leave the military. Lieutenant Yamamoto is given command of the brand new ship, the Aso. In the final episode, the former crew of the Soyokaze, who are supposed to be on the Aso, join Tylor on the Soyokaze as they fly out into space.\n\nThe two major powers in the story are the UPSF (United Planets Space Force) and the Raalgon Empire (the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]), who resemble humans with pointy ears and unusual haircolor).\n\nOne of the largest points of dispute in the story is the competence of Tylor. Several characters say of Tylor, \"I can't decide if he's an idiot or a genius.\" Whether he is a genius or an idiot is up to viewers.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to ''[[The Anime Encyclopedia]]'' by [[Jonathan Clements]] and [[Helen McCarthy]]: \"The character [Tylor] is a cartoon version of Hitoshi Taira, the lazy protagonist of the 1962 live-action movie ''Japan's Irresponsible Age'' who was played by comedian [[Hitoshi Ueki]]. This popular [[satire]] on Japan's salaryman culture featured a feckless individual who always managed to come out on top, advancing up promotional ladders when accidents befall his superiors or lucking into important business information simply by malingering and goofing off. The series and its theatrical spin-offs were revived in 1990, suspiciously close to the time when ''[[Idol Defense Force Hummingbird|Hummingbirds]]''-creator Hitoshi Yoshioka would have begun work on this anime version.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Clements|author2=McCarthy, Helen |authorlink2=Helen McCarthy |title=''[[The Anime Encyclopedia]]''|publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]]|edition=2nd expanded|location=[[Berkeley, California]]|year=2006|page=305|isbn=1-84576-500-1}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Irresponsible Captain Tylor characters}}\n[[File:Captain Tylor Soyokaze crew.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The main crew of the Soyokaze.

Tylor, age 20, joined the United Planets Space Force for what he hoped would be an easy life. Originally assigned to the Pension department, he unwittingly foiled a terrorist plot to kidnap and kill a retired UPSF admiral when he tried to deliver a late check by hand. For saving the war hero's life, Tylor was promoted to Major and placed in command of the destroyer Soyokaze (the UPSF dumping ground for trouble makers and the unwanted). Tylor has, as his superiors have put it, 'The Devil's own luck' and usually can get out of any situation relatively unscathed, avoiding multiple assassination attempts and defeating enemy groups of vastly superior numbers. He is very laid back and does not really care for the rules, using his authority as captain to change whatever regulations seem too uptight for him. He is also easily led by his crew, who are able to convince him to allow them to wear comfortable clothes on watch, hold a swimsuit competition, and let the surgeon drink while on duty. The UPSF and the Raalgon Empire are constantly debating whether Tylor possesses the most brilliant military mind or whether he is just a lucky moron.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dji Tsujitani]]|[[Crispin Freeman]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Major Yuriko Star'''|\u30e6\u30ea\u30b3\u30fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5c11\u4f50|Yuriko Sut\u0101-sh\u014dsa}} is a very strait-laced, by-the-book officer. Yuriko joined the UPSF to give her life structure and attempts to obey the rules in almost every situation. However, she, unlike Yamamoto, has no problem telling Tylor that he has done something wrong and will even resort to slapping him when he gets too far out of line. Yuriko also tries to downplay her gender, making herself a soldier first, and then a woman. This is a sore subject for her when someone comments about Tylor's obvious attraction to her looks, pointing out that she has never used her appearance to get ahead; an equally sore point for her is her budding attraction to him. Yuriko is one of the most rational and level-headed officers on the Soyokaze. While she is senior to Yamamoto, her speciality as an intelligence officer places her outside the chain of command.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[Yuri Amano]]|[[Rachael Lillis]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Lieutenant Makoto Yamamoto'''|\u30de\u30b3\u30c8\u30fb\u30e4\u30de\u30e2\u30c8\u5927\u5c09|Makoto Yamamoto-ta\u012b}} is another very strait-laced, by-the-books military man. Yamamoto is the first officer on the Soyokaze and tried mightily to interject an air of professionalism to the outfit. Constantly enraged by Tylor's lack of discipline and his loose command of the troops, Yamamoto spends much of his free time in the medic's office taking tranquilizers and making use of the neuro-cleanser. Yamamoto sees Tylor for what he is, a bumbling fool, but is torn between the unwritten soldier's code of supporting and obeying your superior officer, and telling the UPSF brass what is REALLY going on. He is always on the lookout for a chance to get some form of command, hoping to get a ship of his own one day.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[Sh\u014d Hayami]]|[[David Brimmer]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Azalyn''' |\u30a2\u30b6\u30ea\u30f3|Azarin}} is the 16-year-old empress of the Holy Raalgon Empire. Azalyn is a child, forced into the unenviable situation of having to assume power of the empire once her parents are murdered. Prompted by her advisors, she gives the command to attack the UPSF (under the assumption that they were behind the assassination plot). Having not had a chance to be a child, Azalyn must now be strong for the entire empire, and it's a task that she is afraid of taking, but even more afraid of failing in.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[Hiroko Kasahara]]|[[Lisa Ortiz]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Captain Ru Baraba Dom'''|\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30e9\u30d0\u30fb\u30c9\u30e0|Ru Baraba Domu}} is the commander of one of the Raalgon fleets. He speaks candidly with the Empress, in stark contrast to the bowing and scraping and lying of the rest of her court. Dom gains Azalyn's trust and becomes one of her more valued advisors. Dom is also very interested in Tylor, feeling that Tylor would be not only a worthy adversary, but also a challenge for anyone to decipher and defeat. It is Dom who assigned Harumi to spy on the Soyokaze's enigmatic captain, but even with the constant data coming in from his valued spy, Dom is still unsure whether Tylor really knows what he is doing or if he is just a fool.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[Toshihiko Seki]]|Josh Mosby}}\n\n==Light novels==\n''The Irresponsible Captain Tylor'' is adapted from the series of light novels ''The Most Irresponsible Man in Space'' by Hitoshi Yoshioka and published under [[Fujimi Shobo]]'s [[Fujimi Fantasia Bunko]] label.

It was produced by some of Japan's larger studios, including [[Big West Advertising|Big West]], [[Tatsunoko Production]], [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] and [[Video and Audio Project|VAP]].\n\n''Tylor'' consists of a 26-episodes TV series directed by [[K\u014dichi Mashimo]], and a sequel [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] series of 10 episodes directed by Mashimo and Naoyuki Yoshinaga. The TV show premiered in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] between January 25, 1993 and July 19, 1993, and was broadcast across Latin America by the television network, Magic Kids. Both series were broadcast across the United States by [[AZN Television]]. ''Tylor'' is distributed across [[North America]] by [[The Right Stuf International]].\n\n[[Enterbrain]] published a 3-volume [[manga]] miniseries in 2001; the light novels hasn't been translated.\n\nA short anime series, titled {{nihongo|''The Irresponsible Galaxy\u2606Tylor''|\u7121\u8cac\u4efb\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u2606\u30bf\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc|Musekinin Gyarakush\u012b\u2606Tair\u0101}} and produced by [[Seven (animation studio)|Seven]], aired from July 11 to September 26, 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a distant, highly technological future, Tylor, the title character, is a mysterious young man without a real purpose in life, a state of mind that is very hard to determine, and a knack for accidentally getting out of near-death situations with a childishly cavalier attitude. He sometimes does not even seem to realize when he is in danger, which is actually an asset to him on many occasions.\n\nTylor stumbles his way into the United Planets Space Force and soon gains command of a destroyer after resolving a hostage dispute and saving a retired admiral. Despite being given a decrepit and underpowered ship (the Soyokaze), thanks to brilliant strokes of luck, Tylor manages to destroy a patrol group. This is quickly followed by a sneak attack on another patrol group, performed while Tylor was playing the role of a consummate, professional soldier. The admiralty, attempting to kill Tylor, present him with a medal modified with a device to trick the Raalgon fleet into believing the Soyokaze is an entire fleet. Tylor loses the medal in UPSF HQ, and the Raalgons destroy the admiralty's super-weapon instead.\n\nThe Soyokaze is then sent to a demotion sector, despite the fervent hopes of its crew. There, Tylor and Yamamoto encounter the ghost of the former captain, who vanishes due to depression after seeing Tylor's behavior. The Admiral of the fleet, who actually drove the prior Captain to suicide, rescinds Tylor's demotion after seeing Tylor with the former captain's pipe, thinking he is now aware of the admiral's crime. Tylor is then captured by the Raalgon fleet, who plan to execute him to boost morale. After escaping his cell, Tylor encounters the Empress of the Raalgon, Azalyn, in plain dress, and spends the day entertaining her. She stops his execution, and his jailors implant microchip in his brain to control him.\n\nMeanwhile, the crew of the Soyokaze has been imprisoned by the brass. They manage to escape captivity and invade the Melva, the main Raalgon ship, to get Tylor back. During the fight, Tylor saves Azalyn from a bomb that her treacherous Prime Minister Wang had detonated to gain power for himself. Tylor is badly injured, and Azalyn tells the Raalgon that she is going with Tylor back to the Soyokaze in order to make sure he is all right. After the doctor saves Tylor, Azalyn returns to her people.\n\nTylor then rendezvouses with the main fleet, where he is branded a traitor for letting Azalyn return. He is sentenced to death by a firing squad. However, Tylor convinces the brass that he can defeat the Raalgon, and they reluctantly allow him to take complete command. After coming to a stand-off with Dom, Tylor manages to spill no blood and stop the fighting for the time being. After the death of Admiral Hanner, whom Tylor had adored and talked with, Tylor becomes sullen and announces he will leave the military. Lieutenant Yamamoto is given command of the brand new ship, the Aso. In the final episode, the former crew of the Soyokaze, who are supposed to be on the Aso, join Tylor on the Soyokaze as they fly out into space.\n\nThe two major powers in the story are the UPSF (United Planets Space Force) and the Raalgon Empire (the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]), who resemble humans with pointy ears and unusual haircolor).\n\nOne of the largest points of dispute in the story is the competence of Tylor. Several characters say of Tylor, \"I can't decide if he's an idiot or a genius.\" Whether he is a genius or an idiot is up to viewers.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to ''[[The Anime Encyclopedia]]'' by [[Jonathan Clements]] and [[Helen McCarthy]]: \"The character [Tylor] is a cartoon version of Hitoshi Taira, the lazy protagonist of the 1962 live-action movie ''Japan's Irresponsible Age'' who was played by comedian [[Hitoshi Ueki]]. This popular [[satire]] on Japan's salaryman culture featured a feckless individual who always managed to come out on top, advancing up promotional ladders when accidents befall his superiors or lucking into important business information simply by malingering and goofing off. The series and its theatrical spin-offs were revived in 1990, suspiciously close to the time when ''[[Idol Defense Force Hummingbird|Hummingbirds]]''-creator Hitoshi Yoshioka would have begun work on this anime version.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Clements|author2=McCarthy, Helen |authorlink2=Helen McCarthy |title=''[[The Anime Encyclopedia]]''|publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]]|edition=2nd expanded|location=[[Berkeley, California]]|year=2006|page=305|isbn=1-84576-500-1}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Irresponsible Captain Tylor characters}}\n[[File:Captain Tylor Soyokaze crew.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The main crew of the Soyokaze.

Tylor, age 20, joined the United Planets Space Force for what he hoped would be an easy life. Originally assigned to the Pension department, he unwittingly foiled a terrorist plot to kidnap and kill a retired UPSF admiral when he tried to deliver a late check by hand. For saving the war hero's life, Tylor was promoted to Major and placed in command of the destroyer Soyokaze (the UPSF dumping ground for trouble makers and the unwanted). Tylor has, as his superiors have put it, 'The Devil's own luck' and usually can get out of any situation relatively unscathed, avoiding multiple assassination attempts and defeating enemy groups of vastly superior numbers. He is very laid back and does not really care for the rules, using his authority as captain to change whatever regulations seem too uptight for him. He is also easily led by his crew, who are able to convince him to allow them to wear comfortable clothes on watch, hold a swimsuit competition, and let the surgeon drink while on duty. The UPSF and the Raalgon Empire are constantly debating whether Tylor possesses the most brilliant military mind or whether he is just a lucky moron.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dji Tsujitani]]|[[Crispin Freeman]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Major Yuriko Star'''|\u30e6\u30ea\u30b3\u30fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5c11\u4f50|Yuriko Sut\u0101-sh\u014dsa}} is a very strait-laced, by-the-book officer. Yuriko joined the UPSF to give her life structure and attempts to obey the rules in almost every situation. However, she, unlike Yamamoto, has no problem telling Tylor that he has done something wrong and will even resort to slapping him when he gets too far out of line. Yuriko also tries to downplay her gender, making herself a soldier first, and then a woman. This is a sore subject for her when someone comments about Tylor's obvious attraction to her looks, pointing out that she has never used her appearance to get ahead; an equally sore point for her is her budding attraction to him. Yuriko is one of the most rational and level-headed officers on the Soyokaze. While she is senior to Yamamoto, her speciality as an intelligence officer places her outside the chain of command.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[Yuri Amano]]|[[Rachael Lillis]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Lieutenant Makoto Yamamoto'''|\u30de\u30b3\u30c8\u30fb\u30e4\u30de\u30e2\u30c8\u5927\u5c09|Makoto Yamamoto-ta\u012b}} is another very strait-laced, by-the-books military man. Yamamoto is the first officer on the Soyokaze and tried mightily to interject an air of professionalism to the outfit. Constantly enraged by Tylor's lack of discipline and his loose command of the troops, Yamamoto spends much of his free time in the medic's office taking tranquilizers and making use of the neuro-cleanser. Yamamoto sees Tylor for what he is, a bumbling fool, but is torn between the unwritten soldier's code of supporting and obeying your superior officer, and telling the UPSF brass what is REALLY going on. He is always on the lookout for a chance to get some form of command, hoping to get a ship of his own one day.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[Sh\u014d Hayami]]|[[David Brimmer]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Azalyn''' |\u30a2\u30b6\u30ea\u30f3|Azarin}} is the 16-year-old empress of the Holy Raalgon Empire. Azalyn is a child, forced into the unenviable situation of having to assume power of the empire once her parents are murdered. Prompted by her advisors, she gives the command to attack the UPSF (under the assumption that they were behind the assassination plot). Having not had a chance to be a child, Azalyn must now be strong for the entire empire, and it's a task that she is afraid of taking, but even more afraid of failing in.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[Hiroko Kasahara]]|[[Lisa Ortiz]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Captain Ru Baraba Dom'''|\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30e9\u30d0\u30fb\u30c9\u30e0|Ru Baraba Domu}} is the commander of one of the Raalgon fleets. He speaks candidly with the Empress, in stark contrast to the bowing and scraping and lying of the rest of her court. Dom gains Azalyn's trust and becomes one of her more valued advisors. Dom is also very interested in Tylor, feeling that Tylor would be not only a worthy adversary, but also a challenge for anyone to decipher and defeat. It is Dom who assigned Harumi to spy on the Soyokaze's enigmatic captain, but even with the constant data coming in from his valued spy, Dom is still unsure whether Tylor really knows what he is doing or if he is just a fool.<br>\n{{Voiced by|[[Toshihiko Seki]]|Josh Mosby}}\n\n==Light novels==\n''The Irresponsible Captain Tylor'' is adapted from the series of light novels ''The Most Irresponsible Man in Space'' by Hitoshi Yoshioka and published under [[Fujimi Shobo]]'s [[Fujimi Fantasia Bunko]] label.
