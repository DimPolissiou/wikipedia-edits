Ferguson suggests that intellectual inquiry is not neatly defined within the boundaries of a single discipline, but that it is shaped out of heterogeneity. ''Aberrations in Black'' can be understood as a response to the canon and its regulation of sexual difference.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=McBride|first=Dwight|year=2007|title=Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique (Review)|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nFerguson begins his discussion with a description of a black drag queen prostitute, who serves as a fixture of urban capitalism in [[Marlon Riggs]]' ''[[Tongues Untied|Tongues United]].'' This figure is confusing in that she is multiply determined and excluded by difference in race, class, sexuality, and gender. Ferguson proposes queer of color critique as a mode of analysis for interpreting the black drag queen prostitute, and uses this figure to demonstrate the heterogeneity of social categories with in the culture and genealogy of the West.\n\nQueer of color critique emerges in ''Aberrations in Black'' as a method for challenging ideologies that work to conceal the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation. Ferguson builds on the idea in [[historical materialism]] that capital produces social formations that exceed the acceptable boundaries of gendered, racialized sexual ideals, while also critiquing the representation of these formations as pathological.<ref name=\":1\" /> He also challenges the view of identity as a goal to be achieved, drawing from [[Barbara Smith]]'s essay \u201cTowards a Black Feminist Criticism\u201d to argue that identity should be a space to negotiate social contradictions, rather than a space where differences are concealed for the sake of stability.\n\nFerguson uses the African American novel as a cite of material and discursive multiplicity that can exist outside of Western, canonical genealogies. He views African American novels as a cultural form that can deepen out understandings of gender and sexuality in African American culture. Ferguson borrows from [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''[[Sula (novel)|Sula]]'', and discusses Richard Wright\u2019s ''[[Native Son]],'' Ralph Ellison\u2019s ''[[Invisible Man]],'' and James Baldwin\u2019s ''[[Go Tell It on the Mountain (novel)|Go Tell it on the Mountain]]'' to display how the African American novel is a site of reflection compelled by struggles over gender and sexuality within the African American community.<ref name=\":1\" /> He juxtaposes these novels with sociological texts like the [[Combahee River Collective]] statement and Daniel Moynihan\u2019s ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action|The Negro Family]]'' to contextualize heteropatriarchy and oppositional movements.\n\n==== ''Native Son'' ====\nChapter 1 of ''Aberrations in Black'' juxtaposes [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s classic novel with the sociological work of [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]], who imagined assimilation and migration through heterosexual reproduction. Park believed urbanization exposed the \u201cprimary group\u201d to prostitution, homosexuality, and juvenile delinquency, equating African American neighborhoods with nonheteronormative formations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race and Culture: Essays in the Sociology of Contemporary Man|last=Park|first=Robert|publisher=The Free Press of Glencoe|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Ferguson understands Wright as responding to social disorganization as a feminizing process \"that disrupted African American gender and sexual integrity.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> Wright's use of Bigger Thomas's character, who is a feminized figure unconforming to heteropatriarchy or national ideas, was to represent the nonheteronormative dysfunction and gendered features within racial domination. Ferguson argues that working-class exploitation of Black men is demonstrated to be the source of feminization and societal dysfunction in Park and Wright's work.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== ''Invisible Man'' ====\nChapter 2 of ''Aberrations in Black'' contains a detailed description of Professor Woodridge, a character present in an unpublished chapter of [[Ralph Ellison]]'s ''[[Invisible Man]].'' To Ferguson, Woodridge represents nonconformity and opposition to the canon within the university. Ferguson juxtaposes this book with Robert Park\u2019s desire to \u201cAmericanize\u201d racial groups that threatened national unity, and Woodridge, a member of a Western university, is argued to defy what Americanization programs were supposed to correct.<ref name=\":5\" /> Ferguson demonstrates through the character of Woodridge how the queer of color can resist interpellation from categories of African American identity determined by dominant literary representations, and how other subjects can be inspired to defy the operation of these forces.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== ''Go Tell It on the Mountain'' ====\nFerguson uses James Baldwin's ''[[Go Tell It on the Mountain (novel)|Go Tell It on the Mountain]]'' as a critique of heteronormativity, discussing how the construction of Blacks as nonheteronormative impacted the psyche of African Americans in the novel. Particularly, Ferguson discusses how Baldwin uses the Grimes' family as a representation of \"pathological\" and \"dirty\" stereotypes used to describe the Harlem community.\n\n==== ''Something Else to Be'' ====\nChapter 4 of ''Aberrations in Black'' critiques the normative and oppressive discussions in sociology, the Black Power movement, and white feminist spaces. Ferguson references [[Audre Lorde]], [[Cheryl Clarke|Cheryll Clarke]], [[Barbara Smith]], as well as [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''Sula'' and utilizes these black feminists' critiques of these discourses in this chapter. He agrees with them when he argues that lesbianism counters identity politics, as well as critiquing white feminist spaces for their lack of inclusivity of black women, especially lesbians. Ferguson critiques [[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action|The Moynihan Report]] for blaming black mothers for black marginalization and pushing the narrative that the U.S. had left it\u2019s oppressive past behind as liberation movements began in developing countries and civil rights took off at home, which would situate the U.S.\u2019s rationale as policeman of the world. He also criticizes the discourses in Black Power movements that position heterosexuality and patriarchal family structures as superior, which especially excludes black lesbians and calls for more coalition building.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aberrations in Black|last=Ferguson|first=Roderick|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0816641291|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/aberrationsinbla0000ferg/page/110 110\u2013137]|url=https://archive.org/details/aberrationsinbla0000ferg/page/110}}</ref>\n\n=====''Sula''=====\nFerguson uses Toni Morrison's ''Sula'' as another example of a novel that depicts sexual nonheteronormativity, illustrating queer black critiques that attempt to displace heteropatriarchal discourse.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Saffin|first=Lori|date=|title=Disciplining Heternorms|url=|journal=Lambda Book Report|volume=|pages=}}</ref> Ferguson argues that Black lesbians such as Audre Lorde and Barbara Smith were leaders in critiquing heterosexuality and patriarchy during movements in the 1970s and 80s, utilizing ''Sula'' as a model for resistance.

He borrows from [[Michel Foucault|Michel Foucault's]] arguments in ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' about power as intentional and calculating to describe how institutions view minority movements as elements that can be coopted and incorporated into its own objectives.

Ferguson suggests that intellectual inquiry is not neatly defined within the boundaries of a single discipline, but that it is shaped out of heterogeneity. ''Aberrations in Black'' can be understood as a response to the canon and its regulation of sexual difference.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=McBride|first=Dwight|year=2007|title=Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique (Review)|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nFerguson begins his discussion with a description of a black drag queen prostitute, who serves as a fixture of urban capitalism in [[Marlon Riggs]]' ''[[Tongues Untied|Tongues United]].'' This figure is confusing in that she is multiply determined and excluded by difference in race, class, sexuality, and gender. Ferguson proposes queer of color critique as a mode of analysis for interpreting the black drag queen prostitute, and uses this figure to demonstrate the heterogeneity of social categories with in the culture and genealogy of the West.\n\nQueer of color critique emerges in ''Aberrations in Black'' as a method for challenging ideologies that work to conceal the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation.

The country also has many surviving monuments from the [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman]] period. They left their mark with the many mosques and other buildings they constructed, that contributed to make Berat and Gjirokast\u00ebr an UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th century, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by various Austro-Hungarian and Italian architects, giving them the appearance of western European cities; this can be particularly seen in [[Tirana]] and Kor\u00e7\u00eb.

Although the country occupies the southwestern portion of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], bordered by [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} to the northeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the east and [[Greece]] to the south and southeast. It has a varied and contrasting topography with high mountains, rocky shores, coastal wetlands, sandy beaches, steep canyons and gorges and islands of various shapes and sizes.\n\nIn terms of topography, the country encompasses [[coastal plain]]s in the west to the [[Albanian Alps]] in the north, the [[Sharr Mountains]] in the northeast, [[Central Mountain Range, Albania#Skanderbeg Mountains|Skanderbeg Mountains]] in the center, [[Korab|Korab Mountains]] in the east, [[Pindus Mountains]] in the southeast and [[Ceraunian Mountains]] in the southwest along the [[Albanian Riviera]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian Sea Coast]].\n\nThe country experiences mostly [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] climate with [[Continental climate|continental]] influences.<ref name=\"climate1\">{{cite web|author1=Ministry of Environment of Albania|title=Albania's Second National Communication to the Conference of Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/albnc2.pdf|website=unfccc.int|location=Tirana|page=28|language=English|author1-link=Ministry of Environment (Albania)}}</ref> That means that the climate is characterised by mild winters and hot, dry summers. The warmest areas of the country are along the west, where climate is profoundly impacted by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The coldest parts of the country are at the north and east, where snowy forested climate is prevalent.\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], Albania was originally home to the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greeks]]. Following the centuries, it was subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. The emergence of a unified Albanian state dates back to the establishment of the [[Principality of Arb\u00ebr]] in 1190 AD.\n\n== Periods ==\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe beginnings of architecture in Albania dates back to the middle [[Neolithic Age]] with the discovery of prehistoric dwellings in Dunavec and [[Maliq]].<ref name=\"neo\">{{cite web|author1=United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization|title=Archaeology and art of Albania, Ecuador, China, Bulgaria|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000748/074870eo.pdf|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|pages=4\u20136|language=English|author1-link=United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization}}</ref> They were built on a wooden platform that rested on stakes stuck vertically into the [[soil]].<ref name=\"neo\"/> Prehistoric dwellings in Albania consist of three types such as houses enclosed either completely on the ground or half underground, both found in [[Cakran]] near [[Fier]] and houses constructed above ground.\n[[File:Amphitheatre of durres albania 2016.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The [[Amphitheatre of Durr\u00ebs]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania#Tentative list|tentative list]] for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].]]\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] started to organize itself in the territory of Albania. The Illyrians were an [[ethnic group]] with distinct culture and art, while it is believed that [[Albanians]] are the descendants of the Illyrians but no enough evidence is left to get a conclusion. Cities within [[Illyria]] were mainly built on the tops of high mountains surrounded by heavily fortified walls. Further, the history of Albania has not been kind to the Illyrian architectural monuments. Few monuments from the Illyrians are still preserved such as in [[Amantia]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)|Antigonia]], [[Byllis]], [[Rozafa Castle|Scodra]], [[Lissus]] and [[Royal Tombs of Selca e Poshtme|Selca e Poshtme]].<ref>Gilkes, O., Albania An Archaeological Guide, I.B.Tauris 2012, {{ISBN|1780760698}}, p263</ref>\n\n[[File:Amphitheatre of Butrint 2009.jpg|210px|thumb|right|[[Butrint]] has been included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author1=UNESCO|title=Butrint|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/570|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English|author1-link=UNESCO}}</ref>]]\n\nFollowing the [[Illyrian Wars]], the architecture in Albania developed significantly in the 2nd century BC with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s. The conquered settlements and villages such as [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]], [[Byllis]], [[Dyrrachium]] and [[Dropull|Hadrianopolis]] were notably modernised following Roman models, with the building of a forum, roads, theatres, promenades, temples, aqueducts and other social buildings. The period also marks the construction of stadiums and thermal baths that were of social importance as places of gathering.\n\nPreviously populated by various [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Greek tribes]], [[Butrint]] became a [[protectorate]] and subsequently a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen|title=Hellenistic and Roman Butrint|publisher=Butrint Foundation, 2009|isbn=9780953555680|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nFoqAQAAMAAJ&dq=butrint+roman+architecture&q=butrint+|language=English|date=2009-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen, Richard Hodges, Sarah Leppard|title=Butrint 4: The Archaeology and Histories of an Ionian Town|publisher=Oxbow Books, 2013|isbn=9781842174623|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q3x-AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=butrint+roman+architecture#v=onepage&q=butrint%20roman%20architecture&f=false|language=English|date=2013-01-08}}</ref>  Nowadays, it demonstrates a high level of Roman urbanisation, while it is among the best preserved remains of Roman heritage in Albania.

The [[Durr\u00ebs Amphitheatre|Amphitheatre of Durr\u00ebs]], which the Romans built, was at that time the largest amphitheatre in the [[Balkan Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Albania|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides, 2015|isbn=9781841628554|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZR3XBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=dyrrachium#v=onepage&q=dyrrachium&f=false|language=English|date=2015-01-07}}</ref> It is the only Roman monument that survived up to the present.\n\nThe [[Via Egnatia]], built by [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Gnaeus Egnatius]], functioned for two millennia as a multi-purpose highway, which once connected the cities of [[Durr\u00ebs]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the west to [[Constantinople]] on the [[Marmara Sea]] in the east.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Frank Sear|title=Roman Architecture - Cornell paperbacks|publisher=Cornell University Press, 1983|isbn=9780801492457|page=270|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rkdt_p6uvw0C&pg=PA268&lpg=PA268&dq=via+engatia+architecture#v=onepage&q=via%20engatia%20architecture&f=false|language=English|year=1983}}</ref> Further, the route gave the Roman colonies of the [[Balkans]] a direct connection to Rome.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nMedieval cities in Albania are classified according to two criteria:\n\n*Cities associated with fortifications, such as Berat and Gjirokastra\n*Cities that lie in flat or steep terrains such as Tirana, Kavaja, and Elbasan.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], a variety of [[architecture style]]s developed in the form of dwelling, defence, worship and engineering structures.\nWhen the [[Roman Empire]] divided into east and west, Albania remained under the [[Eastern Roman empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. In behalf to that, the architecture was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s. Many extensive churches and monasteries were built during that period mainly in the centre and south of the country.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Agricultural University of Tirana|title=Considering Importance of Light in the PostByzantine Church in Central Albania|url=https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2013/november/8B_Considering.pdf|website=ijirset.com|language=English|author1-link=Agricultural University of Tirana}}</ref>\n\nHowever, some inherited historic structures were damaged by invading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the consolidation of the Albanian feudal principalities gave rise to ''Varosha'', or neighbourhoods outside city walls. Examples of such developments are the [[Arberesh]] principalities centred in [[Petrele]], [[Kruje]] and [[Gjirokastra]] originating from the feudal castle. In the 15th century, close attention was given to protective structures such as the castle fortifications of Lezha, Petrela, [[Devol (Albania)|Devoll]], Butrint, and [[Shkodra]]. More reconstructions took place in strategic points such as the Castle of [[Elbasan]], [[Preza]], [[Tepelena]], and [[Vlora]], the latter being the most important on the coast. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the great Pashaliks of the period such as the Bushati Family, [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]], and [[Ali Pashe Tepelena]] reconstructed several fortifications such as the Castle of Shkodra, Berat, and Tepelena respectively. It is important to note that Ali Pashe Tepelena embarked on a major castle building campaign throughout Epirus.\n\n[[File:Ardenica Monastery (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|The [[Ardenica Monastery]] near Fier.]]\n\nDuring the medieval period, mosques in Albania fell into two categories: those covered with a dome, and those with a roof covered hall. The latter were immediately adopted following the Ottoman invasion, by transforming the existing churches of Shkodra, Kruje, Berat, Elbasan and Kanina. For instance, the [[Lead Mosque, Shkod\u00ebr|Lead Mosque]] built by [[Mustafa Pasha Bushati]] in Shkodra resembles a typical Istanbul mosque.\n\nOn the other hand, Christian religious structures inherited many features from their palaeo-Christian predecessors. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, a series of small structures for Christian with simple layouts were built like the [[Voskopoja]] basilica, [[Ardenica Monastery]], and Church of St. Nicholas in Voskopoja. The latter is one of the most valuable architectonic monuments in Albania. Its interior walls are covered with paintings by the renowned painter [[David Selenica]], and by brothers Constantine and Athanasios Zografi.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Modern ===\n\nDuring the 18th century, the city silhouette in Albania began to include places of worship and the Clock Tower. These, together with other social structures such as thermal baths, fountains, and ''[[madrasa|medrese]]'' further enriched the city centre and its neighbourhoods.\n\nIn the 17th century, the ''bazaar'' emerges as a production and exchange centre, while the city expands beyond the castle, which completely loses its function and inhabitants. During this period, Shkodra and Korca become important commerce and skilled crafts centres.\n \n[[File:Tirana_panorama_2016.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Skanderbeg Square]] in [[Neo-renaissance|Neo-Renaissance]] style.]]\n\nThe first half of the 20th century begins with the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation, continues with [[Fan Noli]]'s government, [[King Zog]]'s kingdom, and ends with the Italian invasion. During this time, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by Austro-Hungarian architects, giving them the appearance of European cities.\n\nThe centre of [[Tirana]] was the project of [[Florestano Di Fausto]] and Armando Brasini, well known architects of the [[Benito Mussolini]] period in Italy. Brasini laid the basis for the modern-day arrangement of the ministerial buildings in the city centre.\n\nThe plan underwent revisions by the Albanian architect Eshref Frash\u00ebri, the Italian architect Castellani, and the Austrian architects Weiss and Kohler. The rectangular parallel road system of Tirana e Re district took shape, while the northern portion of the main Boulevard was opened. These urban plans formed the basis of future developments in Albania after the [[second World War]].\n\n{{multiple image\n |align = right\n |total_width = 210\n\n |image1 = Tirana, consiglio dei ministri, 05 bassorilievo.JPG\n |width1 = 1220 |height1 =\n\n |image2 = Ospedale universitario di tirana, bassorilievi 01.JPG\n |width2 =  1490 |height2 =\n\n |footer = Reliefs at the Cpuncil of Ministers Building.<small>''Left''</small> The reliefs at the facade of the University Hospital in [[Tirana]]. <small>''Right''</small>\n}}\n\nFrom 1944 to 1991, cities experienced an ordered development with a decline in architectural quality. Massive socialist-styled [[apartment]] complexes, wide roads, and [[factories]] were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and a number of historic buildings demolished.\n \nThe period after the fall of communism is often described negatively in terms of [[urban area|urban]] development. Kiosks and apartment buildings started to occupy former public areas without planning, while informal districts formed around cities from internal [[Immigration|migrants]] leaving remote rural areas for the western lowland. Decreasing urban space and increased traffic congestion have become major problems as a result of lack of planning. \nAs part of the 2014 Administrative Division Reform, all town centres in Albania are being physically redesigned and fa\u00e7ades painted to reflect a more Mediterranean look.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&kat=88 |title=Ndarja e re, mbeten 28 bashki, shkrihen komunat &#124; Shekulli Online |publisher=Shekulli.com.al |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140113102623/http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&kat=88# |archive-date=2014-01-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformaterritoriale.al/ |title=Reforma Territoriale - KRYESORE |publisher=Reformaterritoriale.al |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nAlthough much has been achieved, critics argue that there is no clear vision on Tirana's future. Some of the pressing issues facing Tirana are loss of public space due to illegal and chaotic construction, unpaved roads in suburban areas, degradation of Tirana's Artificial Lake, rehabilitation of Skanderbeg Square, an ever-present smog, the construction of a central bus station and lack of public parking space. Future plans include the construction of the Multimodal Station of Tirana and the tram line, rehabilitation of the Tiran\u00eb River area, construction of a new boulevard along the former Tirana Railway Station and the finishing of the Big Ring Road.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Cities ==\n\n=== Berat ===\n{{See also|Berat}}\n\n[[File:Berat UNESCO 2016 Albania.jpg|210px|thumb|Scenic view over Gorica.]]\n\n[[Berat]], otherwise known as the city of a thousand windows, is a small city in Southern Albania. The architecture of Berat is diverse and enfolds the inheritance of the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] but also of various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city among others the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Nevertheless, the cityscape is notably embossed by the [[Ottoman architecture|architectural style]] of the Ottomans and boasts a wealth of structures of exceptional [[History of Albania|historical]] and [[Albanian art|architectural]] interest. This led the city to become a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n[[File:Old town of berat albania 3.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The old town of Berat is dominated by Ottoman houses.]]\n\nThe city is separated intro three parts such as the residential quarter within the fortress or known as Kalaja, Mangalem and Gorica. The [[Berat Castle|Kalaja]] is believed to have been found in antiquity as it was the settlement of the [[Illyrian tribe|Illyrian]] tribe of the [[Illyrian tribe#Deretini|Desaretes]].<ref name=\"briefhis\">{{cite web|author1=UNESCO|title=Brief description of Berat|url=http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Venice/pdf/special_events/Berat1.pdf|website=unesco.org|location=Berat|language=English|author1-link=UNESCO}}</ref> Subsequently, it was known as [[Antipatrea]] when the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s conquered the city and called it Albanorum Oppidum.<ref name=\"briefhis\"/> Over the centuries it has been subject to numerous conquest by the Byzantines and Ottomans.\n\nKalaja is well-preserved and consists of numerous houses, most of which are built of stone. Numerous churches with extraordinary decorated [[icon]]s and [[mural]]s still survives including the [[Holy Trinity Church, Berat|Holy Trinity Church]] and [[St. Mary of Blachernae Church, Berat|St. Mary of Blachernae Church]]. Islamic architecture is represented with the ruins of the [[Red Mosque, Berat|Red Mosque]] and [[White Mosque, Berat|White Mosque]]. Worth seeing is the [[cistern]] that was constructed by the Romans. The prominent [[Onufri Museum of Icons]] is also located within the castle and displays works of [[Onufri]] and other important Albanian painter.\n\n[[File:Berat_-_kalaja.jpg|210px|thumb|Remains of the [[Berat Castle]].]]\n\nHouses within the Mangalem quarter were built along a steep hill towards the Gorica quarter. The facades that faces the valley have characteristically [[overhang (architecture)|overhanging windows]]. Therefore, Berat owes its titel to the district, the \"city of a thousand windows\". There are three Ottoman mosques that include the [[King Mosque, Berat|King Mosque]], [[Lead Mosque, Berat|Lead Mosque]] and notably the [[Bachelors' Mosque|Bachelors Mosque]].

Oftentimes, these houses are built on flat grounds, with the ground floor used by inhabitants for agricultural purposes. For example, the Shijaku House in [[Tirana]] is surrounded by adobe walls with a large gate entrance, and almost always covered with a simple roof.\n* Houses with ''\u00e7ardak'', a type of balcony found on the top floor reserved for guests or relaxation: They are mostly found in [[Berat]], and less so in [[Kruje]] and [[Lezha]]. The cardak is a dominant element of the building's outer composition being on the main facade of the house, originally designed to be open. The cardak is extensively used by dwellers in the warm season by exploiting the natural sunlight. It also serves as liaison with other areas of the house. These houses are divided into several sub types: houses with cardak on the front area, on one side, or at the center. An example of such structures is Hajdar Sejdini House in [[Elbasan]]. \n* Urban or civic ''kulla'': They are found in [[Gjirokaster]] (see [[Zekate House]]), Berat, Kruje, and [[Shkoder]] used for defensive and warehouse purposes.

It has a varied and contrasting topography with high mountains, rocky shores, coastal wetlands, sandy beaches, steep canyons and gorges and islands of various shapes and sizes.\n\nIn terms of topography, the country encompasses [[coastal plain]]s in the west to the [[Albanian Alps]] in the north, the [[Sharr Mountains]] in the northeast, [[Central Mountain Range, Albania#Skanderbeg Mountains|Skanderbeg Mountains]] in the center, [[Korab|Korab Mountains]] in the east, [[Pindus Mountains]] in the southeast and [[Ceraunian Mountains]] in the southwest along the [[Albanian Riviera]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian Sea Coast]].\n\nThe country experiences mostly [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] climate with [[Continental climate|continental]] influences.<ref name=\"climate1\">{{cite web|author1=Ministry of Environment of Albania|title=Albania's Second National Communication to the Conference of Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/albnc2.pdf|website=unfccc.int|location=Tirana|page=28|language=English|author1-link=Ministry of Environment (Albania)}}</ref> That means that the climate is characterised by mild winters and hot, dry summers. The warmest areas of the country are along the west, where climate is profoundly impacted by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The coldest parts of the country are at the north and east, where snowy forested climate is prevalent.\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], Albania was originally home to the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greeks]]. Following the centuries, it was subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. The emergence of a unified Albanian state dates back to the establishment of the [[Principality of Arb\u00ebr]] in 1190 AD.\n\n== Periods ==\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe beginnings of architecture in Albania dates back to the middle [[Neolithic Age]] with the discovery of prehistoric dwellings in Dunavec and [[Maliq]].<ref name=\"neo\">{{cite web|author1=United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization|title=Archaeology and art of Albania, Ecuador, China, Bulgaria|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000748/074870eo.pdf|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|pages=4\u20136|language=English|author1-link=United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization}}</ref> They were built on a wooden platform that rested on stakes stuck vertically into the [[soil]].<ref name=\"neo\"/> Prehistoric dwellings in Albania consist of three types such as houses enclosed either completely on the ground or half underground, both found in [[Cakran]] near [[Fier]] and houses constructed above ground.\n[[File:Amphitheatre of durres albania 2016.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The [[Amphitheatre of Durr\u00ebs]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania#Tentative list|tentative list]] for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].]]\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] started to organize itself in the territory of Albania. The Illyrians were an [[ethnic group]] with distinct culture and art, while it is believed that [[Albanians]] are the descendants of the Illyrians but no enough evidence is left to get a conclusion. Cities within [[Illyria]] were mainly built on the tops of high mountains surrounded by heavily fortified walls. Further, the history of Albania has not been kind to the Illyrian architectural monuments. Few monuments from the Illyrians are still preserved such as in [[Amantia]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)|Antigonia]], [[Byllis]], [[Rozafa Castle|Scodra]], [[Lissus]] and [[Royal Tombs of Selca e Poshtme|Selca e Poshtme]].<ref>Gilkes, O., Albania An Archaeological Guide, I.B.Tauris 2012, {{ISBN|1780760698}}, p263</ref>\n\n[[File:Amphitheatre of Butrint 2009.jpg|210px|thumb|right|[[Butrint]] has been included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author1=UNESCO|title=Butrint|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/570|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English|author1-link=UNESCO}}</ref>]]\n\nFollowing the [[Illyrian Wars]], the architecture in Albania developed significantly in the 2nd century BC with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s. The conquered settlements and villages such as [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]], [[Byllis]], [[Dyrrachium]] and [[Dropull|Hadrianopolis]] were notably modernised following Roman models, with the building of a forum, roads, theatres, promenades, temples, aqueducts and other social buildings. The period also marks the construction of stadiums and thermal baths that were of social importance as places of gathering.\n\nPreviously populated by various [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Greek tribes]], [[Butrint]] became a [[protectorate]] and subsequently a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen|title=Hellenistic and Roman Butrint|publisher=Butrint Foundation, 2009|isbn=9780953555680|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nFoqAQAAMAAJ&dq=butrint+roman+architecture&q=butrint+|language=English|date=2009-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen, Richard Hodges, Sarah Leppard|title=Butrint 4: The Archaeology and Histories of an Ionian Town|publisher=Oxbow Books, 2013|isbn=9781842174623|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q3x-AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=butrint+roman+architecture#v=onepage&q=butrint%20roman%20architecture&f=false|language=English|date=2013-01-08}}</ref>  Nowadays, it demonstrates a high level of Roman urbanisation, while it is among the best preserved remains of Roman heritage in Albania.

In behalf to that, the architecture was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s. Many extensive churches and monasteries were built during that period mainly in the centre and south of the country.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Agricultural University of Tirana|title=Considering Importance of Light in the PostByzantine Church in Central Albania|url=https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2013/november/8B_Considering.pdf|website=ijirset.com|language=English|author1-link=Agricultural University of Tirana}}</ref>\n\nHowever, some inherited historic structures were damaged by invading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the consolidation of the Albanian feudal principalities gave rise to ''Varosha'', or neighbourhoods outside city walls. Examples of such developments are the [[Arberesh]] principalities centred in [[Petrele]], [[Kruje]] and [[Gjirokastra]] originating from the feudal castle. In the 15th century, close attention was given to protective structures such as the castle fortifications of Lezha, Petrela, [[Devol (Albania)|Devoll]], Butrint, and [[Shkodra]]. More reconstructions took place in strategic points such as the Castle of [[Elbasan]], [[Preza]], [[Tepelena]], and [[Vlora]], the latter being the most important on the coast. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the great Pashaliks of the period such as the Bushati Family, [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]], and [[Ali Pashe Tepelena]] reconstructed several fortifications such as the Castle of Shkodra, Berat, and Tepelena respectively. It is important to note that Ali Pashe Tepelena embarked on a major castle building campaign throughout Epirus.\n\n[[File:Ardenica Monastery (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|The [[Ardenica Monastery]] near Fier.]]\n\nDuring the medieval period, mosques in Albania fell into two categories: those covered with a dome, and those with a roof covered hall. The latter were immediately adopted following the Ottoman invasion, by transforming the existing churches of Shkodra, Kruje, Berat, Elbasan and Kanina. For instance, the [[Lead Mosque, Shkod\u00ebr|Lead Mosque]] built by [[Mustafa Pasha Bushati]] in Shkodra resembles a typical Istanbul mosque.\n\nOn the other hand, Christian religious structures inherited many features from their palaeo-Christian predecessors. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, a series of small structures for Christian with simple layouts were built like the [[Voskopoja]] basilica, [[Ardenica Monastery]], and Church of St. Nicholas in Voskopoja. The latter is one of the most valuable architectonic monuments in Albania. Its interior walls are covered with paintings by the renowned painter [[David Selenica]], and by brothers Constantine and Athanasios Zografi.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Modern ===\n\nDuring the 18th century, the city silhouette in Albania began to include places of worship and the Clock Tower. These, together with other social structures such as thermal baths, fountains, and ''[[madrasa|medrese]]'' further enriched the city centre and its neighbourhoods.\n\nIn the 17th century, the ''bazaar'' emerges as a production and exchange centre, while the city expands beyond the castle, which completely loses its function and inhabitants. During this period, Shkodra and Korca become important commerce and skilled crafts centres.\n \n[[File:Tirana_panorama_2016.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Skanderbeg Square]] in [[Neo-renaissance|Neo-Renaissance]] style.]]\n\nThe first half of the 20th century begins with the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation, continues with [[Fan Noli]]'s government, [[King Zog]]'s kingdom, and ends with the Italian invasion. During this time, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by Austro-Hungarian architects, giving them the appearance of European cities.\n\nThe centre of [[Tirana]] was the project of [[Florestano Di Fausto]] and Armando Brasini, well known architects of the [[Benito Mussolini]] period in Italy. Brasini laid the basis for the modern-day arrangement of the ministerial buildings in the city centre.\n\nThe plan underwent revisions by the Albanian architect Eshref Frash\u00ebri, the Italian architect Castellani, and the Austrian architects Weiss and Kohler. The rectangular parallel road system of Tirana e Re district took shape, while the northern portion of the main Boulevard was opened. These urban plans formed the basis of future developments in Albania after the [[second World War]].\n\n{{multiple image\n |align = right\n |total_width = 210\n\n |image1 = Tirana, consiglio dei ministri, 05 bassorilievo.JPG\n |width1 = 1220 |height1 =\n\n |image2 = Ospedale universitario di tirana, bassorilievi 01.JPG\n |width2 =  1490 |height2 =\n\n |footer = Reliefs at the Cpuncil of Ministers Building.<small>''Left''</small> The reliefs at the facade of the University Hospital in [[Tirana]]. <small>''Right''</small>\n}}\n\nFrom 1944 to 1991, cities experienced an ordered development with a decline in architectural quality. Massive socialist-styled [[apartment]] complexes, wide roads, and [[factories]] were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and a number of historic buildings demolished.\n \nThe period after the fall of communism is often described negatively in terms of [[urban area|urban]] development. Kiosks and apartment buildings started to occupy former public areas without planning, while informal districts formed around cities from internal [[Immigration|migrants]] leaving remote rural areas for the western lowland. Decreasing urban space and increased traffic congestion have become major problems as a result of lack of planning. \nAs part of the 2014 Administrative Division Reform, all town centres in Albania are being physically redesigned and fa\u00e7ades painted to reflect a more Mediterranean look.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&kat=88 |title=Ndarja e re, mbeten 28 bashki, shkrihen komunat &#124; Shekulli Online |publisher=Shekulli.com.al |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140113102623/http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&kat=88# |archive-date=2014-01-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformaterritoriale.al/ |title=Reforma Territoriale - KRYESORE |publisher=Reformaterritoriale.al |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nAlthough much has been achieved, critics argue that there is no clear vision on Tirana's future. Some of the pressing issues facing Tirana are loss of public space due to illegal and chaotic construction, unpaved roads in suburban areas, degradation of Tirana's Artificial Lake, rehabilitation of Skanderbeg Square, an ever-present smog, the construction of a central bus station and lack of public parking space. Future plans include the construction of the Multimodal Station of Tirana and the tram line, rehabilitation of the Tiran\u00eb River area, construction of a new boulevard along the former Tirana Railway Station and the finishing of the Big Ring Road.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Cities ==\n\n=== Berat ===\n{{See also|Berat}}\n\n[[File:Berat UNESCO 2016 Albania.jpg|210px|thumb|Scenic view over Gorica.]]\n\n[[Berat]], otherwise known as the city of a thousand windows, is a small city in Southern Albania. The architecture of Berat is diverse and enfolds the inheritance of the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] but also of various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city among others the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Nevertheless, the cityscape is notably embossed by the [[Ottoman architecture|architectural style]] of the Ottomans and boasts a wealth of structures of exceptional [[History of Albania|historical]] and [[Albanian art|architectural]] interest. This led the city to become a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n[[File:Old town of berat albania 3.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The old town of Berat is dominated by Ottoman houses.]]\n\nThe city is separated intro three parts such as the residential quarter within the fortress or known as Kalaja, Mangalem and Gorica.

Numerous churches with extraordinary decorated [[icon]]s and [[mural]]s still survives including the [[Holy Trinity Church, Berat|Holy Trinity Church]] and [[St. Mary of Blachernae Church, Berat|St. Mary of Blachernae Church]]. Islamic architecture is represented with the ruins of the [[Red Mosque, Berat|Red Mosque]] and [[White Mosque, Berat|White Mosque]]. Worth seeing is the [[cistern]] that was constructed by the Romans. The prominent [[Onufri Museum of Icons]] is also located within the castle and displays works of [[Onufri]] and other important Albanian painter.\n\n[[File:Berat_-_kalaja.jpg|210px|thumb|Remains of the [[Berat Castle]].]]\n\nHouses within the Mangalem quarter were built along a steep hill towards the Gorica quarter. The facades that faces the valley have characteristically [[overhang (architecture)|overhanging windows]]. Therefore, Berat owes its titel to the district, the \"city of a thousand windows\". There are three Ottoman mosques that include the [[King Mosque, Berat|King Mosque]], [[Lead Mosque, Berat|Lead Mosque]] and notably the [[Bachelors' Mosque|Bachelors Mosque]]. The [[Halveti Teqe, Berat|Halveti Teqe]] stands behind the King Mosque and enclose an impressive carved ceiling.\n\nGorica was for a long time only connected through the [[Gorica Bridge]] to the rest of Berat.

Oftentimes, these houses are built on flat grounds, with the ground floor used by inhabitants for agricultural purposes. For example, the Shijaku House in [[Tirana]] is surrounded by adobe walls with a large gate entrance, and almost always covered with a simple roof.\n* Houses with ''\u00e7ardak'', a type of balcony found on the top floor reserved for guests or relaxation: They are mostly found in [[Berat]], and less so in [[Kruje]] and [[Lezha]]. The cardak is a dominant element of the building's outer composition being on the main facade of the house, originally designed to be open. The cardak is extensively used by dwellers in the warm season by exploiting the natural sunlight. It also serves as liaison with other areas of the house. These houses are divided into several sub types: houses with cardak on the front area, on one side, or at the center. An example of such structures is Hajdar Sejdini House in [[Elbasan]]. \n* Urban or civic ''kulla'': They are found in [[Gjirokaster]] (see [[Zekate House]]), Berat, Kruje, and [[Shkoder]] used for defensive and warehouse purposes.

The [[sequel]] to Six's 2009 film ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'', the film stars [[Laurence R. Harvey]] as a [[mental illness|psychiatrically]] and [[intellectual disability|intellectually]] impaired English man who watches and becomes obsessed with the first ''Human Centipede'' film, and decides to make his own \"centipede\" consisting of 12 people, including [[Ashlynn Yennie]], an actress from the first film.\n\nThe film received substantial attention and controversy for its graphic depictions of [[violence]], [[sexual violence]] and [[body horror]]. It was subject to heavy [[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)#Censorship|censorship]] throughout the world, where it was sometimes edited to remove objectionable content or banned altogether. It received generally negative reviews, with much criticism focused on its acting, plot and violence.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the tollbooth of a parking garage in [[east London]], Martin Lomax ([[Laurence R. Harvey]]) is watching ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'' on his laptop, a film he is obsessed with. Short, overweight, asthmatic, and mentally challenged, Martin lives with his overbearing mother (Vivien Bridson), who blames him for having his father put in prison for physically and sexually abusing Martin when he was a boy. Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens), Martin's psychiatrist, also touches him inappropriately and prescribes him heavy medication. Martin keeps a pet centipede, which he gleefully feeds insects to.\n\nMartin acquires a dingy warehouse after killing the leasor and begins abducting people to use for his own human centipede. His victims include: an aggressive young man (Lucas Hansen) and his girlfriend (Emma Lock); a man (Peter Blankenstein) who complains about the ATM having no cash; a rich man (Daniel Jude Gennis) and his pregnant wife (Katherine Templar) who has a toddler, whom Martin leaves in the back seat of their car uninjured; two drunk girls (Kandice Caine and Georgia Goodrick) who catch Martin masturbating with sandpaper to the scene from the original film where Dr Heiter wakes the centipede up, and another man (Dan Burman). When Martin's mother finds and destroys his scrapbook, Martin kills her by letting his pet centipede bite her face (causing her immense pain), then bludgeoning her head repeatedly with his crowbar until her skull caves in. He then lures his detested neighbour (Lee Nicholas Harris) to the scene, shoots, and kidnaps him. Martin also catches Dr. Sebring and a cabbie (Dominic Borrelli) having sex with a sex worker (Maddi Black), and proceeds to kill Sebring before abducting the cabbie and the sex worker. Martin's final victim is [[Ashlynn Yennie]], the actress who played \"Jenny\" in the first film (now playing herself, having been lured by Martin under the pretense of a film audition with [[Quentin Tarantino]]).\n\nWith twelve victims, Martin begins assembling his \"centipede\". He severs the ligaments in each person's knees to prevent them from fleeing and uses a hammer to knock out their teeth. He slices open the buttocks of one of his victims, causing him to bleed to death. In a quick change of plan, instead of actual surgeon tools, he uses a staple gun and duct tape to attach each person's lips to the next person's buttocks. During the assembly process, the pregnant woman is presumed dead; a grieving Martin places her in the corner. His \"human centipede\" is ultimately ten people long with Ashlynn in front.\n\nAfter performing the crude procedure, Martin begins experimenting. Disturbed by Ashlynn's screams, he tears her tongue out with pliers. He then injects each victim with a syringe of [[laxative]], forcing each of them to explosively evacuate their bowels into the mouth of the person behind them. After pausing, he then wraps his genitals in barbed wire and rapes the woman at the end of his \"centipede\". As he finishes, the pregnant woman awakes and runs outside screaming, apparently in labour. She leaps into a victim's car and bears her child. She then gets onto the road, but as she starts the engine, she stomps on the accelerator, crushing the baby's skull under the pedal. She still manages to escape.\n\nThe neighbour rips his face from the person in front of him, separating the \"centipede\" into two halves. Furious that his centipede is ruined, Martin shoots all the victims, and when he runs out of ammunition, uses a knife to slit the throats of the remaining victims. As he advances on Ashlynn, he appears to give pause, and kneels in front of her. She punches him in the genitals, shoves the funnel into his rectum, and drops his pet centipede into it. In agony, Martin stabs her in the neck and staggers out. Ashlynn is seen slightly moving afterwards.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the tollbooth, with Martin watching the credits of ''First Sequence'' on his laptop, with exactly the same reaction as the initial scene. However, the toddler left in the car from the previous kidnappings can be heard crying in the background.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Laurence R.

The company lodged an appeal against our decision to refuse classification. In the course of preparations for that appeal, the company proposed a number of cuts which it was right for us to consider. In response, after further examination, we proposed a more extensive series of cuts.

Gorier! More extreme! Well, those people will get what they asked for.\"<ref name=\"Yamato\" /> Eric Kohn, writing for ''indieWire'', criticized the excessive grotesqueness of the film as well as Six's vanity. He stated, \"Well, what if it turns someone's own body against them\u2014is that a measure of success? To some degree, yes; it's designed to turn the tables on its own gore-hungry fans by depicting a fictionalized version of one of their own so revolting they think twice about their twisted tendencies. But it's so indulgently perverse, and so viscerally disturbing to watch\u2014not to mention a painfully vain exercise in self-worship\u2014that the lesson is incredibly hard-won. Take a word of warning, if you're on the fence; you don't have to see ''The Human Centipede II'' to know you don't want to see it.\"<ref name=\"Kohn\" />\n\nSome reviewers found the extreme nature of the film boring. Robert Koehler, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', found the gore so excessive that he termed it a form of lazy filmmaking. \"More boring than stomach-churning, the film nevertheless contains scattered scenes and sequences so far beyond the tolerance of the squeamish that it can't be overstated; one, detailing the violent birth and death of a baby, is here simply to shock the most jaded of the jaded,\" he wrote.<ref name=\"Variety\" />\n\nReviewer Robert Saucedo of InsidePulse.com was more generous toward the film, but found its execution lacking. He wrote, \"The film ... has a hint of intelligence hiding behind its beady little eyes. Smeared with blood and poo as it may be, this intelligence exposes a film that has something to say. The problem, unfortunately, is that director Tom Six is like a child \u2013 attempting to make a profound statement but unable to get it out eloquently or even in anything not resembling a whimper or a groan most of the time ...

In the end, the parts of the trilogy form one continuous film about four and a half hours long. He also stated that the third film would answer some \"lasting questions\", have a strange happy ending, and is the last of the series, as he does not want to make any more ''Centipede'' films.<ref name=\"collider.com\"/> In an interview with [[DreadCentral.com]], Six said the third film would \"make the last one look like a [[Disney]] film.

The [[sequel]] to Six's 2009 film ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'', the film stars [[Laurence R. Harvey]] as a [[mental illness|psychiatrically]] and [[intellectual disability|intellectually]] impaired English man who watches and becomes obsessed with the first ''Human Centipede'' film, and decides to make his own \"centipede\" consisting of 12 people, including [[Ashlynn Yennie]], an actress from the first film.\n\nThe film received substantial attention and controversy for its graphic depictions of [[violence]], [[sexual violence]] and [[body horror]]. It was subject to heavy [[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)#Censorship|censorship]] throughout the world, where it was sometimes edited to remove objectionable content or banned altogether. It received generally negative reviews, with much criticism focused on its acting, plot and violence.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the tollbooth of a parking garage in [[east London]], Martin Lomax ([[Laurence R. Harvey]]) is watching ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'' on his laptop, a film he is obsessed with. Short, overweight, asthmatic, and mentally challenged, Martin lives with his overbearing mother (Vivien Bridson), who blames him for having his father put in prison for physically and sexually abusing Martin when he was a boy. Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens), Martin's psychiatrist, also touches him inappropriately and prescribes him heavy medication. Martin keeps a pet centipede, which he gleefully feeds insects to.\n\nMartin acquires a dingy warehouse after killing the leasor and begins abducting people to use for his own human centipede. His victims include: an aggressive young man (Lucas Hansen) and his girlfriend (Emma Lock); a man (Peter Blankenstein) who complains about the ATM having no cash; a rich man (Daniel Jude Gennis) and his pregnant wife (Katherine Templar) who has a toddler, whom Martin leaves in the back seat of their car uninjured; two drunk girls (Kandice Caine and Georgia Goodrick) who catch Martin masturbating with sandpaper to the scene from the original film where Dr Heiter wakes the centipede up, and another man (Dan Burman). When Martin's mother finds and destroys his scrapbook, Martin kills her by letting his pet centipede bite her face (causing her immense pain), then bludgeoning her head repeatedly with his crowbar until her skull caves in. He then lures his detested neighbour (Lee Nicholas Harris) to the scene, shoots, and kidnaps him. Martin also catches Dr. Sebring and a cabbie (Dominic Borrelli) having sex with a sex worker (Maddi Black), and proceeds to kill Sebring before abducting the cabbie and the sex worker. Martin's final victim is [[Ashlynn Yennie]], the actress who played \"Jenny\" in the first film (now playing herself, having been lured by Martin under the pretense of a film audition with [[Quentin Tarantino]]).\n\nWith twelve victims, Martin begins assembling his \"centipede\". He severs the ligaments in each person's knees to prevent them from fleeing and uses a hammer to knock out their teeth. He slices open the buttocks of one of his victims, causing him to bleed to death. In a quick change of plan, instead of actual surgeon tools, he uses a staple gun and duct tape to attach each person's lips to the next person's buttocks. During the assembly process, the pregnant woman is presumed dead; a grieving Martin places her in the corner. His \"human centipede\" is ultimately ten people long with Ashlynn in front.\n\nAfter performing the crude procedure, Martin begins experimenting. Disturbed by Ashlynn's screams, he tears her tongue out with pliers. He then injects each victim with a syringe of [[laxative]], forcing each of them to explosively evacuate their bowels into the mouth of the person behind them. After pausing, he then wraps his genitals in barbed wire and rapes the woman at the end of his \"centipede\". As he finishes, the pregnant woman awakes and runs outside screaming, apparently in labour. She leaps into a victim's car and bears her child.

She still manages to escape.\n\nThe neighbour rips his face from the person in front of him, separating the \"centipede\" into two halves. Furious that his centipede is ruined, Martin shoots all the victims, and when he runs out of ammunition, uses a knife to slit the throats of the remaining victims. As he advances on Ashlynn, he appears to give pause, and kneels in front of her. She punches him in the genitals, shoves the funnel into his rectum, and drops his pet centipede into it. In agony, Martin stabs her in the neck and staggers out. Ashlynn is seen slightly moving afterwards.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the tollbooth, with Martin watching the credits of ''First Sequence'' on his laptop, with exactly the same reaction as the initial scene.

Well, those people will get what they asked for.\"<ref name=\"Yamato\" /> Eric Kohn, writing for ''indieWire'', criticized the excessive grotesqueness of the film as well as Six's vanity. He stated, \"Well, what if it turns someone's own body against them\u2014is that a measure of success? To some degree, yes; it's designed to turn the tables on its own gore-hungry fans by depicting a fictionalized version of one of their own so revolting they think twice about their twisted tendencies. But it's so indulgently perverse, and so viscerally disturbing to watch\u2014not to mention a painfully vain exercise in self-worship\u2014that the lesson is incredibly hard-won. Take a word of warning, if you're on the fence; you don't have to see ''The Human Centipede II'' to know you don't want to see it.\"<ref name=\"Kohn\" />\n\nSome reviewers found the extreme nature of the film boring. Robert Koehler, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', found the gore so excessive that he termed it a form of lazy filmmaking. \"More boring than stomach-churning, the film nevertheless contains scattered scenes and sequences so far beyond the tolerance of the squeamish that it can't be overstated; one, detailing the violent birth and death of a baby, is here simply to shock the most jaded of the jaded,\" he wrote.<ref name=\"Variety\" />\n\nReviewer Robert Saucedo of InsidePulse.com was more generous toward the film, but found its execution lacking. He wrote, \"The film ... has a hint of intelligence hiding behind its beady little eyes. Smeared with blood and poo as it may be, this intelligence exposes a film that has something to say. The problem, unfortunately, is that director Tom Six is like a child \u2013 attempting to make a profound statement but unable to get it out eloquently or even in anything not resembling a whimper or a groan most of the time ... Who would have guessed? ''Human Centipede II'' is a treatise about horror fandom as delivered by a giggling, poop-infatuated toddler.\"<ref name=\"Saucedo\" />\n\nMark Olsen, film critic for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', expressed concern over the film's conclusion as well as its basic premise. The conclusion (which he admits is open to interpretation; did Lomax commit these crimes or not?) leaves the audience either believing that the film is a \"cop-out repudiation of everything that has come prior\" or that even more graphic torture is coming in the third film.<ref name=\"Olsen\">[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-human-centipede-20111007-1,0,5524602.story Olsen, Mark. \"Movie Review: ''The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)''.\" ''Los Angeles Times.'' 7 October 2011.] Accessed 7 October 2011.</ref> Regardless, Olsen concluded that writer-director Six has left himself with no good option for the third film.\n\n[[Roger Ebert]], of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', who did not assign a star rating to the original, gave this film zero stars on review, calling it \"reprehensible, dismaying, ugly, artless and an affront to any notion, however remote, of human decency.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111007/REVIEWS/111009982 Ebert, Roger. \"Movie Review: ''The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)''.\" ''Chicago Sun-Times.'' 7 October 2011.] Retrieved 29 January 2012,</ref> He would later name it the worst movie of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebertpresents.com/episodes/episode-224/videos/370|title=Roger, Christy, and Ignatiy's worst movies of the year|publisher=Ebert Presents|date=30 December 2011|accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, the reception of the film was just as hostile.

In the end, the parts of the trilogy form one continuous film about four and a half hours long. He also stated that the third film would answer some \"lasting questions\", have a strange happy ending, and is the last of the series, as he does not want to make any more ''Centipede'' films.<ref name=\"collider.com\"/> In an interview with [[DreadCentral.com]], Six said the third film would \"make the last one look like a [[Disney]] film. We're going to shoot the third film entirely in America, and it's going to be my favorite... It's going to upset a lot of people.\"\n\nAround late 2012, actor [[Dieter Laser]] and Six ended their legal battle about creative differences, which had been ongoing since March 2012. Laser and Harvey returned for the third film, which is set in the United States, and played new characters. Six had said that the film would star a \"big American celebrity,\" have \"a storyline that nobody would expect,\" and feature a centipede consisting of 500+ people.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rigney |first=Todd |url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/human-centipede-3-debuts-new-poster-at-the-american-film-market/ |title=Human Centipede 3 Debuts New Poster at the American Film Market |publisher=BeyondHollywood.com |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208183205/http://www.beyondhollywood.com/human-centipede-3-debuts-new-poster-at-the-american-film-market/ |archivedate=8 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFilming commenced in May 2013, with [[Eric Roberts]] added to the cast.
