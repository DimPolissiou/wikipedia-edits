Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].\n\nBetween 1976 and 1981, DARPA's major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing. These large-scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research, which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the [[Very-large-scale integration|Very-Large-Scale Integration]] (VLSI) Program and the Congressionally-mandated charged particle beam program.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in [[automatic target recognition]], space based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] (SDIO), later known as the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]] (BMDO), now titled the [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).\n\n===Recent history (1981\u2013present)===\nDuring the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the [[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]] or Hypersonic Research Program. The Strategic Computing Program enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites ([[LIGHTSAT (DARPA)|LIGHTSAT]]) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.\n\nOn February 4, 2004 the agency shut down its so called \"LifeLog Project\".

Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].\n\nBetween 1976 and 1981, DARPA's major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing. These large-scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research, which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the [[Very-large-scale integration|Very-Large-Scale Integration]] (VLSI) Program and the Congressionally-mandated charged particle beam program.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in [[automatic target recognition]], space based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] (SDIO), later known as the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]] (BMDO), now titled the [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).\n\n===Recent history (1981\u2013present)===\nDuring the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the [[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]] or Hypersonic Research Program. The Strategic Computing Program enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites ([[LIGHTSAT (DARPA)|LIGHTSAT]]) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.\n\nOn February 4, 2004 the agency shut down its so called \"LifeLog Project\".

It did continue the group's commercial success, however; lead single \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\" charted at No.&nbsp;6 in the UK charts gaining the band an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and the album entered the UK album chart at No.&nbsp;2, Marillion's second highest placing. \"[[Sugar Mice]]\" and \"[[Warm Wet Circles]]\" also became hit singles, both reaching No.&nbsp;22.

He was making a fantastic amount of money while we were working our asses off. Then I found a bit of paper proposing an American tour. At the end of the day the band would have needed a \u00a314,000 loan from EMI as tour support to do it. That was when I knew that, if I stayed with the band, I'd probably end up a raging alcoholic and be found overdosed and dying in a big house in Oxford with Irish wolfhounds at the bottom of my bed.\"<ref>''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'', 29 May 2003.</ref></blockquote> <!-- article title? author? -->\n\nFish gave the band a choice to continue with either him or the manager. The band sided with the manager and Fish left for a solo career.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/music/news-and-features/back-singing-for-his-supper-after-taking-stock-1-881130 | title= Back singing for his supper after taking stock| date=29 May 2003|work=[[The Scotsman]] |location=UK}}</ref> His last live performance with the band was at [[Craigtoun Country Park]] on 23 July 1988.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.the-company.com/tourhist/1988.htm | title= Tour history 1988 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100101161931/http://the-company.com/tourhist/1988.htm | archivedate= 1 January 2010 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Due to lengthy legal battles, informal contact between Fish and the other four band members apparently did not resume until 1999. Fish would later disclose in the liner notes to the 2-CD reissue of ''Clutching at Straws'' that he and his former bandmates had met up and discussed the demise of the band and renewed their friendship, and had come to the consensus that an excessive touring schedule and too much pressure from the band's management led to the rift.\n\nAlthough reportedly now on good personal terms, both camps had always made it very clear that the oft-speculated-upon reunion would never happen. However, when Fish headlined the 'Hobble on the Cobbles' free concert in Aylesbury's Market Square on 26 August 2007, the attraction of playing their debut single in its spiritual home proved strong enough to overcome any lingering bad feeling between the former band members, and Kelly, Mosley, Rothery, and Trewavas replaced Fish's backing band for an emotional encore of \"Market Square Heroes\".\n\nIn a press interview following the event, Fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, saying that: \"[[Steve Hogarth|Hogarth]] does a great job with the band. We forged different paths over the 19 years.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6966603.stm|title= Singer Fish and Marillion reunite| date=28 August 2007|work=BBC News }}</ref>\n\n===The Steve Hogarth era===\n====''Seasons End'' and ''Holidays in Eden'' (1989\u20131991)====\nAfter the split, the band found Steve Hogarth, the former keyboardist and sometime vocalist of [[The Europeans (band)|The Europeans]]. Hogarth stepped into a difficult situation, as the band had already recorded some demos of the next studio album, which eventually would have become ''[[Seasons End (album)|Seasons End]]''. Hogarth was a significant contrast to Fish, coming from a [[New wave music|new wave]] musical background instead of progressive rock. He had also never owned a Marillion album before joining the band.<ref name=Ling2001/>\n\nAfter Fish left the group (taking his lyrics with him), Hogarth set to work crafting new lyrics to existing songs with lyricist and author [[John Helmer (musician)|John Helmer]]. The demo sessions of the songs from ''Seasons End'' with Fish vocals and lyrics can be found on the bonus disc of the remastered version of ''Clutching at Straws'', while the lyrics found their way into various Fish solo albums such as his first solo album, ''[[Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors]]'', some snippets on his second, ''[[Internal Exile (Fish album)|Internal Exile]]'' and even a line or two found its way to his third album, ''[[Suits (album)|Suits]]''.\n\nHogarth's second album with the band, ''[[Holidays in Eden (Album)|Holidays in Eden]]'', was the first he wrote in partnership with the band, and includes the song \"Dry Land\" which Hogarth had written and recorded in a previous project with the band [[How We Live]]. As quoted from Steve Hogarth, \"''Holidays in Eden'' was to become Marillion's \"pop\"est album ever, and was greeted with delight by many, and dismay by some of the hardcore fans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/holidays.htm |title=MUSIC \u2013 Discography \u2013 Holidays in Eden |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> Despite its pop stylings, the album failed to cross over beyond the band's existing fanbase and produced no major hit singles.\n\n====''Brave'', ''Afraid of Sunlight'' and split with EMI Records (1992\u20131995)====\n''Holidays in Eden'' was followed by ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'', a dark and richly complex [[concept album]] that took the band 18 months to release. The album also marked the start of the band's longtime relationship with producer [[Dave Meegan]]. An independent film based on the album, which featured the band, was also released.\n\nThe next album, ''[[Afraid of Sunlight]]'', would be the band's last album with record label EMI Records. Once again, it received little promotion, no mainstream radio airplay and its sales were disappointing for the band. Despite this, it was one of their most critically acclaimed albums and was included in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'''s 50 Best Albums of 1995.<ref>''Q'', February 1996.</ref> One track of note on the album is ''Out of This World'', a song about [[Donald Campbell]], who died while trying to set a speed record on water. The song inspired an effort to recover both Campbell's body and the \"Bluebird K7,\" the boat which Campbell crashed in, from the water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/lyrics/aos.htm#ootw |title=Out of this World, Trivia |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824163846/http://www.marillion.com/music/lyrics/aos.htm#ootw |archivedate=24 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The recovery was finally undertaken in 2001, and both Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery were invited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/news/2001/20010308.htm |title=Band Member Journal : A Day in the Lakes |website=Marillion.com |date=8 March 2001 |accessdate=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914022052/http://www.marillion.com/news/2001/20010308.htm |archivedate=14 September 2011 }}</ref> In 1998, Steve Hogarth claimed this was the best album he had made with the band.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/aos.htm | title= Afraid of Sunlight Sleeve Notes|website=Marillion.com}}</ref>\n\n====''This Strange Engine'', ''Radiation'' and ''marillion.com'' (1996\u20131999)====\nWhat followed was a string of albums and events that saw Marillion struggling to find their place in the music business. ''[[This Strange Engine (Album)|This Strange Engine]]'' was released in 1997 with little promotion from their new label [[Castle Records]], and the band could not afford to make tour stops in the United States. Luckily, their dedicated US fan base decided to solve the problem by raising some $60,000 themselves online to give to the band to come to the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/press/anorak.htm |title=NEWS \u2013 Press Room \u2013 Anoraknophobia |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914094146/http://www.marillion.com/press/anorak.htm |archivedate=14 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The band's loyal fanbase (combined with the Internet) would eventually become vital to the band's existence.\n\nThe band's tenth album ''[[Radiation (Marillion album)|Radiation]]'' saw the band taking a different approach and was received by fans with mixed reactions.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n''[[marillion.com]]'' was released the following year and showed some progression in the new direction. The band were still unhappy with their record label situation.\n\n====''Anoraknophobia'' and ''Marbles'' (2000\u20132006)====\nThe band decided that they would try a radical experiment by asking their fans if they would help fund the recording of the next album by pre-ordering it before recording even started. The result was over 12,000 pre-orders which raised enough money to record and release ''[[Anoraknophobia]]'' in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/anorak.htm |title=MUSIC \u2013 Discography \u2013 Anoraknophobia |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> The band was able to strike a deal with EMI to also help distribute the album. This allowed Marillion to retain all the rights to their music while enjoying commercial distribution.  By this time the band had also parted company with their long-time manager, saving 20 per cent of the band's income.\n\nThe success of ''Anoraknophobia'' allowed the band to start recording their next album, but they decided to leverage their fanbase once again to help raise money towards marketing and promotion of a new album. The band put up the album for pre-order in mid-production. This time fans responded by pre-ordering 18,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/marbles.htm |title=MUSIC \u2013 Discography \u2013 Marbles |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n''[[Marbles (album)|Marbles]]'' was released in 2004 with a 2-CD version that is only available at Marillion's website \u2013 a 'thank-you' gesture to the over 18,000 fans who pre-ordered it, and as even a further thanks to the fans, their names were credited in the sleeve notes (this 'thank you' to the fans also occurred with the previous album, Anoraknophobia).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n[[Image:MarillionEmpik2007.jpg|thumb|275px|right| Marillion in 2007, left to right: Steve Rothery, Steve Hogarth, Pete Trewavas (front row), Mark Kelly, Ian Mosley (back row)]] The band's management organised the biggest promotional schedule since they had left EMI and Steve Hogarth secured interviews with prominent broadcasters on [[BBC Radio]], including [[Matthew Wright (television presenter)|Matthew Wright]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]], [[Stuart Maconie]], [[Simon Mayo]] and [[Mark Lawson]].

Aware that it was unlikely to gain much mainstream radio airplay, the band released the single in three separate formats and encouraged fans to buy a copy of each to get the single into the UK Top Ten. The single reached No.&nbsp;7, making it the first Marillion song to reach the UK Top Ten since \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\" in 1987 and the band's first Top 40 entry since \"Beautiful\" in 1995. The second single from the album, \"Don't Hurt Yourself\", reached No.&nbsp;16. Following this, they released a download-only single, \"The Damage (live)\", recorded at the band's sell-out gig at the London Astoria. All of this succeeded in putting the band back in the public consciousness, making the campaign a success. Marillion continued to tour throughout 2005 playing several summer festivals and embarking on acoustic tours of both Europe and the United States, followed up by the \"Not Quite Christmas Tour\" of Europe throughout the end of 2005.\n\nA new DVD, ''Colours and Sound'', was released in Feb 2006, documenting the creation, promotion, release, and subsequent European tour in support of the album ''Marbles''.\n\n====''Somewhere Else'' and ''Happiness is the Road'' (2007\u20132008)====\nApril 2007 saw Marillion release their fourteenth studio album ''[[Somewhere Else (Marillion album)|Somewhere Else]]'', their first album in 10 years to make the UK Top No.&nbsp;30.  The success of the album was further underscored by that of the download-only single \"See it Like a Baby\", making UK No.&nbsp;45 (March 2007) and the traditional CD release of \"[[Thankyou Whoever You Are]] / Most Toys\", which made UK No.&nbsp;15 and No.&nbsp;6 in the Netherlands during June 2007.\n\nIn July 2008 the band posted a contest for fans to create a music video for the soon-to-be released single \"Whatever is Wrong with You\", and post it on YouTube.

It is another double album, with one disc based on a concept and the second containing the other songs that aren't a part of the theme. Before the album's release, on 9 September 2008, Marillion pre-released their album via p2p networks themselves. Upon attempting to play the downloaded files, users were shown a video from the band explaining why they had taken this route. Downloaders were then able to opt to purchase the album at a user-defined price or select to receive DRM-free files for free, in exchange for an email address. The band explained that although they do not support piracy, they realised their music would inevitably be distributed online anyway, and wanted to attempt to engage with p2p users and make the best of the situation.<ref>Marillion Press Release (11 September 2008) [http://www.antimusic.com/news/08/sep/11Marillion_Use_P2P_for_Album_Release.shtml \"Marillion Use P2P for Album Release]\" ''Anti Music''</ref>\n\n====''Less is More'' and ''Sounds That Can't Be Made'' (2009\u20132014) ====\nThe band's sixteenth studio album (released 2 October 2009) was an acoustic album featuring new arrangements of previously released tracks (except one, the new track: \"It's Not Your Fault\") entitled ''[[Less Is More (Marillion album)|Less Is More]]''.\n\nTheir seventeenth studio album, titled ''[[Sounds That Can't Be Made]]'', was released in September 2012. Two versions of the album were released: A 2-disc 'deluxe' version that included a DVD with 'making-of' features and sound-check recordings and a single CD jewel case version. The 'deluxe' version also included a 128-page book that incorporated lyrics, artwork and, as was the case with ''[[Anoraknophobia]]'', ''[[Marbles (album)|Marbles]]'' and ''[[Happiness is the Road]]'', the names of people who pre-ordered the album.

Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of [[Peter Gabriel]]-era [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and [[Mellotron]]-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by [[Mark Wilkinson]] used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.\n\nAs Jonh Wilde summarised in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1989: <blockquote>At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with \"[[Market Square Heroes]]\". There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going.  As [[punk rock|punk]] was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp.  When compared to [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|ELP]], they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked \u2013 \"[[Garden Party (Marillion song)|Garden Party]]\", \"[[Punch and Judy (song)|Punch and Judy]]\" and \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\". By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.<ref>Jonh Wilde. \"Fish - A Chip Off the Shoulder\". p 42-43. ''Melody Maker''. 28 October 1989</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe band's unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' in 1987, [[David Hepworth]] wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. ''[[Clutching at Straws]]'' suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.\"<ref>David Hepworth (July 1987) [http://fish-thecompany.com/disco/dacas.htm Review of ''Clutching at Straws''], ''Q Magazine'' (archived at [http://the-company.com Official Fish Site])</ref> In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: \"It's not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?\" He also argued that if the album ''[[Afraid of Sunlight]]'' \"had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.\"<ref>Dave Henderson ''Q'', August 1995.</ref> In ''[[Record Collector]]'' in 2002, Tim Jones argued they were \"one of the most unfairly berated bands in Britain\" and \"one of its best live rock acts.\"<ref>Tim Jones ''Record Collector'', May 2002.</ref> In 2004, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'''s [[Jon Hotten]] wrote: \"That genre thing has been a bugbear of Marillion's, but it no longer seems relevant. What are [[Radiohead]] if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\"<ref name=\"Jon Hotten 2004\"/> In the ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' & ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' Classic Special Edition ''[[Pink Floyd]] & The Story of Prog Rock'', an article on Marillion written by [[Mick Wall]] described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".<ref>Mick Wall ''Q Classic: Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock'', 2005.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Stephen Dalton of ''[[The Times]]'' stated: <blockquote>The band have just released their 14th album, ''[[Somewhere Else (Marillion album)|Somewhere Else]]'', which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like [[Coldplay]], ache like [[Radiohead]] and thunder like [[Muse (band)|Muse]], it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called ''[[Script for a Jester's Tear]]''. But, come on, we all had bad hair days in the 1980s.<ref name=Dalt2007>{{cite web | url= https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/marillion-how-to-thrive-on-a-fish-free-diet | title= How to thrive on a Fish-free diet|date=21 April 2007|author=Stephen Dalton|work=rock's back pages library |location=UK}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite publishing a very good review for their 1995 album ''[[Afraid of Sunlight]]'' and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' refused to interview the band or write a feature on them.

He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\". He also dismissed the band's efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: \"One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion.\"<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/aug/13/tvandradio.television1 | title= In the realm of pretences| author=Gareth McLean| date=13 August 2001|work=The Guardian |location=UK}}</ref>\n\n[[Rachel Cooke]], a writer for ''[[The Observer]]'' and ''[[New Statesman]]'', has repeatedly referred negatively to the band and insulted their fans in her articles.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/26/bestbooksoftheyear.bestbooks1 | title= Reader, I loved it|date=26 November 2006|work=The Observer |location=UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/15/comics | title= I get the picture: comics can be cool|date=15 July 2007|work=The Observer |location=UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.newstatesman.com/television/2008/06/gear-bbc2-clarkson-keep-cars | title= I just can't get you out of my head|date=26 June 2008|work=New Statesman |location=UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2012/03/anti-social-network-bbc3 | title= The Anti-Social Network (BBC3)|date=26 March 2012|work=New Statesman |location=UK}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview in 2000, Hogarth expressed regret about the band retaining their name after he joined: <blockquote>If we had known when I joined Marillion what we know now, we'd have changed the name and been a new band. It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we'd changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It's such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a 'dinosaur prog band'. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven't listened to anything we've done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we've done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It's a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] they say: 'Sorry, we don't play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here's the new [[U2]] single.' I suppose it's something everyone has to cope with \u2013 every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years.

The second version has an instrumental version of \"Alice\" in place of \"Scott's Porridge\". All tracks are instrumental apart from \"Alice\", with vocals by Doug Irvine. The summer demo has three tracks; \"Close\" (parts of which were later rewritten into \"The Web\", \"He Knows You Know\" and \"Chelsea Monday\"), \"Lady Fantasy\" (an original based on an earlier Electric Gypsy song), and another version of \"Alice\". Both were recorded at [[The Enid]]'s studio in Hertfordshire. Following Irvine's departure and replacement by Fish and Minnitt, the band recorded another demo tape, produced by Les Payne, in July 1981 that included early versions of \"He Knows You Know\", \"Garden Party\", and \"Charting the Single\".{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe group attracted attention with a three-track session for the ''[[Friday Rock Show]]'' (early versions of \"The Web\", \"Three Boats Down from The Candy\", and \"Forgotten Sons\").{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} They were subsequently signed by [[EMI Records]]. They released their first single, \"[[Market Square Heroes]]\", in 1982, with the epic song \"Grendel\" on the B-side of the 12\" version.

It did continue the group's commercial success, however; lead single \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\" charted at No.&nbsp;6 in the UK charts gaining the band an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and the album entered the UK album chart at No.&nbsp;2, Marillion's second highest placing. \"[[Sugar Mice]]\" and \"[[Warm Wet Circles]]\" also became hit singles, both reaching No.&nbsp;22.

He was making a fantastic amount of money while we were working our asses off. Then I found a bit of paper proposing an American tour. At the end of the day the band would have needed a \u00a314,000 loan from EMI as tour support to do it. That was when I knew that, if I stayed with the band, I'd probably end up a raging alcoholic and be found overdosed and dying in a big house in Oxford with Irish wolfhounds at the bottom of my bed.\"<ref>''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'', 29 May 2003.</ref></blockquote> <!-- article title? author? -->\n\nFish gave the band a choice to continue with either him or the manager. The band sided with the manager and Fish left for a solo career.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/music/news-and-features/back-singing-for-his-supper-after-taking-stock-1-881130 | title= Back singing for his supper after taking stock| date=29 May 2003|work=[[The Scotsman]] |location=UK}}</ref> His last live performance with the band was at [[Craigtoun Country Park]] on 23 July 1988.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.the-company.com/tourhist/1988.htm | title= Tour history 1988 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100101161931/http://the-company.com/tourhist/1988.htm | archivedate= 1 January 2010 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Due to lengthy legal battles, informal contact between Fish and the other four band members apparently did not resume until 1999. Fish would later disclose in the liner notes to the 2-CD reissue of ''Clutching at Straws'' that he and his former bandmates had met up and discussed the demise of the band and renewed their friendship, and had come to the consensus that an excessive touring schedule and too much pressure from the band's management led to the rift.\n\nAlthough reportedly now on good personal terms, both camps had always made it very clear that the oft-speculated-upon reunion would never happen. However, when Fish headlined the 'Hobble on the Cobbles' free concert in Aylesbury's Market Square on 26 August 2007, the attraction of playing their debut single in its spiritual home proved strong enough to overcome any lingering bad feeling between the former band members, and Kelly, Mosley, Rothery, and Trewavas replaced Fish's backing band for an emotional encore of \"Market Square Heroes\".\n\nIn a press interview following the event, Fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, saying that: \"[[Steve Hogarth|Hogarth]] does a great job with the band. We forged different paths over the 19 years.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6966603.stm|title= Singer Fish and Marillion reunite| date=28 August 2007|work=BBC News }}</ref>\n\n===The Steve Hogarth era===\n====''Seasons End'' and ''Holidays in Eden'' (1989\u20131991)====\nAfter the split, the band found Steve Hogarth, the former keyboardist and sometime vocalist of [[The Europeans (band)|The Europeans]]. Hogarth stepped into a difficult situation, as the band had already recorded some demos of the next studio album, which eventually would have become ''[[Seasons End (album)|Seasons End]]''. Hogarth was a significant contrast to Fish, coming from a [[New wave music|new wave]] musical background instead of progressive rock. He had also never owned a Marillion album before joining the band.<ref name=Ling2001/>\n\nAfter Fish left the group (taking his lyrics with him), Hogarth set to work crafting new lyrics to existing songs with lyricist and author [[John Helmer (musician)|John Helmer]]. The demo sessions of the songs from ''Seasons End'' with Fish vocals and lyrics can be found on the bonus disc of the remastered version of ''Clutching at Straws'', while the lyrics found their way into various Fish solo albums such as his first solo album, ''[[Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors]]'', some snippets on his second, ''[[Internal Exile (Fish album)|Internal Exile]]'' and even a line or two found its way to his third album, ''[[Suits (album)|Suits]]''.\n\nHogarth's second album with the band, ''[[Holidays in Eden (Album)|Holidays in Eden]]'', was the first he wrote in partnership with the band, and includes the song \"Dry Land\" which Hogarth had written and recorded in a previous project with the band [[How We Live]]. As quoted from Steve Hogarth, \"''Holidays in Eden'' was to become Marillion's \"pop\"est album ever, and was greeted with delight by many, and dismay by some of the hardcore fans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/holidays.htm |title=MUSIC \u2013 Discography \u2013 Holidays in Eden |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> Despite its pop stylings, the album failed to cross over beyond the band's existing fanbase and produced no major hit singles.\n\n====''Brave'', ''Afraid of Sunlight'' and split with EMI Records (1992\u20131995)====\n''Holidays in Eden'' was followed by ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'', a dark and richly complex [[concept album]] that took the band 18 months to release. The album also marked the start of the band's longtime relationship with producer [[Dave Meegan]]. An independent film based on the album, which featured the band, was also released.\n\nThe next album, ''[[Afraid of Sunlight]]'', would be the band's last album with record label EMI Records. Once again, it received little promotion, no mainstream radio airplay and its sales were disappointing for the band. Despite this, it was one of their most critically acclaimed albums and was included in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'''s 50 Best Albums of 1995.<ref>''Q'', February 1996.</ref> One track of note on the album is ''Out of This World'', a song about [[Donald Campbell]], who died while trying to set a speed record on water. The song inspired an effort to recover both Campbell's body and the \"Bluebird K7,\" the boat which Campbell crashed in, from the water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/lyrics/aos.htm#ootw |title=Out of this World, Trivia |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824163846/http://www.marillion.com/music/lyrics/aos.htm#ootw |archivedate=24 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The recovery was finally undertaken in 2001, and both Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery were invited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/news/2001/20010308.htm |title=Band Member Journal : A Day in the Lakes |website=Marillion.com |date=8 March 2001 |accessdate=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914022052/http://www.marillion.com/news/2001/20010308.htm |archivedate=14 September 2011 }}</ref> In 1998, Steve Hogarth claimed this was the best album he had made with the band.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/aos.htm | title= Afraid of Sunlight Sleeve Notes|website=Marillion.com}}</ref>\n\n====''This Strange Engine'', ''Radiation'' and ''marillion.com'' (1996\u20131999)====\nWhat followed was a string of albums and events that saw Marillion struggling to find their place in the music business. ''[[This Strange Engine (Album)|This Strange Engine]]'' was released in 1997 with little promotion from their new label [[Castle Records]], and the band could not afford to make tour stops in the United States. Luckily, their dedicated US fan base decided to solve the problem by raising some $60,000 themselves online to give to the band to come to the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/press/anorak.htm |title=NEWS \u2013 Press Room \u2013 Anoraknophobia |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914094146/http://www.marillion.com/press/anorak.htm |archivedate=14 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The band's loyal fanbase (combined with the Internet) would eventually become vital to the band's existence.\n\nThe band's tenth album ''[[Radiation (Marillion album)|Radiation]]'' saw the band taking a different approach and was received by fans with mixed reactions.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n''[[marillion.com]]'' was released the following year and showed some progression in the new direction. The band were still unhappy with their record label situation.\n\n====''Anoraknophobia'' and ''Marbles'' (2000\u20132006)====\nThe band decided that they would try a radical experiment by asking their fans if they would help fund the recording of the next album by pre-ordering it before recording even started. The result was over 12,000 pre-orders which raised enough money to record and release ''[[Anoraknophobia]]'' in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/anorak.htm |title=MUSIC \u2013 Discography \u2013 Anoraknophobia |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> The band was able to strike a deal with EMI to also help distribute the album. This allowed Marillion to retain all the rights to their music while enjoying commercial distribution.  By this time the band had also parted company with their long-time manager, saving 20 per cent of the band's income.\n\nThe success of ''Anoraknophobia'' allowed the band to start recording their next album, but they decided to leverage their fanbase once again to help raise money towards marketing and promotion of a new album. The band put up the album for pre-order in mid-production. This time fans responded by pre-ordering 18,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/marbles.htm |title=MUSIC \u2013 Discography \u2013 Marbles |website=Marillion.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n''[[Marbles (album)|Marbles]]'' was released in 2004 with a 2-CD version that is only available at Marillion's website \u2013 a 'thank-you' gesture to the over 18,000 fans who pre-ordered it, and as even a further thanks to the fans, their names were credited in the sleeve notes (this 'thank you' to the fans also occurred with the previous album, Anoraknophobia).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n[[Image:MarillionEmpik2007.jpg|thumb|275px|right| Marillion in 2007, left to right: Steve Rothery, Steve Hogarth, Pete Trewavas (front row), Mark Kelly, Ian Mosley (back row)]] The band's management organised the biggest promotional schedule since they had left EMI and Steve Hogarth secured interviews with prominent broadcasters on [[BBC Radio]], including [[Matthew Wright (television presenter)|Matthew Wright]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]], [[Stuart Maconie]], [[Simon Mayo]] and [[Mark Lawson]].

Aware that it was unlikely to gain much mainstream radio airplay, the band released the single in three separate formats and encouraged fans to buy a copy of each to get the single into the UK Top Ten. The single reached No.&nbsp;7, making it the first Marillion song to reach the UK Top Ten since \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\" in 1987 and the band's first Top 40 entry since \"Beautiful\" in 1995. The second single from the album, \"Don't Hurt Yourself\", reached No.&nbsp;16. Following this, they released a download-only single, \"The Damage (live)\", recorded at the band's sell-out gig at the London Astoria. All of this succeeded in putting the band back in the public consciousness, making the campaign a success. Marillion continued to tour throughout 2005 playing several summer festivals and embarking on acoustic tours of both Europe and the United States, followed up by the \"Not Quite Christmas Tour\" of Europe throughout the end of 2005.\n\nA new DVD, ''Colours and Sound'', was released in Feb 2006, documenting the creation, promotion, release, and subsequent European tour in support of the album ''Marbles''.\n\n====''Somewhere Else'' and ''Happiness is the Road'' (2007\u20132008)====\nApril 2007 saw Marillion release their fourteenth studio album ''[[Somewhere Else (Marillion album)|Somewhere Else]]'', their first album in 10 years to make the UK Top No.&nbsp;30.  The success of the album was further underscored by that of the download-only single \"See it Like a Baby\", making UK No.&nbsp;45 (March 2007) and the traditional CD release of \"[[Thankyou Whoever You Are]] / Most Toys\", which made UK No.&nbsp;15 and No.&nbsp;6 in the Netherlands during June 2007.\n\nIn July 2008 the band posted a contest for fans to create a music video for the soon-to-be released single \"Whatever is Wrong with You\", and post it on YouTube.

It is another double album, with one disc based on a concept and the second containing the other songs that aren't a part of the theme. Before the album's release, on 9 September 2008, Marillion pre-released their album via p2p networks themselves. Upon attempting to play the downloaded files, users were shown a video from the band explaining why they had taken this route. Downloaders were then able to opt to purchase the album at a user-defined price or select to receive DRM-free files for free, in exchange for an email address. The band explained that although they do not support piracy, they realised their music would inevitably be distributed online anyway, and wanted to attempt to engage with p2p users and make the best of the situation.<ref>Marillion Press Release (11 September 2008) [http://www.antimusic.com/news/08/sep/11Marillion_Use_P2P_for_Album_Release.shtml \"Marillion Use P2P for Album Release]\" ''Anti Music''</ref>\n\n====''Less is More'' and ''Sounds That Can't Be Made'' (2009\u20132014) ====\nThe band's sixteenth studio album (released 2 October 2009) was an acoustic album featuring new arrangements of previously released tracks (except one, the new track: \"It's Not Your Fault\") entitled ''[[Less Is More (Marillion album)|Less Is More]]''.\n\nTheir seventeenth studio album, titled ''[[Sounds That Can't Be Made]]'', was released in September 2012. Two versions of the album were released: A 2-disc 'deluxe' version that included a DVD with 'making-of' features and sound-check recordings and a single CD jewel case version. The 'deluxe' version also included a 128-page book that incorporated lyrics, artwork and, as was the case with ''[[Anoraknophobia]]'', ''[[Marbles (album)|Marbles]]'' and ''[[Happiness is the Road]]'', the names of people who pre-ordered the album.

Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of [[Peter Gabriel]]-era [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and [[Mellotron]]-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by [[Mark Wilkinson]] used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.\n\nAs Jonh Wilde summarised in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1989: <blockquote>At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with \"[[Market Square Heroes]]\". There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going.  As [[punk rock|punk]] was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp.  When compared to [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|ELP]], they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked \u2013 \"[[Garden Party (Marillion song)|Garden Party]]\", \"[[Punch and Judy (song)|Punch and Judy]]\" and \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\". By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.<ref>Jonh Wilde. \"Fish - A Chip Off the Shoulder\". p 42-43. ''Melody Maker''. 28 October 1989</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe band's unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' in 1987, [[David Hepworth]] wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. ''[[Clutching at Straws]]'' suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.\"<ref>David Hepworth (July 1987) [http://fish-thecompany.com/disco/dacas.htm Review of ''Clutching at Straws''], ''Q Magazine'' (archived at [http://the-company.com Official Fish Site])</ref> In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: \"It's not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?\" He also argued that if the album ''[[Afraid of Sunlight]]'' \"had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.\"<ref>Dave Henderson ''Q'', August 1995.</ref> In ''[[Record Collector]]'' in 2002, Tim Jones argued they were \"one of the most unfairly berated bands in Britain\" and \"one of its best live rock acts.\"<ref>Tim Jones ''Record Collector'', May 2002.</ref> In 2004, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'''s [[Jon Hotten]] wrote: \"That genre thing has been a bugbear of Marillion's, but it no longer seems relevant. What are [[Radiohead]] if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\"<ref name=\"Jon Hotten 2004\"/> In the ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' & ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' Classic Special Edition ''[[Pink Floyd]] & The Story of Prog Rock'', an article on Marillion written by [[Mick Wall]] described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".<ref>Mick Wall ''Q Classic: Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock'', 2005.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Stephen Dalton of ''[[The Times]]'' stated: <blockquote>The band have just released their 14th album, ''[[Somewhere Else (Marillion album)|Somewhere Else]]'', which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like [[Coldplay]], ache like [[Radiohead]] and thunder like [[Muse (band)|Muse]], it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called ''[[Script for a Jester's Tear]]''.

He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\".

It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we'd changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It's such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a 'dinosaur prog band'. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven't listened to anything we've done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we've done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It's a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] they say: 'Sorry, we don't play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here's the new [[U2]] single.' I suppose it's something everyone has to cope with \u2013 every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years.

He was the father of [[Pocahontas]] and the lesser known \u201cDave Runs with Locs\u201d. Dave Loc etched his way out of Powhatan history when he dishonored his tribe by creating the 4th lokohoko, an ancient drink that possessed super natural properties and killed thousands. Dave Runs with Locs spent the rest of his days exiled living amongst forest beings and had 2 children  Hart runs with cakes and jimmy the unknown.\n\n==Name==\nIn 1607, the English colonists were introduced to Wahunsenacawh as Powhatan and understood this latter name to come from Powhatan's hometown near the falls of the [[James River]] near present-day [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Huber, Margaret Williamson (January 12, 2011). [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Powhatan_d_1618 \"Powhatan (d. 1618)\"]. [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/ Encyclopedia Virginia]. Retrieved February 18, 2011.</ref>\n\nSeventeenth-century English spellings were not standardized, and representations were many of the sounds of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language spoken by ''Wahunsenacawh'' and his people.  [[Charles Dudley Warner]], writing in the 19th century, but quoting extensively from John Smith's 17th-century writings, in his essay on [[Pocahontas]] states: \"In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with fighting and the savage delights of life. He had many names and titles; his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick, and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.\"  Many variants are used in texts:\n\n* The place,\n**Powhatan, Powatan, Powhaten, Pohetan, Powhattan, Poughwaton,\n* The description, weroance (chief?)\n**[[weroance]], weeroance, wyrounce, wyrounnces, werowance, wyroance, werowans\n* The name, \n**Wahunsunacock, Wahunsenasawk, Wahunsenacawh, Wahunsenacock, Wahunsenakah\n* The title, Mamanatowick (paramount- or great- chief)\n\n==Life==\nLittle is known of Powhatan's life before the arrival of English colonists in 1607. He apparently inherited the leadership of about 4-6 tribes, with its base at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] near present-day Richmond.

However, since Smith's 1608 and 1612 reports omitted this account, many historians have doubted its accuracy.

The modern-day interchange of [[Interstate 64]] and [[Interstate 295 (Virginia)|Interstate 295]] is near this location.  Sometime between 1611 and 1614, Powhatan moved further north to Matchut, in present-day [[King William County, Virginia|King William County]] on the north bank of the [[Pamunkey River]], near where his younger brother Opchanacanough ruled at Youghtanund.\n\nBy the time Smith left Virginia in 1609, the fragile peace between colonists and Algonquians was already beginning to fray. Soon conflict led to the [[First Anglo-Powhatan War]], and further English expansion beyond [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and into Powhatan's territory. The English effectively destroyed two subtribes, the [[Kecoughtan]] and the [[Paspahegh]], at the beginning of this war.  Powhatan sent [[Nemattanew]] to operate against the English on the upper James River, though they held out at [[Henricus]]. With the capture of Pocahontas by Captain [[Samuel Argall]] in 1613, Powhatan sued for peace.  It came about after her alliance in marriage on April 5, 1614 to [[John Rolfe]], a leading tobacco planter. John Rolfe was one of Pocahontas\u2019s many Jamestown teachers before their marriage; he instructed her in matters of the new culture she was being assimilated into, and he also taught her all about Christianity. According to various accounts, Pocahontas and John Rolfe did, in fact, fall in love with each other\u2014it was a consensual relationship.  This might, at least in part, explain Pocahontas\u2019s apparent willingness to assimilate, convert to Christianity and remain with the English: she wanted to be with Rolfe.<ref>Rountree, Helen.

The aged Powhatan's final years have been called \"ineffectual\" (Rountree 1990). Opchanacanough became the greater Native power in the region.  Upon the death of Wahunsunacock in 1618, his next younger brother Opitchapam officially became [[paramount chief]].  However, Opchanacanough, the youngest brother, had achieved the greatest power and effectively became the Powhatan.  By initiating the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]], and attacks in 1644, he attempted to force the English from Virginia.  These attempts met with strong reprisals from the English, ultimately resulting in the near destruction of the tribe.\n\nThrough his daughter Pocahontas (and her marriage to the English colonist John Rolfe), Wahunsunacock was the grandfather of [[Thomas Rolfe]].  In 1635 Rolfe returned to Virginia from England.  Although he was raised an Englishman, he did honor his Native American heritage and even visited his uncle, Opchanacanough, along with his aunt, \u201cCleopatra\u201d upon returning to Jamestown.

It allegedly belonged to Powhatan, although the evidence is questionable.  The Mantle is certainly one of the earliest North American artifacts to have survived in a European collection.  It must have originally belonged to a Native American of high social status, as it was decorated with numerous valuable native shell beads.<ref>[http://www.she-philosopher.com/gallery/powhatan-map.html she-philosopher.com: Gallery exhibit (Powhatan's map on deerskin mantle)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn his 1906 work ''Lives of Famous Chiefs'', Norman Wood described Powhatan, based on English reports.  He was said to be a \"tall, well-proportioned man with a sower looke, his head somewhat gray, his beard so thinne that it seemeth none at all, his age neare sixtie, of a very able and hardy body, to endure any labor.\" <ref>http://journals.aol.com/ondamitag/NorthernHistorically/entries/2008/08/01/powhatan-or-wah-un-so-na-cook.-part-1-of-2/5171  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917050111/http://journals.aol.com/ondamitag/NorthernHistorically/entries/2008/08/01/powhatan-or-wah-un-so-na-cook.-part-1-of-2/5171 |date=September 17, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Sites associated with Powhatan==\n*Powhatan's [[burial mound]] is located on the [[Pamunkey Indian Reservation]] in [[King William, Virginia|King William]]. The remains were relocated there by his brother, [[Opchanacanough]].\n*[[Powhatan County, Virginia|Powhatan County]], although located somewhat to the west of their territory, was named for Powhatan and his tribe.\n*In the independent [[Richmond, Virginia|City of Richmond]], Powhatan Hill is believed to be located near Powhatan's main village. It was ruled by a subject weroance called ''Parahunt'', or ''Tanx'' (\"little\") Powhatan. On first meeting him, the English mistook him for the Great Powhatan.  The confusion persists in historic accounts.\n* Powhatan's central village, [[Werowocomoco]], is believed to have been located in [[Gloucester County, Virginia]]. The Werowocomoco Archeological Site has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Excavations there have revealed much about the early Powhatan people and their interaction with English colonists.\n\n==Fictional representations==\n*[[Douglass Dumbrille]] was cast as Powhatan in the 1953 film ''[[Captain John Smith and Pocahontas]]''.\n*He was played by [[Michael Ansara]] in the ''[[TV Reader's Digest]]'' 1955 episode \"America's First Great Lady\".\n*[[Lakota people|Lakota]] actor [[Russell Means]] voiced Powhatan in the 1995 Disney animated film, ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' and its 1998 direct-to-video sequel ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]''.\n*Powhatan was played by Aboriginal Canadian actor [[Gordon Tootoosis]] in ''[[Pocahontas: The Legend]]'' in 1999.\n*He was played by Canadian actor [[August Schellenberg]] in [[Terrence Malick]]'s 2005 film ''[[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]]''.\n*He is also represented as a potential [[Continental Congress]] member in ''[[Civilization IV: Colonization]]''.\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box|onlinebooks=yes|lcheading=Powhatan, approximately 1550-1618}}\n*David A.
