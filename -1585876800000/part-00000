Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The GG, HRH, Duke of Connaught (& also Col. of the Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for men began Oct. 23, 1915. The 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year.  During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks.

Following a long period of economic crisis and class struggle, the \"grand comrpomise\" served as the foundation for the post-Second World War Nordic model of welfare and labor market organization. The key characteristics of the Nordic model were the centralized coordination of wage negotiation between employers and labor organizations, termed a social partnership, as well as providing a peaceful means to address class conflict between capital and labor.<ref name=ThePoliticalOriginsofInequality1>{{cite book |last= Simon Reid|first= Henry|author-link= |date= December 23, 2015|title= The Political Origins of Inequality: Why a More Equal World Is Better for Us All |url= |location= |publisher= University of Chicago Press |page= 132 |isbn= 978-0226236797|quote=The dynamics were slightly different in each country. The social welfare reforms that emerged out of the Kanslergae Agreement in Denmark in 1933 came at the height of the interwar economic crisis and was part of a wider compromise package to save the Danish economy. It was a coincidence, but a telling one, that on the same day that the agreement was ratified, Hitler was appointed chanceller of the Reich in Berlin, convinced that he had a better way of saving the economy. In Sweden, the politics of grand compromise were pushed forward with the so-called Basic Agreement \u2013 essentially a commitment to the spirit of give-and-take in labour disputes- signed by the employer and labour union associations at the unprepossessing seaside retreat of Saltsjobaden in 1938\u2026But in truth the Agreement was the foundation for the relative industrial harmony that would mark Scandinavian industrial relations throughout Europe\u2019s Golden Age. In Norway, the empowerment of women as well as workers was key. Women workers marched in 1905 and achieved limited suffrage in 1907, with full suffrage coming in 1913, some five years before it came to Sweden.}}</ref>\n\nAlthough often linked to social democratic governance, the Nordic model's parentage actually stems from a mixture of social democratic, centrist and [[right wing]] political parties along with the social trust that emerged from the \"great compromise\" between capital and labor. The influence of each of these factors on each Nordic country varied; for example, social democratic parties played a larger role in the formation of the Nordic model in Sweden and Norway, whereas in Iceland and Finland right-wing political parties played a much more significant role in shaping their countries' social models.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dolvik, Flotten, Hippe, Jordfald |first= Jon Erik, Tone, Jon M., Bard|title= The Nordic Model towards 2030: A New Chapter?

In Sweden, Denmark and Norway, where the social democrats held power for large periods from the 1930s onwards, that description fits better than it does for Finland and Iceland, where centrist and right-leaning parties have set the terms of debate. But in these countries, too, the building of strong labour unions \u2013 in line with Walter Korpi\u2019s power resource mobilization thesis (Korpi 1981) \u2013 was crucial to the central role of labour and employer organizations in developing universal welfare schemes. A variety of modern social security programmes, whether sickness benefits or pensions, first appeared in negotiated collective agreements. It is moreover likely that inspirational ideas and learning experiences that passed between Nordic countries also transcended party lines within these countries.The political underpinnings of the Nordic model have thus been built on broadbased power mobilization and a higher degree of balance between the core interests in society than is evident in most other countries.}}</ref>\n\nSocial security and collective wage bargaining policies were rolled back following economic imbalances in the 1980s and the financial crises of the 1990s, which led to more restrictive budgetary policies that were most pronounced in Sweden and Iceland. Nonetheless welfare expenditure remained high in these countries compared to the European average.<ref name=NordicModelArrivalandDecline1 />\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden, the grand compromise was pushed forward by the [[Saltsj\u00f6baden Agreement]] signed by employer and labor union associations at the seaside retreat of Saltsjobaden in 1938. This agreement provided the foundation for Scandinavian industrial relations throughout Europle's [[Golden age of capitalism|golden age]]. The Swedish model of capitalism developed under the auspices of the Social Democratic Party (SAP), which assumed power in 1932 and retained uninterrupted power until the 1976. Initially differing very little from other industrialized capitalist countries, the state's role in providing comprehensive welfare and infrastructure expanded after the Second World War until reaching a broadly [[social liberal]] consensus in the 1950s.<ref name=ThePoliticalOriginsofInequality1 />\n\nIn the 1950s, [[Olof Palme]] and Prime Minister [[Tage Erlander]] formulated the basis of Swedish social democracy and what would become known as the \u201cSwedish model\u201d, drawing inspiration not from reformist socialism but from the American economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and the liberal ideas he articulated in ''The Affluent Society''. The ideological basis of the Swedish \u201caffluent society\u201d rested on a universal welfare state providing citizens with economic security whilst simultaneously promoting social solidarity, representing a break with earlier notions of [[Means test|selective welfare provision]] in Sweden. The Swedish model was characterized by a strong labor movement as well as inclusive publicly-funded and often publicly-administered welfare institutions. \n\nBy the early 1980s the Swedish model began to suffer from international imbalances, declining competitiveness and capital flight. Two polar opposite solutions emerged to restructure the Swedish economy, the first being a transition to socialism by [[Social ownership|socializing the ownership]] of industry and the second providing favorable conditions for the formation of private capital by embracing neoliberalism. The Swedish model was first challenged in 1976 by the Meidner Plan promoted by the Swedish Labor Organization (LO) and trade unions, which aimed at the gradual socialization of Swedish companies through wage earner funds. The Meidner Plan aimed to collectivize capital formation in two generations by having the wage earner funds own predominant stakes in Swedish corporations on behalf of workers. This proposal was rejected by Olaf Palme and the Social Democratic party leadership.<ref>{{cite book |last= O'Hara|first= Phillip|title= Encyclopedia of Political Economy: L-Z|publisher= Routledge|date=March 19, 1999|isbn= 978-0415154260|page = 1248|quote=The critical issues were perhaps revealed most clearly in the Swedish case. Among the most advanced of the social welfare states, Sweden in the early 1980s faced a pivotal choice between capitalism and the transition to socialism. In the discourse focused upon its nagging problems of international imbalances, declining competitiveness, and capital flight, two polar solutions emerged. Olaf Palme supported an aggressive use of workers\u2019 funds, by which capital formation would have been largely collectivized in two generations. The funds would have come to own predominant stakes in Swedish corporations on behalf of workers. The other alternative was to retrench the welfare state and provide conditions favorable to private capitals formation. Palme\u2019s proposal appears never to have garnered widespread support and was left with no champion in t he wake of his assassination.}}</ref>\n\nUpon returning to power in 1982, the Social Democratic party inherited a slowing economy resulting from the end of the post-war boom. The social democrats adopted [[Monetarism|monetarist]] and neoliberal policies, deregulating the banking industry and liberalizing currency in the 1980s. The economic crisis of the 1990s saw greater austerity measures, deregulation and the privatization of public services.\n\n===Norway===\nNorway's \"grand compromise\" emerged as a response to the crisis of the early 1930s between the trade union confederation and Norwegian Employers' Association, agreeing on national standards in labor-capital relations and creating the foundation for social harmony throughout the compromises' period. Since the 1980s, Norway has undergone more neoliberal reforms and marketization than Sweden since the 1980s, with the traditional foundations for supporting the \"social democratic compromise\" being specific to Western capitalism between 1945-1973.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Fagerberg|first1= Jan|last2= Cappelen|first2= Adne|last3= Mj\u00f8set|first3= Lars|last4= Skarstein|first4= Rune|date= May 1990|title= The Decline of Social-Democratic State Capitalism in Norway|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271521097_The_Decline_of_Social-Democratic_State_Capitalism_in_Norway|journal= New Left Review|volume= |issue= |pages= 60-94|doi= |access-date= 30 March 2020|quote=Norway has, together with Sweden, often been idealized as the most successful case of postwar social democracy...the neo-liberal 'blue wave' which rolled over Western Europe in the 1980s has had considerably greater impact in Norway than in Sweden, combining with the pressures of a destabilized international economy to threaten many of the postwar structures.

[...] The main debate in economic reform should therefore be about the means of transition, not the ends. Eastern Europe will still argue over the ends: for example, whether to aim for Swedish-style social democracy or Thatcherite liberalism. But that can wait.

They point out that Nordic social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement]] to sustain the heavy redistribution required, arguing that it is idealistic to think similar levels of redistribution can be accomplished in countries with weaker labour movements. They note that even in the Scandinavian countries social democracy has been in decline since the weakening of the labour movement in the early 1990s, arguing that the sustainability of social democracy is limited. Roemer and Bardham argue that establishing a [[Market socialism|market socialist]] economy by changing enterprise ownership would be more effective than social democratic redistribution at promoting egalitarian outcomes, particularly in countries with weak labour movements.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation |first1=Pranab |last1=Bardhan |first2=Johen E. |last2=Roemer |year=1992 |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=6 |number=3 |page=104 |quote=[W]e believe that social democracy requires rather special political circumstances that are absent in many countries for which our market socialism proposal may be feasible.

The labour market was rife with conflict and strikes more frequent than in Europe, resulting in strained government\u2013trade union relationship. Secondly, Iceland did not share the Nordic tradition of power-sharing or corporatism as regards labour market policies or macro-economic policy management, primarily because of the weakness of Social Democrats and the Left in general.

When looking exclusively at wages (before taxes and transfers), Danish and American social mobility are very similar. It is only after taxes and transfers are taken into account that Danish social mobility improves, indicating that Danish economic redistribution policies simply give the impression of greater mobility. Additionally, Denmark's greater investment in public education did not improve educational mobility significantly, meaning children of non-college educated parents are still unlikely to receive college education, though this public investment did result in improved cognitive skills amongst poor Danish children compared to their American peers. There was evidence that generous welfare policies could discourage the pursuit of higher-level education due to decreasing the economic benefits that college education level jobs offer and increasing welfare for workers of a lower education level.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Rasmus |last1=Landers\u00f8n |first2=James J. |last2=Heckman |title=The Scandinavian Fantasy: The Sources of Intergenerational Mobility in Denmark and the US |journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] |volume=119 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=178\u2013230 |doi=10.1111/sjoe.12219 |pmid=28649168 |pmc=5476927 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w22465.pdf }}</ref>\n\n== Political ideologies in the Nordic countries ==\nAccording to sociologist [[Lane Kenworthy]], the ideology of the Nordic labour parties in the context of the Nordic model of [[social democracy]] refers to a set of policies for promoting economic security and opportunity within the framework of capitalism rather than a replacement for capitalism.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/140345/lane-kenworthy/americas-social-democratic-future |title=America's Social Democratic Future |journal=Foreign Affairs |issue=January/February 2014 |last=Kenworthy |first=Lane |date=January 2014 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Collective bargaining]]\n* [[Flexicurity]]\n* ''[[Folkhemmet]]''\n* [[Mixed economy]] \n* [[Nefco]]\n* [[Polder model]] \n* [[Prostitution in Sweden]]\n* [[Social corporatism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Social market economy]]\n* [[Swedish welfare]]\n* [[Welfare capitalism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n=== Lists ===\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Corruption Perceptions Index]]\n* [[Democracy Index]]\n* [[Global Peace Index]]\n* [[Human Development Index]]\n* [[Legatum Prosperity Index]]\n* [[List of countries by GDP per capita]]\n* [[List of countries by income equality]]\n* [[List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI]]\n* [[List of countries by life expectancy]]\n* [[List of countries by wealth per adult]]\n* [[List of international rankings]]\n* [[Press Freedom Index]]\n* [[Quality-of-Life Index]]\n* [[Social Progress Index]]\n* [[World Happiness Report]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Blyth, M.

Following a long period of economic crisis and class struggle, the \"grand comrpomise\" served as the foundation for the post-Second World War Nordic model of welfare and labor market organization. The key characteristics of the Nordic model were the centralized coordination of wage negotiation between employers and labor organizations, termed a social partnership, as well as providing a peaceful means to address class conflict between capital and labor.<ref name=ThePoliticalOriginsofInequality1>{{cite book |last= Simon Reid|first= Henry|author-link= |date= December 23, 2015|title= The Political Origins of Inequality: Why a More Equal World Is Better for Us All |url= |location= |publisher= University of Chicago Press |page= 132 |isbn= 978-0226236797|quote=The dynamics were slightly different in each country. The social welfare reforms that emerged out of the Kanslergae Agreement in Denmark in 1933 came at the height of the interwar economic crisis and was part of a wider compromise package to save the Danish economy. It was a coincidence, but a telling one, that on the same day that the agreement was ratified, Hitler was appointed chanceller of the Reich in Berlin, convinced that he had a better way of saving the economy. In Sweden, the politics of grand compromise were pushed forward with the so-called Basic Agreement \u2013 essentially a commitment to the spirit of give-and-take in labour disputes- signed by the employer and labour union associations at the unprepossessing seaside retreat of Saltsjobaden in 1938\u2026But in truth the Agreement was the foundation for the relative industrial harmony that would mark Scandinavian industrial relations throughout Europe\u2019s Golden Age. In Norway, the empowerment of women as well as workers was key. Women workers marched in 1905 and achieved limited suffrage in 1907, with full suffrage coming in 1913, some five years before it came to Sweden.}}</ref>\n\nAlthough often linked to social democratic governance, the Nordic model's parentage actually stems from a mixture of social democratic, centrist and [[right wing]] political parties along with the social trust that emerged from the \"great compromise\" between capital and labor. The influence of each of these factors on each Nordic country varied; for example, social democratic parties played a larger role in the formation of the Nordic model in Sweden and Norway, whereas in Iceland and Finland right-wing political parties played a much more significant role in shaping their countries' social models.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dolvik, Flotten, Hippe, Jordfald |first= Jon Erik, Tone, Jon M., Bard|title= The Nordic Model towards 2030: A New Chapter? NordMod2030|publisher= |date=2015|isbn= 978-82-324-0185-7 |page = 23|quote= The Nordic model therefore cannot exclusively be tied to social democratic party support and political dominance. In Sweden, Denmark and Norway, where the social democrats held power for large periods from the 1930s onwards, that description fits better than it does for Finland and Iceland, where centrist and right-leaning parties have set the terms of debate. But in these countries, too, the building of strong labour unions \u2013 in line with Walter Korpi\u2019s power resource mobilization thesis (Korpi 1981) \u2013 was crucial to the central role of labour and employer organizations in developing universal welfare schemes. A variety of modern social security programmes, whether sickness benefits or pensions, first appeared in negotiated collective agreements. It is moreover likely that inspirational ideas and learning experiences that passed between Nordic countries also transcended party lines within these countries.The political underpinnings of the Nordic model have thus been built on broadbased power mobilization and a higher degree of balance between the core interests in society than is evident in most other countries.}}</ref>\n\nSocial security and collective wage bargaining policies were rolled back following economic imbalances in the 1980s and the financial crises of the 1990s, which led to more restrictive budgetary policies that were most pronounced in Sweden and Iceland. Nonetheless welfare expenditure remained high in these countries compared to the European average.<ref name=NordicModelArrivalandDecline1 />\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden, the grand compromise was pushed forward by the [[Saltsj\u00f6baden Agreement]] signed by employer and labor union associations at the seaside retreat of Saltsjobaden in 1938. This agreement provided the foundation for Scandinavian industrial relations throughout Europle's [[Golden age of capitalism|golden age]]. The Swedish model of capitalism developed under the auspices of the Social Democratic Party (SAP), which assumed power in 1932 and retained uninterrupted power until the 1976. Initially differing very little from other industrialized capitalist countries, the state's role in providing comprehensive welfare and infrastructure expanded after the Second World War until reaching a broadly [[social liberal]] consensus in the 1950s.<ref name=ThePoliticalOriginsofInequality1 />\n\nIn the 1950s, [[Olof Palme]] and Prime Minister [[Tage Erlander]] formulated the basis of Swedish social democracy and what would become known as the \u201cSwedish model\u201d, drawing inspiration not from reformist socialism but from the American economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and the liberal ideas he articulated in ''The Affluent Society''. The ideological basis of the Swedish \u201caffluent society\u201d rested on a universal welfare state providing citizens with economic security whilst simultaneously promoting social solidarity, representing a break with earlier notions of [[Means test|selective welfare provision]] in Sweden. The Swedish model was characterized by a strong labor movement as well as inclusive publicly-funded and often publicly-administered welfare institutions. \n\nBy the early 1980s the Swedish model began to suffer from international imbalances, declining competitiveness and capital flight. Two polar opposite solutions emerged to restructure the Swedish economy, the first being a transition to socialism by [[Social ownership|socializing the ownership]] of industry and the second providing favorable conditions for the formation of private capital by embracing neoliberalism. The Swedish model was first challenged in 1976 by the Meidner Plan promoted by the Swedish Labor Organization (LO) and trade unions, which aimed at the gradual socialization of Swedish companies through wage earner funds. The Meidner Plan aimed to collectivize capital formation in two generations by having the wage earner funds own predominant stakes in Swedish corporations on behalf of workers. This proposal was rejected by Olaf Palme and the Social Democratic party leadership.<ref>{{cite book |last= O'Hara|first= Phillip|title= Encyclopedia of Political Economy: L-Z|publisher= Routledge|date=March 19, 1999|isbn= 978-0415154260|page = 1248|quote=The critical issues were perhaps revealed most clearly in the Swedish case. Among the most advanced of the social welfare states, Sweden in the early 1980s faced a pivotal choice between capitalism and the transition to socialism. In the discourse focused upon its nagging problems of international imbalances, declining competitiveness, and capital flight, two polar solutions emerged. Olaf Palme supported an aggressive use of workers\u2019 funds, by which capital formation would have been largely collectivized in two generations. The funds would have come to own predominant stakes in Swedish corporations on behalf of workers. The other alternative was to retrench the welfare state and provide conditions favorable to private capitals formation. Palme\u2019s proposal appears never to have garnered widespread support and was left with no champion in t he wake of his assassination.}}</ref>\n\nUpon returning to power in 1982, the Social Democratic party inherited a slowing economy resulting from the end of the post-war boom. The social democrats adopted [[Monetarism|monetarist]] and neoliberal policies, deregulating the banking industry and liberalizing currency in the 1980s. The economic crisis of the 1990s saw greater austerity measures, deregulation and the privatization of public services.\n\n===Norway===\nNorway's \"grand compromise\" emerged as a response to the crisis of the early 1930s between the trade union confederation and Norwegian Employers' Association, agreeing on national standards in labor-capital relations and creating the foundation for social harmony throughout the compromises' period. Since the 1980s, Norway has undergone more neoliberal reforms and marketization than Sweden since the 1980s, with the traditional foundations for supporting the \"social democratic compromise\" being specific to Western capitalism between 1945-1973.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Fagerberg|first1= Jan|last2= Cappelen|first2= Adne|last3= Mj\u00f8set|first3= Lars|last4= Skarstein|first4= Rune|date= May 1990|title= The Decline of Social-Democratic State Capitalism in Norway|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271521097_The_Decline_of_Social-Democratic_State_Capitalism_in_Norway|journal= New Left Review|volume= |issue= |pages= 60-94|doi= |access-date= 30 March 2020|quote=Norway has, together with Sweden, often been idealized as the most successful case of postwar social democracy...the neo-liberal 'blue wave' which rolled over Western Europe in the 1980s has had considerably greater impact in Norway than in Sweden, combining with the pressures of a destabilized international economy to threaten many of the postwar structures.

American professor of sociology and political science [[Lane Kenworthy]] advocates for the United States to make a gradual transition toward a social democracy similar to those of the Nordic countries, defining social democracy as such: \"The idea behind social democracy was to make capitalism better. There is disagreement about how exactly to do that, and others might think the proposals in my book aren't true social democracy.

[...] The main debate in economic reform should therefore be about the means of transition, not the ends. Eastern Europe will still argue over the ends: for example, whether to aim for Swedish-style social democracy or Thatcherite liberalism. But that can wait. Sweden and Britain alike have nearly complete private ownership, private financial markets and active labour markets. Eastern Europe today [in 1990] has none of these institutions; for it, the alternative models of Western Europe are almost identical.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13002085 |work=The Economist |date=13 January 1990 |title=What is to be done?|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Danish Prime Minister [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]] addressed the American misconception that the Nordic model is a form of socialism, stating: \"I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism.

They point out that Nordic social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement]] to sustain the heavy redistribution required, arguing that it is idealistic to think similar levels of redistribution can be accomplished in countries with weaker labour movements. They note that even in the Scandinavian countries social democracy has been in decline since the weakening of the labour movement in the early 1990s, arguing that the sustainability of social democracy is limited. Roemer and Bardham argue that establishing a [[Market socialism|market socialist]] economy by changing enterprise ownership would be more effective than social democratic redistribution at promoting egalitarian outcomes, particularly in countries with weak labour movements.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation |first1=Pranab |last1=Bardhan |first2=Johen E. |last2=Roemer |year=1992 |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=6 |number=3 |page=104 |quote=[W]e believe that social democracy requires rather special political circumstances that are absent in many countries for which our market socialism proposal may be feasible. Since it (social democracy) permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now.|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian Gu\u00f0mundur J\u00f3nsson argues that it would be inaccurate to include Iceland in one aspect of the Nordic model, that of [[consensus democracy]]. He writes that \"Icelandic democracy is better described as more adversarial than consensual in style and practice. The labour market was rife with conflict and strikes more frequent than in Europe, resulting in strained government\u2013trade union relationship. Secondly, Iceland did not share the Nordic tradition of power-sharing or corporatism as regards labour market policies or macro-economic policy management, primarily because of the weakness of Social Democrats and the Left in general. Thirdly, the legislative process did not show a strong tendency towards consensus-building between government and opposition with regard to government seeking consultation or support for key legislation. Fourthly, the political style in legislative procedures and public debate in general tended to be adversarial rather than consensual in nature\".<ref>{{cite journal|title = Iceland and the Nordic Model of Consensus Democracy |journal = Scandinavian Journal of History|date = 8 August 2014|issn = 0346-8755|pages = 510\u2013528|volume = 39|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/03468755.2014.935473|first = Gu\u00f0mundur|last = J\u00f3nsson}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2017 study, economists Rasmus Landers\u00f8n and James J. Heckman compared American and Danish social mobility and found that social mobility is not as high as figures might suggest in the Nordic countries{{em dash}}although they did find that Denmark ranks higher in income mobility. When looking exclusively at wages (before taxes and transfers), Danish and American social mobility are very similar. It is only after taxes and transfers are taken into account that Danish social mobility improves, indicating that Danish economic redistribution policies simply give the impression of greater mobility. Additionally, Denmark's greater investment in public education did not improve educational mobility significantly, meaning children of non-college educated parents are still unlikely to receive college education, though this public investment did result in improved cognitive skills amongst poor Danish children compared to their American peers. There was evidence that generous welfare policies could discourage the pursuit of higher-level education due to decreasing the economic benefits that college education level jobs offer and increasing welfare for workers of a lower education level.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Rasmus |last1=Landers\u00f8n |first2=James J. |last2=Heckman |title=The Scandinavian Fantasy: The Sources of Intergenerational Mobility in Denmark and the US |journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] |volume=119 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=178\u2013230 |doi=10.1111/sjoe.12219 |pmid=28649168 |pmc=5476927 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w22465.pdf }}</ref>\n\n== Political ideologies in the Nordic countries ==\nAccording to sociologist [[Lane Kenworthy]], the ideology of the Nordic labour parties in the context of the Nordic model of [[social democracy]] refers to a set of policies for promoting economic security and opportunity within the framework of capitalism rather than a replacement for capitalism.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/140345/lane-kenworthy/americas-social-democratic-future |title=America's Social Democratic Future |journal=Foreign Affairs |issue=January/February 2014 |last=Kenworthy |first=Lane |date=January 2014 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Collective bargaining]]\n* [[Flexicurity]]\n* ''[[Folkhemmet]]''\n* [[Mixed economy]] \n* [[Nefco]]\n* [[Polder model]] \n* [[Prostitution in Sweden]]\n* [[Social corporatism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Social market economy]]\n* [[Swedish welfare]]\n* [[Welfare capitalism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n=== Lists ===\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Corruption Perceptions Index]]\n* [[Democracy Index]]\n* [[Global Peace Index]]\n* [[Human Development Index]]\n* [[Legatum Prosperity Index]]\n* [[List of countries by GDP per capita]]\n* [[List of countries by income equality]]\n* [[List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI]]\n* [[List of countries by life expectancy]]\n* [[List of countries by wealth per adult]]\n* [[List of international rankings]]\n* [[Press Freedom Index]]\n* [[Quality-of-Life Index]]\n* [[Social Progress Index]]\n* [[World Happiness Report]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Blyth, M.
