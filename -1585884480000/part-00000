In the 16th century, the word assumed the meaning of a person, mostly a woman, one who delights in idle talk, a newsmonger, a tattler.<ref>[[OED]]</ref> In the early 19th century, the term was extended from the talker to the conversation of such persons. The verb ''to gossip'', meaning \"to be a gossip\", first appears in [[Shakespeare]].\n\nThe term originates from the bedroom at the time of childbirth. Giving birth used to be a social event exclusively attended by women. The pregnant woman's female relatives and neighbours would congregate and idly converse. Over time, gossip came to mean talk of others.<ref>\"If Walls Could Talk: The History of the Home (Bedroom), Lucy Worsley,  BBC\"</ref>\n\nOthers say that gossip comes from the same root as \"gospel\" \u2014 it is a contraction of \"good spiel\", meaning a good story.\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:No chat.jpg|thumb|This Soviet [[World War II posters from the Soviet Union|war poster]] conveys the message: \"Don't chatter!

Agin, Swiggart & Agin, LLC, Mass High Tech, November 18, 1996.</ref> Low [[self-esteem]] and a desire to \"fit in\" are frequently cited as motivations for workplace gossip.\nThere are five essential functions that gossip has in the workplace (according to DiFonzo & Bordia):\n* Helps individuals learn social information about other individuals in the organization (often without even having to meet the other individual)\n* Builds social networks of individuals by bonding co-workers together and affiliating people with each other.\n* Breaks existing bonds by ostracizing individuals within an organization.\n* Enhances one's social status/power/prestige within the organization.\n* Inform individuals as to what is considered socially acceptable behavior within the organization.\n\nAccording to Kurkland and Pelled, workplace [https://www.gossip99.com/ gossip] can be very serious depending upon the amount of [[Power (social and political)|power]] that the gossiper has over the recipient, which will in turn affect how the gossip is interpreted. There are four types of power that are influenced by gossip:\n* '''Coercive:''' when a gossiper tells negative information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread negative information about them. This causes the gossiper's coercive power to increase.\n* '''Reward:''' when a gossiper tells positive information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread positive information about them. This causes the gossiper's reward power to increase.\n* '''Expert:''' when a gossiper seems to have very detailed knowledge of either the organization's values or about others in the work environment, their expert power becomes enhanced.\n* '''Referent:''' this power can either be reduced OR enhanced to a point. When people view gossiping as a petty activity done to waste time, a gossiper's referent power can decrease along with their reputation. When a recipient is thought of as being invited into a social circle by being a recipient, the gossiper's referent power can increase, but only to a high point where then the recipient begins to resent the gossiper (Kurland & Pelled).\n\nSome negative consequences of workplace [http://www.gossip99.com/ gossip] may include:<ref>[http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf Workplace Gossip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127130859/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, Kit Hennessy, LPC, CEAP.</ref>\n* Lost productivity and wasted time,\n* Erosion of trust and morale,\n* Increased anxiety among employees as rumors circulate without any clear information as to what is fact and what isn\u2019t,\n* Growing divisiveness among employees as people \u201ctake sides,\"\n* Hurt feelings and reputations,\n* Jeopardized chances for the gossipers' advancement as they are perceived as unprofessional, and\n* Attrition as good employees leave the company due to the unhealthy work atmosphere.\nTurner and Weed theorize that among the three main types of responders to [[workplace conflict]] are attackers who cannot keep their feelings to themselves and express their feelings by attacking whatever they can. Attackers are further divided into up-front attackers and behind-the-back attackers. Turner and Weed note that the latter \"are difficult to handle because the target person is not sure of the source of any criticism, nor even always sure that there is criticism.\"<ref>Conflict in organizations: Practical solutions any manager can use; Turner, Stephen P. (University of South Florida); Weed, Frank; 1983.</ref>\n\nIt is possible however, that there may be illegal, unethical, or disobedient behavior happening at the workplace and this may be a case where reporting the behavior may be viewed as gossip. It is then left up to the authority in charge to fully investigate the matter and not simply look past the report and assume it to be workplace gossip.\n\nInformal networks through which communication occurs in an organization are sometimes called the [[grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]. In a study done by Harcourt, Richerson, and Wattier, it was found that middle managers in several different organizations believed that gathering information from the grapevine was a much better way of learning information than through formal communication with their subordinates (Harcourt, Richerson & Wattier).\n\n\n \n==Various views==\nSome see gossip as trivial, hurtful and socially and/or intellectually unproductive. Some people view gossip as a lighthearted way of spreading information. A [[feminism|feminist]] definition of gossip presents it as \"a way of talking between women, intimate in style, personal and domestic in scope and setting, a female cultural event which springs from and perpetuates the restrictions of the female role, but also gives the comfort of validation.\" (Jones, 1990:243)\n\n===In early modern England===\n<!-- this section might fit better in an as-yet non-existent article called something like [[gossip (companion)]] -->\n\nIn [[Early Modern Britain|Early Modern England]] the word \"[https://www.gossip99.com/ gossip]\" referred to companions in [[childbirth]], not limited to the [[midwife]]. It also became a term for women-friends generally, with no necessary derogatory connotations. (OED n. definition 2. a. \"A familiar acquaintance, friend, chum\", supported by references from 1361 to 1873). It commonly referred to an informal local [[sorority]] or social group, who could enforce socially acceptable behaviour through private censure or through public rituals, such as \"[[rough music]]\", the [[cucking stool]] and the [[skimmington ride]].\n\nIn [[Thomas Harman]]\u2019s ''Caveat for Common Cursitors'' 1566 a \u2018[[Thieves' cant|walking mort]]\u2019 relates how she was forced to agree to meet a man in his barn, but informed his wife. The wife arrived with her \u201cfive furious, sturdy, muffled gossips\u201d who catch the errant husband with \u201chis hosen about his legs\u201d and give him a sound beating. The story clearly functions as a [[morality tale]] in which the gossips uphold the [[social order]].<ref>Bernard Capp, ''When Gossips Meet: Women, Family and Neighbourhood in Early Modern England'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|0-19-925598-9}}</ref>\n\nIn Sir Herbert Maxwell Bart's The Chevalier of the Splendid Crest [1900] at the end of chapter three the king is noted as referring to his loyal knight \"Sir Thomas de Roos\" in kindly terms as \"my old gossip\". Whilst a historical novel of that time the reference implies a continued use of the term \"Gossip\" as childhood friend as late as 1900.\n\n===In Judaism===\n{{main article|Lashon hara}}\nJudaism considers gossip spoken without a constructive purpose (known in Hebrew as an [[evil tongue]], ''lashon hara'') as a [[sin]]. Speaking negatively about people, even if retelling true facts, counts as sinful, as it demeans the dignity of man \u2014 both the speaker and the subject of the gossip.\nAccording to ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]'' 18:8: \"The words of a gossip are like choice morsels: they go down to a man's innermost parts.\"\n\n===In Christianity===\nThe Christian perspective on gossip is typically based on modern cultural assumptions of the phenomenon, especially the assumption that generally speaking, gossip is negative speech.<ref>Meng, Margaret (2008). \"Gossip: Killing Us Softly.\" ''Homiletic and Pastoral Review'' 109. pp. 26-31.</ref><ref>Sedler, M.D. (2001).

(2007). \"Gossip in the New Testament.\" ''The New Testament in Cross-Cultural Perspective.'' Eugene: Cascade Books.</ref> Of course, this does not mean that there are ''not'' numerous texts in the New Testament that see gossip as dangerous negative speech.\n\nThus, for example, the [[Epistle to the Romans]] associates gossips (\"backbiters\") with a list of sins including sexual immorality and with murder:\n\n<blockquote>\n:28: And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;\n:29: Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,\n:30: Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,\n:31: Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:\n:32: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. (Romans 1:28-32)\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Matthew 18]], Jesus also taught that conflict resolution among church members ought to begin with the aggrieved party attempting to resolve their dispute with the offending party alone. Only if this did not work would the process escalate to the next step, in which another church member would become involved. After that if the person at fault still would not \"hear\", the matter was to be fully investigated by the church elders, and if not resolved to be then exposed publicly.\n\nBased on texts like these portraying [http://www.gossip99.com/ gossip] negatively, many Christian authors generalize on the phenomenon. So, in order to gossip, writes Phil Fox Rose, we \"must harden our heart towards the 'out' person. We draw a line between ourselves and them; define them as being outside the rules of Christian charity... We create a gap between ourselves and God's Love.\" As we harden our heart towards more people and groups, he continues, \"this negativity and feeling of separateness will grow and permeate our world, and we'll find it more difficult to access God\u2019s love in any aspect of our lives.\"<ref>Phil Fox Rose, [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/philfoxrose/2012/10/gossip-hardens-our-hearts/ \"Gossip hardens our hearts\"], ''Patheos''. Accessed February 23, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe New Testament is also in favor of group accountability (Ephesians 5:11; 1st Tim 5:20; James 5:16; Gal 6:1-2; 1 Cor 12:26), which may be associated with gossip.\n\n===In Islam===\n\nIslam considers [[backbiting]] the equivalent of eating the flesh of one's dead brother. According to Muslims, backbiting harms its victims without offering them any chance of defense, just as dead people cannot defend against their flesh being eaten. Muslims are expected to treat others like brothers (regardless of their beliefs, skin color, gender, or ethnic origin), deriving from Islam's concept of brotherhood amongst its believers.\n\n===In Bahai Faith===\n\nBahais consider backbiting to be the \"worst human quality and the most great sin...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FBackbiting|website=Bahai Quotes.com|accessdate=11 November 2017|title=Backbiting|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924224839/http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FBackbiting|archive-date=24 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Therefore, even murder would be considered less reprobate than backbiting. [[Baha'u'llah]] stated, \"Backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul.\"  When someone kills another, it only affects their physical condition.  However, when someone gossips, it affects one in a different manner.\n\n==In psychology==\n\n===Evolutionary view===\nFrom [[Robin Dunbar]]'s evolutionary theories, gossip originated to help bond the groups that were constantly growing in size. To survive, individuals need alliances; but as these alliances grew larger, it was difficult if not impossible to physically connect with everyone. Conversation and language were able to bridge this gap. Gossip became a social interaction that helped the group gain information about other individuals without personally speaking to them. \u00a0\n\nIt enabled people to keep up with what was going on in their social network. It also creates a bond between the teller and the hearer, as they share information of mutual interest and spend time together. It also helps the hearer learn about another individual\u2019s behavior and helps them have a more effective approach to their relationship. Dunbar (2004) found that 65% of conversations consist of social topics.<ref name=\"Dunbar\">Dunbar, R. (2004). Gossip in evolutionary perspective. Review of General Psychology, 8(2), 100-110.</ref>\n\nDunbar (1994) argues that gossip is the equivalent of [[social grooming]] often observed in other primate species.<ref name=\"Dunbar, R.I.M. 1994\">Dunbar, R.I.M.

(2004). Research on gossip: Taxonomy, methods, and future directions. Review of General Psychology, 8 (2), 78-99.</ref>\nFurther support for the evolutionary significance of gossip comes from a recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal, [[Science (journal)|Science]] Anderson and colleagues (2011) found that faces paired with negative social information dominate visual consciousness to a greater extent than positive and neutral social information during a binocular rivalry task. \n\n[[Binocular rivalry]] occurs when two different stimuli are presented to each eye simultaneously and the two percepts compete for dominance in visual consciousness. While this occurs, an individual will consciously perceive one of the percepts while the other is suppressed. After a time, the other percept will become dominant and an individual will become aware of the second percept. Finally, the two percepts will alternate back and forth in terms of visual awareness. \n\nThe study by Anderson and colleagues (2011) indicates that higher order cognitive processes, like evaluative information processing, can influence early visual processing. That only negative social information differentially affected the dominance of the faces during the task alludes to the unique importance of knowing information about an individual that should be avoided. Since the positive social information did not produce greater perceptual dominance of the matched face indicates that negative information about an individual may be more salient to our behavior than positive.<ref name=\"Anderson\">Anderson, E., Siegel, E.H., Bliss-Moreau, E. & Barrett, L.F. (2011). The visual impact of gossip. Science Magazine, 332, 1446-1448.</ref>\n\nGossip also gives information about social norms and guidelines for behavior. Gossip usually comments on how appropriate a behavior was, and the mere act of repeating it signifies its importance. In this sense, gossip is effective regardless of whether it is positive or negative<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Zhang, L., & Vohs, K. D. (2004). Gossip as cultural learning. Review of General Psychology, 8, 111\u2013121.</ref> Some theorists have proposed that gossip is actually a pro-social behavior intended to allow an individual to correct their socially prohibitive behavior without direct confrontation of the individual. By gossiping about an individual\u2019s acts, other individuals can subtly indicate that said acts are inappropriate and allow the individual to correct their behavior (Schoeman 1994).\n\n===Perception of those who gossip===\nIndividuals who are perceived to engage in gossiping regularly are seen as having less social power and being less liked.{{cn|date=April 2019}} The type of gossip being exchanged also affects likeability, whereby those who engage in negative [http://www.gossip99.com gossip] are less liked than those who engage in positive gossip.<ref>Farley, S. (2011). Is gossip power? The inverse relationship between gossip, power, and likability. European Journal of Social Psychology, 41, 574-579.</ref> In a study done by Turner and colleagues (2003), having a prior relationship with a gossiper was not found to protect the gossiper from less favorable personality-ratings after gossip was exchanged. In the study, pairs of individuals were brought into a research lab to participate. Either the two individuals were friends prior to the study or they were strangers scheduled to participate at the same time. One of the individuals was a confederate of the study, and they engaged in gossiping about the research assistant after she left the room. The gossip exchanged was either positive or negative. Regardless of gossip type (positive versus negative) or relationship type (friend versus stranger) the gossipers were rated as less trustworthy after sharing the gossip.<ref>Turner, M.

''[[Defending the Undefendable]]: The Pimp, Prostitute, Scab, Slumlord, Libeler, Moneylender, and Other Scapegoats in the Rogue's Gallery of American Society'' Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute, {{ISBN|978-1-933550-17-6}}, pp. 42-43, [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=MHU4KkvxSMsC full text online]</ref> Block writes: \"In a sense, the gossip is much ''worse'' than the blackmailer, for the blackmailer has given the blackmailed a chance to silence him. The gossip exposes the secret without warning.\" The victim of a blackmailer is thus offered choices denied to the subject of gossip, such as deciding if the exposure of his or her secret is worth the cost the blackmailer demands. Moreover, in refusing a blackmailer's offer one is in no worse a position than with the gossip.  Adds Block, \"It is indeed difficult, then, to account for the vilification suffered by the blackmailer, at least compared to the gossip, who is usually dismissed with slight contempt and smugness.\"\n\nContemporary critiques of gossip may concentrate on or become subsumed in the discussion of [[social media]] such as [[Facebook]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Cuonzo\n | first1 = Margaret A.\n | chapter = 15: Gossip and the evolution of facebook\n | editor1-last = Wittkower\n | editor1-first = D.

In the 16th century, the word assumed the meaning of a person, mostly a woman, one who delights in idle talk, a newsmonger, a tattler.<ref>[[OED]]</ref> In the early 19th century, the term was extended from the talker to the conversation of such persons. The verb ''to gossip'', meaning \"to be a gossip\", first appears in [[Shakespeare]].\n\nThe term originates from the bedroom at the time of childbirth. Giving birth used to be a social event exclusively attended by women. The pregnant woman's female relatives and neighbours would congregate and idly converse. Over time, gossip came to mean talk of others.<ref>\"If Walls Could Talk: The History of the Home (Bedroom), Lucy Worsley,  BBC\"</ref>\n\nOthers say that gossip comes from the same root as \"gospel\" \u2014 it is a contraction of \"good spiel\", meaning a good story.\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:No chat.jpg|thumb|This Soviet [[World War II posters from the Soviet Union|war poster]] conveys the message: \"Don't chatter!

Agin, Swiggart & Agin, LLC, Mass High Tech, November 18, 1996.</ref> Low [[self-esteem]] and a desire to \"fit in\" are frequently cited as motivations for workplace gossip.\nThere are five essential functions that gossip has in the workplace (according to DiFonzo & Bordia):\n* Helps individuals learn social information about other individuals in the organization (often without even having to meet the other individual)\n* Builds social networks of individuals by bonding co-workers together and affiliating people with each other.\n* Breaks existing bonds by ostracizing individuals within an organization.\n* Enhances one's social status/power/prestige within the organization.\n* Inform individuals as to what is considered socially acceptable behavior within the organization.\n\nAccording to Kurkland and Pelled, workplace [https://www.gossip99.com/ gossip] can be very serious depending upon the amount of [[Power (social and political)|power]] that the gossiper has over the recipient, which will in turn affect how the gossip is interpreted. There are four types of power that are influenced by gossip:\n* '''Coercive:''' when a gossiper tells negative information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread negative information about them. This causes the gossiper's coercive power to increase.\n* '''Reward:''' when a gossiper tells positive information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread positive information about them. This causes the gossiper's reward power to increase.\n* '''Expert:''' when a gossiper seems to have very detailed knowledge of either the organization's values or about others in the work environment, their expert power becomes enhanced.\n* '''Referent:''' this power can either be reduced OR enhanced to a point. When people view gossiping as a petty activity done to waste time, a gossiper's referent power can decrease along with their reputation. When a recipient is thought of as being invited into a social circle by being a recipient, the gossiper's referent power can increase, but only to a high point where then the recipient begins to resent the gossiper (Kurland & Pelled).\n\nSome negative consequences of workplace [http://www.gossip99.com/ gossip] may include:<ref>[http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf Workplace Gossip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127130859/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, Kit Hennessy, LPC, CEAP.</ref>\n* Lost productivity and wasted time,\n* Erosion of trust and morale,\n* Increased anxiety among employees as rumors circulate without any clear information as to what is fact and what isn\u2019t,\n* Growing divisiveness among employees as people \u201ctake sides,\"\n* Hurt feelings and reputations,\n* Jeopardized chances for the gossipers' advancement as they are perceived as unprofessional, and\n* Attrition as good employees leave the company due to the unhealthy work atmosphere.\nTurner and Weed theorize that among the three main types of responders to [[workplace conflict]] are attackers who cannot keep their feelings to themselves and express their feelings by attacking whatever they can. Attackers are further divided into up-front attackers and behind-the-back attackers. Turner and Weed note that the latter \"are difficult to handle because the target person is not sure of the source of any criticism, nor even always sure that there is criticism.\"<ref>Conflict in organizations: Practical solutions any manager can use; Turner, Stephen P. (University of South Florida); Weed, Frank; 1983.</ref>\n\nIt is possible however, that there may be illegal, unethical, or disobedient behavior happening at the workplace and this may be a case where reporting the behavior may be viewed as gossip. It is then left up to the authority in charge to fully investigate the matter and not simply look past the report and assume it to be workplace gossip.\n\nInformal networks through which communication occurs in an organization are sometimes called the [[grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]. In a study done by Harcourt, Richerson, and Wattier, it was found that middle managers in several different organizations believed that gathering information from the grapevine was a much better way of learning information than through formal communication with their subordinates (Harcourt, Richerson & Wattier).\n\n\n \n==Various views==\nSome see gossip as trivial, hurtful and socially and/or intellectually unproductive. Some people view gossip as a lighthearted way of spreading information. A [[feminism|feminist]] definition of gossip presents it as \"a way of talking between women, intimate in style, personal and domestic in scope and setting, a female cultural event which springs from and perpetuates the restrictions of the female role, but also gives the comfort of validation.\" (Jones, 1990:243)\n\n===In early modern England===\n<!-- this section might fit better in an as-yet non-existent article called something like [[gossip (companion)]] -->\n\nIn [[Early Modern Britain|Early Modern England]] the word \"[https://www.gossip99.com/ gossip]\" referred to companions in [[childbirth]], not limited to the [[midwife]]. It also became a term for women-friends generally, with no necessary derogatory connotations. (OED n. definition 2. a. \"A familiar acquaintance, friend, chum\", supported by references from 1361 to 1873). It commonly referred to an informal local [[sorority]] or social group, who could enforce socially acceptable behaviour through private censure or through public rituals, such as \"[[rough music]]\", the [[cucking stool]] and the [[skimmington ride]].\n\nIn [[Thomas Harman]]\u2019s ''Caveat for Common Cursitors'' 1566 a \u2018[[Thieves' cant|walking mort]]\u2019 relates how she was forced to agree to meet a man in his barn, but informed his wife. The wife arrived with her \u201cfive furious, sturdy, muffled gossips\u201d who catch the errant husband with \u201chis hosen about his legs\u201d and give him a sound beating. The story clearly functions as a [[morality tale]] in which the gossips uphold the [[social order]].<ref>Bernard Capp, ''When Gossips Meet: Women, Family and Neighbourhood in Early Modern England'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|0-19-925598-9}}</ref>\n\nIn Sir Herbert Maxwell Bart's The Chevalier of the Splendid Crest [1900] at the end of chapter three the king is noted as referring to his loyal knight \"Sir Thomas de Roos\" in kindly terms as \"my old gossip\". Whilst a historical novel of that time the reference implies a continued use of the term \"Gossip\" as childhood friend as late as 1900.\n\n===In Judaism===\n{{main article|Lashon hara}}\nJudaism considers gossip spoken without a constructive purpose (known in Hebrew as an [[evil tongue]], ''lashon hara'') as a [[sin]]. Speaking negatively about people, even if retelling true facts, counts as sinful, as it demeans the dignity of man \u2014 both the speaker and the subject of the gossip.\nAccording to ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]'' 18:8: \"The words of a gossip are like choice morsels: they go down to a man's innermost parts.\"\n\n===In Christianity===\nThe Christian perspective on gossip is typically based on modern cultural assumptions of the phenomenon, especially the assumption that generally speaking, gossip is negative speech.<ref>Meng, Margaret (2008). \"Gossip: Killing Us Softly.\" ''Homiletic and Pastoral Review'' 109. pp. 26-31.</ref><ref>Sedler, M.D. (2001).

(2007). \"Gossip in the New Testament.\" ''The New Testament in Cross-Cultural Perspective.'' Eugene: Cascade Books.</ref> Of course, this does not mean that there are ''not'' numerous texts in the New Testament that see gossip as dangerous negative speech.\n\nThus, for example, the [[Epistle to the Romans]] associates gossips (\"backbiters\") with a list of sins including sexual immorality and with murder:\n\n<blockquote>\n:28: And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;\n:29: Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,\n:30: Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,\n:31: Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:\n:32: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. (Romans 1:28-32)\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Matthew 18]], Jesus also taught that conflict resolution among church members ought to begin with the aggrieved party attempting to resolve their dispute with the offending party alone. Only if this did not work would the process escalate to the next step, in which another church member would become involved. After that if the person at fault still would not \"hear\", the matter was to be fully investigated by the church elders, and if not resolved to be then exposed publicly.\n\nBased on texts like these portraying [http://www.gossip99.com/ gossip] negatively, many Christian authors generalize on the phenomenon. So, in order to gossip, writes Phil Fox Rose, we \"must harden our heart towards the 'out' person. We draw a line between ourselves and them; define them as being outside the rules of Christian charity... We create a gap between ourselves and God's Love.\" As we harden our heart towards more people and groups, he continues, \"this negativity and feeling of separateness will grow and permeate our world, and we'll find it more difficult to access God\u2019s love in any aspect of our lives.\"<ref>Phil Fox Rose, [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/philfoxrose/2012/10/gossip-hardens-our-hearts/ \"Gossip hardens our hearts\"], ''Patheos''. Accessed February 23, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe New Testament is also in favor of group accountability (Ephesians 5:11; 1st Tim 5:20; James 5:16; Gal 6:1-2; 1 Cor 12:26), which may be associated with gossip.\n\n===In Islam===\n\nIslam considers [[backbiting]] the equivalent of eating the flesh of one's dead brother. According to Muslims, backbiting harms its victims without offering them any chance of defense, just as dead people cannot defend against their flesh being eaten. Muslims are expected to treat others like brothers (regardless of their beliefs, skin color, gender, or ethnic origin), deriving from Islam's concept of brotherhood amongst its believers.\n\n===In Bahai Faith===\n\nBahais consider backbiting to be the \"worst human quality and the most great sin...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FBackbiting|website=Bahai Quotes.com|accessdate=11 November 2017|title=Backbiting|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924224839/http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FBackbiting|archive-date=24 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Therefore, even murder would be considered less reprobate than backbiting. [[Baha'u'llah]] stated, \"Backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul.\"  When someone kills another, it only affects their physical condition.  However, when someone gossips, it affects one in a different manner.\n\n==In psychology==\n\n===Evolutionary view===\nFrom [[Robin Dunbar]]'s evolutionary theories, gossip originated to help bond the groups that were constantly growing in size. To survive, individuals need alliances; but as these alliances grew larger, it was difficult if not impossible to physically connect with everyone. Conversation and language were able to bridge this gap. Gossip became a social interaction that helped the group gain information about other individuals without personally speaking to them. \u00a0\n\nIt enabled people to keep up with what was going on in their social network. It also creates a bond between the teller and the hearer, as they share information of mutual interest and spend time together. It also helps the hearer learn about another individual\u2019s behavior and helps them have a more effective approach to their relationship. Dunbar (2004) found that 65% of conversations consist of social topics.<ref name=\"Dunbar\">Dunbar, R. (2004). Gossip in evolutionary perspective. Review of General Psychology, 8(2), 100-110.</ref>\n\nDunbar (1994) argues that gossip is the equivalent of [[social grooming]] often observed in other primate species.<ref name=\"Dunbar, R.I.M. 1994\">Dunbar, R.I.M.

(2004). Research on gossip: Taxonomy, methods, and future directions. Review of General Psychology, 8 (2), 78-99.</ref>\nFurther support for the evolutionary significance of gossip comes from a recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal, [[Science (journal)|Science]] Anderson and colleagues (2011) found that faces paired with negative social information dominate visual consciousness to a greater extent than positive and neutral social information during a binocular rivalry task. \n\n[[Binocular rivalry]] occurs when two different stimuli are presented to each eye simultaneously and the two percepts compete for dominance in visual consciousness. While this occurs, an individual will consciously perceive one of the percepts while the other is suppressed. After a time, the other percept will become dominant and an individual will become aware of the second percept. Finally, the two percepts will alternate back and forth in terms of visual awareness. \n\nThe study by Anderson and colleagues (2011) indicates that higher order cognitive processes, like evaluative information processing, can influence early visual processing. That only negative social information differentially affected the dominance of the faces during the task alludes to the unique importance of knowing information about an individual that should be avoided. Since the positive social information did not produce greater perceptual dominance of the matched face indicates that negative information about an individual may be more salient to our behavior than positive.<ref name=\"Anderson\">Anderson, E., Siegel, E.H., Bliss-Moreau, E. & Barrett, L.F. (2011). The visual impact of gossip. Science Magazine, 332, 1446-1448.</ref>\n\nGossip also gives information about social norms and guidelines for behavior. Gossip usually comments on how appropriate a behavior was, and the mere act of repeating it signifies its importance. In this sense, gossip is effective regardless of whether it is positive or negative<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Zhang, L., & Vohs, K. D. (2004). Gossip as cultural learning. Review of General Psychology, 8, 111\u2013121.</ref> Some theorists have proposed that gossip is actually a pro-social behavior intended to allow an individual to correct their socially prohibitive behavior without direct confrontation of the individual. By gossiping about an individual\u2019s acts, other individuals can subtly indicate that said acts are inappropriate and allow the individual to correct their behavior (Schoeman 1994).\n\n===Perception of those who gossip===\nIndividuals who are perceived to engage in gossiping regularly are seen as having less social power and being less liked.{{cn|date=April 2019}} The type of gossip being exchanged also affects likeability, whereby those who engage in negative [http://www.gossip99.com gossip] are less liked than those who engage in positive gossip.<ref>Farley, S. (2011). Is gossip power? The inverse relationship between gossip, power, and likability. European Journal of Social Psychology, 41, 574-579.</ref> In a study done by Turner and colleagues (2003), having a prior relationship with a gossiper was not found to protect the gossiper from less favorable personality-ratings after gossip was exchanged. In the study, pairs of individuals were brought into a research lab to participate. Either the two individuals were friends prior to the study or they were strangers scheduled to participate at the same time. One of the individuals was a confederate of the study, and they engaged in gossiping about the research assistant after she left the room. The gossip exchanged was either positive or negative. Regardless of gossip type (positive versus negative) or relationship type (friend versus stranger) the gossipers were rated as less trustworthy after sharing the gossip.<ref>Turner, M. M., Mazur, M.A., Wendel, N. & Winslow, R. (2003). \"Relationship ruin or social glue? The joint effect of relationship type and gossip valence on liking, trust, and expertise\". ''Communication Monographs'', 70, 129-141.\n</ref>\n\n[[Walter Block]] has suggested that while gossip and [[blackmail]] both involve the disclosure of unflattering information, the blackmailer is arguably ethically superior to the gossip.<ref>\nBlock, Walter ([1976], 1991, 2008). ''[[Defending the Undefendable]]: The Pimp, Prostitute, Scab, Slumlord, Libeler, Moneylender, and Other Scapegoats in the Rogue's Gallery of American Society'' Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute, {{ISBN|978-1-933550-17-6}}, pp. 42-43, [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=MHU4KkvxSMsC full text online]</ref> Block writes: \"In a sense, the gossip is much ''worse'' than the blackmailer, for the blackmailer has given the blackmailed a chance to silence him. The gossip exposes the secret without warning.\" The victim of a blackmailer is thus offered choices denied to the subject of gossip, such as deciding if the exposure of his or her secret is worth the cost the blackmailer demands. Moreover, in refusing a blackmailer's offer one is in no worse a position than with the gossip.  Adds Block, \"It is indeed difficult, then, to account for the vilification suffered by the blackmailer, at least compared to the gossip, who is usually dismissed with slight contempt and smugness.\"\n\nContemporary critiques of gossip may concentrate on or become subsumed in the discussion of [[social media]] such as [[Facebook]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Cuonzo\n | first1 = Margaret A.\n | chapter = 15: Gossip and the evolution of facebook\n | editor1-last = Wittkower\n | editor1-first = D.

The album became their first major success especially after the release of the title track, the U.S. #8 \"[[Ladies' Night (song)|Ladies' Night]],\" and the U.S. #5 follow-up \"[[Too Hot (Kool & the Gang song)|Too Hot]]\" which both became Billboard Top 10 hits. The album brought a return to the mainstream after a lull in success from 1976-1978.

The result was that this album was not only popular during the 1970s black-oriented [[funk]] era where the band started, but also during the more popular and diverse [[disco]] era.

The album became their first major success especially after the release of the title track, the U.S. #8 \"[[Ladies' Night (song)|Ladies' Night]],\" and the U.S. #5 follow-up \"[[Too Hot (Kool & the Gang song)|Too Hot]]\" which both became Billboard Top 10 hits. The album brought a return to the mainstream after a lull in success from 1976-1978. In addition all the cuts from the album reached number five on the disco chart.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |title=Joel Whitburn's hot dance/disco, 1974-2003 |publisher=Record Research Inc |location=Menomonee Falls, Wis |year=2004 | isbn = 978-0-89820-156-7 |page=148}}</ref>\n\n''Ladies' Night'' was the album where Kool & the Gang perfected their funky style and made it more mainstream by incorporating some pop and light R&B into the sound. The result was that this album was not only popular during the 1970s black-oriented [[funk]] era where the band started, but also during the more popular and diverse [[disco]] era. ''Ladies' Night'' became their first Platinum album.<ref name=billboardmag>{{cite news|title=Kool & the Gang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT57|accessdate=19 January 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Lynne Segall}}</ref> It also marked the debut of lead vocalist [[James \"J.T.\" Taylor]].\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing | headline = Side A\n| all_writing     = [[Ronald Bell (musician)|Ronald Bell]], Kool & the Gang; except where noted\n| title1  = [[Ladies' Night (song)|Ladies' Night]]\n| writer1 = George Brown, Kool & the Gang\n| length1 = 6:38\n| title2  = Got You into My Life\n| length2 = 4:25\n| title3  = If You Feel Like Dancin'\n| length3 = 5:05\n}}\n{{Track listing | headline = Side B\n| title1  = Hangin' Out\n| length1 = 5:31\n| title2  = Tonight's the Night\n| length2 = 7:21\n| title3  = [[Too Hot (Kool & the Gang song)|Too Hot]]\n| writer3 = Brown, Kool & the Gang\n| length3 = 5:05\n}}\n\n==Charts==\n\n===Album===\n{| class=wikitable\n!
