For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of \"thickness\": for example, [[syrup]] has a higher viscosity than [[water]].{{sfn|Symon|1971|p=}}\n\nViscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal [[friction|frictional force]] that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance, when a fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some [[stress (physics)|stress]] (such as a [[pressure]] difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube.  This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion: the strength of this force is proportional to the viscosity.\n\nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ''ideal'' or ''inviscid'' fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at [[cryogenics|very low temperatures]] in [[Superfluidity|superfluids]]. Otherwise, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires all fluids to have positive viscosity;{{sfn|Balescu|1975|pp=428\u2013429}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=}} such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as [[pitch (resin)|pitch]], may appear to be a [[solid]].\n\n{{toclimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"viscosity\" is derived from the [[Latin]] \"''{{lang|la|viscum}}''\", meaning [[mistletoe]] and also a viscous [[glue]] made from mistletoe berries.<ref name=\"etym_visc\" />\n\n==Definition==\n\n=== Simple definition ===\n[[File:Laminar shear.svg|thumb|Illustration of a planar Couette flow. Since the shearing flow is opposed by friction between adjacent layers of fluid (which are in relative motion), a force is required to sustain the motion of the upper plate. The relative strength of this force is a measure of the fluid's viscosity.]]\n[[File:Laminar shear flow.svg|thumb|In a general parallel flow, the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity.]]\n\nIn [[materials science]] and [[engineering]], one is often interested in understanding the forces, or [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], involved in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a material. For instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by [[Hooke's law]], which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to the deformation of a material from some rest state are called [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] stresses. In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the [[strain rate|rate of change of the deformation]] over time. These are called viscous stresses. For instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the fluid do not depend on the ''distance'' the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how ''quickly'' the shearing occurs.\n\nViscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple shearing flow, such as a planar [[Couette flow]].\n\nIn the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates, one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed <math>u</math> (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move parallel to it, and their speed varies from <math>0</math> at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|p=19}} Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction between them gives rise to a [[force (physics)|force]] resisting their relative motion. In particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed.\n\nIn many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top. Moreover, the magnitude <math>F</math> of the force acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed <math>u</math> and the area <math>A</math> of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation <math>y</math>: \n:<math> F=\\mu A \\frac{u}{y}.</math>\nThe proportionality factor <math>\\mu</math> is the viscosity of the fluid, with units of <math>\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}</math> ([[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-[[second]]). The ratio <math>u/y</math> is called the ''rate of shear deformation'' or ''[[shear velocity]]'', and is the [[derivative]] of the fluid speed in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the plates (see illustrations to the right). If the velocity does not vary linearly with <math>y</math>, then the appropriate generalization is\n:<math>\\tau=\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y},</math>\nwhere <math>\\tau = F / A</math>, and <math>\\partial u / \\partial y</math> is the local shear velocity. This expression is referred to as Newton's law of viscosity. In shearing flows with planar symmetry, it is what ''defines'' <math>\\mu</math>. It is a special case of the general definition of viscosity (see below), which can be expressed in coordinate-free form.\n\nUse of the [[mu (letter)|Greek letter mu]] (<math>\\mu</math>) for the viscosity is common among mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as physicists.{{sfn|Streeter|Wylie|Bedford|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Holman|2002|p=}}{{sfn|Incropera|DeWitt|Bergman|Lavine|2007|p=}}  However, the [[eta (letter)|Greek letter eta]] (<math>\\eta</math>) is also used by chemists, physicists, and the [[IUPAC]].{{sfn|Ni\u010d|Jir\u00e1t|Ko\u0161ata|Jenkins|1997|p=}} The viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is sometimes also referred to as the ''shear viscosity''. However, at least one author discourages the use of this terminology, noting that <math>\\mu</math> can appear in nonshearing flows in addition to shearing flows.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p = 19}}\n\n=== General definition ===\n{{See also|Viscous stress tensor|Volume viscosity}}\n\nIn very general terms, the viscous stresses in a fluid are defined as those resulting from the relative velocity of different fluid particles. As such, the viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity.{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|pp=44\u201345}} (For Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) In Cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as\n\n:<math>\n\\tau_{ij} = \\sum_k \\sum_\\ell \\mu_{ijk\\ell} \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial r_\\ell},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_{ijk\\ell}</math> is a viscosity tensor that maps the strain rate tensor <math>\\partial v_k / \\partial r_\\ell</math> onto the viscous stress tensor <math>\\tau_{ij}</math>.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p= 18|ps=: Note that this source uses an alternative sign convention, which has been reversed here.}} Since the indices in this expression can vary from 1 to 3, there are 81 \"viscosity coefficients\" <math>\\mu_{ijkl}</math> in total. However, due to spatial symmetries these coefficients are not all independent. For instance, for [[isotropic]] Newtonian fluids, the 81 coefficients can be reduced to 2 independent parameters. The most usual decomposition yields the standard (scalar) viscosity <math>\\mu</math> and the [[bulk viscosity]] <math>\\kappa</math>:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mu \\left[\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^{\\dagger} \\right] - \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\mu - \\kappa \\right) (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{\\delta},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{\\delta}</math> is the unit tensor, and the dagger <math>\\dagger</math> denotes the [[transpose]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=45}} This equation can be thought of as a generalized form of Newton's law of viscosity.\n\nThe bulk viscosity (also called volume viscosity) expresses a type of internal friction that resists the shearless compression or expansion of a fluid. Knowledge of <math>\\kappa</math> is frequently not necessary in fluid dynamics problems. For example, an incompressible fluid satisfies <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0</math> and so the term containing <math>\\kappa</math> drops out. Moreover, <math>\\kappa</math> is often assumed to be negligible for gases since it is <math>0</math> in a [[monoatomic]] [[ideal gas]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}} One situation in which <math>\\kappa</math> can be important is the calculation of energy loss in [[sound]] and [[shock wave]]s, described by [[Stokes' law (sound attenuation)|Stokes' law of sound attenuation]], since these phenomena involve rapid expansions and compressions.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the above expressions are not fundamental laws of nature, but rather definitions of viscosity. As such, their utility for any given material, as well as means for measuring or calculating the viscosity, must be established using separate means.\n\n=== Dynamic and kinematic viscosity ===\nIn fluid dynamics, it is common to work in terms of the ''kinematic viscosity'' (also called \"momentum diffusivity\"), defined as the ratio of the viscosity {{mvar|\u03bc}} to the [[density]] of the fluid {{mvar|\u03c1}}. It is usually denoted by the [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]] ({{mvar|\u03bd}}) and has [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] <math>\\mathrm{(length)^2/time}</math>:\n\n: <math>\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}.</math>\n\nConsistent with this nomenclature, the viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is frequently called the ''dynamic viscosity'' or ''absolute viscosity'', and has units force \u00d7 time/area.\n\n==Momentum transport==\n{{See also|Transport phenomena}}\n\nTransport theory provides an alternative interpretation of viscosity in terms of momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as [[thermal conductivity]] characterizes [[heat]] transport, and (mass) [[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]] characterizes mass transport.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} To see this, note that in Newton's law of viscosity, <math>\\tau = \\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)</math>, the shear stress <math>\\tau</math> has units equivalent to a momentum [[flux]], i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus, <math>\\tau</math> can be interpreted as specifying the flow of momentum in the <math>y</math> direction from one fluid layer to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is determined by the viscosity.\n\nThe analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density to low density, momentum flows from high velocity to low velocity. These behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called [[constitutive relations]], whose one-dimensional forms are given here:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{J} &= -D \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\mathbf{q} &= -k_t \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\tau &= \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} & & \\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the density, <math>\\mathbf{J}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{q}</math> are the mass and heat fluxes, and <math>D</math> and <math>k_t</math> are the mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity.{{sfn|Schroeder|1999|p=}} The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and hydrodynamics.\n\n==Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids==\n[[File:Viscous regimes chart.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Viscosity, the slope of each line, varies among materials.]]\n\nNewton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a [[constitutive equation]] (like [[Hooke's law]], [[Fick's law]], and [[Ohm's law]]) which serves to define the viscosity <math>\\mu</math>. Its form  is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids, <math>\\mu</math> is independent of strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]]. [[Gas]]es, [[water]], and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are many [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s that significantly deviate from this behavior. For example:\n\n* [[Shear thickening|Shear-thickening]] liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Shear thinning|Shear-thinning]] liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Thixotropic]] liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Rheopectic]] (dilatant) liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Bingham plastic]]s that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.\n\n[[Frederick Thomas Trouton|Trouton]]'s ratio is the ratio of [[extensional viscosity]] to [[shear viscosity]]. For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3.{{sfn|R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ska| R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski| Ochowiak| Mitkowski|2014|pp=47\u201355}}{{sfn|Trouton|1906|pp= 426\u2013440}} Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nEven for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature. For gases and other [[compressible fluid]]s, it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A [[magnetorheological fluid]], for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a [[magnetic field]], possibly to the point of behaving like a solid.\n\n==In solids==\nThe viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the ''amount'' of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the ''rate'' of deformation over time. (For this reason, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] used the term ''fugitive elasticity'' for fluid viscosity.)\n\nHowever, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many \"solids\" (even [[granite]]) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress.{{sfn|Kumagai|Sasajima |Ito|1978|pp=157\u2013161}} Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, being [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]].\n\nViscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The [[extensional viscosity]] is a [[linear combination]] of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is widely used for characterizing polymers.\n\nIn [[geology]], earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called [[rheid]]s.{{sfn|Scherer|Pardenek|Swiatek|1988|p=14}}\n\n==Measurement==\n{{Main|Viscometer}}\nViscosity is measured with various types of [[viscometer]]s and [[rheometer]]s. A rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hannan |first1=Henry |title=Technician's Formulation Handbook for Industrial and Household Cleaning Products |date=2007 |publisher=Kyral LLC |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-6151-5601-9 |page=7}}</ref>\n\nFor some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates ([[Newtonian fluids]]). The fluids without a constant viscosity ([[non-Newtonian fluid]]s) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.\n\nOne of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.\n\nIn [[coating]] industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the [[efflux time]] is measured. There are several sorts of cup \u2013 such as the [[Zahn cup]] and the [[Ford viscosity cup]] \u2013 with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities (centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.\n\nAlso used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers.\n\nVibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n''Extensional viscosity'' can be measured with various [[rheometer]]s that apply [[extensional stress]].\n\n[[Volume viscosity]] can be measured with an [[acoustic rheometer]].\n\n[[Apparent viscosity]] is a calculation derived from tests performed on [[drilling fluid]] used in oil or gas well development. These calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required.\n\n==Units==\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of dynamic viscosity is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-second (Pa\u00b7s), or equivalently [[kilogram]] per [[metre|meter]] per second (kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>). The [[CGS system|CGS]] unit is the [[poise (unit)|poise]] (P, or g\u00b7cm<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.1 Pa\u00b7s),{{sfn|McNaught|Wilkinson|1997|loc=poise}} named after [[Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille]]. It is commonly expressed, particularly in [[ASTM]] standards, as ''centipoise'' (cP) since the latter is equal to the SI multiple millipascal seconds (mPa\u00b7s).\n\nThe SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m<sup>2</sup>/s), whereas the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the '''stokes''' (St, or cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.0001&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>), named after Sir [[George Gabriel Stokes]].{{sfn|Gyllenbok |2018|p=213}}  In U.S. usage, ''stoke'' is sometimes used as the singular form.  The submultiple ''centistokes'' (cSt) is often used instead, 1\u00a0cSt\u00a0= 1\u00a0mm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0= 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThe [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of viscosity is ''fluidity'', usually symbolized by <math>\\phi = 1 / \\mu</math> or <math>F = 1 / \\mu</math>, depending on the convention used, measured in ''reciprocal poise'' (P<sup>\u22121</sup>, or [[centimetre|cm]]\u00b7[[second|s]]\u00b7[[gram|g]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), sometimes called the ''rhe''. Fluidity is seldom used in [[engineering]] practice.\n\nNonstandard units include the [[reyn]], a British unit of dynamic viscosity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In the automotive industry the [[viscosity index]] is used to describe the change of viscosity with temperature.\n\nAt one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the [[Saybolt viscometer]], and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of [[Saybolt universal second]]s (SUS).<ref name=\"ASTM D2161\" /> Other abbreviations such as SSU (''Saybolt seconds universal'') or SUV (''Saybolt universal viscosity'') are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in [[ASTM]] D 2161.\n\n==Molecular origins==\nIn general, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules constituting the system interact. There are no simple but correct expressions for the viscosity of a fluid. The simplest exact expressions are the [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] for the linear shear viscosity or the ''transient time correlation function'' expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988.{{sfn|Evans | Morriss | 1988|pp=4142\u20134148}} Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of [[molecular dynamics]] computer simulations. On the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilute gas. Even elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity. More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-graining the [[equations of motion]] of the gas molecules. An example of such a treatment is [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]], which derives expressions for the viscosity of a dilute gas from the [[Boltzmann equation]].{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}}\n\nMomentum transport in gases is generally mediated by discrete molecular collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces which bind molecules close together.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically much larger than those of gases.\n\n===Pure gases===\n\n{{See also||Kinetic theory of gases}}\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

More fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becomes imprecise for particles that interact over a finite range, which limits the usefulness of the concept for describing real-world gases.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=103}}\n\n====Chapman\u2013Enskog theory====\n\n{{Main||Chapman\u2013Enskog theory}}\n\nA technique developed by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]] in the early 1900s allows a more refined calculation of <math>\\mu</math>.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}} It is based on the [[Boltzmann equation]], which provides a systematic statistical description of a dilute gas in terms of intermolecular interactions.{{sfn|Cercignani|1975|p=}} As such, their technique allows accurate calculation of <math>\\mu</math> for more realistic molecular models, such as those incorporating intermolecular attraction rather than just hard-core repulsion.\n\nIt turns out that a more realistic modeling of interactions is essential for accurate prediction of the temperature dependence of <math>\\mu</math>, which experiments show increases more rapidly than the <math>T^{1/2}</math> trend predicted for rigid elastic spheres.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Indeed, the Chapman\u2013Enskog analysis shows that the predicted temperature dependence can be tuned by varying the parameters in various molecular models.

To connect with experiment, it is convenient to rewrite as\n\n:<math>\n\\mu = \\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{3/2} \\frac{T_0 + S}{T + S},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mu_0</math> is the viscosity at temperature <math>T_0</math>.{{sfn|Sutherland|1893|pp=507\u2013531}} If <math>\\mu</math> is known from experiments at <math>T = T_0</math> and at least one other temperature, then <math>S</math> can be calculated.

On the other hand, {{harvnb|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}} argue that this success does not imply that molecules actually interact according to the Sutherland model. Rather, they interpret the prediction for <math>\\mu</math> as a simple interpolation which is valid for some gases over fixed ranges of temperature, but otherwise does not provide a picture of intermolecular interactions which is fundamentally correct and general. Slightly more sophisticated models, such as the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], may provide a better picture, but only at the cost of a more opaque dependence on temperature. In some systems the assumption of spherical symmetry must be abandoned as well, as is the case for vapors with highly [[polar molecules]] like [[Properties of water|H<sub>2</sub>O]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007|pp=25\u201327}}{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp= 235\u2013237}}\n\n==== Bulk viscosity ====\n\nIn the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscosity arises in gases whenever there are non-negligible relaxational timescales governing the exchange of energy between the translational energy of molecules and their internal energy, e.g. [[Rotational energy|rotational]] and [[vibration]]al. As such, the bulk viscosity is <math>0</math> for a monatomic ideal gas, in which the internal energy of molecules in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like [[carbon dioxide]], whose molecules possess both rotational and vibrational energy.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp= 197, 214\u2013216}}{{sfn|Cramer|2012|p=066102-2}}\n\n===Pure liquids===\n{{See also||Temperature dependence of liquid viscosity}}\n\n[[File:Viscosity video science museum.ogv|thumb|Video showing three liquids with different viscosities]]\n[[File:09. \u0412\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.ogg|thumb|Experiment showing the behavior of a viscous fluid with blue dye for visibility]]\n\nIn contrast with gases, there is no simple yet accurate picture for the molecular origins of viscosity in liquids.\n\nAt the simplest level of description, the relative motion of adjacent layers in a liquid is opposed primarily by attractive molecular forces\nacting across the layer boundary. In this picture, one (correctly) expects viscosity to decrease with increasing temperature. This is because\nincreasing temperature increases the random thermal motion of the molecules, which makes it easier for them to overcome their attractive interactions.{{sfn|Reid|Sherwood|1958|p=202}}\n\nBuilding on this visualization, a simple theory can be constructed in analogy with the discrete structure of a solid: groups of molecules in a liquid \nare visualized as forming \"cages\" which surround and enclose single molecules.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| pp=29\u201331}} These cages can be occupied or unoccupied, and\nstronger molecular attraction corresponds to stronger cages.\nDue to random thermal motion, a molecule \"hops\" between cages at a rate which varies inversely with the strength of molecular attractions. In [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] these \"hops\" are not biased in any direction.\nOn the other hand, in order for two adjacent layers to move relative to each other, the \"hops\" must be biased in the direction\nof the relative motion. The force required to sustain this directed motion can be estimated for a given shear rate, leading to\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\mu \\approx \\frac{N_A h}{V} \\operatorname{exp}\\left(3.8 \\frac{T_b}{T}\\right),</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere <math>N_A</math> is the [[Avogadro constant]], <math>h</math> is the [[Planck constant]], <math>V</math> is the volume of a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of liquid, and <math>T_b</math> is the [[normal boiling point]].

A classic example \nof this approach is Irving\u2013Kirkwood theory.{{sfn|Irving|Kirkwood|1949|pp=817\u2013829}} On the other hand, such expressions\nare given as averages over multiparticle [[Correlation function (statistical mechanics)|correlation functions]] and are therefore difficult to apply in practice.\n\nIn general, empirically derived expressions (based on existing viscosity measurements) appear to be the only consistently reliable means of calculating viscosity in liquids.{{sfn|Reid|Sherwood|1958|pp=206\u2013209}}\n\n===Mixtures and blends===\n{{See also|Viscosity models for mixtures}}\n\n====Gaseous mixtures====\n\nThe same molecular-kinetic picture of a single component gas can also be applied to a gaseous mixture. For instance, in the Chapman\u2013Enskog approach the viscosity <math>\\mu_{\\text{mix}}</math> of a binary mixture of gases can be written in terms of the individual component viscosities <math>\\mu_{1,2}</math>, their respective volume fractions, and the intermolecular interactions.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}} As for the single-component gas, the dependence of <math>\\mu_{\\text{mix}}</math> on the parameters of the intermolecular interactions enters through various collisional integrals which may not be expressible in terms of elementary functions. To obtain usable expressions for <math>\\mu_{\\text{mix}}</math> which reasonably match experimental data, the collisional integrals typically must be evaluated using some combination of analytic calculation and empirical fitting. An example of such a procedure is the Sutherland approach for the single-component gas, discussed above.\n\n====Blends of liquids====\n\nAs for pure liquids, the viscosity of a blend of liquids is difficult to predict from molecular principles. One method is to extend the molecular \"cage\" theory presented above for a pure liquid. This can be done with varying levels of sophistication. One useful expression resulting from such an analysis is the Lederer\u2013Roegiers equation for a binary mixture:\n\n:<math>\n\\ln \\mu_\\text{blend} = \\frac{x_1}{x_1 + \\alpha x_2} \\ln \\mu_1 + \\frac{\\alpha x_2}{x_1 + \\alpha x_2} \\ln \\mu_2,\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is an empirical parameter, and <math>x_{1,2}</math> and <math>\\mu_{1,2}</math> are the respective [[mole fractions]] and viscosities of the component liquids.{{sfn|Zhmud|2014|p=22}}\n\nSince blending is an important process in the lubricating and oil industries, a variety of empirical and propriety equations exist for predicting the viscosity of a blend, besides those stemming directly from molecular theory.{{sfn|Zhmud|2014|p=22}}\n\n===Solutions and suspensions===\n====Aqeuous solutions====\n{{See also|Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel theory|List of viscosities#Aqueous_solutions}}\nDepending on the [[solute]] and range of concentration, an aqueous [[electrolyte]] solution can have either a larger or smaller viscosity compared with pure water at the same temperature and pressure. For instance, a 20% saline ([[sodium chloride]]) solution has viscosity over 1.5 times that of pure water, whereas a 20% [[potassium iodide]] solution has viscosity about 0.91 times that of pure water.\n\nAn idealized model of dilute electrolytic solutions leads to the following prediction for the viscosity <math>\\mu_s</math> of a solution:{{sfn|Viswanath|Ghosh|Prasad|Dutt|2007|p=}}\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\mu_s}{\\mu_0} = 1 + A \\sqrt{c},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mu_0</math> is the viscosity of the solvent, <math>c</math> is the concentration, and <math>A</math> is a positive constant which depends on both solvent and solute properties.

However, for dilute systems in steady flows, the behavior is Newtonian and expressions for <math>\\mu_{\\text{eff}}</math> can be derived directly from the particle dynamics. In a very dilute system, with volume fraction <math>\\phi \\lesssim 0.02</math>, interactions between the suspended particles can be ignored. In such a case one can explicitly calculate the flow field around each particle independently, and combine the results to obtain <math>\\mu_\\text{eff}</math>.

For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of \"thickness\": for example, [[syrup]] has a higher viscosity than [[water]].{{sfn|Symon|1971|p=}}\n\nViscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal [[friction|frictional force]] that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance, when a fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some [[stress (physics)|stress]] (such as a [[pressure]] difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube.  This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion: the strength of this force is proportional to the viscosity.\n\nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ''ideal'' or ''inviscid'' fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at [[cryogenics|very low temperatures]] in [[Superfluidity|superfluids]]. Otherwise, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires all fluids to have positive viscosity;{{sfn|Balescu|1975|pp=428\u2013429}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=}} such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as [[pitch (resin)|pitch]], may appear to be a [[solid]].\n\n{{toclimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"viscosity\" is derived from the [[Latin]] \"''{{lang|la|viscum}}''\", meaning [[mistletoe]] and also a viscous [[glue]] made from mistletoe berries.<ref name=\"etym_visc\" />\n\n==Definition==\n\n=== Simple definition ===\n[[File:Laminar shear.svg|thumb|Illustration of a planar Couette flow. Since the shearing flow is opposed by friction between adjacent layers of fluid (which are in relative motion), a force is required to sustain the motion of the upper plate. The relative strength of this force is a measure of the fluid's viscosity.]]\n[[File:Laminar shear flow.svg|thumb|In a general parallel flow, the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity.]]\n\nIn [[materials science]] and [[engineering]], one is often interested in understanding the forces, or [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], involved in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a material. For instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by [[Hooke's law]], which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to the deformation of a material from some rest state are called [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] stresses. In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the [[strain rate|rate of change of the deformation]] over time. These are called viscous stresses. For instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the fluid do not depend on the ''distance'' the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how ''quickly'' the shearing occurs.\n\nViscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple shearing flow, such as a planar [[Couette flow]].\n\nIn the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates, one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed <math>u</math> (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move parallel to it, and their speed varies from <math>0</math> at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|p=19}} Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction between them gives rise to a [[force (physics)|force]] resisting their relative motion. In particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed.\n\nIn many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top. Moreover, the magnitude <math>F</math> of the force acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed <math>u</math> and the area <math>A</math> of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation <math>y</math>: \n:<math> F=\\mu A \\frac{u}{y}.</math>\nThe proportionality factor <math>\\mu</math> is the viscosity of the fluid, with units of <math>\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}</math> ([[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-[[second]]). The ratio <math>u/y</math> is called the ''rate of shear deformation'' or ''[[shear velocity]]'', and is the [[derivative]] of the fluid speed in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the plates (see illustrations to the right). If the velocity does not vary linearly with <math>y</math>, then the appropriate generalization is\n:<math>\\tau=\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y},</math>\nwhere <math>\\tau = F / A</math>, and <math>\\partial u / \\partial y</math> is the local shear velocity. This expression is referred to as Newton's law of viscosity. In shearing flows with planar symmetry, it is what ''defines'' <math>\\mu</math>. It is a special case of the general definition of viscosity (see below), which can be expressed in coordinate-free form.\n\nUse of the [[mu (letter)|Greek letter mu]] (<math>\\mu</math>) for the viscosity is common among mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as physicists.{{sfn|Streeter|Wylie|Bedford|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Holman|2002|p=}}{{sfn|Incropera|DeWitt|Bergman|Lavine|2007|p=}}  However, the [[eta (letter)|Greek letter eta]] (<math>\\eta</math>) is also used by chemists, physicists, and the [[IUPAC]].{{sfn|Ni\u010d|Jir\u00e1t|Ko\u0161ata|Jenkins|1997|p=}} The viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is sometimes also referred to as the ''shear viscosity''. However, at least one author discourages the use of this terminology, noting that <math>\\mu</math> can appear in nonshearing flows in addition to shearing flows.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p = 19}}\n\n=== General definition ===\n{{See also|Viscous stress tensor|Volume viscosity}}\n\nIn very general terms, the viscous stresses in a fluid are defined as those resulting from the relative velocity of different fluid particles. As such, the viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity.{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|pp=44\u201345}} (For Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) In Cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as\n\n:<math>\n\\tau_{ij} = \\sum_k \\sum_\\ell \\mu_{ijk\\ell} \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial r_\\ell},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_{ijk\\ell}</math> is a viscosity tensor that maps the strain rate tensor <math>\\partial v_k / \\partial r_\\ell</math> onto the viscous stress tensor <math>\\tau_{ij}</math>.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p= 18|ps=: Note that this source uses an alternative sign convention, which has been reversed here.}} Since the indices in this expression can vary from 1 to 3, there are 81 \"viscosity coefficients\" <math>\\mu_{ijkl}</math> in total. However, due to spatial symmetries these coefficients are not all independent. For instance, for [[isotropic]] Newtonian fluids, the 81 coefficients can be reduced to 2 independent parameters. The most usual decomposition yields the standard (scalar) viscosity <math>\\mu</math> and the [[bulk viscosity]] <math>\\kappa</math>:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mu \\left[\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^{\\dagger} \\right] - \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\mu - \\kappa \\right) (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{\\delta},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{\\delta}</math> is the unit tensor, and the dagger <math>\\dagger</math> denotes the [[transpose]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=45}} This equation can be thought of as a generalized form of Newton's law of viscosity.\n\nThe bulk viscosity (also called volume viscosity) expresses a type of internal friction that resists the shearless compression or expansion of a fluid. Knowledge of <math>\\kappa</math> is frequently not necessary in fluid dynamics problems. For example, an incompressible fluid satisfies <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0</math> and so the term containing <math>\\kappa</math> drops out. Moreover, <math>\\kappa</math> is often assumed to be negligible for gases since it is <math>0</math> in a [[monoatomic]] [[ideal gas]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}} One situation in which <math>\\kappa</math> can be important is the calculation of energy loss in [[sound]] and [[shock wave]]s, described by [[Stokes' law (sound attenuation)|Stokes' law of sound attenuation]], since these phenomena involve rapid expansions and compressions.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the above expressions are not fundamental laws of nature, but rather definitions of viscosity. As such, their utility for any given material, as well as means for measuring or calculating the viscosity, must be established using separate means.\n\n=== Dynamic and kinematic viscosity ===\nIn fluid dynamics, it is common to work in terms of the ''kinematic viscosity'' (also called \"momentum diffusivity\"), defined as the ratio of the viscosity {{mvar|\u03bc}} to the [[density]] of the fluid {{mvar|\u03c1}}. It is usually denoted by the [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]] ({{mvar|\u03bd}}) and has [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] <math>\\mathrm{(length)^2/time}</math>:\n\n: <math>\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}.</math>\n\nConsistent with this nomenclature, the viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is frequently called the ''dynamic viscosity'' or ''absolute viscosity'', and has units force \u00d7 time/area.\n\n==Momentum transport==\n{{See also|Transport phenomena}}\n\nTransport theory provides an alternative interpretation of viscosity in terms of momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as [[thermal conductivity]] characterizes [[heat]] transport, and (mass) [[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]] characterizes mass transport.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} To see this, note that in Newton's law of viscosity, <math>\\tau = \\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)</math>, the shear stress <math>\\tau</math> has units equivalent to a momentum [[flux]], i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus, <math>\\tau</math> can be interpreted as specifying the flow of momentum in the <math>y</math> direction from one fluid layer to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is determined by the viscosity.\n\nThe analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density to low density, momentum flows from high velocity to low velocity. These behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called [[constitutive relations]], whose one-dimensional forms are given here:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{J} &= -D \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\mathbf{q} &= -k_t \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\tau &= \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} & & \\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the density, <math>\\mathbf{J}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{q}</math> are the mass and heat fluxes, and <math>D</math> and <math>k_t</math> are the mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity.{{sfn|Schroeder|1999|p=}} The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and hydrodynamics.\n\n==Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids==\n[[File:Viscous regimes chart.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Viscosity, the slope of each line, varies among materials.]]\n\nNewton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a [[constitutive equation]] (like [[Hooke's law]], [[Fick's law]], and [[Ohm's law]]) which serves to define the viscosity <math>\\mu</math>. Its form  is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids, <math>\\mu</math> is independent of strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]]. [[Gas]]es, [[water]], and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are many [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s that significantly deviate from this behavior. For example:\n\n* [[Shear thickening|Shear-thickening]] liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Shear thinning|Shear-thinning]] liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Thixotropic]] liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Rheopectic]] (dilatant) liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Bingham plastic]]s that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.\n\n[[Frederick Thomas Trouton|Trouton]]'s ratio is the ratio of [[extensional viscosity]] to [[shear viscosity]]. For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3.{{sfn|R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ska| R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski| Ochowiak| Mitkowski|2014|pp=47\u201355}}{{sfn|Trouton|1906|pp= 426\u2013440}} Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nEven for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature. For gases and other [[compressible fluid]]s, it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A [[magnetorheological fluid]], for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a [[magnetic field]], possibly to the point of behaving like a solid.\n\n==In solids==\nThe viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the ''amount'' of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the ''rate'' of deformation over time. (For this reason, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] used the term ''fugitive elasticity'' for fluid viscosity.)\n\nHowever, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many \"solids\" (even [[granite]]) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress.{{sfn|Kumagai|Sasajima |Ito|1978|pp=157\u2013161}} Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, being [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]].\n\nViscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The [[extensional viscosity]] is a [[linear combination]] of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is widely used for characterizing polymers.\n\nIn [[geology]], earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called [[rheid]]s.{{sfn|Scherer|Pardenek|Swiatek|1988|p=14}}\n\n==Measurement==\n{{Main|Viscometer}}\nViscosity is measured with various types of [[viscometer]]s and [[rheometer]]s. A rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hannan |first1=Henry |title=Technician's Formulation Handbook for Industrial and Household Cleaning Products |date=2007 |publisher=Kyral LLC |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-6151-5601-9 |page=7}}</ref>\n\nFor some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates ([[Newtonian fluids]]). The fluids without a constant viscosity ([[non-Newtonian fluid]]s) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.\n\nOne of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.\n\nIn [[coating]] industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the [[efflux time]] is measured. There are several sorts of cup \u2013 such as the [[Zahn cup]] and the [[Ford viscosity cup]] \u2013 with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities (centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.\n\nAlso used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers.\n\nVibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading.

These calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required.\n\n==Units==\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of dynamic viscosity is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-second (Pa\u00b7s), or equivalently [[kilogram]] per [[metre|meter]] per second (kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>). The [[CGS system|CGS]] unit is the [[poise (unit)|poise]] (P, or g\u00b7cm<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.1 Pa\u00b7s),{{sfn|McNaught|Wilkinson|1997|loc=poise}} named after [[Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille]]. It is commonly expressed, particularly in [[ASTM]] standards, as ''centipoise'' (cP) since the latter is equal to the SI multiple millipascal seconds (mPa\u00b7s).\n\nThe SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m<sup>2</sup>/s), whereas the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the '''stokes''' (St, or cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.0001&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>), named after Sir [[George Gabriel Stokes]].{{sfn|Gyllenbok |2018|p=213}}  In U.S. usage, ''stoke'' is sometimes used as the singular form.  The submultiple ''centistokes'' (cSt) is often used instead, 1\u00a0cSt\u00a0= 1\u00a0mm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0= 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThe [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of viscosity is ''fluidity'', usually symbolized by <math>\\phi = 1 / \\mu</math> or <math>F = 1 / \\mu</math>, depending on the convention used, measured in ''reciprocal poise'' (P<sup>\u22121</sup>, or [[centimetre|cm]]\u00b7[[second|s]]\u00b7[[gram|g]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), sometimes called the ''rhe''. Fluidity is seldom used in [[engineering]] practice.\n\nNonstandard units include the [[reyn]], a British unit of dynamic viscosity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In the automotive industry the [[viscosity index]] is used to describe the change of viscosity with temperature.\n\nAt one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the [[Saybolt viscometer]], and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of [[Saybolt universal second]]s (SUS).<ref name=\"ASTM D2161\" /> Other abbreviations such as SSU (''Saybolt seconds universal'') or SUV (''Saybolt universal viscosity'') are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in [[ASTM]] D 2161.\n\n==Molecular origins==\nIn general, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules constituting the system interact. There are no simple but correct expressions for the viscosity of a fluid. The simplest exact expressions are the [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] for the linear shear viscosity or the ''transient time correlation function'' expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988.{{sfn|Evans | Morriss | 1988|pp=4142\u20134148}} Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of [[molecular dynamics]] computer simulations. On the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilute gas. Even elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity. More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-graining the [[equations of motion]] of the gas molecules. An example of such a treatment is [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]], which derives expressions for the viscosity of a dilute gas from the [[Boltzmann equation]].{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}}\n\nMomentum transport in gases is generally mediated by discrete molecular collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces which bind molecules close together.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically much larger than those of gases.\n\n===Pure gases===\n\n{{See also||Kinetic theory of gases}}\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

When a movement is repeated over time, a long-term muscle memory is created for that task, eventually allowing it to be performed with little to no conscious effort. This process decreases the need for attention and creates maximum efficiency within the motor and memory systems.

Most motor skills are thought to be acquired through practice; however, mere observation of the skill has led to learning as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Celnik | first1 = P. | last2 = Classen | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohen | first3 = G.L. | last4 = Duque | first4 = J. | last5 = Mazzocchio | first5 = R. | last6 = Sawaki | first6 = L. | last7 = Stephan | first7 = K. | last8 = Ungerleider | first8 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Formation of a Motor Memory by Action Observation | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 41| pages = 9339\u20139346 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.2282-05.2005| pmid = 16221842 | pmc = 6725701 }}</ref> Research suggests we do not start off with a blank slate with regard to motor memory although we do learn most of our motor memory repertoire during our lifetime.<ref name = \"Flanagan\">{{cite journal | last1 = Flanagan | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Ghahramani | first2 = Z. | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = M.D. | year = 2001 | title = Perspectives and Problems in Motor Learning | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 5 | issue = 11| pages = 487\u2013494 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01773-3| pmid = 11684481 }}</ref> Movements such as facial expressions, which are thought to be learned, can actually be observed in children who are blind; thus there is some evidence for motor memory being genetically pre-wired.<ref name = \"Flanagan\" />\n\nIn the early stages of empirical research of motor memory [[Edward Thorndike]], a leading pioneer in the study of motor memory, was among the first to acknowledge learning can occur without conscious awareness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shanks | first1 = D.R. | last2 = St | last3 = John | first3 = M.F. | year = 1994 | title = Characteristics of Dissociable Human Learning Systems | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/142639/1/download2.pdf| journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 367\u2013447 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00035032}}</ref> One of the earliest and most notable studies regarding the retention of motor skills was by Hill, Rejall, and Thorndike, who showed savings in relearning typing skills after a 25-year period with no practice.<ref name = \"Lee\" /> Findings related to the retention of learned motor skills have been continuously replicated in studies, suggesting that through subsequent practice, motor learning is stored in the brain as memory.

With practice, execution of motor task becomes smoother, there is a decrease in limb stiffness, and muscle activity necessary to the task is performed without conscious effort.<ref name = \"Shadmehr\">{{cite journal | last1 = Shadmehr | first1 = R | last2 = Holcomb | first2 = HH | year = 1997 | title = Neural correlates of motor memory consolidation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = 5327| pages = 821\u201325 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5327.821}}</ref>\n\n===Muscle memory encoding===\n\nThe [[neuroanatomy of memory]] is widespread throughout the [[brain]]; however, the pathways important to motor memory are separate from the medial [[temporal lobe]] pathways associated with [[declarative memory]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brashers-Krug | first1 = T | last2 = Shadmehr | first2 = R. | last3 = Bizzi | first3 = E. | year = 1996 | title = Consolidation in human motor memory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 382 | issue = 6588| pages = 252\u2013255| doi=10.1038/382252a0| pmid = 8717039 | bibcode = 1996Natur.382..252B| citeseerx = 10.1.1.39.3383 }}</ref>  As with declarative memory, motor memory is theorized to have two stages: a short-term [[memory encoding]] stage, which is fragile and susceptible to damage, and a long-term [[memory consolidation]] stage, which is more stable.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Atwell | first1 = P. | last2 = Cooke | first2 = S. | last3 = Yeo | first3 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Cerebellar function in consolidation of motor memory | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1011\u20131020 | doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00719-5| doi-access = free }}</ref> \n  \nThe memory encoding stage is often referred to as [[motor learning]], and requires an increase in brain activity in motor areas as well as an increase in attention. Brain areas active during motor learning include the motor and somatosensory cortices; however, these areas of activation decrease once the motor skill is learned. The prefrontal and frontal cortices are also active during this stage due to the need for increased attention on the task being learned.<ref name = \"Shadmehr\" />\n\nThe main area involved in motor learning is the [[cerebellum]]. Some models of cerebellar-dependent motor learning, in particular the Marr-Albus model, propose a single plasticity mechanism involving the cerebellar [[long-term depression]] (LTD) of the parallel fiber synapses onto [[Purkinje cells]].  These modifications in synapse activity would mediate motor input with motor outputs critical to inducing motor learning.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Boyden | first1 = E. | last2 = Katoh | first2 = A. | last3 = Raymond | first3 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Cerebellum-dependent learning: the role of multiple plasticity mechanisms | url = | journal = Annu.

Regardless of the mechanism, studies of cerebellar-dependent  motor tasks show that cerebral cortical plasticity is crucial for motor learning, even if not necessarily for storage.<ref name = \"Ma\" />\n\nThe [[basal ganglia]] also play an important role in memory and learning, in particular in reference to stimulus-response associations and the formation of habits. The basal ganglia-cerebellar connections are thought to increase with time when learning a motor task.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Packard | first1 = M. | last2 = Knowlton | first2 = B. | year = 2002 | title = Learning and memory functions of the basal ganglia.  | url = | journal = Annu.

The exact mechanism of motor memory consolidation within the brain is controversial. However, most theories assume that there is a general redistribution of information across the brain from encoding to consolidation.  [[Hebb's rule]] states that \"synaptic connectivity changes as a function of repetitive firing.\" In this case, that would mean that the high amount of stimulation coming from practicing a movement would cause the repetition of firing in certain motor networks, presumably leading to an increase in the efficiency of exciting these motor networks over time.<ref name= \"Ma\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = L. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010| title = ,.

These studies have shown a weakened connection from the cerebellum to the primary motor area with practice, it is presumed, because of a decreased need for error correction from the cerebellum. However, the connection between the basal ganglia and the primary motor area is strengthened, suggesting the basal ganglia play an important role in the motor memory consolidation process.<ref name = \"Ma\" />\n\n===Strength training and adaptations===\n{{See also|Muscle memory (strength training)}}\nWhen participating in any sport, new motor skills and movement combinations are frequently being used and repeated. All sports require some degree of strength, endurance training, and skilled reaching in order to be successful in the required tasks. Muscle memory related to [[Muscle memory (strength training)|strength training]]  involves elements of both motor learning, described below, and long-lasting changes in the muscle tissue.\n\nEvidence has shown that increases in strength occur well before muscle [[hypertrophy]], and decreases in strength due to detraining or ceasing to repeat the exercise over an extended period of time precede muscle [[atrophy]].<ref name = \"Adkins\">{{cite journal | last1 = Adkins | first1 = DeAnna L. | last2 = Boychuck | first2 = Jeffery | year = 2006 | title = Motor training induces experience specific patterns of plasticity across motor cortex and spinal cord | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3d63cc947cfcc449d69c520ee3b6099c9d4bc243| journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 101 | issue = 6| pages = 1776\u20131782 | doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00515.2006 | pmid=16959909}}</ref> To be specific, strength training enhances [[motor neuron]] excitability and induces [[synaptogenesis]], both of which would help in enhancing communication between the nervous system and the muscles themselves.<ref name = \"Adkins\" /> [[File:US Navy 071017-N-0995C-008 Chief Mineman Kevin Sperling, an officer recruiter at Navy Recruiting Processing Station Honolulu, presses two 105-pound dumbbells.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A navy man performs strength training exercises.]]However, neuromuscular efficacy is not altered within a two-week time period following cessation of the muscle usage; instead, it is merely the [[neuron]]'s ability to excite the muscle that declines in correlation with the muscle's decrease in strength.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Deschenes Michael | first1 = R. | last2 = Giles Jennifer | first2 = A. | year = 2002 | title = Neural factors account for strength decrements observed after short-term muscle unloading | url = | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

During the first period of resistance exercise, the authors identify significant adaptations in the human methylome, whereby over 9,000 CpG sites were reported as being significantly hypomethylated, with these adaptations being sustained during the subsequent period of physical in-activity. However, upon secondary exposure to resistance exercise, a greater frequency of hypomethylated CpG sites was observed, where over 18,000 sites reported as being significantly hypomethylated. The authors went on to identify how these changes altered the expression of relevant transcripts, and subsequently correlated these changes with adaptations in skeletal muscle mass.

However there isn't much evidence provided on this.\n\n== Impairment ==\nIt is difficult to display cases of \"pure\" motor memory impairment because the memory system is so widespread throughout the brain that damage is not often isolated to one specific type of memory.  Likewise,  diseases commonly associated with motor deficits, such as [[Huntington's]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], have a wide variety of symptoms and associated brain damage that make it impossible to pinpoint whether or not motor memory is in fact impaired.  Case studies have provided some examples of how motor memory has been implemented in patients with brain damage.\n\nAs Edward S. Casey notes in Remembering, Second Edition: A Phenomenological Study,  declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period. \"The activity of the past, in short, resides in its habitual enactment in the present.\"\n\n=== Consolidation deficit ===\nA recent issue in motor memory is whether or not it consolidates in a manner similar to declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period that eventually becomes stable and less susceptible to damage over time.<ref name = \"Krakauer\" /> An example of stable motor memory consolidation in a patient with brain damage is the case of [[Clive Wearing]]. Clive has severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia owing to damage in his temporal lobes, frontal lobes, and hippocampi, which prevents him from storing any new memories and making him aware of only the present moment. However, Clive still retains access to his procedural memories, to be specific, the motor memories involved in playing the piano. This could be because motor memory is demonstrated through savings over several trials of learning, whereas declarative memory is demonstrated through recall of a single item.<ref name = \"Krakauer\" />  This suggests that lesions in certain brain areas normally associated with declarative memory would not affect motor memory for a well-learned skill.\n\n=== Dysgraphia for the alphabet ===\nCase study: 54-year-old woman with known history of [[epilepsy]]\n\t\nThis patient was diagnosed with a pure form of [[dysgraphia]] of letters, meaning he had no other speech or reading impairments.<ref name=\"Kapur\">{{cite journal |last=Kapur |first=N. |last2=Lawton |first2=N.

[[Hebb's rule]] states that \"synaptic connectivity changes as a function of repetitive firing.\" In this case, that would mean that the high amount of stimulation coming from practicing a movement would cause the repetition of firing in certain motor networks, presumably leading to an increase in the efficiency of exciting these motor networks over time.<ref name= \"Ma\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = L. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010| title = ,.

The researchers went on to examine the human epigenome in order to understand how DNA methylation may aid in creating this effect. During the first period of resistance exercise, the authors identify significant adaptations in the human methylome, whereby over 9,000 CpG sites were reported as being significantly hypomethylated, with these adaptations being sustained during the subsequent period of physical in-activity. However, upon secondary exposure to resistance exercise, a greater frequency of hypomethylated CpG sites was observed, where over 18,000 sites reported as being significantly hypomethylated. The authors went on to identify how these changes altered the expression of relevant transcripts, and subsequently correlated these changes with adaptations in skeletal muscle mass.

Also, it was found that gross motor memory in Alzheimer's patients was the same as that of healthy adults when learning occurs under constant practice.<ref name=\"Dick\" /> This suggests that damage to the hippocampal system does not impair an Alzheimer's patient from retaining new gross motor skills, implying that motor memory for gross motor skills is stored elsewhere in the brain. However there isn't much evidence provided on this.\n\n== Impairment ==\nIt is difficult to display cases of \"pure\" motor memory impairment because the memory system is so widespread throughout the brain that damage is not often isolated to one specific type of memory.  Likewise,  diseases commonly associated with motor deficits, such as [[Huntington's]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], have a wide variety of symptoms and associated brain damage that make it impossible to pinpoint whether or not motor memory is in fact impaired.  Case studies have provided some examples of how motor memory has been implemented in patients with brain damage.\n\nAs Edward S. Casey notes in Remembering, Second Edition: A Phenomenological Study,  declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period. \"The activity of the past, in short, resides in its habitual enactment in the present.\"\n\n=== Consolidation deficit ===\nA recent issue in motor memory is whether or not it consolidates in a manner similar to declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period that eventually becomes stable and less susceptible to damage over time.<ref name = \"Krakauer\" /> An example of stable motor memory consolidation in a patient with brain damage is the case of [[Clive Wearing]]. Clive has severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia owing to damage in his temporal lobes, frontal lobes, and hippocampi, which prevents him from storing any new memories and making him aware of only the present moment. However, Clive still retains access to his procedural memories, to be specific, the motor memories involved in playing the piano. This could be because motor memory is demonstrated through savings over several trials of learning, whereas declarative memory is demonstrated through recall of a single item.<ref name = \"Krakauer\" />  This suggests that lesions in certain brain areas normally associated with declarative memory would not affect motor memory for a well-learned skill.\n\n=== Dysgraphia for the alphabet ===\nCase study: 54-year-old woman with known history of [[epilepsy]]\n\t\nThis patient was diagnosed with a pure form of [[dysgraphia]] of letters, meaning he had no other speech or reading impairments.<ref name=\"Kapur\">{{cite journal |last=Kapur |first=N. |last2=Lawton |first2=N.

It was first [[Scientific description|described]] in 1910 by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]], who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about its distribution and ecology. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the presence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. The mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor'', who based his description of the species on four adult male [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Vietnam.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=O. |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil'').

The film stars [[Richard Pryor]] and [[John Candy]]. The [[screenplay]] by [[Herschel Weingrod]] and Timothy Harris was based on the 1902 [[Brewster's Millions|novel of the same name]] by [[George Barr McCutcheon]]. It is the seventh film based on the story.\n\n==Plot==\nMonty Brewster is a [[Minor League Baseball]] pitcher with the [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] Bulls. He and his best friend Spike Nolan, the Bulls' catcher, are arrested after a post-game bar fight. A man offers to post their bail if they will come to [[New York City]] with him. At the Manhattan law office of Granville & Baxter, Brewster is told that his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert Horn, whom he has never met, has left him his entire $300 million fortune, but only if he can complete a challenge with several conditions.\n\nBrewster can choose to receive $1 million upfront, or attempt to inherit the whole estate by spending $30 million in 30 days. In the former case, the law firm becomes the executor of the estate, collecting a fee for performing this service and dividing the remainder among several charities. In the latter case, Brewster may not own any assets that are not already his at the end of the 30 days. He must get value for the services of anyone he hires, he may donate 5% to charity and lose 5% by gambling, and he may not waste the money by purchasing and destroying valuable objects. Finally, he is not allowed to tell anyone, even Spike. If he fails to spend the entire $30 million, he forfeits any remaining balance and inherits nothing. Brewster decides to take the $30 million challenge, and Angela Drake, a [[paralegal]] from the law firm, is assigned to accompany him and keep track of his spending.\n\nBrewster, who has never earned more than $11,000 a year, rents an expensive hotel suite at the [[Plaza Hotel]], hires personal staff on exorbitant salaries, and places bad gambling bets. However, Spike makes good investments, earning Brewster money. Realizing that he is making no headway, Brewster decides to run for [[Mayor of New York City]] and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging a vote for \"[[None of the Above]].\"\n[[File:Inverted Jenny.png|thumb|160px|left|A copy of the famous ''[[Inverted Jenny]]'' appears in one of the film's gags]]\nThe two major candidates threaten to sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, but they settle out of court for several million dollars. Brewster then hires the [[New York Yankees]] for a three-inning exhibition against the Bulls, with himself as the pitcher. He is forced to end his protest campaign when he learns that he is leading in the polls as a [[write-in candidate]]; the job carries an annual salary of $60,000, which is considered an asset under the terms of the will. Blowing his last $38,000 on a party after the game, Brewster becomes fed up with money and is heartbroken that Spike, Angela, and others around him do not understand his actions.\n\nOn the final day, he finds that the sycophantic treatment he received from his entourage is gone. Shunned by everyone he knows, Brewster makes his way to the law office. Having withdrawn from the election, he learns that the city voted \"None of the Above,\" forcing another election in which none of the previous candidates are running.\n\nWarren Cox, a junior lawyer from the law firm and Angela's fianc\u00e9e, has been bribed by the firm to ensure that Brewster fails to spend the entire $30 million. Moments before time expires, Cox hands Brewster some money previously thought to have been spent and informs him he is not broke. Brewster punches Cox, who threatens to sue and declines Brewster's offer of the money as compensation. Realizing that he will need a lawyer, Brewster pays the money to Angela as a [[Retainer agreement|retainer]]. With the transaction completed and all of the money now gone, Brewster fulfills the terms of the will and inherits the entire $300 million.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as Montgomery Brewster\n* [[John Candy]] as Spike Nolan\n* [[Lonette McKee]] as Angela Drake\n* [[Stephen Collins]] as Warren Cox\n* [[David White (actor)|David White]] as George Granville\n* Jerome Dempsey as Norris Baxter\n* [[Jerry Orbach]] as Charlie Pegler\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Edward Roundfield\n* [[David Wohl (actor)|David Wohl]] as Eugene Provost\n* [[Tovah Feldshuh]] as Marilyn\n* [[Hume Cronyn]] as Uncle Rupert Horn\n* [[Joe Grifasi]] as J.B.

The Unicode standard defines [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]], and [[UTF-32]], and several other encodings are in use. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16, and [[Universal Coded Character Set|UCS]]-2 (without full support for Unicode), a precursor of UTF-16; [[GB 18030|GB18030]] is standardized in China and implements Unicode fully, while not an official Unicode standard.\n\nUTF-8, the dominant encoding on the [[World Wide Web]] (used in over 94% of websites {{As of|2019|November|df=|lc=y}}),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/character_encoding/ranking|title=Usage Survey of Character Encodings broken down by Ranking|website=w3techs.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref> uses one [[byte]]{{efn|The Unicode Consortium uses the ambiguous term byte; The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) use the more specific term [[Octet (computing)|octet]] in current documents related to Unicode.|group=note}}for the first 128 [[code point]]s, and up to 4 bytes for other characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch03.pdf#I1.36559|work=The Unicode Standard|title=Conformance | date=March 2020|accessdate=2020-03-15}}</ref> The first 128 Unicode code points represent the [[ASCII]] characters, which means that any ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text.\n\nUCS-2 uses two bytes (16&nbsp;bits) for each character but can only encode the first 65,536 code points, the so-called [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP).  With 1,112,064 possible Unicode code points corresponding to characters (see [[#Architecture and terminology|below]]) on 17 planes, and with over 143,000 code points defined as of version 13.0, UCS-2 is only able to represent less than half of all encoded Unicode characters.  Therefore, UCS-2 is outdated, though still widely used in software.  UTF-16 extends UCS-2, by using the same [[16-bit]] encoding as UCS-2 for the Basic Multilingual Plane, and a 4-byte encoding for the other planes. As long as it contains no code points in the reserved range U+D800\u2013U+DFFF, a UCS-2 text is valid UTF-16 text.\n\nUTF-32 (also referred to as UCS-4) uses four bytes for each character. Like UCS-2, the number of bytes per character is fixed, facilitating character indexing; but unlike UCS-2, UTF-32 is able to encode all Unicode code points. However, because each character uses four bytes, UTF-32 takes significantly more space than other encodings, and is not widely used.\n\n==Origin and development==\nUnicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard, which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other. Many traditional character encodings share a common problem in that they allow bilingual computer processing (usually using [[Latin character]]s and the local script), but not multilingual computer processing (computer processing of arbitrary scripts mixed with each other).\n\nUnicode, in intent, encodes the underlying characters\u2014[[grapheme]]s and grapheme-like units\u2014rather than the variant [[glyph]]s (renderings) for such characters. In the case of [[Chinese characters]], this sometimes leads to controversies over distinguishing the underlying character from its variant glyphs (see [[Han unification]]).\n\nIn text processing, Unicode takes the role of providing a unique ''code point''\u2014a [[number]], not a glyph\u2014for each character. In other words, Unicode represents a character in an abstract way and leaves the visual rendering (size, shape, [[font]], or style) to other software, such as a [[web browser]] or [[word processor]]. This simple aim becomes complicated, however, because of concessions made by Unicode's designers in the hope of encouraging a more rapid adoption of Unicode.\n\nThe first 256 code points were made identical to the content of [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] so as to make it trivial to convert existing western text. Many essentially identical characters were encoded multiple times at different code points to preserve distinctions used by legacy encodings and therefore, allow conversion from those encodings to Unicode (and back) without losing any information. For example, the \"[[Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms (Unicode block)|fullwidth forms]]\" section of code points encompasses a full duplicate of the Latin alphabet because Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ([[CJK]]) fonts contain two versions of these letters, \"fullwidth\" matching the width of the CJK characters, and normal width. For other examples, see [[duplicate characters in Unicode]].\n\n==={{anchor|Unicode 88}}History===\nBased on experiences with the [[Xerox Character Code Standard]] (XCCS) since 1980,<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/> the origins of Unicode date to 1987, when [[Joe Becker (Unicode)|Joe Becker]] from [[Xerox]] with [[Lee Collins (software engineer)|Lee Collins]] and [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], started investigating the practicalities of creating a universal character set.<ref>{{cite web |title=Summary Narrative |url=https://www.unicode.org/history/summary.html |access-date=2010-03-15}}</ref> With additional input from Peter Fenwick and Dave Opstad,<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/> Joe Becker published a draft proposal for an \"international/multilingual text character encoding system in August 1988, tentatively called Unicode\". He explained that \"[t]he name 'Unicode' is intended to suggest a unique, unified, universal encoding\".<ref name=\"unicode-88\">{{Cite web |url=https://unicode.org/history/unicode88.pdf |title=Unicode 88 |author-last=Becker |author-first=Joseph D. |author-link=Joseph D.

Its fundamental differences from XCCS were proposed by Peter Fenwick and Dave Opstad (pure 16-bit codes), and by [[Lee Collins (Unicode)|Lee Collins]] (ideographic character unification). Unicode retains the many features of XCCS whose utility have been proved over the years in an international line of communication multilingual system products.}}</ref>\n\nIn this document, entitled ''Unicode 88'', Becker outlined a [[16-bit]] character model:<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\nUnicode is intended to address the need for a workable, reliable world text encoding. Unicode could be roughly described as \"wide-body ASCII\" that has been stretched to 16&nbsp;bits to encompass the characters of all the world's living languages. In a properly engineered design, 16&nbsp;bits per character are more than sufficient for this purpose.\n</blockquote>\n\nHis original 16-bit design was based on the assumption that only those scripts and characters in modern use would need to be encoded:<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\nUnicode gives higher priority to ensuring utility for the future than to preserving past antiquities. Unicode aims in the first instance at the characters published in modern text (e.g. in the union of all newspapers and magazines printed in the world in 1988), whose number is undoubtedly far below 2<sup>14</sup> = 16,384. Beyond those modern-use characters, all others may be defined to be obsolete or rare; these are better candidates for private-use registration than for congesting the public list of generally useful Unicodes.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn early 1989, the Unicode working group expanded to include Ken Whistler and Mike Kernaghan of Metaphor, Karen Smith-Yoshimura and Joan Aliprand of [[Research Libraries Group|RLG]], and Glenn Wright of [[Sun Microsystems]], and in 1990, Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag from [[Microsoft]] and Rick McGowan of [[NeXT]] joined the group. By the end of 1990, most of the work on mapping existing character encoding standards had been completed, and a final review draft of Unicode was ready.\n\nThe [[Unicode Consortium]] was incorporated in California on 3 January 1991,<ref>[https://unicode.org/history/publicationdates.html History of Unicode Release and Publication Dates] on ''unicode.org.'' Retrieved February 28, 2017.</ref> and in October 1991, the first volume of the Unicode standard was published. The second volume, covering Han ideographs, was published in June 1992.\n\nIn 1996, a surrogate character mechanism was implemented in Unicode 2.0, so that Unicode was no longer restricted to 16 bits. This increased the Unicode codespace to over a million code points, which allowed for the encoding of many historic scripts (e.g., [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]) and thousands of rarely used or obsolete characters that had not been anticipated as needing encoding. Among the characters not originally intended for Unicode are rarely used Kanji or Chinese characters, many of which are part of personal and place names, making them rarely used, but much more essential than envisioned in the original architecture of Unicode.<ref name=unicoderevisited>{{cite web|last=Searle|first=Stephen J|title=Unicode Revisited|url=http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/unicoderevisited.html|accessdate=2013-01-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Microsoft TrueType specification version 1.0 from 1992 used the name ''Apple Unicode'' instead of ''Unicode'' for the Platform ID in the naming table.\n\n===Unicode Consortium===\n{{Main|Unicode Consortium}}\n\nThe Unicode Consortium is a nonprofit organization that coordinates Unicode's development.

For some scripts on the Roadmap, such as [[Jurchen script|Jurchen]] and [[Khitan small script]], encoding proposals have been made and they are working their way through the approval process. For others scripts, such as [[Maya script|Mayan]] (besides numbers) and [[Rongorongo]], no proposal has yet been made, and they await agreement on character repertoire and other details from the user communities involved.\n\nSome modern invented scripts which have not yet been included in Unicode (e.g., [[Tengwar]]) or which do not qualify for inclusion in Unicode due to lack of real-world use (e.g., [[Klingon scripts|Klingon]]) are listed in the [[ConScript Unicode Registry]], along with unofficial but widely used [[Private Use Areas]] code assignments.\n\nThere is also a [[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative]] focused on special Latin medieval characters. Part of these proposals have been already included into Unicode.\n\nThe [https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/ Script Encoding Initiative], a project run by Deborah Anderson at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] was founded in 2002 with the goal of funding proposals for scripts not yet encoded in the standard.

Out of these 2<sup>16</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup> defined code points, the code points from U+D800 through U+DFFF, which are used to encode surrogate pairs in [[UTF-16]], are reserved by the Standard and may not be used to encode valid characters, resulting in a net total of 2<sup>16</sup> &minus; 2<sup>11</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup> = 1,112,064 possible code points corresponding to valid Unicode characters.  Not all of these code points necessarily correspond to visible characters; several, for example, are assigned to control codes such as [[carriage return]].\n\n===Code point planes and blocks===\n{{Main|Plane (Unicode)}}\nThe Unicode codespace is divided into seventeen ''planes'', numbered 0 to 16:\n\n{{Planes (Unicode)}}\n\nAll code points in the BMP are accessed as a single code unit in [[UTF-16]] encoding and can be encoded in one, two or three bytes in [[UTF-8]]. Code points in Planes 1 through 16 (''supplementary planes'') are accessed as surrogate pairs in UTF-16 and encoded in four bytes in UTF-8.\n\nWithin each plane, characters are allocated within named ''[[Block (Unicode)|blocks]]'' of related characters. Although blocks are an arbitrary size, they are always a multiple of 16 code points and often a multiple of 128 code points. Characters required for a given script may be spread out over several different blocks.\n\n===General Category property===\nEach code point has a single [[Character property (Unicode)#General Category|General Category]] property. The major categories are denoted: Letter, Mark, Number, Punctuation, Symbol, Separator and Other. Within these categories, there are subdivisions. In most cases other properties must be used to sufficiently specify the characteristics of a code point. The possible General Categories are:\n\n{{General Category (Unicode)}}\n\nCode points in the range U+D800\u2013U+DBFF (1,024 code points) are known as high-'''surrogate''' code points, and code points in the range U+DC00\u2013U+DFFF (1,024 code points) are known as low-surrogate code points. A high-surrogate code point followed by a low-surrogate code point form a surrogate pair in [[UTF-16]] to represent code points greater than U+FFFF. These code points otherwise cannot be used (this rule is ignored often in practice especially when not using UTF-16).\n\nA small set of code points are guaranteed never to be used for encoding characters, although applications may make use of these code points internally if they wish. There are sixty-six of these '''noncharacters''': U+FDD0\u2013U+FDEF and any code point ending in the value FFFE or FFFF (i.e., U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, \u2026 U+10FFFE, U+10FFFF). The set of noncharacters is stable, and no new noncharacters will ever be defined.<ref name=\"stability-policy\">{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy\n| url = https://unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref> Like surrogates, the rule that these cannot be used is often ignored, although the operation of the [[byte order mark]] assumes that U+FFFE will never be the first code point in a text.\n\nExcluding surrogates and noncharacters leaves 1,111,998 code points available for use.\n\n'''Private-use''' code points are considered to be assigned characters, but they have no interpretation specified by the Unicode standard<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Properties\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch03.pdf#G43463\n| accessdate = 2020-03-15 }}\n</ref> so any interchange of such characters requires an agreement between sender and receiver on their interpretation. There are three private-use areas in the Unicode codespace:\n\n* Private Use Area: U+E000\u2013U+F8FF (6,400 characters)\n* Supplementary Private Use Area-A: U+F0000\u2013U+FFFFD (65,534 characters)\n* Supplementary Private Use Area-B: U+100000\u2013U+10FFFD (65,534 characters).\n\nGraphic characters are characters defined by Unicode to have particular semantics, and either have a visible [[glyph]] shape or represent a visible space. As of Unicode 13.0 there are 143,696 graphic characters.\n\n'''Format''' characters are characters that do not have a visible appearance, but may have an effect on the appearance or behavior of neighboring characters. For example, {{unichar|200C|Zero-width non-joiner|nlink=}} and {{unichar|200D|Zero-width joiner|nlink=}} may be used to change the default shaping behavior of adjacent characters (e.g., to inhibit ligatures or request ligature formation). There are 163 format characters in Unicode 13.0.\n\nSixty-five code points (U+0000\u2013U+001F and U+007F\u2013U+009F) are reserved as '''control''' codes, and correspond to the [[C0 and C1 control codes]] defined in [[ISO/IEC 6429]]. U+0009 (Tab), U+000A (Line Feed), and U+000D (Carriage Return) are widely used in Unicode-encoded texts. In practice the C1 code points are often improperly-translated ([[Mojibake]]) legacy [[Windows-1252]] characters used by some English and Western European texts with Windows technologies.\n\nGraphic characters, format characters, control code characters, and private use characters are known collectively as ''assigned characters''. '''Reserved''' code points are those code points which are available for use, but are not yet assigned. As of Unicode 13.0 there are 830,606 reserved code points.\n\n===Abstract characters===\nThe set of graphic and format characters defined by Unicode does not correspond directly to the repertoire of ''abstract characters'' that is representable under Unicode. Unicode encodes characters by associating an abstract character with a particular code point.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Character Encoding Model\n| url = https://unicode.org/reports/tr17/\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref> However, not all abstract characters are encoded as a single Unicode character, and some abstract characters may be represented in Unicode by a sequence of two or more characters. For example, a Latin small letter \"i\" with an [[ogonek]], a [[dot above]], and an [[acute accent]], which is required in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], is represented by the character sequence U+012F, U+0307, U+0301. Unicode maintains a list of uniquely named character sequences for abstract characters that are not directly encoded in Unicode.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Named Sequences\n| url = https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamedSequences.txt\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref>\n\nAll graphic, format, and private use characters have a unique and immutable name by which they may be identified. This immutability has been guaranteed since Unicode version 2.0 by the Name Stability policy.<ref name=\"stability-policy\" /> In cases where the name is seriously defective and misleading, or has a serious typographical error, a formal alias may be defined, and applications are encouraged to use the formal alias in place of the official character name. For example, {{unichar|A015|YI SYLLABLE WU}} has the formal alias {{sc2|YI SYLLABLE ITERATION MARK}}, and {{unichar|FE18|PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRA'''KC'''ET|note=[[sic]]}} has the formal alias {{sc2|PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRA'''CK'''ET}}.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Name Aliases\n| url = https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NameAliases.txt\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}</ref>\n\n===Ready-made versus composite characters===\nUnicode includes a mechanism for modifying characters that greatly extends the supported glyph repertoire. This covers the use of [[combining diacritical mark]]s that may be added after the base character by the user. Multiple combining diacritics may be simultaneously applied to the same character. Unicode also contains [[precomposed character|precomposed]] versions of most letter/diacritic combinations in normal use. These make conversion to and from legacy encodings simpler, and allow applications to use Unicode as an internal text format without having to implement combining characters. For example, ''\u00e9'' can be represented in Unicode as [[#Upluslink|U+]]0065 ({{sc2|LATIN SMALL LETTER E}}) followed by U+0301 ({{sc2|COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}}), but it can also be represented as the precomposed character U+00E9 ({{sc2|LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE}}). Thus, in many cases, users have multiple ways of encoding the same character. To deal with this, Unicode provides the mechanism of [[canonical equivalence]].\n\nAn example of this arises with [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet. Unicode provides a mechanism for composing Hangul syllables with their individual subcomponents, known as [[Hangul Jamo]]. However, it also provides 11,172 combinations of precomposed syllables made from the most common jamo.\n\nThe [[CJK]] characters currently have codes only for their precomposed form. Still, most of those characters comprise simpler elements (called [[Radical_(Chinese_characters)|radicals]]), so in principle Unicode could have decomposed them as it did with Hangul. This would have greatly reduced the number of required code points, while allowing the display of virtually every conceivable character (which might do away with some of the problems caused by [[Han unification]]). A similar idea is used by some [[input method]]s, such as [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] and [[Wubi method|Wubi]]. However, attempts to do this for character encoding have stumbled over the fact that Chinese characters do not decompose as simply or as regularly as Hangul does.\n\nA set of [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] was provided in Unicode 3.0 (CJK radicals between U+2E80 and U+2EFF, KangXi radicals in U+2F00 to U+2FDF, and ideographic description characters from U+2FF0 to U+2FFB), but the Unicode standard (ch. 12.2 of Unicode 5.2) warns against using [[Ideographic Description Sequences|ideographic description sequences]] as an alternate representation for previously encoded characters:\n\n{{quote|This process is different from a formal ''encoding'' of an ideograph. There is no canonical description of unencoded ideographs; there is no semantic assigned to described ideographs; there is no equivalence defined for described ideographs. Conceptually, ideographic descriptions are more akin to the English phrase \"an 'e' with an acute accent on it\" than to the character sequence &lt;U+0065, U+0301&gt;.}}\n\n===Ligatures===\nMany scripts, including [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Devanagari|Devan\u0101gar\u012b]], have special orthographic rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special [[ligature (typography)|ligature forms]]. The rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex, requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ACE (Arabic Calligraphic Engine by DecoType in the 1980s and used to generate all the Arabic examples in the printed editions of the Unicode Standard), which became the [[proof of concept]] for [[OpenType]] (by Adobe and Microsoft), [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]] (by [[SIL International]]), or [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]] (by Apple).\n\nInstructions are also embedded in fonts to tell the [[operating system]] how to properly output different character sequences. A simple solution to the placement of combining marks or diacritics is assigning the marks a width of zero and placing the glyph itself to the left or right of the left sidebearing (depending on the direction of the script they are intended to be used with). A mark handled this way will appear over whatever character precedes it, but will not adjust its position relative to the width or height of the base glyph; it may be visually awkward and it may overlap some glyphs. Real stacking is impossible, but can be approximated in limited cases (for example, Thai top-combining vowels and tone marks can just be at different heights to start with). Generally this approach is only effective in monospaced fonts, but may be used as a fallback rendering method when more complex methods fail.\n\n===Standardized subsets===\nSeveral subsets of Unicode are standardized: Microsoft Windows since [[Windows NT 4.0]] supports [[WGL-4]] with 656 characters, which is considered to support all contemporary European languages using the Latin, Greek, or Cyrillic script.

Some systems have made attempts to provide more information about such characters. Apple's [[Last Resort font]] will display a substitute glyph indicating the Unicode range of the character, and the [[SIL International]]'s [[Unicode fallback font|Unicode Fallback]] font will display a box showing the hexadecimal scalar value of the character.\n\n==={{anchor|UTF|UCS}}Mapping and encodings===\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been specified for storing a series of code points as a series of bytes.\n\n<!-- [[Unicode Transformation Format]] redirects here -->\nUnicode defines two mapping methods: the ''Unicode Transformation Format'' (UTF) encodings, and the ''[[Universal Coded Character Set]]'' (UCS) encodings. An encoding maps (possibly a subset of) the range of Unicode ''code points'' to sequences of values in some fixed-size range, termed ''code units''. All UTF encodings map code points to a unique sequence of bytes.<ref>{{cite web|title=UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM|url=https://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html|website=Unicode.org FAQ|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> The numbers in the names of the encodings indicate the number of bits per code unit (for UTF encodings) or the number of bytes per code unit (for UCS encodings and UTF-1). UTF-8 and UTF-16 are the most commonly used encodings. UCS-2 is an obsolete subset of UTF-16; UCS-4 and UTF-32 are functionally equivalent.\n\nUTF encodings include:\n\n* [[UTF-1]], a retired predecessor of UTF-8, maximizes compatibility with [[ISO/IEC 2022|ISO 2022]], no longer part of ''The Unicode Standard''\n* [[UTF-7]], a 7-bit encoding sometimes used in e-mail, often considered obsolete (not part of ''The Unicode Standard'', but only documented as an informational [[Request for Comments|RFC]], i.e., not on the Internet Standards Track)\n* [[UTF-8]], uses one to four bytes for each code point, maximizes compatibility with [[ASCII]]\n* [[UTF-EBCDIC]], similar to UTF-8 but designed for compatibility with [[EBCDIC]] (not part of ''The Unicode Standard'')\n* [[UTF-16]], uses one or two 16-bit code units per code point, cannot encode surrogates\n* [[UTF-32]], uses one 32-bit code unit per code point\n\nUTF-8 uses one to four bytes per code point and, being compact for Latin scripts and ASCII-compatible, provides the ''de facto'' standard encoding for interchange of Unicode text. It is used by [[FreeBSD]] and most recent [[Linux distributions]] as a direct replacement for legacy encodings in general text handling.\n\nThe UCS-2 and UTF-16 encodings specify the Unicode [[Byte Order Mark]] (BOM) for use at the beginnings of text files, which may be used for byte ordering detection (or [[endianness|byte endianness]] detection). The BOM, code point U+FEFF has the important property of unambiguity on byte reorder, regardless of the Unicode encoding used; U+FFFE (the result of byte-swapping U+FEFF) does not equate to a legal character, and U+FEFF in other places, other than the beginning of text, conveys the zero-width non-break space (a character with no appearance and no effect other than preventing the formation of [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]]).\n\nThe same character converted to UTF-8 becomes the byte sequence <code>EF BB BF</code>. The Unicode Standard allows that the BOM \"can serve as signature for UTF-8 encoded text where the character set is unmarked\".<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Unicode Standard, Version 6.2 | publisher=The Unicode Consortium | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-936213-08-5 | page=561 }}</ref> Some software developers have adopted it for other encodings, including UTF-8, in an attempt to distinguish UTF-8 from local 8-bit [[code page]]s. However {{IETF RFC|3629}}, the UTF-8 standard, recommends that byte order marks be forbidden in protocols using UTF-8, but discusses the cases where this may not be possible. In addition, the large restriction on possible patterns in UTF-8 (for instance there cannot be any lone bytes with the high bit set) means that it should be possible to distinguish UTF-8 from other character encodings without relying on the BOM.\n\nIn UTF-32 and UCS-4, one [[32-bit]] code unit serves as a fairly direct representation of any character's code point (although the endianness, which varies across different platforms, affects how the code unit manifests as a byte sequence). In the other encodings, each code point may be represented by a variable number of code units. UTF-32 is widely used as an internal representation of text in programs (as opposed to stored or transmitted text), since every Unix operating system that uses the [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] compilers to generate software uses it as the standard \"[[wide character]]\" encoding. Some programming languages, such as [[Seed7]], use UTF-32 as internal representation for strings and characters. Recent versions of the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language (beginning with 2.2) may also be configured to use UTF-32 as the representation for Unicode strings, effectively disseminating such encoding in [[high-level programming language|high-level]] coded software.\n\n[[Punycode]], another encoding form, enables the encoding of Unicode strings into the limited character set supported by the [[ASCII]]-based [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). The encoding is used as part of [[IDNA]], which is a system enabling the use of [[Internationalized Domain Names]] in all scripts that are supported by Unicode. Earlier and now historical proposals include [[UTF-5]] and [[UTF-6]].\n\n[[GB 18030|GB18030]] is another encoding form for Unicode, from the [[Standardization Administration of China]]. It is the official [[character set]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). [[Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode|BOCU-1]] and [[Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode|SCSU]] are Unicode compression schemes. The [[April Fools' Day RFC]] of 2005 specified two [[parody]] UTF encodings, [[UTF-9]] and [[UTF-18]].\n\n==Adoption==\n\n===Operating systems===\nUnicode has become the dominant scheme for internal processing and storage of text. Although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings, Unicode is used almost exclusively for building new information processing systems. Early adopters tended to use [[UCS-2]] (the fixed-width two-byte precursor to UTF-16) and later moved to [[UTF-16]] (the variable-width current standard), as this was the least disruptive way to add support for non-BMP characters. The best known such system is [[Windows NT]] (and its descendants, [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]]), which uses UTF-16 as the sole internal character encoding. The [[Java virtual machine|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] bytecode environments, [[macOS]], and [[KDE]] also use it for internal representation. Partial support for Unicode can be installed on [[Windows 9x]] through the [[Microsoft Layer for Unicode]].\n\n[[UTF-8]] (originally developed for [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]])<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt\n | title = UTF-8 history\n | first = Rob | last = Pike | authorlink = Rob Pike\n | date = 2003-04-30\n}}</ref> has become the main storage encoding on most [[Unix-like]] operating systems (though others are also used by some libraries) because it is a relatively easy replacement for traditional [[extended ASCII]] character sets. UTF-8 is also the most common Unicode encoding used in [[HTML]] documents on the [[World Wide Web]].\n\nMultilingual text-rendering engines which use Unicode include [[Uniscribe]] and [[DirectWrite]] for Microsoft Windows, [[ATSUI]] and [[Core Text]] for macOS, and [[Pango]] for [[GTK+]] and the [[GNOME]] desktop.\n\n===Input methods===\n{{Main|Unicode input}}\n\nBecause keyboard layouts cannot have simple key combinations for all characters, several operating systems provide alternative input methods that allow access to the entire repertoire.\n\n[[ISO/IEC 14755]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/ISO-14755.pdf |title=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 18/WG 9 N |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> which standardises methods for entering Unicode characters from their code points, specifies several methods. There is the ''Basic method'', where a ''beginning sequence'' is followed by the hexadecimal representation of the code point and the ''ending sequence''. There is also a ''screen-selection entry method'' specified, where the characters are listed in a table in a screen, such as with a character map program.\n\nOnline tools for finding the code point for a known character include Unicode Lookup<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unicodelookup.com/|title=Unicode Lookup|last=Hedley|first=Jonathan|date=2009}}</ref> by Jonathan Hedley and Shapecatcher<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shapecatcher.com/|title=Unicode Character Recognition|last=Milde|first=Benjamin|date=2011}}</ref> by Benjamin Milde. In Unicode Lookup, one enters a search key (e.g. \"fractions\"), and a list of corresponding characters with their code points is returned. In Shapecatcher, based on [[Shape context]], one draws the character in a box and a list of characters approximating the drawing, with their code points, is returned.\n\n===Email===\n{{Main|Unicode and email}}\n\n[[MIME]] defines two different mechanisms for encoding non-ASCII characters in [[email]], depending on whether the characters are in email headers (such as the \"Subject:\"), or in the text body of the message; in both cases, the original character set is identified as well as a transfer encoding. For email transmission of Unicode, the [[UTF-8]] character set and the [[Base64]] or the [[Quoted-printable]] transfer encoding are recommended, depending on whether much of the message consists of [[ASCII]] characters. The details of the two different mechanisms are specified in the MIME standards and generally are hidden from users of email software.\n\nThe adoption of Unicode in email has been very slow. Some East Asian text is still encoded in encodings such as [[ISO-2022]], and some devices, such as mobile phones, still cannot correctly handle Unicode data. Support has been improving, however. Many major free mail providers such as [[Yahoo]], [[Google]] ([[Gmail]]), and [[Microsoft]] ([[Outlook.com]]) support it.\n\n===Web===\n{{Main|Unicode and HTML}}\n\nAll [[W3C]] recommendations have used Unicode as their ''document character set'' since HTML 4.0. [[Web browser]]s have supported Unicode, especially UTF-8, for many years. There used to be display problems resulting primarily from [[typeface|font]] related issues; e.g. v 6 and older of Microsoft [[Internet Explorer]] did not render many code points unless explicitly told to use a font that contains them.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan |last=Wood |url=http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/explorer.html#ie5 |title=Setting up Windows Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 and 6 for Multilingual and Unicode Support |publisher=Alan Wood |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\nAlthough syntax rules may affect the order in which characters are allowed to appear, [[XML]] (including [[XHTML]]) documents, by definition,<ref>{{cite web|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.1 (Second Edition)|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11|accessdate=2013-11-01}}</ref> comprise characters from most of the Unicode code points, with the exception of:\n\n* most of the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C0 control codes]]\n* the permanently unassigned code points D800\u2013DFFF\n* FFFE or FFFF\n\nHTML characters manifest either directly as [[byte]]s according to document's encoding, if the encoding supports them, or users may write them as numeric character references based on the character's Unicode code point. For example, the references <code>&amp;#916;</code>, <code>&amp;#1049;</code>, <code>&amp;#1511;</code>, <code>&amp;#1605;</code>, <code>&amp;#3671;</code>, <code>&amp;#12354;</code>, <code>&amp;#21494;</code>, <code>&amp;#33865;</code>, and <code>&amp;#47568;</code> (or the same numeric values expressed in hexadecimal, with <code>&amp;#x</code> as the prefix) should display on all browsers as \u0394, \u0419, \u05e7 ,\u0645, \u0e57, \u3042, \u53f6, \u8449, and \ub9d0.\n\nWhen specifying [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]], for example as [[URL]]s in [[HTTP]] requests, non-ASCII characters must be [[percent encoding|percent-encoded]].\n\n===Fonts===\n{{Main|Unicode font}}\n\nUnicode is not in principle concerned with fonts ''per se'', seeing them as implementation choices.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/wiley/journals/epobetan/pdf/volume6/issue3/bigelow.pdf  | title = The design of a Unicode font | journal = Electronic Publishing | volume = VOL. 6(3), 289\u2013305 | date = September 1993 | page = 292 |last1 = Bigelow | first1=Charles | last2 = Holmes | first2 = Kris}}</ref> Any given character may have many [[allograph]]s, from the more common bold, italic and base letterforms to complex decorative styles.

These font formats map Unicode code points to glyphs, but TrueType font is restricted to 65,535 glyphs.\n\n[[List of typefaces|Thousands of fonts]] exist on the market, but fewer than a dozen fonts\u2014sometimes described as \"pan-Unicode\" fonts\u2014attempt to support the majority of Unicode's character repertoire. Instead, Unicode-based [[List of Unicode fonts|fonts]] typically focus on supporting only basic ASCII and particular scripts or sets of characters or symbols. Several reasons justify this approach: applications and documents rarely need to render characters from more than one or two writing systems; fonts tend to demand resources in computing environments; and operating systems and applications show increasing intelligence in regard to obtaining glyph information from separate font files as needed, i.e., [[font substitution]]. Furthermore, designing a consistent set of rendering instructions for tens of thousands of glyphs constitutes a monumental task; such a venture passes the point of [[diminishing returns]] for most typefaces.\n\n===Newlines===\n\nGREAT WORK\n\nIn terms of the newline, Unicode introduced {{unichar|2028|LINE SEPARATOR}} and {{unichar|2029|PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR}}. This was an attempt to provide a Unicode solution to encoding paragraphs and lines semantically, potentially replacing all of the various platform solutions. In doing so, Unicode does provide a way around the historical platform dependent solutions. Nonetheless, few if any Unicode solutions have adopted these Unicode line and paragraph separators as the sole canonical line ending characters. However, a common approach to solving this issue is through newline normalization. This is achieved with the Cocoa text system in Mac OS X and also with W3C XML and HTML recommendations. In this approach every possible newline character is converted internally to a common newline (which one does not really matter since it is an internal operation just for rendering). In other words, the text system can correctly treat the character as a newline, regardless of the input's actual encoding.\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Philosophical and completeness criticisms===\n[[Han unification]] (the identification of forms in the [[East Asian language]]s which one can treat as stylistic variations of the same historical character) has become one of the most controversial aspects of Unicode, despite the presence of a majority of experts from all three regions in the [[Ideographic Research Group]] (IRG), which advises the Consortium and ISO on additions to the repertoire and on Han unification.<ref>[http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/characcodehist.html A Brief History of Character Codes], Steven J. Searle, originally written [https://web.archive.org/web/20001216022100/http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/characcodehist.html 1999], last updated 2004</ref>\n\nUnicode has been criticized for failing to separately encode older and alternative forms of [[kanji]] which, critics argue, complicates the processing of ancient Japanese and uncommon Japanese names. This is often due to the fact that Unicode encodes characters rather than glyphs (the visual representations of the basic character that often vary from one language to another). Unification of glyphs leads to the perception that the languages themselves, not just the basic character representation, are being merged.<ref name=\"dw2001\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20130625062705/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/u-secret.html The secret life of Unicode: A peek at Unicode's soft underbelly], Suzanne Topping, 1 May 2001 ''(Internet Archive)''</ref>{{clarify|date=April 2010|reason=\"and, contains\" and meaning of statement}} There have been several attempts to create alternative encodings that preserve the stylistic differences between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in opposition to Unicode's policy of Han unification. An example of one is [[TRON (encoding)|TRON]] (although it is not widely adopted in Japan, there are some users who need to handle historical Japanese text and favor it).\n\nAlthough the repertoire of fewer than 21,000 Han characters in the earliest version of Unicode was largely limited to characters in common modern usage, Unicode now includes more than 92,000 Han characters, and work is continuing to add thousands more historic and dialectal characters used in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\n\nModern font technology provides a means to address the practical issue of needing to depict a unified Han character in terms of a collection of alternative glyph representations, in the form of [[variation Selectors|Unicode variation sequences]]. For example, the Advanced Typographic tables of [[OpenType]] permit one of a number of alternative glyph representations to be selected when performing the character to glyph mapping process. In this case, information can be provided within plain text to designate which alternate character form to select.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|right|Various [[Cyrillic]] characters shown with and without italics]]\nIf the difference in the appropriate glyphs for two characters in the same script differ only in the italic, Unicode has generally unified them, as can be seen in the comparison between Russian (labeled standard) and Serbian characters at right, meaning that the differences are displayed through smart font technology or manually changing fonts.\n\n===Mapping to legacy character sets===\nUnicode was designed to provide code-point-by-code-point [[round-trip format conversion]] to and from any preexisting character encodings, so that text files in older character sets can be converted to Unicode and then back and get back the same file, without employing context-dependent interpretation. That has meant that inconsistent legacy architectures, such as [[combining character|combining diacritics]] and [[precomposed character]]s, both exist in Unicode, giving more than one method of representing some text. This is most pronounced in the three different encoding forms for Korean [[Hangul]]. Since version 3.0, any precomposed characters that can be represented by a combining sequence of already existing characters can no longer be added to the standard in order to preserve interoperability between software using different versions of Unicode.\n\n[[Injective]] mappings must be provided between characters in existing legacy character sets and characters in Unicode to facilitate conversion to Unicode and allow interoperability with legacy software. Lack of consistency in various mappings between earlier Japanese encodings such as [[Shift-JIS]] or [[EUC-JP]] and Unicode led to [[round-trip format conversion]] mismatches, particularly the mapping of the character JIS X 0208 '\uff5e' (1-33, WAVE DASH), heavily used in legacy database data, to either {{unichar|FF5E|FULLWIDTH TILDE}} (in [[Microsoft Windows]]) or {{unichar|301C|WAVE DASH}} (other vendors).<ref>\n[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2166.doc AFII contribution about WAVE DASH], {{Cite web|url=http://www.ingrid.org/java/i18n/unicode.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422181018/http://www.ingrid.org/java/i18n/unicode.html|title=An Unicode vendor-specific character table for japanese|date=2011-04-22|archive-date=2011-04-22|website=web.archive.org<!--|access-date=2019-05-20-->}}</ref>\n\nSome Japanese computer programmers objected to Unicode because it requires them to separate the use of {{unichar|005C|REVERSE SOLIDUS|note=backslash}} and {{unichar|00A5|YEN SIGN}}, which was mapped to 0x5C in JIS X 0201, and a lot of legacy code exists with this usage.<ref>[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/intro-i18n/ch-codes.en.html#s-646problem ''ISO 646-* Problem''], Section 4.4.3.5 of ''Introduction to I18n'', Tomohiro KUBOTA, 2001</ref> (This encoding also replaces tilde '~' 0x7E with macron '\u00af', now 0xAF.) The separation of these characters exists in [[ISO 8859-1]], from long before Unicode.\n\n===Indic scripts===\n[[Indic script]]s such as [[Tamil script|Tamil]] and [[Devanagari]] are each allocated only 128 code points, matching the [[ISCII]] standard. The correct rendering of Unicode Indic text requires transforming the stored logical order characters into visual order and the forming of ligatures (aka conjuncts) out of components. Some local scholars argued in favor of assignments of Unicode code points to these ligatures, going against the practice for other writing systems, though Unicode contains some Arabic and other ligatures for backward compatibility purposes only.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Arabic Presentation Forms-A\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB50.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Arabic Presentation Forms-B\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFE70.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Alphabetic Presentation Forms\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB00.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref> Encoding of any new ligatures in Unicode will not happen, in part because the set of ligatures is font-dependent, and Unicode is an encoding independent of font variations. The same kind of issue arose for the [[Tibetan script]] in 2003 when the [[Standardization Administration of China]] proposed encoding 956 precomposed Tibetan syllables,<ref>{{Cite web | author=China | title=Proposal on Tibetan BrdaRten Characters Encoding for ISO/IEC 10646 in BMP | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02455-n2558-tibetan.pdf | date=2 December 2002 }}</ref> but these were rejected for encoding by the relevant ISO committee ([[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]]).<ref>{{Cite web | author= V. S. Umamaheswaran | title=Resolutions of WG 2 meeting 44 | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2003/03390r-n2654.pdf | at=Resolution M44.20 | date=7 November 2003 }}</ref>\n\n[[Thai alphabet]] support has been criticized for its ordering of Thai characters. The vowels \u0e40, \u0e41, \u0e42, \u0e43, \u0e44 that are written to the left of the preceding consonant are in visual order instead of phonetic order, unlike the Unicode representations of other Indic scripts. This complication is due to Unicode inheriting the [[TIS-620|Thai Industrial Standard 620]], which worked in the same way, and was the way in which Thai had always been written on keyboards. This ordering problem complicates the Unicode collation process slightly, requiring table lookups to reorder Thai characters for collation.<ref name=\"dw2001\" /> Even if Unicode had adopted encoding according to spoken order, it would still be problematic to collate words in dictionary order. E.g., the word {{wiktth|\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e07}} {{IPA-th|sa d\u025b\u02d0\u014b|}} \"perform\" starts with a consonant cluster \"\u0e2a\u0e14\" (with an inherent vowel for the consonant \"\u0e2a\"), the vowel \u0e41-, in spoken order would come after the \u0e14, but in a dictionary, the word is collated as it is written, with the vowel following the \u0e2a.\n\n===Combining characters===\n{{Main|Combining character}}\n{{See also|Unicode normalization#Normalization}}\n\nCharacters with diacritical marks can generally be represented either as a single precomposed character or as a decomposed sequence of a base letter plus one or more non-spacing marks. For example, \u1e17 (precomposed e with macron and acute above) and e&#772;&#769; (e followed by the combining macron above and combining acute above) should be rendered identically, both appearing as an [[e]] with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] and [[acute accent]], but in practice, their appearance may vary depending upon what rendering engine and fonts are being used to display the characters. Similarly, [[dot (diacritic)|underdots]], as needed in the [[romanization]] of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]], will often be placed incorrectly.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Unicode characters that map to precomposed glyphs can be used in many cases, thus avoiding the problem, but where no precomposed character has been encoded the problem can often be solved by using a specialist Unicode font such as [[Charis SIL]] that uses [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]], [[OpenType]], or [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]] technologies for advanced rendering features.\n\n===Anomalies===\n{{main|Unicode alias names and abbreviations}}\nThe Unicode standard has imposed rules intended to guarantee stability.<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html Unicode stability policy]</ref> Depending on the strictness of a rule, a change can be prohibited or allowed. For example, a \"name\" given to a code point cannot and will not change. But a \"script\" property is more flexible, by Unicode's own rules. In version 2.0, Unicode changed many code point \"names\" from version 1. At the same moment, Unicode stated that from then on, an assigned name to a code point will never change anymore. This implies that when mistakes are published, these mistakes cannot be corrected, even if they are trivial (as happened in one instance with the spelling {{sc2|{{typo|BRAKCET}}}} for {{sc2|BRACKET}} in a character name). In 2006 a list of anomalies in character names was first published, and, as of April 2017, there were 94 characters with identified issues,<ref name=\"tn17\">{{cite web |url=https://unicode.org/notes/tn27/ |title=Unicode Technical Note #27: Known Anomalies in Unicode Character Names |date=10 April 2017 |website=unicode.org}}</ref> for example:\n\n* {{unichar|2118|script capital p|nlink=Weierstrass p}}: This is a small letter.

The character repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with [[ISO/IEC 10646]], and both are code-for-code identical.\n\n''The Unicode Standard'' consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard [[character encoding]]s, a set of reference [[data file]]s, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for [[Unicode normalization|normalization]], decomposition, [[Unicode collation algorithm|collation]], rendering, and [[bidirectional text]] display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and left-to-right scripts).<ref>{{Cite web | title = The Unicode Standard: A Technical Introduction | url = https://www.unicode.org/standard/principles.html | accessdate = 2010-03-16}}</ref>\n\nUnicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread and predominant use in the [[internationalization and localization]] of computer [[software]]. The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies, including modern [[operating system]]s, [[XML]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (and other programming languages), and the [[.NET Framework]].\n\n[[Comparison of Unicode encodings|Unicode can be implemented]] by different [[character encoding]]s. The Unicode standard defines [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]], and [[UTF-32]], and several other encodings are in use. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16, and [[Universal Coded Character Set|UCS]]-2 (without full support for Unicode), a precursor of UTF-16; [[GB 18030|GB18030]] is standardized in China and implements Unicode fully, while not an official Unicode standard.\n\nUTF-8, the dominant encoding on the [[World Wide Web]] (used in over 94% of websites {{As of|2019|November|df=|lc=y}}),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/character_encoding/ranking|title=Usage Survey of Character Encodings broken down by Ranking|website=w3techs.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref> uses one [[byte]]{{efn|The Unicode Consortium uses the ambiguous term byte; The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) use the more specific term [[Octet (computing)|octet]] in current documents related to Unicode.|group=note}}for the first 128 [[code point]]s, and up to 4 bytes for other characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch03.pdf#I1.36559|work=The Unicode Standard|title=Conformance | date=March 2020|accessdate=2020-03-15}}</ref> The first 128 Unicode code points represent the [[ASCII]] characters, which means that any ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text.\n\nUCS-2 uses two bytes (16&nbsp;bits) for each character but can only encode the first 65,536 code points, the so-called [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP).  With 1,112,064 possible Unicode code points corresponding to characters (see [[#Architecture and terminology|below]]) on 17 planes, and with over 143,000 code points defined as of version 13.0, UCS-2 is only able to represent less than half of all encoded Unicode characters.  Therefore, UCS-2 is outdated, though still widely used in software.  UTF-16 extends UCS-2, by using the same [[16-bit]] encoding as UCS-2 for the Basic Multilingual Plane, and a 4-byte encoding for the other planes. As long as it contains no code points in the reserved range U+D800\u2013U+DFFF, a UCS-2 text is valid UTF-16 text.\n\nUTF-32 (also referred to as UCS-4) uses four bytes for each character. Like UCS-2, the number of bytes per character is fixed, facilitating character indexing; but unlike UCS-2, UTF-32 is able to encode all Unicode code points. However, because each character uses four bytes, UTF-32 takes significantly more space than other encodings, and is not widely used.\n\n==Origin and development==\nUnicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard, which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other. Many traditional character encodings share a common problem in that they allow bilingual computer processing (usually using [[Latin character]]s and the local script), but not multilingual computer processing (computer processing of arbitrary scripts mixed with each other).\n\nUnicode, in intent, encodes the underlying characters\u2014[[grapheme]]s and grapheme-like units\u2014rather than the variant [[glyph]]s (renderings) for such characters. In the case of [[Chinese characters]], this sometimes leads to controversies over distinguishing the underlying character from its variant glyphs (see [[Han unification]]).\n\nIn text processing, Unicode takes the role of providing a unique ''code point''\u2014a [[number]], not a glyph\u2014for each character. In other words, Unicode represents a character in an abstract way and leaves the visual rendering (size, shape, [[font]], or style) to other software, such as a [[web browser]] or [[word processor]]. This simple aim becomes complicated, however, because of concessions made by Unicode's designers in the hope of encouraging a more rapid adoption of Unicode.\n\nThe first 256 code points were made identical to the content of [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] so as to make it trivial to convert existing western text. Many essentially identical characters were encoded multiple times at different code points to preserve distinctions used by legacy encodings and therefore, allow conversion from those encodings to Unicode (and back) without losing any information. For example, the \"[[Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms (Unicode block)|fullwidth forms]]\" section of code points encompasses a full duplicate of the Latin alphabet because Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ([[CJK]]) fonts contain two versions of these letters, \"fullwidth\" matching the width of the CJK characters, and normal width. For other examples, see [[duplicate characters in Unicode]].\n\n==={{anchor|Unicode 88}}History===\nBased on experiences with the [[Xerox Character Code Standard]] (XCCS) since 1980,<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/> the origins of Unicode date to 1987, when [[Joe Becker (Unicode)|Joe Becker]] from [[Xerox]] with [[Lee Collins (software engineer)|Lee Collins]] and [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], started investigating the practicalities of creating a universal character set.<ref>{{cite web |title=Summary Narrative |url=https://www.unicode.org/history/summary.html |access-date=2010-03-15}}</ref> With additional input from Peter Fenwick and Dave Opstad,<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/> Joe Becker published a draft proposal for an \"international/multilingual text character encoding system in August 1988, tentatively called Unicode\".

Its fundamental differences from XCCS were proposed by Peter Fenwick and Dave Opstad (pure 16-bit codes), and by [[Lee Collins (Unicode)|Lee Collins]] (ideographic character unification). Unicode retains the many features of XCCS whose utility have been proved over the years in an international line of communication multilingual system products.}}</ref>\n\nIn this document, entitled ''Unicode 88'', Becker outlined a [[16-bit]] character model:<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\nUnicode is intended to address the need for a workable, reliable world text encoding. Unicode could be roughly described as \"wide-body ASCII\" that has been stretched to 16&nbsp;bits to encompass the characters of all the world's living languages. In a properly engineered design, 16&nbsp;bits per character are more than sufficient for this purpose.\n</blockquote>\n\nHis original 16-bit design was based on the assumption that only those scripts and characters in modern use would need to be encoded:<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\nUnicode gives higher priority to ensuring utility for the future than to preserving past antiquities. Unicode aims in the first instance at the characters published in modern text (e.g. in the union of all newspapers and magazines printed in the world in 1988), whose number is undoubtedly far below 2<sup>14</sup> = 16,384. Beyond those modern-use characters, all others may be defined to be obsolete or rare; these are better candidates for private-use registration than for congesting the public list of generally useful Unicodes.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn early 1989, the Unicode working group expanded to include Ken Whistler and Mike Kernaghan of Metaphor, Karen Smith-Yoshimura and Joan Aliprand of [[Research Libraries Group|RLG]], and Glenn Wright of [[Sun Microsystems]], and in 1990, Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag from [[Microsoft]] and Rick McGowan of [[NeXT]] joined the group. By the end of 1990, most of the work on mapping existing character encoding standards had been completed, and a final review draft of Unicode was ready.\n\nThe [[Unicode Consortium]] was incorporated in California on 3 January 1991,<ref>[https://unicode.org/history/publicationdates.html History of Unicode Release and Publication Dates] on ''unicode.org.'' Retrieved February 28, 2017.</ref> and in October 1991, the first volume of the Unicode standard was published. The second volume, covering Han ideographs, was published in June 1992.\n\nIn 1996, a surrogate character mechanism was implemented in Unicode 2.0, so that Unicode was no longer restricted to 16 bits. This increased the Unicode codespace to over a million code points, which allowed for the encoding of many historic scripts (e.g., [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]) and thousands of rarely used or obsolete characters that had not been anticipated as needing encoding. Among the characters not originally intended for Unicode are rarely used Kanji or Chinese characters, many of which are part of personal and place names, making them rarely used, but much more essential than envisioned in the original architecture of Unicode.<ref name=unicoderevisited>{{cite web|last=Searle|first=Stephen J|title=Unicode Revisited|url=http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/unicoderevisited.html|accessdate=2013-01-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Microsoft TrueType specification version 1.0 from 1992 used the name ''Apple Unicode'' instead of ''Unicode'' for the Platform ID in the naming table.\n\n===Unicode Consortium===\n{{Main|Unicode Consortium}}\n\nThe Unicode Consortium is a nonprofit organization that coordinates Unicode's development.

Out of these 2<sup>16</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup> defined code points, the code points from U+D800 through U+DFFF, which are used to encode surrogate pairs in [[UTF-16]], are reserved by the Standard and may not be used to encode valid characters, resulting in a net total of 2<sup>16</sup> &minus; 2<sup>11</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup> = 1,112,064 possible code points corresponding to valid Unicode characters.  Not all of these code points necessarily correspond to visible characters; several, for example, are assigned to control codes such as [[carriage return]].\n\n===Code point planes and blocks===\n{{Main|Plane (Unicode)}}\nThe Unicode codespace is divided into seventeen ''planes'', numbered 0 to 16:\n\n{{Planes (Unicode)}}\n\nAll code points in the BMP are accessed as a single code unit in [[UTF-16]] encoding and can be encoded in one, two or three bytes in [[UTF-8]]. Code points in Planes 1 through 16 (''supplementary planes'') are accessed as surrogate pairs in UTF-16 and encoded in four bytes in UTF-8.\n\nWithin each plane, characters are allocated within named ''[[Block (Unicode)|blocks]]'' of related characters. Although blocks are an arbitrary size, they are always a multiple of 16 code points and often a multiple of 128 code points. Characters required for a given script may be spread out over several different blocks.\n\n===General Category property===\nEach code point has a single [[Character property (Unicode)#General Category|General Category]] property. The major categories are denoted: Letter, Mark, Number, Punctuation, Symbol, Separator and Other. Within these categories, there are subdivisions. In most cases other properties must be used to sufficiently specify the characteristics of a code point. The possible General Categories are:\n\n{{General Category (Unicode)}}\n\nCode points in the range U+D800\u2013U+DBFF (1,024 code points) are known as high-'''surrogate''' code points, and code points in the range U+DC00\u2013U+DFFF (1,024 code points) are known as low-surrogate code points. A high-surrogate code point followed by a low-surrogate code point form a surrogate pair in [[UTF-16]] to represent code points greater than U+FFFF. These code points otherwise cannot be used (this rule is ignored often in practice especially when not using UTF-16).\n\nA small set of code points are guaranteed never to be used for encoding characters, although applications may make use of these code points internally if they wish. There are sixty-six of these '''noncharacters''': U+FDD0\u2013U+FDEF and any code point ending in the value FFFE or FFFF (i.e., U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, \u2026 U+10FFFE, U+10FFFF). The set of noncharacters is stable, and no new noncharacters will ever be defined.<ref name=\"stability-policy\">{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy\n| url = https://unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref> Like surrogates, the rule that these cannot be used is often ignored, although the operation of the [[byte order mark]] assumes that U+FFFE will never be the first code point in a text.\n\nExcluding surrogates and noncharacters leaves 1,111,998 code points available for use.\n\n'''Private-use''' code points are considered to be assigned characters, but they have no interpretation specified by the Unicode standard<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Properties\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch03.pdf#G43463\n| accessdate = 2020-03-15 }}\n</ref> so any interchange of such characters requires an agreement between sender and receiver on their interpretation. There are three private-use areas in the Unicode codespace:\n\n* Private Use Area: U+E000\u2013U+F8FF (6,400 characters)\n* Supplementary Private Use Area-A: U+F0000\u2013U+FFFFD (65,534 characters)\n* Supplementary Private Use Area-B: U+100000\u2013U+10FFFD (65,534 characters).\n\nGraphic characters are characters defined by Unicode to have particular semantics, and either have a visible [[glyph]] shape or represent a visible space. As of Unicode 13.0 there are 143,696 graphic characters.\n\n'''Format''' characters are characters that do not have a visible appearance, but may have an effect on the appearance or behavior of neighboring characters. For example, {{unichar|200C|Zero-width non-joiner|nlink=}} and {{unichar|200D|Zero-width joiner|nlink=}} may be used to change the default shaping behavior of adjacent characters (e.g., to inhibit ligatures or request ligature formation). There are 163 format characters in Unicode 13.0.\n\nSixty-five code points (U+0000\u2013U+001F and U+007F\u2013U+009F) are reserved as '''control''' codes, and correspond to the [[C0 and C1 control codes]] defined in [[ISO/IEC 6429]]. U+0009 (Tab), U+000A (Line Feed), and U+000D (Carriage Return) are widely used in Unicode-encoded texts. In practice the C1 code points are often improperly-translated ([[Mojibake]]) legacy [[Windows-1252]] characters used by some English and Western European texts with Windows technologies.\n\nGraphic characters, format characters, control code characters, and private use characters are known collectively as ''assigned characters''. '''Reserved''' code points are those code points which are available for use, but are not yet assigned. As of Unicode 13.0 there are 830,606 reserved code points.\n\n===Abstract characters===\nThe set of graphic and format characters defined by Unicode does not correspond directly to the repertoire of ''abstract characters'' that is representable under Unicode. Unicode encodes characters by associating an abstract character with a particular code point.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Character Encoding Model\n| url = https://unicode.org/reports/tr17/\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref> However, not all abstract characters are encoded as a single Unicode character, and some abstract characters may be represented in Unicode by a sequence of two or more characters. For example, a Latin small letter \"i\" with an [[ogonek]], a [[dot above]], and an [[acute accent]], which is required in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], is represented by the character sequence U+012F, U+0307, U+0301. Unicode maintains a list of uniquely named character sequences for abstract characters that are not directly encoded in Unicode.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Named Sequences\n| url = https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamedSequences.txt\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref>\n\nAll graphic, format, and private use characters have a unique and immutable name by which they may be identified. This immutability has been guaranteed since Unicode version 2.0 by the Name Stability policy.<ref name=\"stability-policy\" /> In cases where the name is seriously defective and misleading, or has a serious typographical error, a formal alias may be defined, and applications are encouraged to use the formal alias in place of the official character name. For example, {{unichar|A015|YI SYLLABLE WU}} has the formal alias {{sc2|YI SYLLABLE ITERATION MARK}}, and {{unichar|FE18|PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRA'''KC'''ET|note=[[sic]]}} has the formal alias {{sc2|PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRA'''CK'''ET}}.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Name Aliases\n| url = https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NameAliases.txt\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}</ref>\n\n===Ready-made versus composite characters===\nUnicode includes a mechanism for modifying characters that greatly extends the supported glyph repertoire. This covers the use of [[combining diacritical mark]]s that may be added after the base character by the user. Multiple combining diacritics may be simultaneously applied to the same character. Unicode also contains [[precomposed character|precomposed]] versions of most letter/diacritic combinations in normal use. These make conversion to and from legacy encodings simpler, and allow applications to use Unicode as an internal text format without having to implement combining characters. For example, ''\u00e9'' can be represented in Unicode as [[#Upluslink|U+]]0065 ({{sc2|LATIN SMALL LETTER E}}) followed by U+0301 ({{sc2|COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}}), but it can also be represented as the precomposed character U+00E9 ({{sc2|LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE}}). Thus, in many cases, users have multiple ways of encoding the same character. To deal with this, Unicode provides the mechanism of [[canonical equivalence]].\n\nAn example of this arises with [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet. Unicode provides a mechanism for composing Hangul syllables with their individual subcomponents, known as [[Hangul Jamo]]. However, it also provides 11,172 combinations of precomposed syllables made from the most common jamo.\n\nThe [[CJK]] characters currently have codes only for their precomposed form. Still, most of those characters comprise simpler elements (called [[Radical_(Chinese_characters)|radicals]]), so in principle Unicode could have decomposed them as it did with Hangul. This would have greatly reduced the number of required code points, while allowing the display of virtually every conceivable character (which might do away with some of the problems caused by [[Han unification]]). A similar idea is used by some [[input method]]s, such as [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] and [[Wubi method|Wubi]]. However, attempts to do this for character encoding have stumbled over the fact that Chinese characters do not decompose as simply or as regularly as Hangul does.\n\nA set of [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] was provided in Unicode 3.0 (CJK radicals between U+2E80 and U+2EFF, KangXi radicals in U+2F00 to U+2FDF, and ideographic description characters from U+2FF0 to U+2FFB), but the Unicode standard (ch. 12.2 of Unicode 5.2) warns against using [[Ideographic Description Sequences|ideographic description sequences]] as an alternate representation for previously encoded characters:\n\n{{quote|This process is different from a formal ''encoding'' of an ideograph. There is no canonical description of unencoded ideographs; there is no semantic assigned to described ideographs; there is no equivalence defined for described ideographs. Conceptually, ideographic descriptions are more akin to the English phrase \"an 'e' with an acute accent on it\" than to the character sequence &lt;U+0065, U+0301&gt;.}}\n\n===Ligatures===\nMany scripts, including [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Devanagari|Devan\u0101gar\u012b]], have special orthographic rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special [[ligature (typography)|ligature forms]]. The rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex, requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ACE (Arabic Calligraphic Engine by DecoType in the 1980s and used to generate all the Arabic examples in the printed editions of the Unicode Standard), which became the [[proof of concept]] for [[OpenType]] (by Adobe and Microsoft), [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]] (by [[SIL International]]), or [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]] (by Apple).\n\nInstructions are also embedded in fonts to tell the [[operating system]] how to properly output different character sequences. A simple solution to the placement of combining marks or diacritics is assigning the marks a width of zero and placing the glyph itself to the left or right of the left sidebearing (depending on the direction of the script they are intended to be used with). A mark handled this way will appear over whatever character precedes it, but will not adjust its position relative to the width or height of the base glyph; it may be visually awkward and it may overlap some glyphs. Real stacking is impossible, but can be approximated in limited cases (for example, Thai top-combining vowels and tone marks can just be at different heights to start with). Generally this approach is only effective in monospaced fonts, but may be used as a fallback rendering method when more complex methods fail.\n\n===Standardized subsets===\nSeveral subsets of Unicode are standardized: Microsoft Windows since [[Windows NT 4.0]] supports [[WGL-4]] with 656 characters, which is considered to support all contemporary European languages using the Latin, Greek, or Cyrillic script. Other standardized subsets of Unicode include the Multilingual European Subsets:<ref>[https://www.evertype.com/standards/iso10646/pdf/cwa13873.pdf CWA 13873:2000&nbsp;\u2013 Multilingual European Subsets in ISO/IEC 10646-1] [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] Workshop Agreement 13873</ref>\n\nMES-1 (Latin scripts only, 335 characters), MES-2 (Latin, Greek and Cyrillic 1062 characters)<ref>[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/mes-2-rationale.html Multilingual European Character Set 2 (MES-2) Rationale], [[Markus Kuhn (computer scientist)|Markus Kuhn]], 1998</ref> and MES-3A & MES-3B (two larger subsets, not shown here).

Some systems have made attempts to provide more information about such characters. Apple's [[Last Resort font]] will display a substitute glyph indicating the Unicode range of the character, and the [[SIL International]]'s [[Unicode fallback font|Unicode Fallback]] font will display a box showing the hexadecimal scalar value of the character.\n\n==={{anchor|UTF|UCS}}Mapping and encodings===\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been specified for storing a series of code points as a series of bytes.\n\n<!-- [[Unicode Transformation Format]] redirects here -->\nUnicode defines two mapping methods: the ''Unicode Transformation Format'' (UTF) encodings, and the ''[[Universal Coded Character Set]]'' (UCS) encodings. An encoding maps (possibly a subset of) the range of Unicode ''code points'' to sequences of values in some fixed-size range, termed ''code units''. All UTF encodings map code points to a unique sequence of bytes.<ref>{{cite web|title=UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM|url=https://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html|website=Unicode.org FAQ|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> The numbers in the names of the encodings indicate the number of bits per code unit (for UTF encodings) or the number of bytes per code unit (for UCS encodings and UTF-1). UTF-8 and UTF-16 are the most commonly used encodings. UCS-2 is an obsolete subset of UTF-16; UCS-4 and UTF-32 are functionally equivalent.\n\nUTF encodings include:\n\n* [[UTF-1]], a retired predecessor of UTF-8, maximizes compatibility with [[ISO/IEC 2022|ISO 2022]], no longer part of ''The Unicode Standard''\n* [[UTF-7]], a 7-bit encoding sometimes used in e-mail, often considered obsolete (not part of ''The Unicode Standard'', but only documented as an informational [[Request for Comments|RFC]], i.e., not on the Internet Standards Track)\n* [[UTF-8]], uses one to four bytes for each code point, maximizes compatibility with [[ASCII]]\n* [[UTF-EBCDIC]], similar to UTF-8 but designed for compatibility with [[EBCDIC]] (not part of ''The Unicode Standard'')\n* [[UTF-16]], uses one or two 16-bit code units per code point, cannot encode surrogates\n* [[UTF-32]], uses one 32-bit code unit per code point\n\nUTF-8 uses one to four bytes per code point and, being compact for Latin scripts and ASCII-compatible, provides the ''de facto'' standard encoding for interchange of Unicode text. It is used by [[FreeBSD]] and most recent [[Linux distributions]] as a direct replacement for legacy encodings in general text handling.\n\nThe UCS-2 and UTF-16 encodings specify the Unicode [[Byte Order Mark]] (BOM) for use at the beginnings of text files, which may be used for byte ordering detection (or [[endianness|byte endianness]] detection). The BOM, code point U+FEFF has the important property of unambiguity on byte reorder, regardless of the Unicode encoding used; U+FFFE (the result of byte-swapping U+FEFF) does not equate to a legal character, and U+FEFF in other places, other than the beginning of text, conveys the zero-width non-break space (a character with no appearance and no effect other than preventing the formation of [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]]).\n\nThe same character converted to UTF-8 becomes the byte sequence <code>EF BB BF</code>. The Unicode Standard allows that the BOM \"can serve as signature for UTF-8 encoded text where the character set is unmarked\".<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Unicode Standard, Version 6.2 | publisher=The Unicode Consortium | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-936213-08-5 | page=561 }}</ref> Some software developers have adopted it for other encodings, including UTF-8, in an attempt to distinguish UTF-8 from local 8-bit [[code page]]s. However {{IETF RFC|3629}}, the UTF-8 standard, recommends that byte order marks be forbidden in protocols using UTF-8, but discusses the cases where this may not be possible. In addition, the large restriction on possible patterns in UTF-8 (for instance there cannot be any lone bytes with the high bit set) means that it should be possible to distinguish UTF-8 from other character encodings without relying on the BOM.\n\nIn UTF-32 and UCS-4, one [[32-bit]] code unit serves as a fairly direct representation of any character's code point (although the endianness, which varies across different platforms, affects how the code unit manifests as a byte sequence). In the other encodings, each code point may be represented by a variable number of code units. UTF-32 is widely used as an internal representation of text in programs (as opposed to stored or transmitted text), since every Unix operating system that uses the [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] compilers to generate software uses it as the standard \"[[wide character]]\" encoding. Some programming languages, such as [[Seed7]], use UTF-32 as internal representation for strings and characters. Recent versions of the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language (beginning with 2.2) may also be configured to use UTF-32 as the representation for Unicode strings, effectively disseminating such encoding in [[high-level programming language|high-level]] coded software.\n\n[[Punycode]], another encoding form, enables the encoding of Unicode strings into the limited character set supported by the [[ASCII]]-based [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). The encoding is used as part of [[IDNA]], which is a system enabling the use of [[Internationalized Domain Names]] in all scripts that are supported by Unicode. Earlier and now historical proposals include [[UTF-5]] and [[UTF-6]].\n\n[[GB 18030|GB18030]] is another encoding form for Unicode, from the [[Standardization Administration of China]]. It is the official [[character set]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). [[Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode|BOCU-1]] and [[Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode|SCSU]] are Unicode compression schemes. The [[April Fools' Day RFC]] of 2005 specified two [[parody]] UTF encodings, [[UTF-9]] and [[UTF-18]].\n\n==Adoption==\n\n===Operating systems===\nUnicode has become the dominant scheme for internal processing and storage of text. Although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings, Unicode is used almost exclusively for building new information processing systems. Early adopters tended to use [[UCS-2]] (the fixed-width two-byte precursor to UTF-16) and later moved to [[UTF-16]] (the variable-width current standard), as this was the least disruptive way to add support for non-BMP characters. The best known such system is [[Windows NT]] (and its descendants, [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]]), which uses UTF-16 as the sole internal character encoding. The [[Java virtual machine|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] bytecode environments, [[macOS]], and [[KDE]] also use it for internal representation. Partial support for Unicode can be installed on [[Windows 9x]] through the [[Microsoft Layer for Unicode]].\n\n[[UTF-8]] (originally developed for [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]])<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt\n | title = UTF-8 history\n | first = Rob | last = Pike | authorlink = Rob Pike\n | date = 2003-04-30\n}}</ref> has become the main storage encoding on most [[Unix-like]] operating systems (though others are also used by some libraries) because it is a relatively easy replacement for traditional [[extended ASCII]] character sets. UTF-8 is also the most common Unicode encoding used in [[HTML]] documents on the [[World Wide Web]].\n\nMultilingual text-rendering engines which use Unicode include [[Uniscribe]] and [[DirectWrite]] for Microsoft Windows, [[ATSUI]] and [[Core Text]] for macOS, and [[Pango]] for [[GTK+]] and the [[GNOME]] desktop.\n\n===Input methods===\n{{Main|Unicode input}}\n\nBecause keyboard layouts cannot have simple key combinations for all characters, several operating systems provide alternative input methods that allow access to the entire repertoire.\n\n[[ISO/IEC 14755]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/ISO-14755.pdf |title=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 18/WG 9 N |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> which standardises methods for entering Unicode characters from their code points, specifies several methods. There is the ''Basic method'', where a ''beginning sequence'' is followed by the hexadecimal representation of the code point and the ''ending sequence''. There is also a ''screen-selection entry method'' specified, where the characters are listed in a table in a screen, such as with a character map program.\n\nOnline tools for finding the code point for a known character include Unicode Lookup<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unicodelookup.com/|title=Unicode Lookup|last=Hedley|first=Jonathan|date=2009}}</ref> by Jonathan Hedley and Shapecatcher<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shapecatcher.com/|title=Unicode Character Recognition|last=Milde|first=Benjamin|date=2011}}</ref> by Benjamin Milde. In Unicode Lookup, one enters a search key (e.g. \"fractions\"), and a list of corresponding characters with their code points is returned. In Shapecatcher, based on [[Shape context]], one draws the character in a box and a list of characters approximating the drawing, with their code points, is returned.\n\n===Email===\n{{Main|Unicode and email}}\n\n[[MIME]] defines two different mechanisms for encoding non-ASCII characters in [[email]], depending on whether the characters are in email headers (such as the \"Subject:\"), or in the text body of the message; in both cases, the original character set is identified as well as a transfer encoding. For email transmission of Unicode, the [[UTF-8]] character set and the [[Base64]] or the [[Quoted-printable]] transfer encoding are recommended, depending on whether much of the message consists of [[ASCII]] characters. The details of the two different mechanisms are specified in the MIME standards and generally are hidden from users of email software.\n\nThe adoption of Unicode in email has been very slow. Some East Asian text is still encoded in encodings such as [[ISO-2022]], and some devices, such as mobile phones, still cannot correctly handle Unicode data. Support has been improving, however. Many major free mail providers such as [[Yahoo]], [[Google]] ([[Gmail]]), and [[Microsoft]] ([[Outlook.com]]) support it.\n\n===Web===\n{{Main|Unicode and HTML}}\n\nAll [[W3C]] recommendations have used Unicode as their ''document character set'' since HTML 4.0. [[Web browser]]s have supported Unicode, especially UTF-8, for many years. There used to be display problems resulting primarily from [[typeface|font]] related issues; e.g. v 6 and older of Microsoft [[Internet Explorer]] did not render many code points unless explicitly told to use a font that contains them.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan |last=Wood |url=http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/explorer.html#ie5 |title=Setting up Windows Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 and 6 for Multilingual and Unicode Support |publisher=Alan Wood |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\nAlthough syntax rules may affect the order in which characters are allowed to appear, [[XML]] (including [[XHTML]]) documents, by definition,<ref>{{cite web|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.1 (Second Edition)|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11|accessdate=2013-11-01}}</ref> comprise characters from most of the Unicode code points, with the exception of:\n\n* most of the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C0 control codes]]\n* the permanently unassigned code points D800\u2013DFFF\n* FFFE or FFFF\n\nHTML characters manifest either directly as [[byte]]s according to document's encoding, if the encoding supports them, or users may write them as numeric character references based on the character's Unicode code point. For example, the references <code>&amp;#916;</code>, <code>&amp;#1049;</code>, <code>&amp;#1511;</code>, <code>&amp;#1605;</code>, <code>&amp;#3671;</code>, <code>&amp;#12354;</code>, <code>&amp;#21494;</code>, <code>&amp;#33865;</code>, and <code>&amp;#47568;</code> (or the same numeric values expressed in hexadecimal, with <code>&amp;#x</code> as the prefix) should display on all browsers as \u0394, \u0419, \u05e7 ,\u0645, \u0e57, \u3042, \u53f6, \u8449, and \ub9d0.\n\nWhen specifying [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]], for example as [[URL]]s in [[HTTP]] requests, non-ASCII characters must be [[percent encoding|percent-encoded]].\n\n===Fonts===\n{{Main|Unicode font}}\n\nUnicode is not in principle concerned with fonts ''per se'', seeing them as implementation choices.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/wiley/journals/epobetan/pdf/volume6/issue3/bigelow.pdf  | title = The design of a Unicode font | journal = Electronic Publishing | volume = VOL. 6(3), 289\u2013305 | date = September 1993 | page = 292 |last1 = Bigelow | first1=Charles | last2 = Holmes | first2 = Kris}}</ref> Any given character may have many [[allograph]]s, from the more common bold, italic and base letterforms to complex decorative styles.

These font formats map Unicode code points to glyphs, but TrueType font is restricted to 65,535 glyphs.\n\n[[List of typefaces|Thousands of fonts]] exist on the market, but fewer than a dozen fonts\u2014sometimes described as \"pan-Unicode\" fonts\u2014attempt to support the majority of Unicode's character repertoire. Instead, Unicode-based [[List of Unicode fonts|fonts]] typically focus on supporting only basic ASCII and particular scripts or sets of characters or symbols. Several reasons justify this approach: applications and documents rarely need to render characters from more than one or two writing systems; fonts tend to demand resources in computing environments; and operating systems and applications show increasing intelligence in regard to obtaining glyph information from separate font files as needed, i.e., [[font substitution]]. Furthermore, designing a consistent set of rendering instructions for tens of thousands of glyphs constitutes a monumental task; such a venture passes the point of [[diminishing returns]] for most typefaces.\n\n===Newlines===\nUnicode partially addresses the [[newline]] problem that occurs when trying to read a text file on different platforms. Unicode defines a large number of [[Newline#Unicode|characters]] that conforming applications should recognize as line terminators.\n\nIn terms of the newline, Unicode introduced {{unichar|2028|LINE SEPARATOR}} and {{unichar|2029|PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR}}. This was an attempt to provide a Unicode solution to encoding paragraphs and lines semantically, potentially replacing all of the various platform solutions. In doing so, Unicode does provide a way around the historical platform dependent solutions. Nonetheless, few if any Unicode solutions have adopted these Unicode line and paragraph separators as the sole canonical line ending characters. However, a common approach to solving this issue is through newline normalization. This is achieved with the Cocoa text system in Mac OS X and also with W3C XML and HTML recommendations. In this approach every possible newline character is converted internally to a common newline (which one does not really matter since it is an internal operation just for rendering). In other words, the text system can correctly treat the character as a newline, regardless of the input's actual encoding.\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Philosophical and completeness criticisms===\n[[Han unification]] (the identification of forms in the [[East Asian language]]s which one can treat as stylistic variations of the same historical character) has become one of the most controversial aspects of Unicode, despite the presence of a majority of experts from all three regions in the [[Ideographic Research Group]] (IRG), which advises the Consortium and ISO on additions to the repertoire and on Han unification.<ref>[http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/characcodehist.html A Brief History of Character Codes], Steven J. Searle, originally written [https://web.archive.org/web/20001216022100/http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/characcodehist.html 1999], last updated 2004</ref>\n\nUnicode has been criticized for failing to separately encode older and alternative forms of [[kanji]] which, critics argue, complicates the processing of ancient Japanese and uncommon Japanese names. This is often due to the fact that Unicode encodes characters rather than glyphs (the visual representations of the basic character that often vary from one language to another). Unification of glyphs leads to the perception that the languages themselves, not just the basic character representation, are being merged.<ref name=\"dw2001\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20130625062705/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/u-secret.html The secret life of Unicode: A peek at Unicode's soft underbelly], Suzanne Topping, 1 May 2001 ''(Internet Archive)''</ref>{{clarify|date=April 2010|reason=\"and, contains\" and meaning of statement}} There have been several attempts to create alternative encodings that preserve the stylistic differences between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in opposition to Unicode's policy of Han unification. An example of one is [[TRON (encoding)|TRON]] (although it is not widely adopted in Japan, there are some users who need to handle historical Japanese text and favor it).\n\nAlthough the repertoire of fewer than 21,000 Han characters in the earliest version of Unicode was largely limited to characters in common modern usage, Unicode now includes more than 92,000 Han characters, and work is continuing to add thousands more historic and dialectal characters used in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\n\nModern font technology provides a means to address the practical issue of needing to depict a unified Han character in terms of a collection of alternative glyph representations, in the form of [[variation Selectors|Unicode variation sequences]]. For example, the Advanced Typographic tables of [[OpenType]] permit one of a number of alternative glyph representations to be selected when performing the character to glyph mapping process. In this case, information can be provided within plain text to designate which alternate character form to select.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|right|Various [[Cyrillic]] characters shown with and without italics]]\nIf the difference in the appropriate glyphs for two characters in the same script differ only in the italic, Unicode has generally unified them, as can be seen in the comparison between Russian (labeled standard) and Serbian characters at right, meaning that the differences are displayed through smart font technology or manually changing fonts.\n\n===Mapping to legacy character sets===\nUnicode was designed to provide code-point-by-code-point [[round-trip format conversion]] to and from any preexisting character encodings, so that text files in older character sets can be converted to Unicode and then back and get back the same file, without employing context-dependent interpretation. That has meant that inconsistent legacy architectures, such as [[combining character|combining diacritics]] and [[precomposed character]]s, both exist in Unicode, giving more than one method of representing some text. This is most pronounced in the three different encoding forms for Korean [[Hangul]]. Since version 3.0, any precomposed characters that can be represented by a combining sequence of already existing characters can no longer be added to the standard in order to preserve interoperability between software using different versions of Unicode.\n\n[[Injective]] mappings must be provided between characters in existing legacy character sets and characters in Unicode to facilitate conversion to Unicode and allow interoperability with legacy software. Lack of consistency in various mappings between earlier Japanese encodings such as [[Shift-JIS]] or [[EUC-JP]] and Unicode led to [[round-trip format conversion]] mismatches, particularly the mapping of the character JIS X 0208 '\uff5e' (1-33, WAVE DASH), heavily used in legacy database data, to either {{unichar|FF5E|FULLWIDTH TILDE}} (in [[Microsoft Windows]]) or {{unichar|301C|WAVE DASH}} (other vendors).<ref>\n[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2166.doc AFII contribution about WAVE DASH], {{Cite web|url=http://www.ingrid.org/java/i18n/unicode.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422181018/http://www.ingrid.org/java/i18n/unicode.html|title=An Unicode vendor-specific character table for japanese|date=2011-04-22|archive-date=2011-04-22|website=web.archive.org<!--|access-date=2019-05-20-->}}</ref>\n\nSome Japanese computer programmers objected to Unicode because it requires them to separate the use of {{unichar|005C|REVERSE SOLIDUS|note=backslash}} and {{unichar|00A5|YEN SIGN}}, which was mapped to 0x5C in JIS X 0201, and a lot of legacy code exists with this usage.<ref>[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/intro-i18n/ch-codes.en.html#s-646problem ''ISO 646-* Problem''], Section 4.4.3.5 of ''Introduction to I18n'', Tomohiro KUBOTA, 2001</ref> (This encoding also replaces tilde '~' 0x7E with macron '\u00af', now 0xAF.) The separation of these characters exists in [[ISO 8859-1]], from long before Unicode.\n\n===Indic scripts===\n[[Indic script]]s such as [[Tamil script|Tamil]] and [[Devanagari]] are each allocated only 128 code points, matching the [[ISCII]] standard. The correct rendering of Unicode Indic text requires transforming the stored logical order characters into visual order and the forming of ligatures (aka conjuncts) out of components. Some local scholars argued in favor of assignments of Unicode code points to these ligatures, going against the practice for other writing systems, though Unicode contains some Arabic and other ligatures for backward compatibility purposes only.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Arabic Presentation Forms-A\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB50.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Arabic Presentation Forms-B\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFE70.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Alphabetic Presentation Forms\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB00.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref> Encoding of any new ligatures in Unicode will not happen, in part because the set of ligatures is font-dependent, and Unicode is an encoding independent of font variations. The same kind of issue arose for the [[Tibetan script]] in 2003 when the [[Standardization Administration of China]] proposed encoding 956 precomposed Tibetan syllables,<ref>{{Cite web | author=China | title=Proposal on Tibetan BrdaRten Characters Encoding for ISO/IEC 10646 in BMP | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02455-n2558-tibetan.pdf | date=2 December 2002 }}</ref> but these were rejected for encoding by the relevant ISO committee ([[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]]).<ref>{{Cite web | author= V. S. Umamaheswaran | title=Resolutions of WG 2 meeting 44 | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2003/03390r-n2654.pdf | at=Resolution M44.20 | date=7 November 2003 }}</ref>\n\n[[Thai alphabet]] support has been criticized for its ordering of Thai characters. The vowels \u0e40, \u0e41, \u0e42, \u0e43, \u0e44 that are written to the left of the preceding consonant are in visual order instead of phonetic order, unlike the Unicode representations of other Indic scripts. This complication is due to Unicode inheriting the [[TIS-620|Thai Industrial Standard 620]], which worked in the same way, and was the way in which Thai had always been written on keyboards. This ordering problem complicates the Unicode collation process slightly, requiring table lookups to reorder Thai characters for collation.<ref name=\"dw2001\" /> Even if Unicode had adopted encoding according to spoken order, it would still be problematic to collate words in dictionary order. E.g., the word {{wiktth|\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e07}} {{IPA-th|sa d\u025b\u02d0\u014b|}} \"perform\" starts with a consonant cluster \"\u0e2a\u0e14\" (with an inherent vowel for the consonant \"\u0e2a\"), the vowel \u0e41-, in spoken order would come after the \u0e14, but in a dictionary, the word is collated as it is written, with the vowel following the \u0e2a.\n\n===Combining characters===\n{{Main|Combining character}}\n{{See also|Unicode normalization#Normalization}}\n\nCharacters with diacritical marks can generally be represented either as a single precomposed character or as a decomposed sequence of a base letter plus one or more non-spacing marks. For example, \u1e17 (precomposed e with macron and acute above) and e&#772;&#769; (e followed by the combining macron above and combining acute above) should be rendered identically, both appearing as an [[e]] with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] and [[acute accent]], but in practice, their appearance may vary depending upon what rendering engine and fonts are being used to display the characters. Similarly, [[dot (diacritic)|underdots]], as needed in the [[romanization]] of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]], will often be placed incorrectly.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Unicode characters that map to precomposed glyphs can be used in many cases, thus avoiding the problem, but where no precomposed character has been encoded the problem can often be solved by using a specialist Unicode font such as [[Charis SIL]] that uses [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]], [[OpenType]], or [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]] technologies for advanced rendering features.\n\n===Anomalies===\n{{main|Unicode alias names and abbreviations}}\nThe Unicode standard has imposed rules intended to guarantee stability.<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html Unicode stability policy]</ref> Depending on the strictness of a rule, a change can be prohibited or allowed. For example, a \"name\" given to a code point cannot and will not change. But a \"script\" property is more flexible, by Unicode's own rules. In version 2.0, Unicode changed many code point \"names\" from version 1. At the same moment, Unicode stated that from then on, an assigned name to a code point will never change anymore. This implies that when mistakes are published, these mistakes cannot be corrected, even if they are trivial (as happened in one instance with the spelling {{sc2|{{typo|BRAKCET}}}} for {{sc2|BRACKET}} in a character name). In 2006 a list of anomalies in character names was first published, and, as of April 2017, there were 94 characters with identified issues,<ref name=\"tn17\">{{cite web |url=https://unicode.org/notes/tn27/ |title=Unicode Technical Note #27: Known Anomalies in Unicode Character Names |date=10 April 2017 |website=unicode.org}}</ref> for example:\n\n* {{unichar|2118|script capital p|nlink=Weierstrass p}}: This is a small letter.

The former, forensic, relates to a discussion or examination performed in public. Because trials in the ancient world were typically held in public, it carries a strong judicial connotation. The second is science, which is derived from the Latin word for 'knowledge' and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, then, forensic science can be seen as the use of the scientific methods and processes in crime solving.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''forensic'' comes from the Latin term ''{{lang|la|for\u0113nsis}}'', meaning \"of or before the forum\".<ref>{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}</ref> The history of the term originates from Roman times, during which a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the [[Roman Forum|forum]]. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word ''forensic''\u2014as a form of legal evidence; and as a category of public presentation.\n\nIn modern use, the term ''forensics'' in the place of ''forensic science'' can be considered incorrect, as the term ''forensic'' is effectively a [[synonym]] for ''legal'' or ''related to courts''. However, the term is now so closely associated with the scientific field that many dictionaries include the meaning that equates the word ''forensics'' with ''forensic science''.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Origins of forensic science and early methods===\n{{main|Forensics in antiquity}}\nThe [[Ancient history|ancient world]] lacked standardized forensic practices, which enabled criminals to escape punishment.

It was developed by Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]], who realized that variation in the genetic code could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jefferys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.\n\nIn 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in the nearby village of [[Enderby, Leicestershire|Enderby]]. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth's murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn's murder but not Lynda's.  Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime.  A friend of [[Colin Pitchfork]] was heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.\n\nBecause of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI : European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreforensics.co.uk/forensic-cases-colin-pitchfork-first-exoneration-through-dna.html|title=Forensic Cases: Colin Pitchfork, First Exoneration Through DNA|website=exploreforensics.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Maturation===\n[[File:JacktheRipperPuck.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cartoon of a man holding a bloody knife looking contemptuously at a display of half-a-dozen supposed and dissimilar likenesses|Police brought to bear the latest techniques of forensic science in their attempts to identify and capture the serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]].]]\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation.

The work combined in one system fields of knowledge that had not been previously integrated, such as psychology and physical science, and which could be successfully used against crime. Gross adapted some fields to the needs of criminal investigation, such as [[crime scene photography]]. He went on to found the Institute of Criminalistics in 1912, as part of the University of Graz' Law School. This Institute was followed by many similar institutes all over the world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Martin|title=Otto Gross, Freudian Psychoanalyst, 1877\u20131920|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]]|year=1999|location=Lampeter|isbn=0-7734-8164-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909, [[Archibald Reiss]] founded the ''Institut de police scientifique'' of the [[University of Lausanne|University of Lausanne (UNIL)]], the first school of forensic science in the world. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]], became known as the \"[[Sherlock Holmes]] of [[France]]\". He formulated the basic principle of forensic science: \"Every contact leaves a trace\", which became known as [[Locard's exchange principle]]. In 1910, he founded what may have been the first criminal laboratory in the world, after persuading the Police Department of [[Lyon]] (France) to give him two attic rooms and two assistants.<ref>[http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206090107/http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm|date=6 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nSymbolic of the new found prestige of forensics and the use of reasoning in detective work was the popularity of the fictional character [[Sherlock Holmes]], written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in the late 19th century. He remains a great inspiration for forensic science, especially for the way his acute study of a crime scene yielded small clues as to the precise sequence of events. He made great use of [[trace evidence]] such as shoe and tire impressions, as well as fingerprints, [[ballistics]] and [[Graphology|handwriting analysis]], now known as [[questioned document examination]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yMDWLq2FdrIC|title=Oxford studies in epistemology|editor=Tamar Szabo Gendler |editor2=John Hawthorne|author=Alexander Bird |chapter=Abductive Knowledge and Holmesian Inference |page=11 |isbn=978-0-19-928590-7 |date=27 June 2006}}</ref> Such evidence is used to test theories conceived by the police, for example, or by the investigator himself.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia Sherlockiana |author=Matthew Bunson |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aSgfAQAAIAAJ |page=50 |isbn=978-0-671-79826-0 |date=19 October 1994}}</ref> All of the techniques advocated by Holmes later became reality, but were generally in their infancy at the time Conan Doyle was writing. In many of his reported cases, Holmes frequently complains of the way the crime scene has been contaminated by others, especially by the police, emphasising the critical importance of maintaining its integrity, a now well-known feature of crime scene examination. He used [[analytical chemistry]] for [[blood residue]] analysis as well as [[toxicology]] examination and determination for poisons. He used [[ballistics]] by measuring bullet [[caliber|calibres]] and matching them with a suspected murder weapon.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fact and feeling: Baconian science and the nineteenth-Century literary imagination |page=214 |author=Jonathan Smith |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hFn1Zx_desIC |isbn=978-0-299-14354-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Late 19th \u2013 early 20th centuries figures ===\nHans Gross applied scientific methods to crime scenes and was responsible for the birth of criminalistics.\n\nEdmund Locard expanded on Gross' work with Locard's Exchange Principle which stated \"whenever two objects come into contact with one another, materials are exchanged between them\". This means that every contact by a criminal leaves a trace. \n\nAlexander Lacassagne, who taught Locard, produced autopsy standards on actual forensic cases.\n\nAlphonse Bertillon was a French criminologist and founder of Anthropometry (scientific study of measurements and proportions of the human body). He used anthropometry for identification, stating that, since each individual is unique, by measuring aspects of physical difference there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, a way of identifying criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body. In 1884, over 240 repeat offenders were caught using the Bertillon system, but the system was largely superseded by fingerprinting.\n\nFrances Glessner Lee, known as \"the mother of forensic science\",<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/nutshells | title=Murder is Her Hobby: Frances Glessner Lee and the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death}}</ref> was instrumental in the development of forensic science in the US.

The former, forensic, relates to a discussion or examination performed in public. Because trials in the ancient world were typically held in public, it carries a strong judicial connotation. The second is science, which is derived from the Latin word for 'knowledge' and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, then, forensic science can be seen as the use of the scientific methods and processes in crime solving.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''forensic'' comes from the Latin term ''{{lang|la|for\u0113nsis}}'', meaning \"of or before the forum\".<ref>{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}</ref> The history of the term originates from Roman times, during which a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the [[Roman Forum|forum]]. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word ''forensic''\u2014as a form of legal evidence; and as a category of public presentation.\n\nIn modern use, the term ''forensics'' in the place of ''forensic science'' can be considered incorrect, as the term ''forensic'' is effectively a [[synonym]] for ''legal'' or ''related to courts''. However, the term is now so closely associated with the scientific field that many dictionaries include the meaning that equates the word ''forensics'' with ''forensic science''.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Origins of forensic science and early methods===\n{{main|Forensics in antiquity}}\nThe [[Ancient history|ancient world]] lacked standardized forensic practices, which enabled criminals to escape punishment. Criminal investigations and trials relied heavily on forced [[Confession (law)|confessions]] and witness [[testimony]]. However, ancient sources do contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow concepts in forensic science developed centuries later.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schafer|first=Elizabeth D.|title=Forensic Science|chapter=Ancient science and forensics |editor=Ayn Embar-seddon |editor2=Allan D.

In light of this, the owner of that sickle confessed to the murder.

It was developed by Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]], who realized that variation in the genetic code could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jefferys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.\n\nIn 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in the nearby village of [[Enderby, Leicestershire|Enderby]]. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth's murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn's murder but not Lynda's.  Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime.  A friend of [[Colin Pitchfork]] was heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.\n\nBecause of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI : European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreforensics.co.uk/forensic-cases-colin-pitchfork-first-exoneration-through-dna.html|title=Forensic Cases: Colin Pitchfork, First Exoneration Through DNA|website=exploreforensics.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Maturation===\n[[File:JacktheRipperPuck.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cartoon of a man holding a bloody knife looking contemptuously at a display of half-a-dozen supposed and dissimilar likenesses|Police brought to bear the latest techniques of forensic science in their attempts to identify and capture the serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]].]]\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation.

The work combined in one system fields of knowledge that had not been previously integrated, such as psychology and physical science, and which could be successfully used against crime. Gross adapted some fields to the needs of criminal investigation, such as [[crime scene photography]]. He went on to found the Institute of Criminalistics in 1912, as part of the University of Graz' Law School. This Institute was followed by many similar institutes all over the world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Martin|title=Otto Gross, Freudian Psychoanalyst, 1877\u20131920|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]]|year=1999|location=Lampeter|isbn=0-7734-8164-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909, [[Archibald Reiss]] founded the ''Institut de police scientifique'' of the [[University of Lausanne|University of Lausanne (UNIL)]], the first school of forensic science in the world. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]], became known as the \"[[Sherlock Holmes]] of [[France]]\". He formulated the basic principle of forensic science: \"Every contact leaves a trace\", which became known as [[Locard's exchange principle]]. In 1910, he founded what may have been the first criminal laboratory in the world, after persuading the Police Department of [[Lyon]] (France) to give him two attic rooms and two assistants.<ref>[http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206090107/http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm|date=6 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nSymbolic of the new found prestige of forensics and the use of reasoning in detective work was the popularity of the fictional character [[Sherlock Holmes]], written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in the late 19th century. He remains a great inspiration for forensic science, especially for the way his acute study of a crime scene yielded small clues as to the precise sequence of events. He made great use of [[trace evidence]] such as shoe and tire impressions, as well as fingerprints, [[ballistics]] and [[Graphology|handwriting analysis]], now known as [[questioned document examination]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yMDWLq2FdrIC|title=Oxford studies in epistemology|editor=Tamar Szabo Gendler |editor2=John Hawthorne|author=Alexander Bird |chapter=Abductive Knowledge and Holmesian Inference |page=11 |isbn=978-0-19-928590-7 |date=27 June 2006}}</ref> Such evidence is used to test theories conceived by the police, for example, or by the investigator himself.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia Sherlockiana |author=Matthew Bunson |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aSgfAQAAIAAJ |page=50 |isbn=978-0-671-79826-0 |date=19 October 1994}}</ref> All of the techniques advocated by Holmes later became reality, but were generally in their infancy at the time Conan Doyle was writing. In many of his reported cases, Holmes frequently complains of the way the crime scene has been contaminated by others, especially by the police, emphasising the critical importance of maintaining its integrity, a now well-known feature of crime scene examination. He used [[analytical chemistry]] for [[blood residue]] analysis as well as [[toxicology]] examination and determination for poisons. He used [[ballistics]] by measuring bullet [[caliber|calibres]] and matching them with a suspected murder weapon.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fact and feeling: Baconian science and the nineteenth-Century literary imagination |page=214 |author=Jonathan Smith |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hFn1Zx_desIC |isbn=978-0-299-14354-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Late 19th \u2013 early 20th centuries figures ===\nHans Gross applied scientific methods to crime scenes and was responsible for the birth of criminalistics.\n\nEdmund Locard expanded on Gross' work with Locard's Exchange Principle which stated \"whenever two objects come into contact with one another, materials are exchanged between them\". This means that every contact by a criminal leaves a trace. \n\nAlexander Lacassagne, who taught Locard, produced autopsy standards on actual forensic cases.\n\nAlphonse Bertillon was a French criminologist and founder of Anthropometry (scientific study of measurements and proportions of the human body). He used anthropometry for identification, stating that, since each individual is unique, by measuring aspects of physical difference there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, a way of identifying criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body. In 1884, over 240 repeat offenders were caught using the Bertillon system, but the system was largely superseded by fingerprinting.\n\nFrances Glessner Lee, known as \"the mother of forensic science\",<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/nutshells | title=Murder is Her Hobby: Frances Glessner Lee and the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death}}</ref> was instrumental in the development of forensic science in the US.

Some states require accreditation, but some states do not.  Because of this, many labs have been caught performing very poor work resulting in false convictions or acquittals.

It is the tallest of the three species of [[camel]]; adult males stand {{convert|1.8|\u2013|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, while females are {{convert|1.7|\u2013|1.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Males  typically weigh between {{convert|400|and|600|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and females weigh between {{convert|300|and|540|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The species' distinctive features include its long, curved neck, narrow chest, a single hump (compared with two on the [[Bactrian camel]] and [[wild Bactrian camel]]), and long hairs on the throat, shoulders and hump. The coat is generally a shade of brown. The hump, {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall or more, is made of fat bound together by [[fibrous tissue]].\n\nDromedaries are mainly active during daylight hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which are led by a [[Dominance (ethology)|dominant]] male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, such as the ability to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a [[gestation]] of 15 months.\n\nThe dromedary has not occurred naturally in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first [[Domestication of animals|domesticated]] in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the [[Sahara Desert]]. The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a [[beast of burden]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"dromedary\" comes from the [[Old French]] ''dromedaire'' or the [[Late Latin]] ''dromedarius''.

It is the tallest of the three species of [[camel]]; adult males stand {{convert|1.8|\u2013|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, while females are {{convert|1.7|\u2013|1.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Males  typically weigh between {{convert|400|and|600|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and females weigh between {{convert|300|and|540|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The species' distinctive features include its long, curved neck, narrow chest, a single hump (compared with two on the [[Bactrian camel]] and [[wild Bactrian camel]]), and long hairs on the throat, shoulders and hump. The coat is generally a shade of brown. The hump, {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall or more, is made of fat bound together by [[fibrous tissue]].\n\nDromedaries are mainly active during daylight hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which are led by a [[Dominance (ethology)|dominant]] male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, such as the ability to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a [[gestation]] of 15 months.\n\nThe dromedary has not occurred naturally in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first [[Domestication of animals|domesticated]] in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the [[Sahara Desert]]. The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a [[beast of burden]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"dromedary\" comes from the [[Old French]] ''dromedaire'' or the [[Late Latin]] ''dromedarius''.

The total dromedary population in Australia is 0.5 million as of 2005. Nearly 99% of the populations are feral, and they have annual growth rate of 10%.<ref name=rosati/> Most of the [[Australian feral camel|Australian feral camels]] are dromedaries, with only a few Bactrian camels. Most of the dromedaries occur in [[Western Australia]], with smaller populations in the [[Northern Territory]], [[Western Queensland]] and northern [[South Australia]].<ref name=rosati/>\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nThe strength and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal.<ref name=camel/> According to [[Richard Bulliet]], they can be used for a wide variety of purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, and trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather.<ref name=bulliet/> The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several [[Bedouin]] pastoralist tribes of northern [[Arabia]], such as the [[Ruwallah]], the [[Bani Sakhr]] and the [[Mutayr]].<ref name=sweet>{{cite journal|last1=Sweet|first1=L.E.|title=Camel raiding of North Arabian Bedouin: a mechanism of ecological adaptation|journal=[[American Anthropologist]]|date=1965|volume=67|issue=5|pages=1132\u201350|doi=10.1525/aa.1965.67.5.02a00030}}</ref>\n\n===Riding camels===\n{{main|Camel racing}}\n[[File:Bait al-Faqih.jpg|thumb|Dromedaries at [[Bait al-Faqih]] Market, Yemen]]\n[[File:Camel in desert.JPG|thumb|A camel decorated for a tourist camel ride in the [[Judean Desert]]]]\n\nAlthough the role of the camel is diminishing with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas.

D.

The first segment sees host Scott Herriot at [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]] in the [[Magic Kingdom]], where riders are challenged to hold cups of water in their mouth during the ride.\n\nThe next segment of the show which is Scott heading to the Morocco pavilion at Epcot '94 to see [[Hulk Hogan]] who was starring in [[Thunder in Paradise]]. After Scott meets Hulk on the set, Hulk then literally gives Scott a lift to Marrakech. After hearing from the waiter that there's one tagine chicken left, Hulk and Scott arm-wrestled for it but Scott lost and ended up with a bologna sandwich. After Scott leaves Hulk to sign autographs, he heads to Disney MGM Studios to check out the then-soon to be opened [[Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]]. Imagine riding up 199 feet in a squeaky old elevator. Then the doors open and you look out at a spectacular view of the park. Then the drop happens! It's a 13-story free-fall straight to the bottom and it is like falling off a really tall mountain except you don't have a parachute on. Scott ends the segment by saying that there will be a warning sign directly on the ride. Scott then heads back to Epcot '94 to play a game at the interactive fountain to see how many people can make it through the fountain without getting wet. Scott says that \"it is like having the world's biggest squirt gun and the whole world is your little sister\". After the game, Scott then meets the cast and creative director of the show Splashtacular.

After finding his way out of there, Scott heads to the [[Pirates of the Caribbean]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] to play a game.

Scott heads back to Disney MGM Studios at [[The Magic of Disney Animation]] to take a look at [[The Lion King]]. Once inside while looking at his own drawing, Scott is informed by animator Aaron Blaise that they don't actually paint by number.

The frontiersmen tell Scott that he's almost out of time and he has to go down to Pleasure Island to check out the Jazz Club.

Scott leaves Kermit saying \"that guy looks a lot like [[Kermit the Frog]]\" not knowing that he is the real deal. After Scott settles in, he watches the movie and kind of interacts with the [[Muppets]]. And as always the film ends with the Swedish Chef firing a cannon into the movie screen. After the film, Scott says that he can't tell the viewers about it \"but it involves the Swedish Chef, a bunch of penguins and a really big cannon\"  Kermit the Frog comes up to Scott and tells him that the glasses need to come back to the theater. Scott then realizes that it really is Kermit the Frog and asks him about the pie scene and Kermit offers to demonstrate.

After going over the layout of the course, Scott interviews the two families that are competing: The Yohe family from [[Syracuse, New York]] and The Nichols family from Boberbuck, Missouri. The race begins and the Nichols family took a small lead across the water to beach B then held on to that lead going into the paddle boat leg. But the Yohe family were catching up and pulled on ahead and they then pedaled backwards back to beach A. The Yohes take the tag and held on a huge lead going into the colored flags where under two of them the players must find a [[Mickey Mouse]] figure. But the Nichols had caught up and they were the first to find the mickey figure. The players then carry their colored flags to two traffic cones with the Nichols being the first to do so and heading towards the water slide. The Yohes were in hot pursuit but it was the Nichols family who came in first. For being the winners, the Nichols family earned these Gaudi gold medals, [[Goofy]] shirts and gift certificates.

The first segment sees host Scott Herriot at [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]] in the [[Magic Kingdom]], where riders are challenged to hold cups of water in their mouth during the ride.\n\nThe next segment of the show which is Scott heading to the Morocco pavilion at Epcot '94 to see [[Hulk Hogan]] who was starring in [[Thunder in Paradise]]. After Scott meets Hulk on the set, Hulk then literally gives Scott a lift to Marrakech.

After Scott leaves Hulk to sign autographs, he heads to Disney MGM Studios to check out the then-soon to be opened [[Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]]. Imagine riding up 199 feet in a squeaky old elevator. Then the doors open and you look out at a spectacular view of the park. Then the drop happens! It's a 13-story free-fall straight to the bottom and it is like falling off a really tall mountain except you don't have a parachute on. Scott ends the segment by saying that there will be a warning sign directly on the ride. Scott then heads back to Epcot '94 to play a game at the interactive fountain to see how many people can make it through the fountain without getting wet. Scott says that \"it is like having the world's biggest squirt gun and the whole world is your little sister\". After the game, Scott then meets the cast and creative director of the show Splashtacular. If you put a manhole cover on one of the super-shooters it would launch a human being about 60 to 80 feet in the air. Scott says that the fountain is \"more fun than a [[7-Eleven]] Big Gulp\". Then Scott travels to The Living Seas and interviews Marine Biologist Conrad Litz about the then-new dolphin keyboard project.

Scott says that \"Innovations+Inventions=Innoventions\" and that the future looks \"mighty nice\" and that is \"innoventive\". Scott heads back to Disney MGM Studios at [[The Magic of Disney Animation]] to take a look at [[The Lion King]]. Once inside while looking at his own drawing, Scott is informed by animator Aaron Blaise that they don't actually paint by number. Aaron then tells Scott about the making of The Lion King \"in 30 seconds\". Later Aaron presents Scott of a drawing of him and a bear. Aaron then tells Scott that the big bears \"are attracted to dark pink shirts\" but Scott is wearing a light pink shirt. The Magic Kingdom is Scott's next stop to see [[Nancy Kerrigan]]. After showing off her moves on the ice, Nancy asks Scott if he ever skated. To which Scott (wearing a Speed Skating suit) says he never skated before. Before Nancy offers to show Scott how it's done, Scott asks Nancy if she's ever timed herself of how many spins in the air. Nancy says \"No\" and Scott offers to time her. After Scott says \"Go', Nancy begins spinning. While Nancy is spinning Scott was reading the newspaper comics, checking the stopwatch, ordering pizza, shaving and eating ice cream. After Nancy is done, Scott then tells Nancy to let ''him'' give it a try. But Scott leaped from the Magic Kingdom to Disney MGM Studios. Scott comes back to Disney's Wilderness Lodge to warm up by the fire and says that it \"gets the chill out of your bones\". It's revealed that three Frontiersmen were singing the song all along. The frontiersmen tell Scott that he's almost out of time and he has to go down to Pleasure Island to check out the Jazz Club. After the frontiersmen were done singing, Scott asks the viewers if they ever remember them opening for [[Led Zeppelin]] back in '74. As told, Scott heads to the Jazz Club and explain that the Jazz Club is one of then-eight great clubs on Pleasure Island and also you can listen to the great jazz of yesterday and today. After the Jazz Club, Scott plays some midway carnival games. (where he cheats on the Test Your Strength game) Then Scott checks out the New Year's Eve countdown held every night. Then Scott and the viewers once again check up on what is coming up in the months ahead at Walt Disney World. Coming soon in July The Lion King is turned into the Legend Of The Lion King stage show. Later experience the thrilling drops of [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]]. \"Is that the Stop button?\" Mickey Mania marches down Main Street U.S.A. And so ends Episode 2 and Scott's search for a bear. While Scott is talking, he is interrupted when he sees [[Winnie the Pooh (character)|Winnie the Pooh]] walking by. Scott thinks he has finally found his bear and runs towards Pooh saying that he \"just wanted an autograph\".\n\n===Episode 3 (August, 1994)===\n\nIn the brand new and exciting edition of Walt Disney World Inside Out, Scott Herriott is your \"Host, hydrolysis expert,\" and tour guide through Walt Disney World. First Scott heads to Disney MGM Studios to see [[Jim Henson's Muppet Vision 3D]] where he interviews guests about what they are expecting from this show. After Scott bumps into [[Sweetums]], Scott receives his 3-D glasses and is told by [[Kermit the Frog]] that there is no videotaping inside the theater. Scott leaves Kermit saying \"that guy looks a lot like [[Kermit the Frog]]\" not knowing that he is the real deal. After Scott settles in, he watches the movie and kind of interacts with the [[Muppets]]. And as always the film ends with the Swedish Chef firing a cannon into the movie screen. After the film, Scott says that he can't tell the viewers about it \"but it involves the Swedish Chef, a bunch of penguins and a really big cannon\"  Kermit the Frog comes up to Scott and tells him that the glasses need to come back to the theater. Scott then realizes that it really is Kermit the Frog and asks him about the pie scene and Kermit offers to demonstrate. Kermit then tosses the pie into Scott's face and Scott says that \"it seems so real\". Kermit tells Scott that it's much how they  did it . Scott asks Kermit about having dinner tonight and that \"dessert's on me\". Scott then plays tennis at [[Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa]] with a kid (the same kid from the intro of this episode) and indicates that the kid's mom produces the show. Then Scott talks about the Legend of the Lion King stage show at the Magic Kingdom. Scott then travels to Bay Lake and talk about \"the warm sun, the cool breeze, the water gently lapping at your...lap\" and the Hobie 16s before a lifeguard asks Scott if he would try the Hobie 16 out in the water by himself. Scott declines and thanks the lifeguard for asking that question. Scott heads to [[Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort]] to host the Walt Disney World Inside Out Hydro-man Water Race. After going over the layout of the course, Scott interviews the two families that are competing: The Yohe family from [[Syracuse, New York]] and The Nichols family from Boberbuck, Missouri. The race begins and the Nichols family took a small lead across the water to beach B then held on to that lead going into the paddle boat leg. But the Yohe family were catching up and pulled on ahead and they then pedaled backwards back to beach A. The Yohes take the tag and held on a huge lead going into the colored flags where under two of them the players must find a [[Mickey Mouse]] figure. But the Nichols had caught up and they were the first to find the mickey figure. The players then carry their colored flags to two traffic cones with the Nichols being the first to do so and heading towards the water slide. The Yohes were in hot pursuit but it was the Nichols family who came in first. For being the winners, the Nichols family earned these Gaudi gold medals, [[Goofy]] shirts and gift certificates. Also since everyone's a winner at Walt Disney World, the Yohe family as well earned the Goofy shirts and the gift certificates. Then Scott checks out the then-new [[Disney's All-Star Sports Resort]]. Scott heads on over to Epcot '94 to go inside [[Innoventions (Epcot)|Innoventions]] and play video games. Scott goes to [[Typhoon Lagoon]] and interviews some guests.

At Disney Studios experience the faster than gravity falls of the terrifying then-new [[Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]]. In the [[Magic Kingdom]], Legend of The Lion King opens. And at Epcot '94 [[Innoventions (Epcot)]] opens for business. After signing off, Scott hits his golf ball and heads back to Disney-MGM-Studios to search for the ball. Kermit arrives and Scott shows him his club as a clue. Then the ball landed directly behind them and Kermit tells Scott that he was slicing the ball a bit to the left. After Scott and Kermit did some golfing jokes, the episode ends.\n\n===Episode 4 (September, 1994)===\n\nNote: Starting with this episode the announcer was Marc Elliot.\n\nIn this hugely international episode of Walt Disney World Inside Out, Scott Herriot is your host and multilinguist. Today, he takes the viewers on a tour of [[World Showcase]] at Epcot '94. Then the announcer Marc Elliot fills us in with what else Scott is doing in this episode. So pack your bags, grab your passports and \"keep your arms and legs inside the sofa at all times\" because we're heading off on a journey to visit 11 countries in \"27 and a half minutes\". First Scott heads to Disney-MGM-Studios to ride [[Star Tours]]. His mission: Save the universe \"without messing up his hair\". After interviewing guests waiting in line as well as a cast member who told Scott that the first time he put on the shirt that he was wearing he felt that he \"looked like a parking cone\", Scott goes on the ride but before the ride began Scott said \"May the force be with you, live long and prosper and [[Remember the Alamo]]\". After the ride Scott asks some kids where the restrooms are. Scott begins his tour of World Showcase starting in Germany. Scott says that Germany \"makes you think of cities like [[Hamburg]], Friedberg, [[Steven Spielberg]], me in lederhosen\". Then Scott talks to Patrick Hanfert and Katrin Schnadt two of the cast members in Germany. Then Scott gives out the first of four international questions about Germany. \"Lederhosen translates literally to leather pants and your question is: Do you think I should wear them more often?\". Both Katrin and Patrick said \"No\" and \"Absolutely not\". Scott asks how Germans say Mickey Mouse which leads into the next segment that deals with Mickey Mania the Magic Kingdom's then-newest parade. Then Scott travels to Japan and talks to two more cast members. He also gives the second question: \"[[Godzilla]]. Do you think that he should be a good running mate in 1996?\". The two cast members didn't come up with an answer so Scott heads on down to Discovery Island \" a huge island zoo and anyone can come and see it. It's a place full of wild animals and strange sounds. A place not unlike my own dressing room\". After Scott disembarked the boat, Kim Murphy [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s corporate V.P. for environmental policy shows Scott around the island (including the Birds of Prey show area). In a remote segment, [[Howie Mandel]] interviews guests and goes onto the Backlot Studio tour. Scott then continues the World Showcase adventure by going to Mexico.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
