Specifically, AI is the ability of computer algorithms to approximate conclusions without direct human input.\n\nWhat distinguishes AI technology from traditional technologies in health care is the ability to gain information, process it and give a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through [[machine learning]] [[algorithms]]. These algorithms can recognize patterns in behavior and create their own logic. In order to reduce the margin of error, AI algorithms need to be tested repeatedly. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: if you set a goal, the algorithm can't adjust itself and only understand what it has been told explicitly, (2) and algorithms are [[black box]]es; algorithms can predict extremely precise, but not the cause or the why.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://hbr.org/2016/01/algorithms-need-managers-too |title= Algorithms Need Managers, Too |date=2016-01-01 |work=Harvard Business Review |access-date=2018-10-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe primary aim of health-related AI applications is to analyze relationships between prevention or treatment techniques and patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Coiera E | date = 1997 | title = Guide to medical informatics, the Internet and telemedicine. | publisher = Chapman & Hall, Ltd. }}</ref> AI programs have been developed and applied to practices such as [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] processes, [[Medical guideline|treatment protocol]] development, [[drug development]], [[personalized medicine]], and [[patient monitoring]] and care.

The U.S. News Staff (2018) writes that in the near future, doctors who utilize AI will \u201cwin out\u201d over the doctors who don't. AI will not replace healthcare workers but instead, allow them more time for bedside cares. AI may avert healthcare worker burn out and cognitive overload. Overall, as Quan-Haase (2018) says, technology \u201cextends to the accomplishment of societal goals, including higher levels of security, better means of communication over time and space, improved health care, and increased autonomy\u201d (p.&nbsp;43).

The U.S. News Staff (2018) writes that in the near future, doctors who utilize AI will \u201cwin out\u201d over the doctors who don't. AI will not replace healthcare workers but instead, allow them more time for bedside cares. AI may avert healthcare worker burn out and cognitive overload. Overall, as Quan-Haase (2018) says, technology \u201cextends to the accomplishment of societal goals, including higher levels of security, better means of communication over time and space, improved health care, and increased autonomy\u201d (p.&nbsp;43). As we adapt and utilize AI into our practice we can enhance our care to our patients resulting in greater outcomes for all.\n\n==Expanding care to developing nations==\nWith an increase in the use of AI, more care may become available to those in developing nations. AI continues to expand in its abilities and as it is able to interpret radiology, it may be able to diagnose more people with the need for fewer doctors as there is a shortage in many of these nations.<ref name=\"Bresnick, Jennifer p 12\"/>\nThe goal of AI is to teach others in the world, which will then lead to improved treatment and eventually greater global health. Using AI in developing nations who do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can use AI to improve patient care.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen AF, Zoga AC, Vaccaro AR | title = Point/Counterpoint: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare. | journal = Healthcare Transformation | date = 1 November 2017 | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 84\u201392 | doi =  10.1089/heat.2017.29042.pcp| doi-access = free }}</ref> For example, Natural language processing, and machine learning are being used for guiding cancer treatments in places such as Thailand, China, and India.

It is also held by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]], husband of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The title is granted by the reigning monarch, who is the [[fount of honor|fount of all honors]], through the issuing of [[letters patent]] as an expression of the royal will.\n\nIndividuals holding the title of [[prince]] will usually also be granted the style of [[Royal Highness]]. \n\nWhen a British Prince marries, his wife also becomes a British Princess, however she is addressed by the feminine version of the husband's most senior title on his behalf. Traditionally, all wives of male members of the British Royal Family, the aristocracy, and members of the public take the style and title of their husbands. An example of this case is [[Princess Michael of Kent]], the wife of the Queen's cousin, [[Prince Michael of Kent]].\n\nThere is also the case when a [[British Princess|princess of blood royal]] marries a British Prince: she also becomes a princess by marriage and will be addressed in the same way; an example of this situation was the late [[Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife]]: when she married his cousin [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]] she became Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife.\n\nIn the event that a British Prince has a [[peerage|peer]] title, the Princess is addressed by the feminine version of her husband's peer title; an example of this case is the wife of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], who is officially styled His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge: his wife [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Catherine]] becomes HRH The Duchess of Cambridge. Omitting for both the prince and princess titles and their christian names.\n\n==History==\nPrior to 1714, the title of prince and the style of HRH was not customary in usage. Sons and daughters of the sovereign were not automatically or traditionally called a prince or princess. An exception was the [[Prince of Wales]], a title conferred on the eldest son of the sovereign since the reign of [[Edward I of England]]. In the Kingdom of Scotland, even though an honorific principality was created by James I, the heir-apparent was only referred to as [[Duke of Rothesay]]. Some others include John, brother of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and later [[John, King of England|King John]], who is sometimes called Prince John.\n\nAfter the accession of George I (the first monarch from the [[House of Hanover]]), it became customary for the sons of the sovereign and grandsons of the sovereign in the male line to be titled 'Prince' and styled ''His [[Royal Highness]]'' (abbreviated ''HRH''). Great-grandsons of the sovereign were princes styled ''His [[Highness]]'' (abbreviated ''HH'').\n\n* The first male-line great-grandchild of a British monarch was not born until 1776. In keeping with tradition, he was given the style of [[His Highness]] Prince William of Gloucester (later [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh]]). On 22 July 1816 when he married his cousin and daughter of King George III, he was granted the style [[His Royal Highness]]. His only surviving elder sister, [[Princess Sophia of Gloucester]], was also elevated to [[Her Royal Highness]] style the following day. Prince William died in 1834 before the accession of Queen Victoria.\n* The first of the second set of male-line great-grandchildren of a British monarch was born on 21 September 1845 as [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|Prince Ernest Augustus]].  He was granted the style of ''His Royal Highness'' because he was a male-line grandson of the King of Hanover and heir to the heir of that kingdom.\n\nJust three weeks after the birth of her fourth grandchild but first male-line grandson, [[Queen Victoria]] issued letters patent in 1864<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1864 Royal Styles and Titles \u2013 1864 Letters Patent}}</ref> which formally confirmed the practice of calling children and male-line grandchildren ''His Royal Highness'' with their titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names. The letters patent did not address the styling of great-grandchildren or further descendants as ''His/Her Highness'' or Prince or Princess.\n\nSubsequent to 1864 some amendments regarding princes were made, with the issuance of specific letters patent changing the title and style of the following groups:\n\n*In 1898, the children of [[George V|Prince George, Duke of York]], the eldest living son of [[Edward VII|the Prince of Wales]], were customarily titled princes, with the style of ''Highness'', as great-grandchildren of [[Queen Victoria]] in the male line. With letters patent dated 28 May 1898, the Crown granted the children of the eldest son of any [[Prince of Wales]] the style of ''Royal Highness''.<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1898 Letters Patent}}</ref>\n*In 1914, the children of [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick]], a great-great-grandchild of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], were granted the title of prince and the style ''Highness'' by George V, in letters patent dated 17 June 1914.<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1914 Letters Patent}}</ref>\n*In 1917, [[George V]] issued a royal proclamation, altering the name of the Royal House from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] to the [[House of Windsor]] and the discontinuance of the usage of the German titles of Duke of Saxony, [[Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and the like.<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1917 Royal Proclamation}}</ref>\n*Later that year, letters patent altered the rights to the title prince and the style ''Royal Highness''. These letters patent, dated 30 November 1917, stated that \"the children of any [[King of the United Kingdom|Sovereign of these Realms]] and the children of the sons of any such Sovereign ''(as per the above Letters Patent of 1864)'' and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales ''(a modification of the Letters Patent of 1898)'' shall have and at all times hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness with their titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names or with their other titles of honour\". It was also decreed in these letters that \"grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line ... shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of [[Duke]]s of these Our Realms\" (i.e., ''Lord'' or ''Lady'' before their Christian name).<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30428 |page=13086 |date=14 December 1917 }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=Second 1917 Letters Patent}}</ref> In addition the letters stated ''save as aforesaid the style title or attribute of Royal Highness, Highness or Serene Highness and the titular dignity of Prince or Princess shall not henceforth be assumed or borne by any descendant of any Sovereign of these Realms''.\nBoth the proclamation and the letters patent of 1917 remain in force today, excepting a few amendments and creations noted.\n*However, the former reigning [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Duke of Brunswick]], head of the [[House of Hanover]], refused to recognise the letters depriving his children of the British and Irish princely titles, and in 1931, he issued a decree, in the capacity of the head of the House of Hanover and senior male-line descendant of [[George III of the United Kingdom]], stating that the members of the former Hanoverian royal family would continue to bear the title of Prince (or Princess) of Great Britain and Ireland with the style of Royal Highness. This title and style remains in use to this day by his descendants, including the current head of the House of Hanover, [[Ernst August, Prince of Hanover (born 1954)|Ernst August, Prince of Hanover]]. The decree by the head of the House of Hanover is not legally recognised in the United Kingdom or Ireland, and the titles are used as titles of pretense. Since, however, the Hanovers are born in the [[patrilineality|male-line]] of [[George II of Great Britain]] they were bound by the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] until repealed in 2015. Thus, before his marriage to [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline of Monaco]], Ernst August requested, and Elizabeth II issued on 11 January 1999, an [[Order in Council]]: \"My Lords, I do hereby declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between His Royal Highness Prince Ernst August Albert of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg and Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline Louise Marguerite of Monaco...\" Without the [[Royal Assent]], the marriage would have been void in the United Kingdom.\n*After the [[Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII|abdication crisis of 1936]], [[George VI]] issued letters patent (dated 27 May 1937) regranting his [[Edward VIII|elder brother]] his style as son of a Sovereign, whilst expressly denying the style of ''Royal Highness'' to his wife and descendants.<ref name=\"ed8\">{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1937 Letters Patent}}</ref> The marriage, however, had no issue.\n*On 22 October 1948, George VI issued letters patent allowing the children of his daughter [[Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh]], and son-in-law [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], to assume princely titles and the style ''Royal Highness'';<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1948 Letters Patent}}</ref> they would not have been entitled to them ordinarily, as grandchildren in the female line, until their mother ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II.  Thus the current [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] was styled ''HRH Prince Charles of Edinburgh'' until his mother's accession.  Otherwise the children would have been styled Earl of Merioneth and Lady Anne Mountbatten, respectively.\n*Queen Elizabeth II issued letters patent, dated 22 February 1957, creating Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a ''Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''.<ref name=\"princeforphil\">{{London Gazette|issue=41009|date=22 February 1957|page=1209}}</ref> Prince Philip had been born a [[Prince of Greece and Denmark]], titles he renounced upon going through the naturalisation process, unaware that he was already a British subject by virtue of the [[Sophia Naturalization Act 1705]].\n*On the wedding day of [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|The Prince Edward]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Sophie Rhys-Jones]], it was announced by [[Buckingham Palace]] that The Queen, in agreement with their wishes, had declared that their children would be styled as children of an earl, and not as Princes of the United Kingdom with the style ''[[Royal Highness]]''.\n* On 31 December 2012, Queen Elizabeth II declared that all the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, at that time [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], would have the title Prince or Princess and the style ''[[Royal Highness]]''.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60384 |page=213 |date=8 January 2013}}</ref> Accordingly, the Duke's eldest son, born on 22 July 2013, is styled ''His Royal Highness [[Prince George of Cambridge]]''.

It is also held by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]], husband of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The title is granted by the reigning monarch, who is the [[fount of honor|fount of all honors]], through the issuing of [[letters patent]] as an expression of the royal will.\n\nIndividuals holding the title of [[prince]] will usually also be granted the style of [[Royal Highness]]. \n\nWhen a British Prince marries, his wife also becomes a British Princess, however she is address by the feminine version of the husband's most senior title on his behalf. Traditionally, all wives of male members of the British Royal Family, the aristocracy, and members of the public take the style and title of their husbands. An example of this case is [[Princess Michael of Kent]], the wife of the Queen's cousin, [[Prince Michael of Kent]].\n\nThere is also the case when a [[British Princess|princess of blood royal]] marries a British Prince, she also becomes a princess by marriage and will be address in the same way, an example of this situation was the late [[Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife]], when she married his cousin [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]] became Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife.\n\nIn the event that a British Prince has a [[peerage|peer]] title, the Princess is address by the feminine version of her husband's peer title, an example of this case is the wife of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], who is officially styled His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge, his wife [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Catherine]] becomes HRH The Duchess of Cambridge. Omitting for both the prince and princess titles and their christian names.\n\n==History==\nPrior to 1714, the title of prince and the style of HRH was not customary in usage. Sons and daughters of the sovereign were not automatically or traditionally called a prince or princess. An exception was the [[Prince of Wales]], a title conferred on the eldest son of the sovereign since the reign of [[Edward I of England]]. In the Kingdom of Scotland, even though an honorific principality was created by James I, the heir-apparent was only referred to as [[Duke of Rothesay]]. Some others include John, brother of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and later [[John, King of England|King John]], who is sometimes called Prince John.\n\nAfter the accession of George I (the first monarch from the [[House of Hanover]]), it became customary for the sons of the sovereign and grandsons of the sovereign in the male line to be titled 'Prince' and styled ''His [[Royal Highness]]'' (abbreviated ''HRH''). Great-grandsons of the sovereign were princes styled ''His [[Highness]]'' (abbreviated ''HH'').\n\n* The first male-line great-grandchild of a British monarch was not born until 1776. In keeping with tradition, he was given the style of [[His Highness]] Prince William of Gloucester (later [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh]]). On 22 July 1816 when he married his cousin and daughter of King George III, he was granted the style [[His Royal Highness]]. His only surviving elder sister, [[Princess Sophia of Gloucester]], was also elevated to [[Her Royal Highness]] style the following day. Prince William died in 1834 before the accession of Queen Victoria.\n* The first of the second set of male-line great-grandchildren of a British monarch was born on 21 September 1845 as [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|Prince Ernest Augustus]].  He was granted the style of ''His Royal Highness'' because he was a male-line grandson of the King of Hanover and heir to the heir of that kingdom.\n\nJust three weeks after the birth of her fourth grandchild but first male-line grandson, [[Queen Victoria]] issued letters patent in 1864<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1864 Royal Styles and Titles \u2013 1864 Letters Patent}}</ref> which formally confirmed the practice of calling children and male-line grandchildren ''His Royal Highness'' with their titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names. The letters patent did not address the styling of great-grandchildren or further descendants as ''His/Her Highness'' or Prince or Princess.\n\nSubsequent to 1864 some amendments regarding princes were made, with the issuance of specific letters patent changing the title and style of the following groups:\n\n*In 1898, the children of [[George V|Prince George, Duke of York]], the eldest living son of [[Edward VII|the Prince of Wales]], were customarily titled princes, with the style of ''Highness'', as great-grandchildren of [[Queen Victoria]] in the male line. With letters patent dated 28 May 1898, the Crown granted the children of the eldest son of any [[Prince of Wales]] the style of ''Royal Highness''.<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1898 Letters Patent}}</ref>\n*In 1914, the children of [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick]], a great-great-grandchild of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], were granted the title of prince and the style ''Highness'' by George V, in letters patent dated 17 June 1914.<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1914 Letters Patent}}</ref>\n*In 1917, [[George V]] issued a royal proclamation, altering the name of the Royal House from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] to the [[House of Windsor]] and the discontinuance of the usage of the German titles of Duke of Saxony, [[Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and the like.<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1917 Royal Proclamation}}</ref>\n*Later that year, letters patent altered the rights to the title prince and the style ''Royal Highness''. These letters patent, dated 30 November 1917, stated that \"the children of any [[King of the United Kingdom|Sovereign of these Realms]] and the children of the sons of any such Sovereign ''(as per the above Letters Patent of 1864)'' and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales ''(a modification of the Letters Patent of 1898)'' shall have and at all times hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness with their titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names or with their other titles of honour\". It was also decreed in these letters that \"grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line ... shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of [[Duke]]s of these Our Realms\" (i.e., ''Lord'' or ''Lady'' before their Christian name).<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30428 |page=13086 |date=14 December 1917 }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=Second 1917 Letters Patent}}</ref> In addition the letters stated ''save as aforesaid the style title or attribute of Royal Highness, Highness or Serene Highness and the titular dignity of Prince or Princess shall not henceforth be assumed or borne by any descendant of any Sovereign of these Realms''.\nBoth the proclamation and the letters patent of 1917 remain in force today, excepting a few amendments and creations noted.\n*However, the former reigning [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Duke of Brunswick]], head of the [[House of Hanover]], refused to recognise the letters depriving his children of the British and Irish princely titles, and in 1931, he issued a decree, in the capacity of the head of the House of Hanover and senior male-line descendant of [[George III of the United Kingdom]], stating that the members of the former Hanoverian royal family would continue to bear the title of Prince (or Princess) of Great Britain and Ireland with the style of Royal Highness. This title and style remains in use to this day by his descendants, including the current head of the House of Hanover, [[Ernst August, Prince of Hanover (born 1954)|Ernst August, Prince of Hanover]]. The decree by the head of the House of Hanover is not legally recognised in the United Kingdom or Ireland, and the titles are used as titles of pretense. Since, however, the Hanovers are born in the [[patrilineality|male-line]] of [[George II of Great Britain]] they were bound by the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] until repealed in 2015. Thus, before his marriage to [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline of Monaco]], Ernst August requested, and Elizabeth II issued on 11 January 1999, an [[Order in Council]]: \"My Lords, I do hereby declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between His Royal Highness Prince Ernst August Albert of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg and Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline Louise Marguerite of Monaco...\" Without the [[Royal Assent]], the marriage would have been void in the United Kingdom.\n*After the [[Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII|abdication crisis of 1936]], [[George VI]] issued letters patent (dated 27 May 1937) regranting his [[Edward VIII|elder brother]] his style as son of a Sovereign, whilst expressly denying the style of ''Royal Highness'' to his wife and descendants.<ref name=\"ed8\">{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1937 Letters Patent}}</ref> The marriage, however, had no issue.\n*On 22 October 1948, George VI issued letters patent allowing the children of his daughter [[Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh]], and son-in-law [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], to assume princely titles and the style ''Royal Highness'';<ref>{{harvnb|Velde|loc=1948 Letters Patent}}</ref> they would not have been entitled to them ordinarily, as grandchildren in the female line, until their mother ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II.  Thus the current [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] was styled ''HRH Prince Charles of Edinburgh'' until his mother's accession.  Otherwise the children would have been styled Earl of Merioneth and Lady Anne Mountbatten, respectively.\n*Queen Elizabeth II issued letters patent, dated 22 February 1957, creating Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a ''Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''.<ref name=\"princeforphil\">{{London Gazette|issue=41009|date=22 February 1957|page=1209}}</ref> Prince Philip had been born a [[Prince of Greece and Denmark]], titles he renounced upon going through the naturalisation process, unaware that he was already a British subject by virtue of the [[Sophia Naturalization Act 1705]].\n*On the wedding day of [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|The Prince Edward]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Sophie Rhys-Jones]], it was announced by [[Buckingham Palace]] that The Queen, in agreement with their wishes, had declared that their children would be styled as children of an earl, and not as Princes of the United Kingdom with the style ''[[Royal Highness]]''.\n* On 31 December 2012, Queen Elizabeth II declared that all the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, at that time [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], would have the title Prince or Princess and the style ''[[Royal Highness]]''.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60384 |page=213 |date=8 January 2013}}</ref> Accordingly, the Duke's eldest son, born on 22 July 2013, is styled ''His Royal Highness [[Prince George of Cambridge]]''. His daughter, born on 2 May 2015, is styled ''Her Royal Highness [[Princess Charlotte of Cambridge]]''. His second son, born on 23 April 2018, is styled ''His Royal Highness [[Prince Louis of Cambridge]]''.\n\n==Styles of British princes==\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Coronet of the British Heir Apparent.svg|Coronet of the heir apparent\nFile:Coronet of a Child of the Sovereign.svg|Coronet of a son of the sovereign\nFile:Coronet of a Child of the Heir Apparent.svg|Coronet of a son of the heir apparent\nFile:Coronet of a Grandchild of the Sovereign.svg|Coronet of a grandson of the sovereign\n</gallery>\n</center>\n* Sovereign's heir apparent if Prince of Wales \u2013 HRH The Prince of Wales.\n* Sovereign's sons (not Prince of Wales) with peerage \u2013 HRH The Prince ''X'', Duke of ''Y'' (with ''Y'' being the [[territorial designation]] of their highest peerage), e.g., HRH The Prince Andrew, Duke of York.\n* Sovereign's sons without peerage \u2013 HRH The Prince ''X'', e.g., HRH The Prince John.\n* Sovereign's male line grandsons with peerage \u2013 HRH Prince \"X\", Duke of \"Y\" (with ''Y'' being the territorial designation of their highest title), e.g., HRH Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.\n* Sovereign's male line grandsons without peerage \u2013 HRH Prince \"X\" of \"Y\" (with ''Y'' being the territorial designation of their father's highest title), e.g., HRH Prince Michael of Kent.\n* Sovereign's great-grandsons whose father is the oldest son of the heir apparent \u2013 HRH Prince \"X\" of \"Y\" (with ''Y'' being the territorial designation of their father's highest title), e.g., HRH Prince George of Cambridge.\n\n==List of British princes since 1714==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n|style=\"background:#d0def8\"|Prince of Great Britain from birth\n|-\n|style=\"background:#ead0f8\"|Prince of the United Kingdom from birth\n|-\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|Created Prince of Great Britain by the sovereign\n|-\n|style=\"background:#f8ead0\"|Created Prince of the United Kingdom by the sovereign\n|-\n|({{dagger|alt=title restricted by George V}}) \u2013 In [[Letters Patent]] dated 20 November 1917, King George V restricted the title of Prince to the children of the sovereign, the children of the sovereign's sons, and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales.\n|-\n|({{double-dagger|alt=title suspended by George V}}) \u2013 By an [[Order in Council]] dated 28 March 1919, as authorized by the [[Titles Deprivation Act 1917]], King George V suspended the British peerage titles, princely dignities and honours of those who sided with [[Germany]] in [[World War I]].\n|-\n|The descendants of [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick]], head of the House of Hanover and the senior male-line descendant of King George III, who bear the title Prince or Princess of the United Kingdom with the style of Royal Highness as a secondary [[pretender|title of pretense]].\n|-\n|The children of the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Earl]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Countess of Wessex]] are styled as the children of an Earl, rather than as Princes or Princesses.

See also Figure 2-22 in {{Harvnb|Richter|1958}} (copy in {{Harvnb|Bormann|Wendt|Di Giacomo|2013|p=60}}), which replicates Wadati's curves.</ref> [[Charles F. Richter]] then worked out how to adjust for epicentral distance (and some other factors) so that the [[logarithm]] of the amplitude of the seismograph trace could be used as a measure of \"magnitude\" that was internally consistent and corresponded roughly with estimates of an earthquake's energy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gutenberg|Richter|1956a}}.</ref> He established a reference point and the now familiar ten-fold (exponential) scaling of each degree of magnitude, and in 1935 published what he called the \"magnitude scale\", now called the [[local magnitude scale]], labeled {{M|l}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935}}.</ref> (This scale is also known as the ''Richter scale'', but news media sometimes use that term indiscriminately to refer to other similar scales.)\n\nThe local magnitude scale was developed on the basis of shallow (~{{cvt|15|km|sigfig=1}} deep), moderate-sized earthquakes at a distance of approximately {{cvt|100|to|600|km}}, conditions where the surface waves are predominant. At greater depths, distances, or magnitudes the surface waves are greatly reduced, and the local magnitude scale underestimates the magnitude, a problem called ''saturation''. Additional scales were developed<ref>See {{Harvnb|Bormann|Saul|2009}} for an overview.</ref> \u2013 a surface-wave magnitude scale ({{m|s|link=y}}) by [[Beno Gutenberg]] in 1945<ref>{{Harvnb|Gutenberg|1945a}}.</ref>, a body-wave magnitude scale ({{m|B|link=y}}) by Gutenberg and Richter in 1956,<ref>{{Harvnb|Gutenberg|1945b}}, {{Harvnb|Gutenberg|Richter|1956b}}.</ref> and a number of variants<ref>See [[Seismic magnitude scales]].</ref> \u2013 to overcome the deficiencies of the {{M|l}} scale, but all are subject to saturation. A particular problem was that the {{m|s}} scale (which in the 1970s was the preferred magnitude scale) saturates around {{m|s|8.0}} and therefore underestimates the energy release of \"great\" earthquakes<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|1977|p=2981}}.</ref> such as the [[1960 Chilean Earthquake|1960 Chilean]] and [[1964 Alaska earthquake|1964 Alaskan]] earthquakes. These had {{m|s}} magnitudes of 8.5 and 8.4 respectively but were notably more powerful than other M 8 earthquakes; their moment magnitudes were closer to 9.6 and 9.3.<ref>{{short-isc|EHB|879136}}; {{short-isc|EHB|869809}}.</ref>\n\n=== Single couple or double couple ===\nThe study of earthquakes is challenging as the source events cannot be observed directly, and it took many years to develop the mathematics for understanding what the seismic waves from an earthquake can tell us about the source event. An early step was to determine how different systems of forces might generate seismic waves equivalent to those observed from earthquakes.<ref> {{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|pp=112-113}}; {{Harvnb|Stauder|1962|p=39}}.</ref>\n\nThe simplest force system is a single force acting on an object. If it has sufficient strength to overcome any resistance it will cause the object to move (\"translate\"). A pair of forces, acting on the same \"line of action\" but in opposite directions, will cancel; if they cancel (balance) exactly there will be no net translation, though the object will experience stress, either tension or compression. If the pair of forces are offset, acting along parallel but separate lines of action, the object experiences a rotational force, or [[torque]]. In [[mechanics]] (the branch of physics concerned with the interactions of forces) this model is called a ''[[couple (mechanics)|couple]]'', also ''simple couple'' or ''single couple''. If a second couple of equal and opposite magnitude is applied their torques cancel; this is called a ''double couple''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|p=115}}.</ref> A double couple can be viewed as \"equivalent to a pressure and tension acting simultaneously at right angles\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1995|p=1210}}; {{Harvnb|Maruyama|1963|p=484}}.</ref>\n\nThe single couple and double couple models are important in seismology because each can be used to derive how the seismic waves generated by an earthquake event should appear in the \"far field\" (that is, at distance). Once that relation is understood it can be inverted to use the earthquake's observed seismic waves to determine its other characteristics, including fault geometry and seismic moment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shearer|2009|p=245}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1923 Hiroshi Nakano showed that certain aspects of seismic waves could be explained in terms of a double couple model.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1995|p=1210}}.</ref> This led to a three-decade long controversy over the best way to model the seismic source: as a single couple, or a double couple?<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|p=115}}.</ref> While Japanese seismologists favored the double couple, most seismologists favored the single couple.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|p=115}}. See {{Harvnb|Byerly|1960}} for a contemporary account of why many seismologists favored a single couple model.</ref> Although the single couple model had some short-comings, it seemed more intuitive, and there was a belief \u2013 mistaken, as it turned out \u2013 that the [[elastic rebound theory]] for explaining why earthquakes happen required a single couple model.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|pp=116, 117}}.</ref> In principle these models could be distinguished by differences in the radiation patterns of their [[S-waves]], but the quality of the observational data was inadequate for that.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pujol|2003b|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nThe debate ended when {{Harvtxt|Maruyama|1963}}, Haskell (1964), and {{Harvtxt|Burridge|Knopoff|1964}} showed that if earthquake ruptures are modeled as dislocations the pattern of seismic radiation can always be matched with an equivalent pattern derived from a double couple, but not from a single couple.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pujol|2003b|p=165}}; {{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|pp=117\u2013118}}.</ref> This was confirmed as better and more plentiful data coming from the [[World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network]] (WWSSN) permitted closer analysis of seismic waves.

First, he used data from distant stations of the [[WWSSN]] to analyze long-period (200 second) seismic waves (wavelength of about 1,000 kilometers) to determine the magnitude of the earthquake's equivalent double couple.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aki|1966a|pp=24, 36}}.</ref> Second, he drew upon the work of Burridge and Knopoff on dislocation to determine the amount of slip, the energy released, and the stress drop (essentially how much of the potential energy was released).<ref>{{Harvnb|Aki|1966a|p=24}}.</ref> In particular, he derived a now famous equation that relates an earthquake's seismic moment to its physical parameters:\n\n::<big>{{math|''M''{{ssub|0}} {{=}} ''&mu;u&#772;S''}}</big>\n\nwith {{mvar|&mu;}} being the rigidity (or resistance) of moving a fault with a surface areas of {{mvar|S}} over an average dislocation (distance) of {{mvar|u&#772;}}. (Modern formulations replace {{mvar|u&#772;S}} with the equivalent {{mvar|D&#772;A}}, known as the \"geometric moment\" or \"potency\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bormann|Wendt|Di Giacomo|2013|p=12}}, equation 3.1.</ref>.) By this equation the ''moment'' determined from the double couple of the seismic waves can be related to the moment calculated from knowledge of the surface area of fault slippage and the amount of slip.

Gutenberg and Richter suggested that radiated energy E<sub>s</sub> could be estimated as\n\n:<math>\\log E_s \\approx 4.8 + 1.5 M_S, </math>\n\n(in Joules). Unfortunately, the duration of many very large earthquakes was longer than 20 seconds, the period of the surface waves used in the measurement of {{M|s}}. This meant that giant earthquakes such as the 1960 Chilean earthquake (M 9.5) were only assigned an {{M|s|8.2}}. [[Caltech]] seismologist [[Hiroo Kanamori]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|1977}}.</ref> recognized this deficiency and took the simple but important step of defining a magnitude based on estimates of radiated energy, {{M|w}}, where the \"w\" stood for work (energy):\n \n:<math> M_w = 2/3 \\log E_s - 3.2 </math>\n\nKanamori recognized that measurement of radiated energy is technically difficult since it involves the integration of wave energy over the entire frequency band. To simplify this calculation, he noted that the lowest frequency parts of the spectrum can often be used to estimate the rest of the spectrum. The lowest frequency [[asymptote]] of a seismic spectrum is characterized by the [[seismic moment]], {{M|0}}. Using an approximate relation between radiated energy and seismic moment (which assumes stress drop is complete and ignores fracture energy),\n\n:<math>E_s \\approx M_0 / (2 \\times 10^4) </math>\n\n(where '''E''' is in Joules and {{M|0}} is in N<math> \\cdot </math>m), Kanamori approximated {{M|w}} by\n\n:<math> M_w = ( \\log M_0 - 9.1 ) /1.5 </math>\n\n=== Moment magnitude scale ===\n\nThe formula above made it much easier to estimate the energy-based magnitude {{m|w}}, but it changed the fundamental nature of the scale into a moment magnitude scale. [[Caltech]] seismologist [[Thomas C. Hanks]] noted that Kanamori's {{M|w}} scale was very similar to a relationship between {{M|L}} and {{M|0}} that was reported by {{Harvtxt|Thatcher|Hanks|1973}}\n\n:<math> M_L \\approx ( \\log M_0 - 9.0 ) /1.5 </math>\n\n{{Harvtxt|Hanks|Kanamori|1979}} combined their work to define a new magnitude scale based on estimates of seismic moment\n\n:<math> M = ( \\log M_0 - 9.05 ) /1.5 </math>\n\nwhere <math> M_0 </math> is defined in newton meters (N\u00b7m).\n\n== Current use ==\n<!-- This section is poorly written mish-mash of un-cited details. I am inclined to delete it. -JJ -->\nMoment magnitude is now the most common measure of earthquake size for medium to large earthquake magnitudes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Boyle|2008|p=}}.</ref>{{scientific citation needed|date=March 2019}} but in practice, seismic moment, the seismological parameter it is based on, is not measured routinely for smaller quakes. For example, the [[United States Geological Survey]] does not use this scale for earthquakes with a magnitude of less than 3.5,{{cn|date=March 2019}} which includes the great majority of quakes.\n\nCurrent practice in official{{who|date=March 2019}} earthquake reports is to adopt moment magnitude as the preferred magnitude, i.e., {{M|w}} is the official magnitude reported whenever it can be computed. Because seismic moment ({{M|0}}, the quantity needed to compute {{M|w}}) is not measured if the earthquake is too small, the reported magnitude for earthquakes smaller than {{M|.|4}} is often Richter's {{M|L}}.\n\nPopular press reports most often deal with significant earthquakes larger than {{M|.|~ 4}}. For these events, the official{{who|date=March 2019}} magnitude is the moment magnitude {{M|w}}, not Richter's local magnitude {{m|l}}.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe symbol for the moment magnitude scale is {{m|w}}, with the subscript \"w\" meaning [[mechanical work]] accomplished. The moment magnitude {{M|w}} is a [[dimensionless number|dimensionless value]] defined by [[Hiroo Kanamori]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|1977|p=}}.</ref> as\n\n:<math>M_\\mathrm{w} = {\\frac{2}{3}}\\log_{10}(M_0) - 10.7,</math>\n\nwhere {{M|0}} is the seismic moment in [[dyne]]\u22c5cm (10<sup>\u22127</sup>&nbsp;N\u22c5m).<ref>{{Harvnb|Hanks|Kanamori|1979|p=}}.</ref> The constant values in the equation are chosen to achieve consistency with the magnitude values produced by earlier scales, such as the local magnitude and the surface wave magnitude.  Thus, a magnitude zero [[microearthquake]] has a seismic moment of approximately {{val|1.2e9|u=N\u22c5m}}, while the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Great Chilean earthquake]] of 1960, with an estimated moment magnitude of 9.4\u20139.6, had a seismic moment between {{val|1.4e23|u=N\u22c5m}} and {{val|2.8e23|u=N\u22c5m}}. <!-- ** Question whether the second instance of Mw above should be seismic moment {{m|0}}. -->\n\n== Relations between seismic moment, potential energy released and radiated energy ==\nSeismic moment is not a direct measure of energy changes during an earthquake. The relations between seismic moment and the energies involved in an earthquake depend on parameters that have large uncertainties and that may vary between earthquakes. Potential energy is stored in the crust in the form of [[elastic energy]] due to built-up [[Stress (physics)|stress]] and [[gravitational energy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kostrov|1974|p=}}; {{Harvnb|Dahlen|1977|p=}}.</ref> During an earthquake, a portion <math>\\Delta W</math> of this stored energy is transformed into\n* energy dissipated <math>E_f</math> in frictional weakening and inelastic deformation in rocks by processes such as the creation of cracks\n* heat <math>E_h</math>\n* radiated seismic energy <math>E_s</math>\n\nThe potential energy drop caused by an earthquake is related approximately to its seismic moment by\n\n:<math>\\Delta W \\approx \\frac{\\overline\\sigma}{\\mu} M_0</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\overline\\sigma</math> is the average of the ''absolute'' shear stresses on the fault before and after the earthquake (e.g., equation 3 of {{Harvnb|Venkataraman|Kanamori|2004|p=}}) and <math>\\mu</math> is the average of the [[shear modulus|shear moduli]] of the rocks that constitute the fault. Currently, there is no technology to measure absolute stresses at all depths of interest, nor method to estimate it accurately, and <math>\\overline\\sigma</math> is thus poorly known. It could vary highly from one earthquake to another. Two earthquakes with identical <math>M_0</math> but different <math>\\overline\\sigma</math> would have released different <math>\\Delta W</math>.\n\nThe radiated energy caused by an earthquake is approximately related to seismic moment by\n\n:<math> E_\\mathrm{s} \\approx \\eta_R \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma_s}{2\\mu} M_0 </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\eta_R = E_s /(E_s+E_f)</math> is radiated efficiency and <math>\\Delta\\sigma_s</math> is the static stress drop, i.e., the difference between shear stresses on the fault before and after the earthquake (e.g., from equation 1 of {{Harvnb|Venkataraman|Kanamori|2004|p=}}). These two quantities are far from being constants. For instance, <math>\\eta_R</math> depends on rupture speed; it is close to 1 for regular earthquakes but much smaller for slower earthquakes such as [[tsunami earthquake]]s and [[slow earthquake]]s. Two earthquakes with identical <math>M_0</math> but different <math>\\eta_R</math> or <math>\\Delta\\sigma_s</math> would have radiated different <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math>.\n\nBecause <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math> and <math>M_0</math> are fundamentally independent properties of an earthquake source, and since <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math> can now be computed more directly and robustly than in the 1970s, introducing a separate magnitude associated to radiated energy was warranted. Choy and Boatwright defined in 1995 the ''energy magnitude''<ref>{{Harvnb|Choy|Boatwright|1995|p=}}</ref>\n\n: <math>M_\\mathrm{E} =  \\textstyle{\\frac{2}{3}}\\log_{10}E_\\mathrm{s} -3.2</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math> is in J (N\u00b7m).\n\n== Comparative energy released by two earthquakes ==\n\nAssuming the values of {{mvar|&sigma;&#772;/&mu;}} are the same for all earthquakes, one can consider {{M|w}} as a measure of the potential energy change &Delta;''W'' caused by earthquakes. Similarly, if one assumes <math>\\eta_R \\Delta\\sigma_s/2\\mu</math> is the same for all earthquakes, one can consider {{M|w}} as a measure of the energy ''E''<sub>s</sub> radiated by earthquakes.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the following formula, obtained by [[equation solving|solving]] for {{M|0}} the equation defining {{m|w}}, allows one to assess the ratio <math>E_1/E_2</math> of energy release (potential or radiated) between two earthquakes of different moment magnitudes, <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math>:\n:<math> E_1/E_2 \\approx 10^{\\frac{3}{2}(m_1 - m_2)}.</math>\n\nAs with the Richter scale, an increase of one step on the [[logarithmic scale]] of moment magnitude corresponds to a 10<sup>1.5</sup> \u2248 32 times increase in the amount of energy released, and an increase of two steps corresponds to a 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000 times increase in energy. Thus, an earthquake of {{M|w}} of 7.0 contains 1000 times as much energy as one of 5.0 and about 32 times that of 6.0.\n\n== {{anchor|Subtypes}} Subtypes of M<sub>w</sub> ==\nVarious ways of determining moment magnitude have been developed, and several subtypes of the {{m|w}} scale can be used to indicate the basis used.<ref>USGS [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/terms.php Technical Terms used on Event Pages].</ref>\n\n* {{vanchor|'''Mwb'''}} \u2013 Based on ''moment tensor inversion'' of long-period (~10 \u2013 100 s) body-waves.\n* {{vanchor|'''Mwr'''}} \u2013 From a ''moment tensor inversion'' of complete waveforms at regional distances (~ 1,000 miles).

Richter]] then worked out how to adjust for epicentral distance (and some other factors) so that the [[logarithm]] of the amplitude of the seismograph trace could be used as a measure of \"magnitude\" that was internally consistent and corresponded roughly with estimates of an earthquake's energy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gutenberg|Richter|1956a}}.</ref> He established a reference point and the now familiar ten-fold (exponential) scaling of each degree of magnitude, and in 1935 published what he called the \"magnitude scale\", now called the [[local magnitude scale]], labeled {{M|l}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935}}.</ref> (This scale is also known as the ''Richter scale'', but news media sometimes use that term indiscriminately to refer to other similar scales.)\n\nThe local magnitude scale was developed on the basis of shallow (~{{cvt|15|km|sigfig=1}} deep), moderate-sized earthquakes at a distance of approximately {{cvt|100|to|600|km}}, conditions where the surface waves are predominant. At greater depths, distances, or magnitudes the surface waves are greatly reduced, and the local magnitude scale underestimates the magnitude, a problem called ''saturation''. Additional scales were developed<ref>See {{Harvnb|Bormann|Saul|2009}} for an overview.</ref> \u2013 a surface-wave magnitude scale ({{m|s|link=y}}) by [[Beno Gutenberg]] in 1945<ref>{{Harvnb|Gutenberg|1945a}}.</ref>, a body-wave magnitude scale ({{m|B|link=y}}) by Gutenberg and Richter in 1956,<ref>{{Harvnb|Gutenberg|1945b}}, {{Harvnb|Gutenberg|Richter|1956b}}.</ref> and a number of variants<ref>See [[Seismic magnitude scales]].</ref> \u2013 to overcome the deficiencies of the {{M|l}} scale, but all are subject to saturation. A particular problem was that the {{m|s}} scale (which in the 1970s was the preferred magnitude scale) saturates around {{m|s|8.0}} and therefore underestimates the energy release of \"great\" earthquakes<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|1977|p=2981}}.</ref> such as the [[1960 Chilean Earthquake|1960 Chilean]] and [[1964 Alaska earthquake|1964 Alaskan]] earthquakes. These had {{m|s}} magnitudes of 8.5 and 8.4 respectively but were notably more powerful than other M 8 earthquakes; their moment magnitudes were closer to 9.6 and 9.3.<ref>{{short-isc|EHB|879136}}; {{short-isc|EHB|869809}}.</ref>\n\n=== Single couple or double couple ===\nThe study of earthquakes is challenging as the source events cannot be observed directly, and it took many years to develop the mathematics for understanding what the seismic waves from an earthquake can tell us about the source event. An early step was to determine how different systems of forces might generate seismic waves equivalent to those observed from earthquakes.<ref> {{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|pp=112-113}}; {{Harvnb|Stauder|1962|p=39}}.</ref>\n\nThe simplest force system is a single force acting on an object. If it has sufficient strength to overcome any resistance it will cause the object to move (\"translate\"). A pair of forces, acting on the same \"line of action\" but in opposite directions, will cancel; if they cancel (balance) exactly there will be no net translation, though the object will experience stress, either tension or compression. If the pair of forces are offset, acting along parallel but separate lines of action, the object experiences a rotational force, or [[torque]]. In [[mechanics]] (the branch of physics concerned with the interactions of forces) this model is called a ''[[couple (mechanics)|couple]]'', also ''simple couple'' or ''single couple''. If a second couple of equal and opposite magnitude is applied their torques cancel; this is called a ''double couple''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|p=115}}.</ref> A double couple can be viewed as \"equivalent to a pressure and tension acting simultaneously at right angles\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1995|p=1210}}; {{Harvnb|Maruyama|1963|p=484}}.</ref>\n\nThe single couple and double couple models are important in seismology because each can be used to derive how the seismic waves generated by an earthquake event should appear in the \"far field\" (that is, at distance). Once that relation is understood it can be inverted to use the earthquake's observed seismic waves to determine its other characteristics, including fault geometry and seismic moment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shearer|2009|p=245}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1923 Hiroshi Nakano showed that certain aspects of seismic waves could be explained in terms of a double couple model.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1995|p=1210}}.</ref> This led to a three-decade long controversy over the best way to model the seismic source: as a single couple, or a double couple?<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|p=115}}.</ref> While Japanese seismologists favored the double couple, most seismologists favored the single couple.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|p=115}}. See {{Harvnb|Byerly|1960}} for a contemporary account of why many seismologists favored a single couple model.</ref> Although the single couple model had some short-comings, it seemed more intuitive, and there was a belief \u2013 mistaken, as it turned out \u2013 that the [[elastic rebound theory]] for explaining why earthquakes happen required a single couple model.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|pp=116, 117}}.</ref> In principle these models could be distinguished by differences in the radiation patterns of their [[S-waves]], but the quality of the observational data was inadequate for that.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pujol|2003b|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nThe debate ended when {{Harvtxt|Maruyama|1963}}, Haskell (1964), and {{Harvtxt|Burridge|Knopoff|1964}} showed that if earthquake ruptures are modeled as dislocations the pattern of seismic radiation can always be matched with an equivalent pattern derived from a double couple, but not from a single couple.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pujol|2003b|p=165}}; {{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|pp=117\u2013118}}.</ref> This was confirmed as better and more plentiful data coming from the [[World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network]] (WWSSN) permitted closer analysis of seismic waves.

First, he used data from distant stations of the [[WWSSN]] to analyze long-period (200 second) seismic waves (wavelength of about 1,000 kilometers) to determine the magnitude of the earthquake's equivalent double couple.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aki|1966a|pp=24, 36}}.</ref> Second, he drew upon the work of Burridge and Knopoff on dislocation to determine the amount of slip, the energy released, and the stress drop (essentially how much of the potential energy was released).<ref>{{Harvnb|Aki|1966a|p=24}}.</ref> In particular, he derived a now famous equation that relates an earthquake's seismic moment to its physical parameters:\n\n::<big>{{math|''M''{{ssub|0}} {{=}} ''&mu;u&#772;S''}}</big>\n\nwith {{mvar|&mu;}} being the rigidity (or resistance) of moving a fault with a surface areas of {{mvar|S}} over an average dislocation (distance) of {{mvar|u&#772;}}. (Modern formulations replace {{mvar|u&#772;S}} with the equivalent {{mvar|D&#772;A}}, known as the \"geometric moment\" or \"potency\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bormann|Wendt|Di Giacomo|2013|p=12}}, equation 3.1.</ref>.) By this equation the ''moment'' determined from the double couple of the seismic waves can be related to the moment calculated from knowledge of the surface area of fault slippage and the amount of slip.

Gutenberg and Richter suggested that radiated energy E<sub>s</sub> could be estimated as\n\n:<math>\\log E_s \\approx 4.8 + 1.5 M_S, </math>\n\n(in Joules). Unfortunately, the duration of many very large earthquakes was longer than 20 seconds, the period of the surface waves used in the measurement of {{M|s}}. This meant that giant earthquakes such as the 1960 Chilean earthquake (M 9.5) were only assigned an {{M|s|8.2}}. [[Caltech]] seismologist [[Hiroo Kanamori]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|1977}}.</ref> recognized this deficiency and took the simple but important step of defining a magnitude based on estimates of radiated energy, {{M|w}}, where the \"w\" stood for work (energy):\n \n:<math> M_w = 2/3 \\log E_s - 3.2 </math>\n\nKanamori recognized that measurement of radiated energy is technically difficult since it involves the integration of wave energy over the entire frequency band. To simplify this calculation, he noted that the lowest frequency parts of the spectrum can often be used to estimate the rest of the spectrum. The lowest frequency [[asymptote]] of a seismic spectrum is characterized by the [[seismic moment]], {{M|0}}. Using an approximate relation between radiated energy and seismic moment (which assumes stress drop is complete and ignores fracture energy),\n\n:<math>E_s \\approx M_0 / (2 \\times 10^4) </math>\n\n(where '''E''' is in Joules and {{M|0}} is in N<math> \\cdot </math>m), Kanamori approximated {{M|w}} by\n\n:<math> M_w = ( \\log M_0 - 9.1 ) /1.5 </math>\n\n=== Moment magnitude scale ===\n\nThe formula above made it much easier to estimate the energy-based magnitude {{m|w}}, but it changed the fundamental nature of the scale into a moment magnitude scale. [[Caltech]] seismologist [[Thomas C. Hanks]] noted that Kanamori's {{M|w}} scale was very similar to a relationship between {{M|L}} and {{M|0}} that was reported by {{Harvtxt|Thatcher|Hanks|1973}}\n\n:<math> M_L \\approx ( \\log M_0 - 9.0 ) /1.5 </math>\n\n{{Harvtxt|Hanks|Kanamori|1979}} combined their work to define a new magnitude scale based on estimates of seismic moment\n\n:<math> M = ( \\log M_0 - 9.05 ) /1.5 </math>\n\nwhere <math> M_0 </math> is defined in newton meters (N\u00b7m).\n\n== Current use ==\n<!-- This section is poorly written mish-mash of un-cited details. I am inclined to delete it. -JJ -->\nMoment magnitude is now the most common measure of earthquake size for medium to large earthquake magnitudes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Boyle|2008|p=}}.</ref>{{scientific citation needed|date=March 2019}} but in practice, seismic moment, the seismological parameter it is based on, is not measured routinely for smaller quakes. For example, the [[United States Geological Survey]] does not use this scale for earthquakes with a magnitude of less than 3.5,{{cn|date=March 2019}} which includes the great majority of quakes.\n\nCurrent practice in official{{who|date=March 2019}} earthquake reports is to adopt moment magnitude as the preferred magnitude, i.e., {{M|w}} is the official magnitude reported whenever it can be computed. Because seismic moment ({{M|0}}, the quantity needed to compute {{M|w}}) is not measured if the earthquake is too small, the reported magnitude for earthquakes smaller than {{M|.|4}} is often Richter's {{M|L}}.\n\nPopular press reports most often deal with significant earthquakes larger than {{M|.|~ 4}}. For these events, the official{{who|date=March 2019}} magnitude is the moment magnitude {{M|w}}, not Richter's local magnitude {{m|l}}.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe symbol for the moment magnitude scale is {{m|w}}, with the subscript \"w\" meaning [[mechanical work]] accomplished. The moment magnitude {{M|w}} is a [[dimensionless number|dimensionless value]] defined by [[Hiroo Kanamori]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|1977|p=}}.</ref> as\n\n:<math>M_\\mathrm{w} = {\\frac{2}{3}}\\log_{10}(M_0) - 10.7,</math>\n\nwhere {{M|0}} is the seismic moment in [[dyne]]\u22c5cm (10<sup>\u22127</sup>&nbsp;N\u22c5m).<ref>{{Harvnb|Hanks|Kanamori|1979|p=}}.</ref> The constant values in the equation are chosen to achieve consistency with the magnitude values produced by earlier scales, such as the local magnitude and the surface wave magnitude.  Thus, a magnitude zero [[microearthquake]] has a seismic moment of approximately {{val|1.2e9|u=N\u22c5m}}, while the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Great Chilean earthquake]] of 1960, with an estimated moment magnitude of 9.4\u20139.6, had a seismic moment between {{val|1.4e23|u=N\u22c5m}} and {{val|2.8e23|u=N\u22c5m}}. <!-- ** Question whether the second instance of Mw above should be seismic moment {{m|0}}. -->\n\n== Relations between seismic moment, potential energy released and radiated energy ==\nSeismic moment is not a direct measure of energy changes during an earthquake. The relations between seismic moment and the energies involved in an earthquake depend on parameters that have large uncertainties and that may vary between earthquakes. Potential energy is stored in the crust in the form of [[elastic energy]] due to built-up [[Stress (physics)|stress]] and [[gravitational energy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kostrov|1974|p=}}; {{Harvnb|Dahlen|1977|p=}}.</ref> During an earthquake, a portion <math>\\Delta W</math> of this stored energy is transformed into\n* energy dissipated <math>E_f</math> in frictional weakening and inelastic deformation in rocks by processes such as the creation of cracks\n* heat <math>E_h</math>\n* radiated seismic energy <math>E_s</math>\n\nThe potential energy drop caused by an earthquake is related approximately to its seismic moment by\n\n:<math>\\Delta W \\approx \\frac{\\overline\\sigma}{\\mu} M_0</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\overline\\sigma</math> is the average of the ''absolute'' shear stresses on the fault before and after the earthquake (e.g., equation 3 of {{Harvnb|Venkataraman|Kanamori|2004|p=}}) and <math>\\mu</math> is the average of the [[shear modulus|shear moduli]] of the rocks that constitute the fault. Currently, there is no technology to measure absolute stresses at all depths of interest, nor method to estimate it accurately, and <math>\\overline\\sigma</math> is thus poorly known. It could vary highly from one earthquake to another. Two earthquakes with identical <math>M_0</math> but different <math>\\overline\\sigma</math> would have released different <math>\\Delta W</math>.\n\nThe radiated energy caused by an earthquake is approximately related to seismic moment by\n\n:<math> E_\\mathrm{s} \\approx \\eta_R \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma_s}{2\\mu} M_0 </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\eta_R = E_s /(E_s+E_f)</math> is radiated efficiency and <math>\\Delta\\sigma_s</math> is the static stress drop, i.e., the difference between shear stresses on the fault before and after the earthquake (e.g., from equation 1 of {{Harvnb|Venkataraman|Kanamori|2004|p=}}). These two quantities are far from being constants. For instance, <math>\\eta_R</math> depends on rupture speed; it is close to 1 for regular earthquakes but much smaller for slower earthquakes such as [[tsunami earthquake]]s and [[slow earthquake]]s. Two earthquakes with identical <math>M_0</math> but different <math>\\eta_R</math> or <math>\\Delta\\sigma_s</math> would have radiated different <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math>.\n\nBecause <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math> and <math>M_0</math> are fundamentally independent properties of an earthquake source, and since <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math> can now be computed more directly and robustly than in the 1970s, introducing a separate magnitude associated to radiated energy was warranted. Choy and Boatwright defined in 1995 the ''energy magnitude''<ref>{{Harvnb|Choy|Boatwright|1995|p=}}</ref>\n\n: <math>M_\\mathrm{E} =  \\textstyle{\\frac{2}{3}}\\log_{10}E_\\mathrm{s} -3.2</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math> is in J (N\u00b7m).\n\n== Comparative energy released by two earthquakes ==\n\nAssuming the values of {{mvar|&sigma;&#772;/&mu;}} are the same for all earthquakes, one can consider {{M|w}} as a measure of the potential energy change &Delta;''W'' caused by earthquakes. Similarly, if one assumes <math>\\eta_R \\Delta\\sigma_s/2\\mu</math> is the same for all earthquakes, one can consider {{M|w}} as a measure of the energy ''E''<sub>s</sub> radiated by earthquakes.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the following formula, obtained by [[equation solving|solving]] for {{M|0}} the equation defining {{m|w}}, allows one to assess the ratio <math>E_1/E_2</math> of energy release (potential or radiated) between two earthquakes of different moment magnitudes, <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math>:\n:<math> E_1/E_2 \\approx 10^{\\frac{3}{2}(m_1 - m_2)}.</math>\n\nAs with the Richter scale, an increase of one step on the [[logarithmic scale]] of moment magnitude corresponds to a 10<sup>1.5</sup> \u2248 32 times increase in the amount of energy released, and an increase of two steps corresponds to a 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000 times increase in energy. Thus, an earthquake of {{M|w}} of 7.0 contains 1000 times as much energy as one of 5.0 and about 32 times that of 6.0.\n\n== {{anchor|Subtypes}} Subtypes of M<sub>w</sub> ==\nVarious ways of determining moment magnitude have been developed, and several subtypes of the {{m|w}} scale can be used to indicate the basis used.<ref>USGS [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/terms.php Technical Terms used on Event Pages].</ref>\n\n* {{vanchor|'''Mwb'''}} \u2013 Based on ''moment tensor inversion'' of long-period (~10 \u2013 100 s) body-waves.\n* {{vanchor|'''Mwr'''}} \u2013 From a ''moment tensor inversion'' of complete waveforms at regional distances (~ 1,000 miles).

{"title_page": "Indie Fund", "text_new": "The '''Indie Fund''' is an organization created by several [[independent game development|independent game  developers]] to help fund budding indie video game development.  The Indie Fund was created in early 2010, its purpose aimed \"to encourage the next generation of game developers\" by providing them funding for development of these games without the terms that would normally be associated with publication agreements.<ref name=\"announce\"/>\n\nThe founding and current members of the Indie Fund include: Ron Carmel and [[Kyle Gabler]] of [[2D Boy]], [[Jonathan Blow]] of Number None, [[Kellee Santiago]] formerly of [[thatgamecompany]], Nathan Vella of [[Capybara Games|Capy]], Matthew Wegner of Flashbang Studios and Aaron Isaksen of AppAbove Games.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27446/Independent_Game_Luminaries_Announce_Indie_Fund.php | title = Independent Game Luminaries Announce Indie Fund | first = Simon | last = Carless | date = 2010-03-12 | accessdate = 2012-01-09 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nMembers of the Indie Game organization have identified difficulties for indie developers to be able to fund their projects. Ron Carmel noted that there are typically two ways that this funding can occur: either through the developers providing their own money to initiate the project, or by signing deals with publishers for funding in exchange for part of the game's revenues being given back to the publisher.  Neither of these choices were considered optimal for an aspiring developer, according to Carmel.<ref name=\"announce\"/>\n\nIn 2008, several self-published indie games, including ''[[Audiosurf]]'', ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'', ''[[Castle Crashers]]'', and ''[[World of Goo]]'' were released to both strong critical reception and large sales.  All of these games were initially funded by their respective studios, and demonstrated that investment in independent games could be profitable.<ref name=\"announce\"/> With the following years also providing more commercially-successful games, the Indie Fund group decided to create the fund, using the profits from these games, as to aid the next iteration of indie games.<ref name=\"announce\"/><ref>{{cite conference | url = http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1012305/Indies-and-Publishers-Fixing-a | title = Indies and Publishers: Fixing a System That Never Worked | accessdate = 2012-01-09 | first = Ron | last = Carmel | conference = 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]] | date = March 9\u201313, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Funding model==\n[[File:The Swapper - Screenshot 03.png|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[The Swapper]]'' was financed in part by the Indie Fund.]]\nInvestments in indie games are pulled from the Fund's reserves. Currently, the group states they can select two to three games that they can support per year, but they believe as the Fund expands, they can invest in more projects.<ref name=\"announce\"/> Developers cannot directly apply for investment by the Fund; instead, the Fund watches the indie game market, observing games that get notice from the gaming press through both conferences and word-of-mouth, and selects candidate teams from these sources.<ref name=\"announce\"/> The Fund provides monthly payments to the selected projects to cover development costs; upon release, the developers are expected to pay back the development funding and a small portion of the game's revenue over the next three years based on the level of funding required.<ref name=\"announce\"/>  There is no penalty for failing to be able to pay back the full funding and revenue; should this occur within three years of release, the Fund requires no further payment, and all further revenue can be kept by the developers.<ref name=\"model\">{{cite web | url = http://indie-fund.com/about/ | title = About Indie Fund | accessdate = 2012-01-09 | publisher = Indie Fund }}</ref> The Fund allows the developer to retain all IP rights, and does not set any timetable for the development, only requesting monthly progress updates.<ref name=\"announce\"/><ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nAs an example, ''[[Q.U.B.E.]]'', the first Indie Fund-backed game to be released, had an original budget request of about $42,000 in August 2010; aware that it was apparently going over-budget, the Fund approved addition funding to bring the total investment to $90,000.  With four days of the title being released on the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] software delivery platform, the title has sold 12,000 copies, sufficient to repay the investment.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://indie-fund.com/2012/01/q-u-b-e-recoups-investment/ | title = Q.U.B.E.

This allows the Fund to allow for broader projects in size and scope, as well as take more risks on games that may not be as financially successful as others.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-02-09-indie-fund-updates-investment-model | title = Indie Fund updates investment model | first = Rachel | last = Weber | date = 2012-02-09 | accessdate = 2012-02-09 | publisher = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> One example is the decision to fund the game ''[[The Splatters]]'' in September 2012; though the game had previously been released to [[Xbox Live Arcade]] in April 2012, the game was considered unsuccessful but the developers, Spiky Snail, wanted to revise the title based on lessons learned and port it to more systems. The Indie Fund agreed to back the improvements, feeling that the developers had shown an understanding of the initial faults to assure a product that will overcome the risks of investment.<ref name=\"splatters\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/177108/Why_Indie_Fund_is_backing_an_XBLA_flop.php | title = Why Indie Fund is backing an XBLA flop  | first = Tom | last = Curtis | date = 2012-09-04 | accessdate = 2012-09-04 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\nA further change was made in June 2015, allowing investors to decide how their funds can be distributed to the various games currently supported by the Indie Fund.<ref name=\"armello\"/>\n\n==Funded games==\nAt the 2011 [[Game Developers Conference]], the Indie Fund announced the first three games that it had already funded ''[[Q.U.B.E.]]'' by Toxic Games (which would later be the first Indie Fund game to be released in December 2011), ''[[Monaco (video game)|Monaco]]'' by Pocketwatch Games, and ''Shadow Physics'' by Scott Anderson and Steve Swink.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33314/GDC_2011_Indie_Fund_Announces_Support_For_Three_Titles.php | title = GDC 2011: Indie Fund Announces Support For Three Titles  | first = Simon | last = Parkin | date= 2011-03-01 | accessdate =2012-01-09 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> The Indie Fund has also announced funding for one other yet-to-be-named titles from [[Double Fine Productions]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/194277/DoubleFine_receives_Indie_Fund_backing_for_two_new_titles.php | title = DoubleFine receives Indie Fund backing for two new titles | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2013-06-13 | accessdate = 2013-06-16 | first = Kris | last = Ligman }}</ref> The Indie Fund also provided $50,000 in funding for the development of ''[[That Dragon, Cancer]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/22/that-dragon-cancer-release-date-pancakes/ | title = The playable poetry of 'That Dragon, Cancer' lands in January | date = 2015-12-22 | accessdate = 2016-01-11 | first = Jessica | last = Conditt |work = [[Engadget]] }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The Indie Fund was created in early 2010, its purpose aimed \"to encourage the next generation of game developers\" by providing them funding for development of these games without the terms that would normally be associated with publication agreements.<ref name=\"announce\"/>\n\nThe founding and current members of the Indie Fund include: Ron Carmel and [[Kyle Gabler]] of [[2D Boy]], [[Jonathan Blow]] of Number None, [[Kellee Santiago]] formerly of [[thatgamecompany]], Nathan Vella of [[Capybara Games|Capy]], Matthew Wegner of Flashbang Studios and Aaron Isaksen of AppAbove Games.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27446/Independent_Game_Luminaries_Announce_Indie_Fund.php | title = Independent Game Luminaries Announce Indie Fund | first = Simon | last = Carless | date = 2010-03-12 | accessdate = 2012-01-09 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nMembers of the Indie Game organization have identified difficulties for indie developers to be able to fund their projects. Ron Carmel noted that there are typically two ways that this funding can occur: either through the developers providing their own money to initiate the project, or by signing deals with publishers for funding in exchange for part of the game's revenues being given back to the publisher.  Neither of these choices were considered optimal for an aspiring developer, according to Carmel.<ref name=\"announce\"/>\n\nIn 2008, several self-published indie games, including ''[[Audiosurf]]'', ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'', ''[[Castle Crashers]]'', and ''[[World of Goo]]'' were released to both strong critical reception and large sales.  All of these games were initially funded by their respective studios, and demonstrated that investment in independent games could be profitable.<ref name=\"announce\"/> With the following years also providing more commercially-successful games, the Indie Fund group decided to create the fund, using the profits from these games, as to aid the next iteration of indie games.<ref name=\"announce\"/><ref>{{cite conference | url = http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1012305/Indies-and-Publishers-Fixing-a | title = Indies and Publishers: Fixing a System That Never Worked | accessdate = 2012-01-09 | first = Ron | last = Carmel | conference = 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]] | date = March 9\u201313, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Funding model==\n[[File:The Swapper - Screenshot 03.png|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[The Swapper]]'' was financed in part by the Indie Fund.]]\nInvestments in indie games are pulled from the Fund's reserves. Currently, the group states they can select two to three games that they can support per year, but they believe as the Fund expands, they can invest in more projects.<ref name=\"announce\"/> Developers cannot directly apply for investment by the Fund; instead, the Fund watches the indie game market, observing games that get notice from the gaming press through both conferences and word-of-mouth, and selects candidate teams from these sources.<ref name=\"announce\"/> The Fund provides monthly payments to the selected projects to cover development costs; upon release, the developers are expected to pay back the development funding and a small portion of the game's revenue over the next three years based on the level of funding required.<ref name=\"announce\"/>  There is no penalty for failing to be able to pay back the full funding and revenue; should this occur within three years of release, the Fund requires no further payment, and all further revenue can be kept by the developers.<ref name=\"model\">{{cite web | url = http://indie-fund.com/about/ | title = About Indie Fund | accessdate = 2012-01-09 | publisher = Indie Fund }}</ref> The Fund allows the developer to retain all IP rights, and does not set any timetable for the development, only requesting monthly progress updates.<ref name=\"announce\"/><ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nAs an example, ''[[Q.U.B.E.]]'', the first Indie Fund-backed game to be released, had an original budget request of about $42,000 in August 2010; aware that it was apparently going over-budget, the Fund approved addition funding to bring the total investment to $90,000.  With four days of the title being released on the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] software delivery platform, the title has sold 12,000 copies, sufficient to repay the investment.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://indie-fund.com/2012/01/q-u-b-e-recoups-investment/ | title = Q.U.B.E.

This allows the Fund to allow for broader projects in size and scope, as well as take more risks on games that may not be as financially successful as others.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-02-09-indie-fund-updates-investment-model | title = Indie Fund updates investment model | first = Rachel | last = Weber | date = 2012-02-09 | accessdate = 2012-02-09 | publisher = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> One example is the decision to fund the game ''[[The Splatters]]'' in September 2012; though the game had previously been released to [[Xbox Live Arcade]] in April 2012, the game was considered unsuccessful but the developers, Spiky Snail, wanted to revise the title based on lessons learned and port it to more systems. The Indie Fund agreed to back the improvements, feeling that the developers had shown an understanding of the initial faults to assure a product that will overcome the risks of investment.<ref name=\"splatters\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/177108/Why_Indie_Fund_is_backing_an_XBLA_flop.php | title = Why Indie Fund is backing an XBLA flop  | first = Tom | last = Curtis | date = 2012-09-04 | accessdate = 2012-09-04 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\nA further change was made in June 2015, allowing investors to decide how their funds can be distributed to the various games currently supported by the Indie Fund.<ref name=\"armello\"/>\n\n==Funded games==\nAt the 2011 [[Game Developers Conference]], the Indie Fund announced the first three games that it had already funded ''[[Q.U.B.E.]]'' by Toxic Games (which would later be the first Indie Fund game to be released in December 2011), ''[[Monaco (video game)|Monaco]]'' by Pocketwatch Games, and ''Shadow Physics'' by Scott Anderson and Steve Swink.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33314/GDC_2011_Indie_Fund_Announces_Support_For_Three_Titles.php | title = GDC 2011: Indie Fund Announces Support For Three Titles  | first = Simon | last = Parkin | date= 2011-03-01 | accessdate =2012-01-09 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> The Indie Fund has also announced funding for one other yet-to-be-named titles from [[Double Fine Productions]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/194277/DoubleFine_receives_Indie_Fund_backing_for_two_new_titles.php | title = DoubleFine receives Indie Fund backing for two new titles | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2013-06-13 | accessdate = 2013-06-16 | first = Kris | last = Ligman }}</ref> The Indie Fund also provided $50,000 in funding for the development of ''[[That Dragon, Cancer]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/22/that-dragon-cancer-release-date-pancakes/ | title = The playable poetry of 'That Dragon, Cancer' lands in January | date = 2015-12-22 | accessdate = 2016-01-11 | first = Jessica | last = Conditt |work = [[Engadget]] }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

(UK game show)|British programme]] ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' It originally aired on [[Star Plus]] for the first 3 seasons from 2000 to 2007 and was commissioned by the programming team of [[Sameer Nair]]. Since 2010, it has been airing on [[Sony Entertainment Television India|Sony TV]] and produced by [[Big Synergy]].\n\n==Season Overview==\n\n===Season 1: 2000\u201301===\nKBC premiered on 3 July 2000 and was hosted by [[Amitabh Bachchan]], his first appearance on Indian television. ''KBC'' initially offered contestants the chance to win 1 [[Crore]] [[Indian rupees]]. The season ended in 2001. The show was well received in its premiere season.<ref name=ht1>{{cite web|last=Arora |first=Siddharth |title=Five crore question: What makes KBC work? |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Television/Five-crore-question-What-makes-KBC-work/Article1-771297.aspx |format=Article, Interview with [[Amitabh Bachchan]] |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=24 November 2011 |date=19 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122034514/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Television/Five-crore-question-What-makes-KBC-work/Article1-771297.aspx |archivedate=22 November 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mega Star Show |url=http://www.screenindia.com/jul14/tele2.htm |website=[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]] |accessdate=13 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000819000144/http://www.screenindia.com/jul14/tele2.htm |archivedate=19 August 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Season 2: 2005\u201306===\nOn 5 August 2005, the show was restarted after a four-year hiatus, and renamed '''''Kaun Banega Crorepati Dwitiya''''' or '''''KBC 2'''''. During this season, the top prize amount was doubled to 2 Crore [[Rupees]]. It was abruptly ended by [[STAR Plus]] after Amitabh Bachchan fell ill in 2006.<ref>{{|work=|title= |date=|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> Mr. Bachchan had shot 61 of the 85 scheduled episodes when he fell ill. He announced he would return after he recovered, but when his health prevented him from filming the remaining 24 episodes, Star TV took the decision to axe it.\n\n===Season 3: 2007===\nStar Television recruited [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] to host the third season of the show. The grand prize remained 2 Crore Rupees. The third season of the show began airing on 22 January 2007. The show started well but the show's ratings dropped significantly due to the change of the host.<ref>http://ibnlive.in.com/news/should-bollywoods-charmerinchief-stick-to-films-why-shah-rukh-khan-cant-crack-tv-game-shows/490232-8-66.html</ref> The season ended on 19 April 2007 with a special finale.\n\n===Season 4: 2010===\nThe fourth season (called ''KBC 4'') was hosted by the returning Amitabh Bachchan and started on 11 October 2010, on Bachchan's 68th birthday. This season was telecast four days a week, Monday through Thursday evenings. The tagline of the season was \"Koi Bhi Sawaal Chota Nahi Hota\" (English: ''Every question is important''. Literally: ''No question is small''). The show moved from [[STAR Plus]] to [[Sony Entertainment Television India|Sony TV]]. The new logo designed for the fourth season incorporated the new [[Indian rupee symbol|Indian Rupee symbol]], which was unveiled earlier in the year. The contestant tryout for the fourth season opened on 2 August 2010 at 9 PM [[Indian Standard Time|IST]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Amitabh Bachchan-hosted KBC 4 to go on air from Oct 1|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_amitabh-bachchan-hosted-kbc-4-to-go-on-air-from-oct-11_1418189|work=DnaIndia|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>  The total prize money for this season was {{INR}}1 Crore, and a jackpot question for {{INR}}5 Crore.

The number of questions were reduced from 15 to 13 and, as in the United States version of the show, a timer was added to each question.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/mam/headlines/y2k10/sep/sepmam82.php|title=KBC to give away Rs 50 MN in 60 minutes|work=Business Standard|access-date=28 September 2010}}</ref> There was a 30-second time limit for questions 1 and 2, and a 45-second time limit for questions 3 to 7.

This season introduced the \"Double Dip\" and \"Ask the Expert\" lifelines (similar to the United States counterpart from the Millionaire clock format).\n\n===Season 5: 2011===\n[[Amitabh Bachchan]] returned to host the fifth season which premiered on 15 August 2011 on the [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day of India]] and ended on 17 November 2011. It was again aired four days a week. Compared to the previous season, there was only one major gameplay change: there was only a single milestone (the Padao) that the contestant chose. The tagline used for the season was \"Koi Bhi Insaan Chota Nahi Hota\" (English: ''No human is small''. Literally: ''No person is inferior''). This season was the generally viewed as the most popular show on Indian television in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Television KBC 5 ends, leaves behind poignant memories|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Television/KBC-5-ends-leaves-behind-poignant-memories/Article1-770946.aspx|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref>\nThis season introduced a play at home segment called \"[http://kbcgbjjtodayquestion.com/kbc-ghar-baithe-jeeto-jackpot-2018/ Ghar Baithe Jeeto Jackpot]\". This contest allowed home viewers to send an answer to a question via SMS during the show, with 1 Lakh Rupees going to the randomly picked winner, who can double or triple this amount by correctly answering further questions.\n\n===Season 6: 2012\u201313===\nThe registration (contestant tryout) for the season started from 28 May 2012. This sixth season (labeled as ''KBC 6'') was also hosted by Bachchan and premiered on 7 September 2012. It aired from Friday to Sunday evenings on [[Sony TV]]. The season ended on 26 January 2013. The tagline used for the season was \"Sirf Gyaan Hi Aapko Aapka Haq Dilata Hai\" (English: ''It is only knowledge that gives you your right''). This season retained the 13 question format of the previous season.\n\nThis season, ''KBC'' started a new tradition of giving an advantage to socially excluded people, known as \"Dusra Mauka\". Sonali Mukherjee, a victim of acid throwing, appeared along [[Lara Dutta]] in the first such special. On 13 January 2013, another special aired in which Manoj Kumar, a Mahadalit was accompanied by Indian actor [[Manoj Bajpayee]]. The winner of season 6 was Sunmeet Kaur.\n\n<ref>https://auditionsdekho.com/sony-tv-kaun-banega-crorepati/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goczAtbQhaI</ref>\n\n===Season 7: 2013===\nThe rehearsals for the show began on 26 June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title='Kaun Banega Crorepati' rehearsals begin|url=http://badhil.com/kaun-banega-crorepati-rehearsals-begin/|publisher=Badhil}}</ref> Registration started from 8:30 PM on 27 May 2013.\n\nThe seventh season (called ''KBC 7'') was also hosted by Bachchan entitled \"Seekhna Bandh Toh Jeetna Bandh\" (English: ''If Learning stops, winning stops'' or simply: ''Learn to Win'') was used as the tagline for the season.  The total prize money was increased to {{INR}}7 Crore, and the number of questions increased from 13 to 15. The season was commenced on 6 September 2013.\n\nThe season had a few changes, including a new lifeline called Power Paplu. This lifeline allowed the contestant to reuse a lifeline that was previously used on another question. (It could not be a lifeline that was used on the current question. For example, a contestant could not use \"Ask the Audience\"/\"Audience Poll\" twice on the same question.) Double Dip and Ask The Expert were discontinued and in lieu 50:50 and Flip The Question (also known as \"Switch\" or \"Switch The Question\") were revived. The Phone-a-Friend was extended to 45 seconds. The prize for jackpot question was increased to {{INR}}7 Crore. The ''Kaun Banega Crorepati 2013'' set was a 360-degree multimedia stage. The final four questions were a part of ''Sapta Koti Sandook ''(English: ''The Seven Crore Jackpot)'' that let contestants win from {{INR}}1 Crore, {{INR}}3 Crore, {{INR}}5 Crore and finally {{INR}}7 Crore. The system of Fastest Finger First was also altered. Instead of playing one question, the winner of the leader board formed at the end of three questions, sits on the ''Hot Seat.'' (i.e. the player who answered the most questions correctly in the shortest amount of time).\n\n===Season 8: 2014===\nThe highest winning prize of this season was also {{INR}}7 Crore. The registrations of ''KBC 8'' were commenced on 22 July 2014 and the shooting started on 2 August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kaun Banega Crorepati to shoot an episode in Surat!|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/television/tv-channels/gecs/kaun-banega-crorepati-to-shoot-an-episode-in-surat-140725|work=Indian Television|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> Shooting of the entire show was held in [[Surat]].

The Phone-a-Friend was shortened down to 30 seconds and the original Fastest Finger First system (as used for seasons 1 to 6) was reinstated.\n\nThe grand premiere episode of the series premiered on 17 August 2014 (Sunday) at 8:30 PM IST for 3 hours. The season aired from on Monday through Thursday evenings. Initially running for 1.5 hours, the program reduced to an hour. The season ended on 6 November 2014, and aired its two grand finale episodes on 9 November and on 16 November 2014. The tagline for the season was \"Yahan Sirf Paise Nahi, Dil Bhi Jeete Jate Hain\" (English: ''Not only money here, hearts are also won''). Three special guests appeared in the grand premiere episode: television comedian, [[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] from [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors TV]]'s television series ''[[Comedy Nights with Kapil]]'', [[Dayanand Shetty]] and [[Aditya Shrivastava]] from Sony TV's television series ''[[C.I.D.

The tagline of this season was \"Jawaab dene ka Waqt aa gaya hai\" (English: ''The time has come to answer'').   The show aired from Monday to Friday at 9:00 pm. The season introduced a 16 question format, where the first 10 questions are timed (45 seconds for the first five questions and 60 seconds for the following five questions). The 50:50 lifeline replaced Double Dip and the Three Wise Men lifeline was replaced by the Plus One (from the United States version). Phone-a-Friend (now sponsored by [[Jio]]) introduced video calls. In case the contestant reaches the 16th question (Jio Jackpot Question), then the contestant cannot use the remaining lifelines. The last episode of the show was aired on 7 November 2017. Reportedly, with 19.8 million registrations, the show stood at the top of TRP ratings for the Indian television industry.\n\n===Season 10: 2018===\nThe show started registration on 6 June 2018 and started airing on [[Sony Entertainment Television|Sony TV]] from 3 September 2018.

The show was replaced by [[Beyhadh 2]] from 2 December 2019.\n\nUnfortunately, after season 8, nobody has won the Jackpot prize of Rs. 7 crore.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Qualification===\nSimilar to the original airing in Great Britain, members of the public completed a qualification quiz which opened at the start of each season at various times in the year (also known as \"registration period\"). Would-be contestants would sent a premium-rate SMS to a designated number and answer a question by responding. Contestants would complete a series of interviews before being randomly selected from a pool of other hopeful contestants and appearing on the stage in Fastest Finger First. In order to be eligible, contestants must be residents and citizens of India and at least 18 years of age.\n\n===Fastest Finger First===\nThe selected contestants are then brought to the studio to play Fastest Finger First where they will be asked to arrange four answers into the designated order in the shortest amount of time. In Season 7, contestants would play three questions and the one who answered the most correctly in the shortest amount of time will get selected to play the main game.\n\n===Main gameplay===\nAfter determining the winner of Fastest Finger First, they would join the host in the \"Hot Seat\" to start answering a series of multiple-choice questions on their way to win the top cash prize as outlined in the table below. Along the way, the contestant is free to walk away from the game with their winnings but if they got a question wrong, they would walk away with nothing unless they correctly answered a milestone question (highlighted in yellow) that would guarantee some winnings.\n\nTo help them along the way, much like its counterparts, the contestant had a set of lifelines available for them to use. Which lifelines were available were dependent on the format being used.\n* '''Audience Poll''' ('''Ask The Audience'''): The studio audience would dial into a keypad what they believed was the correct answer to the question. The results of the poll are shown to the contestant.\n* '''50:50''': The computer would remove two wrong answers from the game leaving the contestant one right and one wrong answer.\n* '''Phone-A-Friend''': The contestant could call a pre-selected friend or family member of their choosing to aid them in answering the question. Once connected, the aiding party and the contestant had 30 seconds (45 in Season 7) to talk it out among themselves. In 2017, this became a video call instead of a voice call. For season 10, this lifeline was removed in favor of reinstating Ask the Expert <ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> The lifeline is called a phone a friend have next after 9 years. \n* '''Flip The Question''' ('''Switch The Question'''/'''Switch'''): The current question would be thrown-out and replaced with a new question. Any lifelines expended on the original question remained expended. It was introduced in the 2nd season, removed after the 3rd season and reinstated for the 7th & 11th season. During seasons 2 and 3 it could only be used after the 5th question, while it was available from the beginning in season 7. In season 11, new question would be of contestant's pre-selected category from given choice of 11 categories.\n* '''Double Dip''': As featured on the US \"Super Millionaire\", this granted the contestant two chances to answer the question. However, invoking this lifeline removed the ability to walk away from the question. The contestant must answer twice with no further usage of lifelines. (They may use other lifelines before invoking Double Dip but not during the resolution of the lifeline.) In the event of a clocked game, the timer would stop for the first guess only. After that, if the first guess was wrong, the timer resumed counting down. If the contestant did not make their second guess before the time limit or if it was wrong, the contestant would walk away from the game with the lower threshold amount, if any.\n* '''Expert Advice''' ('''Ask the Expert'''): In season 4, the \"Expert Advice\" lifeline was added to the pool of lifelines available. The producers would invite certain general knowledge expert to come to the studio to aid the contestant. This lifeline was restored for season 10 in 2018.<ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> \n* '''Power Paplu''': Introduced in the 7th season, this lifeline allowed the contestant to reuse a lifeline that was previously used on another question. It could not be a lifeline that was used on the current question. \n* '''Triguni''' ('''\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0917\u0941\u0923\u0940,''' '''Three Wise Men'''):  Similar to its US counterpart, the producers would invite certain general knowledge experts or celebrities to come to the studio to aid the contestant. When invoked, the \"Three Wise Men\" were granted 30 seconds to discuss the question and the possible choices among themselves to come up with a consensus answer to relay back to the contestant who was often in earshot of the conversation. Once the time expired, the \"Three Wise Men\" were instructed to stop discussing the question and play resumed as normal.\n* '''Jodidaar''' ('''\u091c\u094b\u0921\u0940\u0926\u093e\u0930''', lit. '''Partner'''): Similar to the United States' '''Plus One''' lifeline, in addition to having 3 Phone-a-Friends, the contestant can also bring a designated family member or friend in to aid them in answering the question. (This person is designated by the contestant prior to the show.)\n\nAdditionally, starting in Season 4, the contestant would have to answer these questions within a certain amount of time. Contestants were allotted 30 seconds to respond up to and including the first threshold question (in 2017, this was increased to 45 seconds). The following question up to and including the next threshold contestants were allotted 60 seconds to give their \"final answer\". For the final set of questions (the question following the second threshold), questions were un-timed. Using a lifeline paused the timer temporarily until it resolved. If the contestant used Flip The Question, the timer would restart from the base value of the question.\n\nThe total number of questions available in the game changed. As the number of questions changed, so did the total prize money available. In 2017, KBC introduced a jackpot question. For the Jackpot Question, the contestants were not allowed to use any of the remaining lifelines.\n\nIn the fifth and sixth season, the contestants had to select a threshold or \"Padao\" themselves. They were allowed to choose any one question on the tree and designate that as a threshold amount. Meaning that if they cross the threshold, they were guaranteed that amount of cash winnings. Getting a question wrong before the Padao is reached would result in zero winnings.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px; cellpadding:2; cellspacing:0;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |Question number\n! colspan=\"7\" |Payout Structure\n|-\n!

The grand prize remained 2 Crore Rupees. The third season of the show began airing on 22 January 2007. The show started well but the show's ratings dropped significantly due to the change of the host.<ref>http://ibnlive.in.com/news/should-bollywoods-charmerinchief-stick-to-films-why-shah-rukh-khan-cant-crack-tv-game-shows/490232-8-66.html</ref> The season ended on 19 April 2007 with a special finale.\n\n===Season 4: 2010===\nThe fourth season (called ''KBC 4'') was hosted by the returning Amitabh Bachchan and started on 11 October 2010, on Bachchan's 68th birthday. This season was telecast four days a week, Monday through Thursday evenings. The tagline of the season was \"Koi Bhi Sawaal Chota Nahi Hota\" (English: ''Every question is important''. Literally: ''No question is small''). The show moved from [[STAR Plus]] to [[Sony Entertainment Television India|Sony TV]]. The new logo designed for the fourth season incorporated the new [[Indian rupee symbol|Indian Rupee symbol]], which was unveiled earlier in the year.

It was again aired four days a week. Compared to the previous season, there was only one major gameplay change: there was only a single milestone (the Padao) that the contestant chose. The tagline used for the season was \"Koi Bhi Insaan Chota Nahi Hota\" (English: ''No human is small''. Literally: ''No person is inferior''). This season was the generally viewed as the most popular show on Indian television in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Television KBC 5 ends, leaves behind poignant memories|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Television/KBC-5-ends-leaves-behind-poignant-memories/Article1-770946.aspx|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref>\nThis season introduced a play at home segment called \"[http://kbcgbjjtodayquestion.com/kbc-ghar-baithe-jeeto-jackpot-2018/ Ghar Baithe Jeeto Jackpot]\". This contest allowed home viewers to send an answer to a question via SMS during the show, with 1 Lakh Rupees going to the randomly picked winner, who can double or triple this amount by correctly answering further questions.\n\n===Season 6: 2012\u201313===\nThe registration (contestant tryout) for the season started from 28 May 2012. This sixth season (labeled as ''KBC 6'') was also hosted by Bachchan and premiered on 7 September 2012. It aired from Friday to Sunday evenings on [[Sony TV]]. The season ended on 26 January 2013. The tagline used for the season was \"Sirf Gyaan Hi Aapko Aapka Haq Dilata Hai\" (English: ''It is only knowledge that gives you your right''). This season retained the 13 question format of the previous season.\n\nThis season, ''KBC'' started a new tradition of giving an advantage to socially excluded people, known as \"Dusra Mauka\". Sonali Mukherjee, a victim of acid throwing, appeared along [[Lara Dutta]] in the first such special. On 13 January 2013, another special aired in which Manoj Kumar, a Mahadalit was accompanied by Indian actor [[Manoj Bajpayee]].

The total prize money was increased to {{INR}}7 Crore, and the number of questions increased from 13 to 15. The season was commenced on 6 September 2013.\n\nThe season had a few changes, including a new lifeline called Power Paplu. This lifeline allowed the contestant to reuse a lifeline that was previously used on another question. (It could not be a lifeline that was used on the current question. For example, a contestant could not use \"Ask the Audience\"/\"Audience Poll\" twice on the same question.) Double Dip and Ask The Expert were discontinued and in lieu 50:50 and Flip The Question (also known as \"Switch\" or \"Switch The Question\") were revived. The Phone-a-Friend was extended to 45 seconds. The prize for jackpot question was increased to {{INR}}7 Crore. The ''Kaun Banega Crorepati 2013'' set was a 360-degree multimedia stage. The final four questions were a part of ''Sapta Koti Sandook ''(English: ''The Seven Crore Jackpot)'' that let contestants win from {{INR}}1 Crore, {{INR}}3 Crore, {{INR}}5 Crore and finally {{INR}}7 Crore. The system of Fastest Finger First was also altered. Instead of playing one question, the winner of the leader board formed at the end of three questions, sits on the ''Hot Seat.'' (i.e. the player who answered the most questions correctly in the shortest amount of time).\n\n===Season 8: 2014===\nThe highest winning prize of this season was also {{INR}}7 Crore.

Three special guests appeared in the grand premiere episode: television comedian, [[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] from [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors TV]]'s television series ''[[Comedy Nights with Kapil]]'', [[Dayanand Shetty]] and [[Aditya Shrivastava]] from Sony TV's television series ''[[C.I.D.

The season introduced a 16 question format, where the first 10 questions are timed (45 seconds for the first five questions and 60 seconds for the following five questions). The 50:50 lifeline replaced Double Dip and the Three Wise Men lifeline was replaced by the Plus One (from the United States version). Phone-a-Friend (now sponsored by [[Jio]]) introduced video calls. In case the contestant reaches the 16th question (Jio Jackpot Question), then the contestant cannot use the remaining lifelines. The last episode of the show was aired on 7 November 2017. Reportedly, with 19.8 million registrations, the show stood at the top of TRP ratings for the Indian television industry.\n\n===Season 10: 2018===\nThe show started registration on 6 June 2018 and started airing on [[Sony Entertainment Television|Sony TV]] from 3 September 2018. The tagline for the tenth season is ''Kab Tak Rokoge'' (English: ''How long will you stop'').<ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> In this particular season, the Phone-a-friend lifeline was replaced with the Ask The Expert lifeline.\n\n===Season 11: 2019===\nKBC returned to air with Bachchan resuming hosting duties as it premiered on 19 August 2019 airing on Sony TV.<ref>\n{{url|https://www.bizasialive.com/sony-tv-begins-registration-process-for-kbc-11-launch/|KBC 11 registration begins}}</ref><ref>{{url|https://khabar.ndtv.com/news/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-11-new-promo-release-amitabh-bachchan-seen-with-new-style-and-new-moral-2067912|Kaun Banega Crorepati 11 new promo released with new style and new moral}} Retrieve on 11 July 2019</ref> In this season the show's tagline was '''Ade Raho''' (English- Keep Standing).

The show witnessed [[Sudha Murthy]] on their last episode of 'Karamveer Special' on 29 November 2019. The show was replaced by [[Beyhadh 2]] from 2 December 2019.\n\nUnfortunately, after season 8, nobody has won the Jackpot prize of Rs. 7 crore.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Qualification===\nSimilar to the original airing in Great Britain, members of the public completed a qualification quiz which opened at the start of each season at various times in the year (also known as \"registration period\"). Would-be contestants would sent a premium-rate SMS to a designated number and answer a question by responding. Contestants would complete a series of interviews before being randomly selected from a pool of other hopeful contestants and appearing on the stage in Fastest Finger First. In order to be eligible, contestants must be residents and citizens of India and at least 18 years of age.\n\n===Fastest Finger First===\nThe selected contestants are then brought to the studio to play Fastest Finger First where they will be asked to arrange four answers into the designated order in the shortest amount of time. In Season 7, contestants would play three questions and the one who answered the most correctly in the shortest amount of time will get selected to play the main game.\n\n===Main gameplay===\nAfter determining the winner of Fastest Finger First, they would join the host in the \"Hot Seat\" to start answering a series of multiple-choice questions on their way to win the top cash prize as outlined in the table below. Along the way, the contestant is free to walk away from the game with their winnings but if they got a question wrong, they would walk away with nothing unless they correctly answered a milestone question (highlighted in yellow) that would guarantee some winnings.\n\nTo help them along the way, much like its counterparts, the contestant had a set of lifelines available for them to use. Which lifelines were available were dependent on the format being used.\n* '''Audience Poll''' ('''Ask The Audience'''): The studio audience would dial into a keypad what they believed was the correct answer to the question. The results of the poll are shown to the contestant.\n* '''50:50''': The computer would remove two wrong answers from the game leaving the contestant one right and one wrong answer.\n* '''Phone-A-Friend''': The contestant could call a pre-selected friend or family member of their choosing to aid them in answering the question. Once connected, the aiding party and the contestant had 30 seconds (45 in Season 7) to talk it out among themselves. In 2017, this became a video call instead of a voice call. For season 10, this lifeline was removed in favor of reinstating Ask the Expert <ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> The lifeline is called a phone a friend have next after 9 years. \n* '''Flip The Question''' ('''Switch The Question'''/'''Switch'''): The current question would be thrown-out and replaced with a new question. Any lifelines expended on the original question remained expended. It was introduced in the 2nd season, removed after the 3rd season and reinstated for the 7th & 11th season. During seasons 2 and 3 it could only be used after the 5th question, while it was available from the beginning in season 7. In season 11, new question would be of contestant's pre-selected category from given choice of 11 categories.\n* '''Double Dip''': As featured on the US \"Super Millionaire\", this granted the contestant two chances to answer the question. However, invoking this lifeline removed the ability to walk away from the question. The contestant must answer twice with no further usage of lifelines. (They may use other lifelines before invoking Double Dip but not during the resolution of the lifeline.) In the event of a clocked game, the timer would stop for the first guess only. After that, if the first guess was wrong, the timer resumed counting down. If the contestant did not make their second guess before the time limit or if it was wrong, the contestant would walk away from the game with the lower threshold amount, if any.\n* '''Expert Advice''' ('''Ask the Expert'''): In season 4, the \"Expert Advice\" lifeline was added to the pool of lifelines available. The producers would invite certain general knowledge expert to come to the studio to aid the contestant. This lifeline was restored for season 10 in 2018.<ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> \n* '''Power Paplu''': Introduced in the 7th season, this lifeline allowed the contestant to reuse a lifeline that was previously used on another question. It could not be a lifeline that was used on the current question. \n* '''Triguni''' ('''\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0917\u0941\u0923\u0940,''' '''Three Wise Men'''):  Similar to its US counterpart, the producers would invite certain general knowledge experts or celebrities to come to the studio to aid the contestant. When invoked, the \"Three Wise Men\" were granted 30 seconds to discuss the question and the possible choices among themselves to come up with a consensus answer to relay back to the contestant who was often in earshot of the conversation. Once the time expired, the \"Three Wise Men\" were instructed to stop discussing the question and play resumed as normal.\n* '''Jodidaar''' ('''\u091c\u094b\u0921\u0940\u0926\u093e\u0930''', lit. '''Partner'''): Similar to the United States' '''Plus One''' lifeline, in addition to having 3 Phone-a-Friends, the contestant can also bring a designated family member or friend in to aid them in answering the question. (This person is designated by the contestant prior to the show.)\n\nAdditionally, starting in Season 4, the contestant would have to answer these questions within a certain amount of time. Contestants were allotted 30 seconds to respond up to and including the first threshold question (in 2017, this was increased to 45 seconds). The following question up to and including the next threshold contestants were allotted 60 seconds to give their \"final answer\". For the final set of questions (the question following the second threshold), questions were un-timed. Using a lifeline paused the timer temporarily until it resolved. If the contestant used Flip The Question, the timer would restart from the base value of the question.\n\nThe total number of questions available in the game changed. As the number of questions changed, so did the total prize money available. In 2017, KBC introduced a jackpot question. For the Jackpot Question, the contestants were not allowed to use any of the remaining lifelines.\n\nIn the fifth and sixth season, the contestants had to select a threshold or \"Padao\" themselves. They were allowed to choose any one question on the tree and designate that as a threshold amount. Meaning that if they cross the threshold, they were guaranteed that amount of cash winnings. Getting a question wrong before the Padao is reached would result in zero winnings.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px; cellpadding:2; cellspacing:0;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |Question number\n! colspan=\"7\" |Payout Structure\n|-\n!

However, it was after this that the number of Chinese migrants and traders significantly increased. These Chinese men intermarried into the local populations, and together they formed mixed-race communities called the [[Peranakan]]s or Straits Chinese.<ref name=\"NatGeo-Laksa\"/> \n\nIn Malaysia, the dish is believed to have been introduced by Chinese immigrants in [[Malacca]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/2012/10/laksa-discovering-malaysias-signature-dish/|title=Laksa: Discovering Malaysia\u2019s signature dish|author=Lara Dunston|date= 24 October 2012 |work=Asian Correspondent}}</ref> \n\nIn Singapore, the dish (or its local \"Katong\" version) is believed to have been created after interaction between the Peranakans with the local Singaporeans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_884_2004-12-27.html |title=Laksa Origins|publisher=[[National Library Board]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Banerji\"/>.\n\nIn Indonesia, the dish is believed to have been born from the Chinese coastal settlements and the mixing of cultures between Chinese merchants and the local cooking practices.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/11/23/039dapur-naga039-a-peek-039peranakan039-cuisine.html|title='Dapur Naga': A peek into 'peranakan' cuisine |author=Prodita Sabarini quoting [[Myra Sidharta]]|date= 24 October 2012 |work=[[The Jakarta Post]]}}</ref> Historians believe laksa is a dish that was born from actual [[Interethnic marriage|intermarriage]].<ref name=\"Banerji\">{{cite news | title = How Intermarriage Created One of the World's Most Delicious Foods | author = Urvija Banerji | date = 8 January 2016 | work = Atlas Obscura | url =http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-intermarriage-created-one-of-the-worlds-most-delicious-foods}}</ref> In early coastal ''pecinan'' (Chinese settlement) in maritime Southeast Asia, it was only Chinese men that ventured abroad out from China to trade.

Nevertheless, numbers of laksa recipes has been developed along the trade channels of Southeast Asia\u2014where the ports of [[Penang]], [[Medan]], Malacca, Singapore, [[Palembang]], and [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (now Jakarta) are the major stops along the historic [[spice trade|spice route]].

However, its popularity is somewhat overshadowed by ''[[Soto (food)|soto]]'', a similar hearty warm soup dish, which is often consumed with rice instead of noodles. In modern households, it is common practice to mix and match the recipes of laksas; if traditional laksa noodle is not available, Japanese [[udon]] noodles might be used instead.<ref>{{cite news | title = Weekend Bites: Melting pot laksa to keep warm on rainy days | author = Theodora Hurustiati | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | date = 27 October 2012 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/27/weekend-bites-melting-pot-laksa-keep-warm-rainy-days.html}}</ref>\n\nLaksa is a popular dish in Darwin, Australia, and the first Darwin International Laksa Festival was held in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-10/most-of-darwins-noodles-are-homemade-in-a-backyard-shed/11678390|title=The backyard noodle machine catering for Darwin's growing appetite|last=Byrne|first=Conor|last2=Ong|first2=Jess|date=2019-11-10|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThe type of laksa is based upon the soup base employed in its recipe; either rich and savoury [[coconut milk]], fresh and sour ''asam'' ([[tamarind]], ''[[Garcinia atroviridis|gelugur]]'' or ''[[kokum]]''), or the combination of the two. There are three basic types of laksa: ''curry laksa'', ''asam laksa'', and other variant that can be identified as either curry or asam laksa. Curry laksa is a [[coconut milk]] curry soup with noodles, while asam laksa is a sour, most often [[tamarind]]-based, soup with noodles. Thick rice noodles also known as '''laksa noodles''' are most commonly used, although thin [[rice vermicelli]] (''bee hoon'' or ''mee hoon'') are also common, and some recipes might create their own rice noodle from scratch. Some variants might use other types of noodles; Johor laksa for example uses [[spaghetti]],<ref name=\"JP1\"/> while a fusion recipe might use Japanese [[udon]] noodle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spicy Malaysian Tofu Laksa with Udon Noodles|publisher=haute chef|url=http://hautechef.in/index.php/spicy-malaysian-tofu-laksa-with-udon-noodles.html|access-date=8 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714024922/http://hautechef.in/index.php/spicy-malaysian-tofu-laksa-with-udon-noodles.html|archive-date=14 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"SBS-Laksa\"/>\n\n===Curry laksa===\n[[File:Laksa.JPG|thumb|Curry laksa sold in [[Bukit Batok]], Singapore]]\n\n'''Curry laksa''' is a [[coconut milk|coconut]]-based curry soup.<ref name=\"SBS-Laksa\"/> The main ingredients for most versions of curry laksa include bean curd puffs, [[surimi|fish sticks]], [[shrimp]], and [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s.

In modern households, it is common practice to mix and match the recipes of laksas; if traditional laksa noodle is not available, Japanese [[udon]] noodles might be used instead.<ref>{{cite news | title = Weekend Bites: Melting pot laksa to keep warm on rainy days | author = Theodora Hurustiati | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | date = 27 October 2012 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/27/weekend-bites-melting-pot-laksa-keep-warm-rainy-days.html}}</ref>\n\nLaksa is a popular dish in Darwin, Australia, and the first Darwin International Laksa Festival was held in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-10/most-of-darwins-noodles-are-homemade-in-a-backyard-shed/11678390|title=The backyard noodle machine catering for Darwin's growing appetite|last=Byrne|first=Conor|last2=Ong|first2=Jess|date=2019-11-10|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThe type of laksa is based upon the soup base employed in its recipe; either rich and savoury [[coconut milk]], fresh and sour ''asam'' ([[tamarind]], ''[[Garcinia atroviridis|gelugur]]'' or ''[[kokum]]''), or the combination of the two. There are three basic types of laksa: ''curry laksa'', ''asam laksa'', and other variant that can be identified as either curry or asam laksa. Curry laksa is a [[coconut milk]] curry soup with noodles, while asam laksa is a sour, most often [[tamarind]]-based, soup with noodles. Thick rice noodles also known as '''laksa noodles''' are most commonly used, although thin [[rice vermicelli]] (''bee hoon'' or ''mee hoon'') are also common, and some recipes might create their own rice noodle from scratch. Some variants might use other types of noodles; Johor laksa for example uses [[spaghetti]],<ref name=\"JP1\"/> while a fusion recipe might use Japanese [[udon]] noodle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spicy Malaysian Tofu Laksa with Udon Noodles|publisher=haute chef|url=http://hautechef.in/index.php/spicy-malaysian-tofu-laksa-with-udon-noodles.html|access-date=8 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714024922/http://hautechef.in/index.php/spicy-malaysian-tofu-laksa-with-udon-noodles.html|archive-date=14 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"SBS-Laksa\"/>\n\n===Curry laksa===\n[[File:Laksa.JPG|thumb|Curry laksa sold in [[Bukit Batok]], Singapore]]\n\n'''Curry laksa''' is a [[coconut milk|coconut]]-based curry soup.<ref name=\"SBS-Laksa\"/> The main ingredients for most versions of curry laksa include bean curd puffs, [[surimi|fish sticks]], [[shrimp]], and [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s.

Laksa is commonly served with a spoonful of ''[[sambal]]'' chilli paste and garnished with [[Vietnamese coriander]], or ''laksa leaf'', which is known in [[Malay language|Malay]] as ''daun kesum''.\n\nThis is usually known as [[curry mee]] in Penang rather than curry laksa, due to the different kind of noodles used (yellow ''[[mee pok|mee]]'' or ''bee hoon'', as opposed to the thick white laksa noodles). Curry mee in [[Penang]] uses congealed pork blood, a delicacy to the [[Malaysian Chinese]] community.\n\nThe term \"curry laksa\" is more commonly used in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Singapore.

Common spices include [[turmeric]], [[coriander]], [[candlenut]], [[lemongrass]], garlic, [[shallot]], and [[Black pepper|pepper]] cooked in [[coconut milk]]. Widely available ''daun kemangi'' (Indonesian lemon basil leaf) is commonly used instead of ''daun kesum''. ''Bihun'' or thin [[rice vermicelli]] is most commonly used noodle instead of thick rice noodle, and some recipe might add slices of ''[[ketupat]]'' or ''[[lontong]]'' rice cake.

''Lemak'' is a culinary description in the Malay language which specifically refers to the presence of [[coconut milk]] which adds a distinctive richness to a dish. As the name implies, it is made with a rich, slightly sweet and strongly spiced coconut gravy. Laksa lemak is usually made with a fish-based gravy (with vegetarian food stalls omitting fish) and quite similar to '''Thai laksa''' (Malay: '''''laksa Thai'''''), perhaps to the point that one could say they are one and the same.\n[[File:YosriLaksam.jpg|thumb|right|Laksam is a popular dish in Kelantan and Terengganu]]\n* '''Laksam''', also known in [[Thailand]] as '''lasae''' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e30\u0e41\u0e0b}}),<ref name=\"Thairath\" /> a speciality of the Northeastern Malaysian states of [[Kelantan]], Terengganu, and [[Kedah]], is made with very thick flat white rice flour noodles in a rich, full-bodied white gravy of boiled fish and coconut milk.

In Katong laksa, the noodles are normally cut up into smaller pieces so that the entire dish can be eaten with a spoon alone, without chopsticks or a fork.

Penang asam laksa listed at number 26 on \"World's 50 most delicious foods\" compiled by ''CNN Go'' in 2011.<ref name=\"CNNGo\"/> ''Asam'' is the Malay word for any ingredient that makes a dish taste sour (e.g. [[tamarind]], ''[[Garcinia atroviridis|gelugur]]'' or [[kokum]]). Laksa typically uses [[Garcinia atroviridis|''asam keping'']], known as [[kokum]] in the English speaking world, which is a type of dried slices of sour [[mangosteen]]s. The modern Malay spelling is ''asam'', though the spelling ''assam'' is still frequently used.\n\nThe main ingredients for asam laksa include shredded fish, normally ''kembung'' (small mackerel of the [[Rastrelliger]] genus), and finely sliced vegetables including cucumber, onions, red chillies, pineapple, lettuce, common mint, ''daun kesum'' (Vietnamese mint or laksa mint), and pink ''bunga kantan'' ([[Etlingera eliator|torch ginger]]). Asam laksa is normally served with either thick rice noodles or thin rice noodles ([[vermicelli]]) and topped off with ''[[petis]] udang'' or ''hae ko'' (\u8766\u818f), a thick sweet prawn-[[shrimp paste]].<ref name=\"SBS-Laksa\"/>\n\nVariants of asam laksa include:\n* '''Penang laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Pulau Pinang'''''), also known as ''asam laksa'' from the [[Malay language|Malay]] for [[tamarind]], comes from the Malaysian island of [[Penang]]. It is made with [[mackerel]] (''ikan kembung'') soup and its main distinguishing feature is the ''asam'' or tamarind which gives the soup a sour taste. The fish is poached and then flaked. Other ingredients that give Penang laksa its distinctive flavour include [[lemongrass]], [[galangal]] (''lengkuas'') and chilli. Typical garnishes include [[Mentha|mint]], [[pineapple]] slices, thinly sliced onion, ''[[petis]] udang'' or ''hae ko'' (\u8766\u818f), a thick sweet prawn-[[shrimp paste]] and use of [[Etlingera eliator|torch ginger]] flower. This, and not 'curry mee' is the usual 'laksa' one gets in Penang. Penang Laksa is listed at number 7 on the ''World's 50 best foods''compiled by CNN Go in July 2011\n* '''Perlis laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Perlis''''') is similar to Penang laksa but differs in garnishing used such as catfish and eel fish. Perlis laksa can be found in Kuala Perlis.\n* '''Kedah laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Kedah''''') is very similar to Penang laksa and only differs in the garnishing used. Sliced boiled eggs are usually added to the dish. Kedah laksa used rice to make a laksa noodle. The laksa in Kedah is Laksa Telok Kechai.\n* '''Ipoh laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Ipoh'''''), from the Malaysian city of [[Ipoh]], is similar to Penang laksa but has a more sour (rather than sweet) taste, and contains prawn paste.\n* '''Kuala Kangsar Laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Kuala Kangsar'''''), made of wheat flour (usually hand made). The soup is rather lighter than the common laksa taste and so much different from Ipoh Laksa in shape, taste, and smell. The local municipal council built a complex called \"Kompleks Cendol dan Laksa\" near the river bank of the Perak River. It is the main attraction for tourists in Kuala Kangsar.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n* '''Medan laksa''' (Indonesian: '''''Laksa Medan'''''), from Indonesian city of [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]].
