Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Its simple, neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces. It has sometimes been sold as '''Standard''' or '''Basic Commercial''' in English-speaking countries.\n==Design characteristics==\n[[Image:Akzidenz-Grotesk variations.svg|thumb|Digital variants of Akzidenz-Grotesk, showing the slight inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies between different weights and widths]]\nLike most [[sans-serif]]s, Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, with all strokes of the letter of similar width.

The population was 77,434 at the [[2010 U.S. Census]], making it the eighth-largest city in the state.<ref name=\"pop\"/>\n\nIt became prominent in the nineteenth century as a shipping and market center, first served by [[riverboat]]s and then by [[rail transport|railroads]]. Seven lines met in Albany, and it was a center of trade in the Southeast. It is part of the [[Black Belt (geological formation)]], the extensive area in the Deep South of cotton plantations. From the mid-20th century, it received military investment during [[World War II]] and after, that helped develop the region. Albany and this area were prominent during the civil rights era, particularly during the early 1960s as activists worked to regain voting and other civil rights. Railroad restructuring and reduction in the military here caused job losses, but the city has developed new businesses.\n\n==History==\nThe region where Albany is located was long inhabited by the [[Creek people|Creek Indians]], who called it ''Thronateeska'' after their word for \"[[flint]]\", the valuable mineral found in beds near the Flint River. They used it for making arrowheads and other tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagecenter.org/about.html|title=Thronateeska Heritage Center|website=Heritagecenter.org|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref> In 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], and the United States made treaties to extinguish Creek and other Native American land claims in the Southeast. The US Army forcibly removed most of the native peoples to [[Indian Territory]], lands west of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\n===Nelson Tift===\n[[File:Nelson Tift.jpg|thumb|Nelson Tift (1810-1891), the founder of Albany]]\nEuropean-American settlement began with [[Nelson Tift]] of [[Groton, Connecticut]], who took land along the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] in October 1836 after [[Indian removal]].  Tift and his colleagues named the new town Albany after [[Albany, New York|the capital]] of New York; noting that New York's Albany was a commercial center located at the headwaters of the [[Hudson River]], they hoped that their town near the headwaters of the Flint would prove to be just as successful. It proved to be nowhere near as prosperous. Alexander Shotwell laid out the town in 1836, and it was incorporated as a city by an act of the General Assembly of Georgia on December 27, 1838.<ref>[http://www.albany.ga.us/city_commission/cc_index.htm ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310014656/http://www.albany.ga.us/city_commission/cc_index.htm |date=March 10, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nTift for decades was the city's leading entrepreneur. An ardent booster, he promoted education, business, and railroad construction. During the Civil War he provided naval supplies and helped build two ships.  He opposed [[Radical Reconstruction]] inside the state and in Congress, and was scornful of the [[Yankee]] [[carpetbaggers]] who came in. Historian John Fair concludes that Tift became \"more Southern than many natives.\"<ref name=\"fair\"/> His pro-slavery attitudes before the war and his support for [[Racial segregation|segregation]] afterward made him compatible with Georgia's white elite.<ref name=\"fair\">Fair, John D. \"Nelson Tift: A Connecticut Yankee in King Cotton's Court,\" ''Georgia Historical Quarterly'' (2004) 88#3 pp 338-374</ref>\n\nThis area was developed for cotton cultivation by planters, who used numerous enslaved African Americans to clear lands and process the cotton. As a result of the planters' acquisition of slave workers, by 1840 Dougherty County's majority population was black, composed overwhelmingly of slaves.  The market center for cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantations]], Albany was in a prime location for shipping cotton to other markets by [[steamboat]]s on the river. In 1858, Tift hired [[Horace King (architect)|Horace King]], a former slave and bridge builder, to construct a [[toll bridge]] over the river. King's bridge toll house still stands.\n\nAlready important as a shipping port, Albany later became an important railroad hub in southwestern Georgia. Seven lines were constructed to the town. An exhibit on trains is located at the Thronateeska Heritage Center in the former [[railroad station]].\n\n===Carey Wentworth Styles===\nAfter the war, [[Carey Wentworth Styles]] moved to Albany and founded the newspaper ''Albany News''. In the early years following the war, Styles, like Tift, took great exception to the [[Radical Reconstruction]] program then in force, and advocated for a more moderate response based on his interpretation of Georgia's rights under the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].<ref name=\"Davis2012\">{{cite book|author=Jefferson Davis|title=The Papers of Jefferson Davis: 1871-1879|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AKq2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 12, 2012|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-3907-3|pages=37\u201338}}</ref>  Styles backed \"constitutional reconstruction\" advanced by [[Benjamin H.

It caused extensive property damage in 1841 and 1925. The city has also been subject to [[tornado]]es. On February 10, 1940, a severe tornado hit Albany, killing eighteen people and causing large-scale damage.\n\nOn April 11, 1906, the [[Carnegie Library]], created by matching funds from the philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]], was opened downtown. Originally a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] facility under [[Jim Crow]] laws, it was not open to African Americans until after the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. It functioned as a library through 1985. In 1992, after renovation, the building was reopened as the headquarters of the Albany Area Arts Council.\n\nIn 1912, the downtown U.S. Post Office and courthouse building opened. Other federal projects have been important to the city and region. In 1937, Chehaw Park was constructed as a part of a [[New Deal]] program under the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nMajor changes came with the expansion of military facilities in the city, secured by the powerful [[Southern Block]] in Congress.  A [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] training base was built near Albany on land owned by the city and leased to the Air Corps for $1 a year.  Construction of the base and airfield by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] began on March 25, 1941. After being used during World War II, the airfield was temporarily deactivated between August 15, 1946, and September 1, 1947.\n\nAfter the beginning of the [[Cold War]] and the founding of the [[U.S. Air Force]] in late 1947, the airfield was reactivated and upgraded with runways for a U.S. Air Force base.  It was named [[Turner Air Force Base]]. The Air Force used this base for heavy bomber jets, such as the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. A number of other Air Force units were also housed at this base.\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.strategic-air-command.com/bases/Turner_AFB.htm\n| title=Turner AFB\n| accessdate=May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060513110048/http://www.strategic-air-command.com/bases/Turner_AFB.htm| archivedate= May 13, 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> Among them were the 1370th Photomapping Group,<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.1370th.com/index.htm\n |title       = 1370th Photomapping and Charting Group\n |accessdate  = May 11, 2006\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060517174305/http://www.1370th.com/index.htm\n |archivedate = May 17, 2006\n |url-status     = dead\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> and refueling and maintenance functions.\n\nIn 1951, the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] established a logistics base on the eastern outskirts of Albany.  During the 1950s and 1960s, so many white servicemen and associated workers arrived that the city briefly became majority white for the first time since 1870.\n\nIn 1960, the population of Albany reached 50,000 people. During 1961\u20131962, African Americans in Albany played a prominent role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] (see the [[Albany Movement]]). They led protests and non-violent demonstrations to end segregation of public facilities, gain the right to vote, and advance social justice. Assisted by activists from [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]], [[SNCC]], and the [[NAACP]], African Americans and supporters took a stand to fight segregation through nonviolence. The city repealed its [[Jim Crow]] laws in 1963, but African Americans did not recover the ability to exercise their voting rights until Congress passed enforcement authority with the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].\n\nIn 1967, the Air Force closed all its operations at the base, which was transferred to the [[U.S. Navy]] and renamed Naval Air Station Albany.   NAS Albany was used as the shore base of nearly all the Navy's [[RA-5C Vigilante]] twin-jet, carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft. In 1974, the base was closed and the property was returned to the city.\n\nIn 1979, the Miller Brewing Company purchased part of the old naval base's property to build a new brewery.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.turnerfield-miller.com\n| title=History of Turner Field Albany Georgia\n| accessdate=May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060524015648/http://www.turnerfield-miller.com/| archivedate= May 24, 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe decline in military bases and railroad restructuring nationwide both led to job losses in the Albany area. Much of the remaining white population moved to suburbs and newer housing out of the city, which became majority African American in the 1970s. Struggling with a poor economy, in 1988 Albany made national headlines as the \"Murder Capital of America,\" with the highest murder rate per capita in the United States. Other cities have since taken that title.\n\nSome late twentieth-century floods have been extreme. In 1994, a severe flood was caused by rainfall from [[Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)#Impact|Tropical Storm Alberto]]; it killed 14 people and displaced 22,000. The state supported a $150 million renovation of the [[Albany State University]] campus to repair storm damage and complete upgrades. New housing was built on the south side of town to replace what had been destroyed. In 1998, the Flint River crested at {{convert|35|ft|m}} above its bed and flooded parts of the city.\n\nBecause of such flooding, the city has decided against redeveloping areas along the riverfront floodplain for commercial or residential purposes.  This area is being improved for other uses, with a riverfront walkway and a new aquarium built over a tributary creek.\n\nOn January 2 and 22, 2017, violent tornadoes passed through the area, claiming several lives and destroying mobile home parks in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/170122_rpts.html|title=Storm Prediction Center Storm Reports Page|first=Storm Prediction|last=Center|website=www.spc.noaa.gov}}</ref>\nOn October 10, 2018 Hurricane Michael, the first major hurricane (Category 3+) to directly impact Georgia since the 1890s, plowed through South Georgia leaving widespread devastation in its path.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.weather.gov/ffc/2018_hurricane_michael | title=Hurricane Michael Hits Georgia | publisher=National Weather Service | date=October 10, 2018}}</ref>\n<br>\n\nBy mid April 2020 Albany had the fourth-highest density of COVID-19 outbreaks in the southeast, next to the New Orleans greater metro area, Randolph and Terrel Counties in Georgia.

Approximately 1,400 employees at the plant were projected to lose their jobs.\n\n===Business environment===\nAs a result of the recent economic downturn, unemployment remained higher in Albany than the country average.

Located on the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]], it is the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Dougherty County, Georgia|Dougherty County]]. Located in southwest Georgia,<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=May 31, 2011  }}</ref> it is the principal city of the [[Albany, Georgia metropolitan area]]. The population was 77,434 at the [[2010 U.S. Census]], making it the eighth-largest city in the state.<ref name=\"pop\"/>\n\nIt became prominent in the nineteenth century as a shipping and market center, first served by [[riverboat]]s and then by [[rail transport|railroads]]. Seven lines met in Albany, and it was a center of trade in the Southeast. It is part of the [[Black Belt (geological formation)]], the extensive area in the Deep South of cotton plantations. From the mid-20th century, it received military investment during [[World War II]] and after, that helped develop the region. Albany and this area were prominent during the civil rights era, particularly during the early 1960s as activists worked to regain voting and other civil rights. Railroad restructuring and reduction in the military here caused job losses, but the city has developed new businesses.\n\n==History==\nThe region where Albany is located was long inhabited by the [[Creek people|Creek Indians]], who called it ''Thronateeska'' after their word for \"[[flint]]\", the valuable mineral found in beds near the Flint River. They used it for making arrowheads and other tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagecenter.org/about.html|title=Thronateeska Heritage Center|website=Heritagecenter.org|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref> In 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], and the United States made treaties to extinguish Creek and other Native American land claims in the Southeast. The US Army forcibly removed most of the native peoples to [[Indian Territory]], lands west of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\n===Nelson Tift===\n[[File:Nelson Tift.jpg|thumb|Nelson Tift (1810-1891), the founder of Albany]]\nEuropean-American settlement began with [[Nelson Tift]] of [[Groton, Connecticut]], who took land along the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] in October 1836 after [[Indian removal]].  Tift and his colleagues named the new town Albany after [[Albany, New York|the capital]] of New York; noting that New York's Albany was a commercial center located at the headwaters of the [[Hudson River]], they hoped that their town near the headwaters of the Flint would prove to be just as successful. It proved to be nowhere near as prosperous. Alexander Shotwell laid out the town in 1836, and it was incorporated as a city by an act of the General Assembly of Georgia on December 27, 1838.<ref>[http://www.albany.ga.us/city_commission/cc_index.htm ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310014656/http://www.albany.ga.us/city_commission/cc_index.htm |date=March 10, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nTift for decades was the city's leading entrepreneur. An ardent booster, he promoted education, business, and railroad construction. During the Civil War he provided naval supplies and helped build two ships.  He opposed [[Radical Reconstruction]] inside the state and in Congress, and was scornful of the [[Yankee]] [[carpetbaggers]] who came in. Historian John Fair concludes that Tift became \"more Southern than many natives.\"<ref name=\"fair\"/> His pro-slavery attitudes before the war and his support for [[Racial segregation|segregation]] afterward made him compatible with Georgia's white elite.<ref name=\"fair\">Fair, John D. \"Nelson Tift: A Connecticut Yankee in King Cotton's Court,\" ''Georgia Historical Quarterly'' (2004) 88#3 pp 338-374</ref>\n\nThis area was developed for cotton cultivation by planters, who used numerous enslaved African Americans to clear lands and process the cotton. As a result of the planters' acquisition of slave workers, by 1840 Dougherty County's majority population was black, composed overwhelmingly of slaves.  The market center for cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantations]], Albany was in a prime location for shipping cotton to other markets by [[steamboat]]s on the river. In 1858, Tift hired [[Horace King (architect)|Horace King]], a former slave and bridge builder, to construct a [[toll bridge]] over the river. King's bridge toll house still stands.\n\nAlready important as a shipping port, Albany later became an important railroad hub in southwestern Georgia. Seven lines were constructed to the town. An exhibit on trains is located at the Thronateeska Heritage Center in the former [[railroad station]].\n\n===Carey Wentworth Styles===\nAfter the war, [[Carey Wentworth Styles]] moved to Albany and founded the newspaper ''Albany News''. In the early years following the war, Styles, like Tift, took great exception to the [[Radical Reconstruction]] program then in force, and advocated for a more moderate response based on his interpretation of Georgia's rights under the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].<ref name=\"Davis2012\">{{cite book|author=Jefferson Davis|title=The Papers of Jefferson Davis: 1871-1879|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AKq2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 12, 2012|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-3907-3|pages=37\u201338}}</ref>  Styles backed \"constitutional reconstruction\" advanced by [[Benjamin H.

Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref> After his legislative service, Styles sold the Albany newspaper in 1876 and returned to Atlanta.\n\n===20th century to present===\nWhile integral to the economic life of the town, the Flint River has flooded regularly. It caused extensive property damage in 1841 and 1925. The city has also been subject to [[tornado]]es. On February 10, 1940, a severe tornado hit Albany, killing eighteen people and causing large-scale damage.\n\nOn April 11, 1906, the [[Carnegie Library]], created by matching funds from the philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]], was opened downtown. Originally a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] facility under [[Jim Crow]] laws, it was not open to African Americans until after the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. It functioned as a library through 1985. In 1992, after renovation, the building was reopened as the headquarters of the Albany Area Arts Council.\n\nIn 1912, the downtown U.S. Post Office and courthouse building opened. Other federal projects have been important to the city and region. In 1937, Chehaw Park was constructed as a part of a [[New Deal]] program under the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nMajor changes came with the expansion of military facilities in the city, secured by the powerful [[Southern Block]] in Congress.  A [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] training base was built near Albany on land owned by the city and leased to the Air Corps for $1 a year.  Construction of the base and airfield by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] began on March 25, 1941. After being used during World War II, the airfield was temporarily deactivated between August 15, 1946, and September 1, 1947.\n\nAfter the beginning of the [[Cold War]] and the founding of the [[U.S. Air Force]] in late 1947, the airfield was reactivated and upgraded with runways for a U.S. Air Force base.  It was named [[Turner Air Force Base]]. The Air Force used this base for heavy bomber jets, such as the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. A number of other Air Force units were also housed at this base.\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.strategic-air-command.com/bases/Turner_AFB.htm\n| title=Turner AFB\n| accessdate=May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060513110048/http://www.strategic-air-command.com/bases/Turner_AFB.htm| archivedate= May 13, 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> Among them were the 1370th Photomapping Group,<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.1370th.com/index.htm\n |title       = 1370th Photomapping and Charting Group\n |accessdate  = May 11, 2006\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060517174305/http://www.1370th.com/index.htm\n |archivedate = May 17, 2006\n |url-status     = dead\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> and refueling and maintenance functions.\n\nIn 1951, the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] established a logistics base on the eastern outskirts of Albany.  During the 1950s and 1960s, so many white servicemen and associated workers arrived that the city briefly became majority white for the first time since 1870.\n\nIn 1960, the population of Albany reached 50,000 people. During 1961\u20131962, African Americans in Albany played a prominent role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] (see the [[Albany Movement]]). They led protests and non-violent demonstrations to end segregation of public facilities, gain the right to vote, and advance social justice. Assisted by activists from [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]], [[SNCC]], and the [[NAACP]], African Americans and supporters took a stand to fight segregation through nonviolence. The city repealed its [[Jim Crow]] laws in 1963, but African Americans did not recover the ability to exercise their voting rights until Congress passed enforcement authority with the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].\n\nIn 1967, the Air Force closed all its operations at the base, which was transferred to the [[U.S. Navy]] and renamed Naval Air Station Albany.   NAS Albany was used as the shore base of nearly all the Navy's [[RA-5C Vigilante]] twin-jet, carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft. In 1974, the base was closed and the property was returned to the city.\n\nIn 1979, the Miller Brewing Company purchased part of the old naval base's property to build a new brewery.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.turnerfield-miller.com\n| title=History of Turner Field Albany Georgia\n| accessdate=May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060524015648/http://www.turnerfield-miller.com/| archivedate= May 24, 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe decline in military bases and railroad restructuring nationwide both led to job losses in the Albany area. Much of the remaining white population moved to suburbs and newer housing out of the city, which became majority African American in the 1970s. Struggling with a poor economy, in 1988 Albany made national headlines as the \"Murder Capital of America,\" with the highest murder rate per capita in the United States. Other cities have since taken that title.\n\nSome late twentieth-century floods have been extreme. In 1994, a severe flood was caused by rainfall from [[Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)#Impact|Tropical Storm Alberto]]; it killed 14 people and displaced 22,000. The state supported a $150 million renovation of the [[Albany State University]] campus to repair storm damage and complete upgrades. New housing was built on the south side of town to replace what had been destroyed. In 1998, the Flint River crested at {{convert|35|ft|m}} above its bed and flooded parts of the city.\n\nBecause of such flooding, the city has decided against redeveloping areas along the riverfront floodplain for commercial or residential purposes.  This area is being improved for other uses, with a riverfront walkway and a new aquarium built over a tributary creek.\n\nOn January 2 and 22, 2017, violent tornadoes passed through the area, claiming several lives and destroying mobile home parks in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/170122_rpts.html|title=Storm Prediction Center Storm Reports Page|first=Storm Prediction|last=Center|website=www.spc.noaa.gov}}</ref>\nOn October 10, 2018 Hurricane Michael, the first major hurricane (Category 3+) to directly impact Georgia since the 1890s, plowed through South Georgia leaving widespread devastation in its path.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.weather.gov/ffc/2018_hurricane_michael | title=Hurricane Michael Hits Georgia | publisher=National Weather Service | date=October 10, 2018}}</ref>\n<br>\n\nBy mid April 2020 Albany had the forth highest density of Covid-19 outbreaks in the southeast, next to the New Orleans greater metro area, Randolph and Terrel Counties in Georgia.

From the 1920s there were proposals to roof the railway yards on the southeast corner of [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders]] and [[Swanston Street]]s for a public square, with more detailed proposals prepared in the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Federation Square, a place in history|url=https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/assets-fedsquare/uploads/2015/02/Federation-Square-History.pdf|website=Fed Square Melbourne|publisher=Federation Square Management Pty Ltd|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref> In the 1960s, the [[Melbourne City Council]] decided that the best place for the [[City Square, Melbourne|City Square]] was the corner of Swanston and [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]]s, opposite the town hall. The first temporary square opened in 1968, and a permanent version opened in 1981. It was however not considered a great success, and was redeveloped in the 1990s as a smaller simpler space in front of a new large hotel.\n\nMeanwhile, in the late 1960s, a small part of the railway lines had been partly roofed by the construction of the [[Princes Gate Towers]], known as the Gas & Fuel Buildings after their major tenant, the [[Gas and Fuel Corporation]], over the old [[Princes Bridge railway station|Princes Bridge station]]. This included a plaza on the corner, which was elevated above the street and little used. Between the plaza and Batman Avenue, which ran along the north bank of the [[Yarra River]], were the extensive [[Jolimont Yard|Jolimont Railway Yards]], and the through train lines running into Flinders Street station under Swanston Street.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&inttype=1&intid=923\n|work=The Age\n|title=Demolitions days\n|author=Fiona Whitlock\n|date=9 December 1996\n|publisher=150.theage.com.au\n|access-date=16 March 2008\n|location=Melbourne\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904013543/http://150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&inttype=1&intid=923\n|archive-date=4 September 2007\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Design competition and controversy===\nIn 1996 the [[Premier of Victoria|Premier]] [[Jeff Kennett]] announced that the Gas & Fuel Buildings would be demolished, and the railyards roofed, and a complex including arts facilities and a large public space would be built.

A series of 'shards' provided vertical accents, while interconnected laneways and stairways and the wintergarden would connect Flinders Street to the Yarra River. The open square was arranged as a gently sloping amphitheatre, focussed on a large viewing screen for public events, with a secondary sloped plaza area on the main corner. The design was widely supported by the design community but was less popular with the public.

The performance arts space was dropped, the number of commercial tenancies increased, and the south end of the Atrium became an auditorium.

The open public square is directly opposite [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] and [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's Cathedral]]. The layout of the precinct is designed to connect the historical central district of the city with the Yarra River and a new park [[Birrarung Marr]].\n\n[[File:MEL federationssquare.jpg|thumb|900px|center|<center>360\u00b0 panorama</center>]]\n[[File:FederationSquare-panorama.jpg|thumb|900px|center|<center>Night view</center>]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Design features==\n\n===Square===\n[[File:Fed square tiles.jpg|thumb|left|Main square paving.]]\n\nThe complex of buildings forms a rough U-shape around the main open-air square, oriented to the west. The eastern end of the square is formed by the glazed walls of The Atrium. While [[bluestone]] is used for the majority of the paving in the Atrium and St Paul's Court, matching footpaths elsewhere in central Melbourne, the main square is paved in 470,000 [[ochre]]-coloured sandstone blocks from [[Western Australia]]<ref name=open/> and invokes images of the [[outback]]. The paving is designed as a huge urban artwork, called ''Nearamnew'', by [[Paul Carter (academic)|Paul Carter]] and gently rises above street level, containing a number of textual pieces inlaid in its undulating surface.\n\nThere are a small number of [[Landscaping|landscaped]] sections in the square and plaza which are planted with [[Eucalyptus]] trees.\n\n===Plaza and giant screen===\n[[File:RuddSorry.jpg|thumb|right|The large screen is used for public events. Pictured is a telecast of [[Kevin Rudd]]'s parliamentary apology to the [[stolen generations]].]]\nA key part of the plaza design is its large and fixed public screen, which has been used to broadcast major sporting events such as the [[AFL Grand Final]] and still{{when|date=October 2015}} continues to do so. During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], thousands of football fans assembled to watch.\n\n===Buildings===\n[[File:Federation-square-sandstone-facade.jpg|thumb|right| Building fa\u00e7ades clad using [[pinwheel tiling]]]]\nThe architecture of the square is in the [[deconstructivist]] style, with both plan and elevations designed around slightly angular, 'cranked' geometries, rather than tradition orthogonal grids. The built forms are mainly slightly bent north\u2013south volumes, separated by glazed gaps, a reference to traditional Melbourne laneways, with vertical 'shards', attached or freestanding, containing discrete functions like the Visitor's Centre, or lifts and stairs.\n\nThe larger built volumes are relatively simple reinforced concrete buildings with glass walls, but with a second outer skin of cladding carried on heavy steel framing, folded and stepped slightly to create angular undulating surfaces. The cladding is composed of 6 different materials, zinc, perforated zinc, glass, frosted glass, sandstone and no cladding, in a camouflage-like pattern, and created using [[pinwheel tiling]]. The 'crossbar' is an east\u2013west built from that runs through the long gallery building, and is clad in perforated black steel panels.\n\nSome buildings are named. The building along Flinders Street that houses ACMI and SBS is named the Alfred Deakin Building, the building between the plaza space and the river is called the Yarra Building, while the building that houses the NGV Australia is also called the [[Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia|Ian Potter Centre]].\n\n===Shards===\n[[File:St. Paul's Cathedral View from Federation Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's Cathedral]] and the eastern shard.]]\nThree shards frame the square space. The eastern and southern shards are completely clad in metallic surfaces with angular slots, very similar in design to the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]], while the western shard is clad in glass. Adjoined to the southern shard is a hotel which features the wrap around metallic screen and glass [[louver]]s.\n\n===Laneways===\nThere are a number of unnamed laneways in the Federation Square complex which connect it to both Flinders Street and the Yarra River via stairways. The stairways between the Western Shard and nearby buildings are also paved in larger flat rectangle sandstone blocks.\n\n===Riverfront===\nThe riverfront areas extend south to an elevated pedestrian promenade which was once part of Batman Avenue and is lined with tall established trees of both deciduous exotic species and Australian eucalpyts. More recently, the vaults adjacent to the Princes Bridge have been converted into Federation Wharf, a series of cafes and boat berths. Some of the areas between the stairs and lanes leading to the river are landscaped with shady tree ferns.\n\n===Atrium===\n[[File:Federation Square Melbourne..JPG|thumb|right|Glass walls of the atrium space.]]\nThe \"[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]\" is one of the major public spaces in the precinct. It is a [[laneway]]-like space, five stories high with glazed walls and roof. The exposed metal structure and glazing patterns follow the [[pinwheel tiling]] pattern used elsewhere in the precinct's building [[facades]].<ref>''Brown-May, A and Day, N'' (2003) Federation Square, South Yarra, Vic: Hardie Grant Books ({{ISBN|1-74066-002-1}})</ref>\n\n===Labyrinth===\nThe \"labyrinth\" is a [[passive cooling]] system sandwiched above the railway lines and below the middle of the square. The [[concrete]] structure consists of 1.2&nbsp;km of interlocking, honeycombed walls. It covers 1600 m<sup>2</sup>. The walls have a corrugated profile to maximize their [[Area|surface area]], and are spaced 60&nbsp;cm apart.\n\nDuring [[summer]] nights, cold air is pumped in the combed space, cooling down the concrete, while heat absorbed during the day is pumped out. The following day, cold air is pumped from the labyrinth out into the atrium through floor vents. This process can keep the atrium up to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C cooler than outside. This is comparable to conventional [[air conditioning]], but using one-tenth the energy and producing one-tenth the [[carbon dioxide]].\n\nDuring [[winter]], the process is reversed, storing warm daytime air in the Labyrinth overnight, and pumping it back into the atrium during the day.\n\nThe system can also partly cool the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image|ACMI]] building when the power is not required by the atrium.\n\n==Facilities and tenants==\nIn addition to a number of shops, [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[caf\u00e9]]s and [[restaurant]]s, Federation Square's cultural facilities include:\n\n===Melbourne Visitor Centre===\n[[File:Flinderstreetstation.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] and the stunted glass Eastern Shard, entry to the Melbourne Visitor Centre.]]\nThe Melbourne Visitor Centre is located underground, with its entrance at the main corner shard directly opposite Flinders Street Station and St Pauls Cathedral and its exit at the opposite shard. The entrance and exit shards feature interactive news tickers in colour LEDs and small screens promoting current activities. The Visitor Centre was intended to replace a facility which was previously located at the turn of the 19th-century town hall administration buildings on Swanston Street. The Visitors Centre was demolished in December 2018 to make way for an entrance to the [[Melbourne metro]] station to be built under the Swanston Street, and the visitors centre returned to the Town Hall.\n\n===The Edge===\n[[File:Melbourne Federation Square Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|The Edge Theatre seating.]]\nThe Edge theatre is a 450-seat space designed to have views of the Yarra River and across to the spire of [[Arts Centre Melbourne|The Arts Centre]]. The theatre is lined in wood veneer in similar geometrical patterns to other interiors in the complex.  The Edge was named \"The [[BMW]] Edge\" until May 2013, when a new [[sponsorship deal]] with [[Deakin University]] caused it to be renamed \"The Deakin Edge\".\n\n===Zinc===\nZinc is a function space underneath the gallery building, and opens onto the Yarra river bank. It was intended as an entirely commercial part of the development of Federation Square, and is used for wedding receptions, corporate events, launches, and the like.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zinc at Fed Sq |url=http://zincfedsq.com.au/ |website=ZincFedSq |accessdate=26 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===National Gallery of Victoria===\n[[File:Ian Potter Centre.jpg|thumb|left|Ian Potter Centre entry.]]\nThe [[Ian Potter Centre]], also known as the NGVA, houses the Australian part of the art collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] (NGV), in the building along the eastern side. (The St Kilda Rd building now houses that International works of the NGV, and is known as the NGVI). There are over 20,000 Australian artworks, including paintings, sculpture, photography, fashion and textiles, and the collection is the oldest and most well known in the country.\n\nWell-known works at the Ian Potter Centre include [[Frederick McCubbin]]'s ''Pioneers'' (1904) and [[Tom Roberts]]' ''[[Shearing the Rams]]'' (1890). Also featured are works from [[Sidney Nolan]], [[John Perceval]], [[Margaret Preston]] and [[Fred Williams (artist)|Fred Williams]]. Indigenous art includes works by [[William Barak]] and [[Emily Kngwarreye]].\n\nThe National Gallery at Federation Square also features the NGV Kids Corner, which is an interactive education section aimed at small children and families, and the NGV Studio.\n\n=== ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image) ===\n{{main|Australian Centre for the Moving Image}}\n[[File:Australian Centre for the Moving Image.jpg|thumb|The Alfred Deakin Building houses the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.]]\nThe [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] known as ACMI has two cinemas that are equipped to play every film, video and digital video format, with attention to high-quality acoustics. The screen gallery, built along the entire length of what was previously a train station platform, is a subterranean gallery for experimentation with the moving image. Video art, installations, interactives, sound art and net art are all regularly exhibited in this space. Additional venues within ACMI allow computer-based public education, and other interactive presentations.\n\nIn 2003, ACMI commissioned SelectParks to produce an interactive game-based, [[site-specific installation]] called AcmiPark, which replicated and abstracted the real-world architecture of Federation Square. It also houses highly innovative mechanisms for interactive, multi-player sound and musical composition.\n\n===Transport Hotel Bar===\nTransport hotel and bar is a three-level hotel complex adjacent to the southern shard on the south western corner of the square. \nIt has a ground-floor public bar, restaurant and cocktail lounge on the rooftop.\n\n===SBS Radio and Television offices===\n[[File:Federation Square (SBS Building).jpg|thumb|The Alfred Deakin Building houses offices for SBS.]]\n{{main|Special Broadcasting Service}}\nThe Melbourne offices of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), one of Australia's two publicly funded national broadcasters, is in the Deakin Building on Flinders Street.\n\n===Melbourne Festival headquarters===\n{{main|Melbourne International Arts Festival}}\nThe headquarters of Melbourne Festival (formerly Melbourne International Arts Festival) are located on Level 2 of the Yarra Building.\n\n===Beer awards===\nFederation Square has recently become home to several beer award shows, and tastings, including the [[Australian International Beer Awards]] trade and public shows, as well as other similar events such as showcases of local and other Australian breweries. These events have been held in the square's [[indoor outdoor]] area the Atrium and usually require an entry fee in exchange for a set number of tastings.\n\n===Past tenants===\nPast tenants have included:\n* \"Champions\" \u2013 The Australian Racing Museum & Hall of Fame\n* National Design Centre\n\n==Reception and recognition==\n[[File:B2.2008 fedsquare.JPG|thumb|A tram on Flinders Street, with the East Shard and the ACMI building in the background.]]\nIn 2009, [[Virtual Tourist]] awarded Federation Square with the title of the 'World's Fifth-Ugliest Building'.<ref name=\"Ugliest\"/> Criticisms of it ranged from its damage to the heritage vista to its similarity to a bombed-out war-time bunker due to its \"army camouflage\" colours.

It incorporates major cultural institutions such as the [[Ian Potter Centre]], [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] (ACMI) and the [[Koorie Heritage Trust]] as well as cafes and bars in a series of buildings centred around a large paved square, and a glass walled atrium.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nMelbourne's central city grid was designed without a central public square, long seen as a missing element. From the 1920s there were proposals to roof the railway yards on the southeast corner of [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders]] and [[Swanston Street]]s for a public square, with more detailed proposals prepared in the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Federation Square, a place in history|url=https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/assets-fedsquare/uploads/2015/02/Federation-Square-History.pdf|website=Fed Square Melbourne|publisher=Federation Square Management Pty Ltd|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref> In the 1960s, the [[Melbourne City Council]] decided that the best place for the [[City Square, Melbourne|City Square]] was the corner of Swanston and [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]]s, opposite the town hall. The first temporary square opened in 1968, and a permanent version opened in 1981. It was however not considered a great success, and was redeveloped in the 1990s as a smaller simpler space in front of a new large hotel.\n\nMeanwhile, in the late 1960s, a small part of the railway lines had been partly roofed by the construction of the [[Princes Gate Towers]], known as the Gas & Fuel Buildings after their major tenant, the [[Gas and Fuel Corporation]], over the old [[Princes Bridge railway station|Princes Bridge station]]. This included a plaza on the corner, which was elevated above the street and little used. Between the plaza and Batman Avenue, which ran along the north bank of the [[Yarra River]], were the extensive [[Jolimont Yard|Jolimont Railway Yards]], and the through train lines running into Flinders Street station under Swanston Street.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&inttype=1&intid=923\n|work=The Age\n|title=Demolitions days\n|author=Fiona Whitlock\n|date=9 December 1996\n|publisher=150.theage.com.au\n|access-date=16 March 2008\n|location=Melbourne\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904013543/http://150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&inttype=1&intid=923\n|archive-date=4 September 2007\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Design competition and controversy===\nIn 1996 the [[Premier of Victoria|Premier]] [[Jeff Kennett]] announced that the Gas & Fuel Buildings would be demolished, and the railyards roofed, and a complex including arts facilities and a large public space would be built.

A series of 'shards' provided vertical accents, while interconnected laneways and stairways and the wintergarden would connect Flinders Street to the Yarra River. The open square was arranged as a gently sloping amphitheatre, focussed on a large viewing screen for public events, with a secondary sloped plaza area on the main corner. The design was widely supported by the design community but was less popular with the public. The design was also soon criticized when it was realised that the western freestanding 'shard' would block views of the south front of [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's Cathedral]] from [[Princes Bridge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe mix of occupants and tenants were soon modified, with the cinemedia centre becoming the new body known as [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image|ACMI]], offices for multicultural broadcaster [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] added, and the gallery space becoming the Australian art wing of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], which became the Ian Potter Centre. The performance arts space was dropped, the number of commercial tenancies increased, and the south end of the Atrium became an auditorium.

The open public square is directly opposite [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] and [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's Cathedral]]. The layout of the precinct is designed to connect the historical central district of the city with the Yarra River and a new park [[Birrarung Marr]].\n\n[[File:MEL federationssquare.jpg|thumb|900px|center|<center>360\u00b0 panorama</center>]]\n[[File:FederationSquare-panorama.jpg|thumb|900px|center|<center>Night view</center>]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Design features==\n\n===Square===\n[[File:Fed square tiles.jpg|thumb|left|Main square paving.]]\n\nThe complex of buildings forms a rough U-shape around the main open-air square, oriented to the west. The eastern end of the square is formed by the glazed walls of The Atrium. While [[bluestone]] is used for the majority of the paving in the Atrium and St Paul's Court, matching footpaths elsewhere in central Melbourne, the main square is paved in 470,000 [[ochre]]-coloured sandstone blocks from [[Western Australia]]<ref name=open/> and invokes images of the [[outback]]. The paving is designed as a huge urban artwork, called ''Nearamnew'', by [[Paul Carter (academic)|Paul Carter]] and gently rises above street level, containing a number of textual pieces inlaid in its undulating surface.\n\nThere are a small number of [[Landscaping|landscaped]] sections in the square and plaza which are planted with [[Eucalyptus]] trees.\n\n===Plaza and giant screen===\n[[File:RuddSorry.jpg|thumb|right|The large screen is used for public events. Pictured is a telecast of [[Kevin Rudd]]'s parliamentary apology to the [[stolen generations]].]]\nA key part of the plaza design is its large and fixed public screen, which has been used to broadcast major sporting events such as the [[AFL Grand Final]] and still{{when|date=October 2015}} continues to do so. During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], thousands of football fans assembled to watch.\n\n===Buildings===\n[[File:Federation-square-sandstone-facade.jpg|thumb|right| Building fa\u00e7ades clad using [[pinwheel tiling]]]]\nThe architecture of the square is in the [[deconstructivist]] style, with both plan and elevations designed around slightly angular, 'cranked' geometries, rather than tradition orthogonal grids. The built forms are mainly slightly bent north\u2013south volumes, separated by glazed gaps, a reference to traditional Melbourne laneways, with vertical 'shards', attached or freestanding, containing discrete functions like the Visitor's Centre, or lifts and stairs.\n\nThe larger built volumes are relatively simple reinforced concrete buildings with glass walls, but with a second outer skin of cladding carried on heavy steel framing, folded and stepped slightly to create angular undulating surfaces. The cladding is composed of 6 different materials, zinc, perforated zinc, glass, frosted glass, sandstone and no cladding, in a camouflage-like pattern, and created using [[pinwheel tiling]]. The 'crossbar' is an east\u2013west built from that runs through the long gallery building, and is clad in perforated black steel panels.\n\nSome buildings are named. The building along Flinders Street that houses ACMI and SBS is named the Alfred Deakin Building, the building between the plaza space and the river is called the Yarra Building, while the building that houses the NGV Australia is also called the [[Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia|Ian Potter Centre]].\n\n===Shards===\n[[File:St. Paul's Cathedral View from Federation Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's Cathedral]] and the eastern shard.]]\nThree shards frame the square space. The eastern and southern shards are completely clad in metallic surfaces with angular slots, very similar in design to the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]], while the western shard is clad in glass. Adjoined to the southern shard is a hotel which features the wrap around metallic screen and glass [[louver]]s.\n\n===Laneways===\nThere are a number of unnamed laneways in the Federation Square complex which connect it to both Flinders Street and the Yarra River via stairways. The stairways between the Western Shard and nearby buildings are also paved in larger flat rectangle sandstone blocks.\n\n===Riverfront===\nThe riverfront areas extend south to an elevated pedestrian promenade which was once part of Batman Avenue and is lined with tall established trees of both deciduous exotic species and Australian eucalpyts. More recently, the vaults adjacent to the Princes Bridge have been converted into Federation Wharf, a series of cafes and boat berths. Some of the areas between the stairs and lanes leading to the river are landscaped with shady tree ferns.\n\n===Atrium===\n[[File:Federation Square Melbourne..JPG|thumb|right|Glass walls of the atrium space.]]\nThe \"[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]\" is one of the major public spaces in the precinct. It is a [[laneway]]-like space, five stories high with glazed walls and roof. The exposed metal structure and glazing patterns follow the [[pinwheel tiling]] pattern used elsewhere in the precinct's building [[facades]].<ref>''Brown-May, A and Day, N'' (2003) Federation Square, South Yarra, Vic: Hardie Grant Books ({{ISBN|1-74066-002-1}})</ref>\n\n===Labyrinth===\nThe \"labyrinth\" is a [[passive cooling]] system sandwiched above the railway lines and below the middle of the square. The [[concrete]] structure consists of 1.2&nbsp;km of interlocking, honeycombed walls. It covers 1600 m<sup>2</sup>. The walls have a corrugated profile to maximize their [[Area|surface area]], and are spaced 60&nbsp;cm apart.\n\nDuring [[summer]] nights, cold air is pumped in the combed space, cooling down the concrete, while heat absorbed during the day is pumped out. The following day, cold air is pumped from the labyrinth out into the atrium through floor vents. This process can keep the atrium up to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C cooler than outside. This is comparable to conventional [[air conditioning]], but using one-tenth the energy and producing one-tenth the [[carbon dioxide]].\n\nDuring [[winter]], the process is reversed, storing warm daytime air in the Labyrinth overnight, and pumping it back into the atrium during the day.\n\nThe system can also partly cool the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image|ACMI]] building when the power is not required by the atrium.\n\n==Facilities and tenants==\nIn addition to a number of shops, [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[caf\u00e9]]s and [[restaurant]]s, Federation Square's cultural facilities include:\n\n===Melbourne Visitor Centre===\n[[File:Flinderstreetstation.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] and the stunted glass Eastern Shard, entry to the Melbourne Visitor Centre.]]\nThe Melbourne Visitor Centre is located underground, with its entrance at the main corner shard directly opposite Flinders Street Station and St Pauls Cathedral and its exit at the opposite shard. The entrance and exit shards feature interactive news tickers in colour LEDs and small screens promoting current activities. The Visitor Centre was intended to replace a facility which was previously located at the turn of the 19th-century town hall administration buildings on Swanston Street. The Visitors Centre was demolished in December 2018 to make way for an entrance to the [[Melbourne metro]] station to be built under the Swanston Street, and the visitors centre returned to the Town Hall.\n\n===The Edge===\n[[File:Melbourne Federation Square Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|The Edge Theatre seating.]]\nThe Edge theatre is a 450-seat space designed to have views of the Yarra River and across to the spire of [[Arts Centre Melbourne|The Arts Centre]]. The theatre is lined in wood veneer in similar geometrical patterns to other interiors in the complex.  The Edge was named \"The [[BMW]] Edge\" until May 2013, when a new [[sponsorship deal]] with [[Deakin University]] caused it to be renamed \"The Deakin Edge\".\n\n===Zinc===\nZinc is a function space underneath the gallery building, and opens onto the Yarra river bank. It was intended as an entirely commercial part of the development of Federation Square, and is used for wedding receptions, corporate events, launches, and the like.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zinc at Fed Sq |url=http://zincfedsq.com.au/ |website=ZincFedSq |accessdate=26 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===National Gallery of Victoria===\n[[File:Ian Potter Centre.jpg|thumb|left|Ian Potter Centre entry.]]\nThe [[Ian Potter Centre]], also known as the NGVA, houses the Australian part of the art collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] (NGV), in the building along the eastern side. (The St Kilda Rd building now houses that International works of the NGV, and is known as the NGVI). There are over 20,000 Australian artworks, including paintings, sculpture, photography, fashion and textiles, and the collection is the oldest and most well known in the country.\n\nWell-known works at the Ian Potter Centre include [[Frederick McCubbin]]'s ''Pioneers'' (1904) and [[Tom Roberts]]' ''[[Shearing the Rams]]'' (1890). Also featured are works from [[Sidney Nolan]], [[John Perceval]], [[Margaret Preston]] and [[Fred Williams (artist)|Fred Williams]]. Indigenous art includes works by [[William Barak]] and [[Emily Kngwarreye]].\n\nThe National Gallery at Federation Square also features the NGV Kids Corner, which is an interactive education section aimed at small children and families, and the NGV Studio.\n\n=== ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image) ===\n{{main|Australian Centre for the Moving Image}}\n[[File:Australian Centre for the Moving Image.jpg|thumb|The Alfred Deakin Building houses the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.]]\nThe [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] known as ACMI has two cinemas that are equipped to play every film, video and digital video format, with attention to high-quality acoustics. The screen gallery, built along the entire length of what was previously a train station platform, is a subterranean gallery for experimentation with the moving image. Video art, installations, interactives, sound art and net art are all regularly exhibited in this space. Additional venues within ACMI allow computer-based public education, and other interactive presentations.\n\nIn 2003, ACMI commissioned SelectParks to produce an interactive game-based, [[site-specific installation]] called AcmiPark, which replicated and abstracted the real-world architecture of Federation Square. It also houses highly innovative mechanisms for interactive, multi-player sound and musical composition.\n\n===Transport Hotel Bar===\nTransport hotel and bar is a three-level hotel complex adjacent to the southern shard on the south western corner of the square. \nIt has a ground-floor public bar, restaurant and cocktail lounge on the rooftop.\n\n===SBS Radio and Television offices===\n[[File:Federation Square (SBS Building).jpg|thumb|The Alfred Deakin Building houses offices for SBS.]]\n{{main|Special Broadcasting Service}}\nThe Melbourne offices of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), one of Australia's two publicly funded national broadcasters, is in the Deakin Building on Flinders Street.\n\n===Melbourne Festival headquarters===\n{{main|Melbourne International Arts Festival}}\nThe headquarters of Melbourne Festival (formerly Melbourne International Arts Festival) are located on Level 2 of the Yarra Building.\n\n===Beer awards===\nFederation Square has recently become home to several beer award shows, and tastings, including the [[Australian International Beer Awards]] trade and public shows, as well as other similar events such as showcases of local and other Australian breweries. These events have been held in the square's [[indoor outdoor]] area the Atrium and usually require an entry fee in exchange for a set number of tastings.\n\n===Past tenants===\nPast tenants have included:\n* \"Champions\" \u2013 The Australian Racing Museum & Hall of Fame\n* National Design Centre\n\n==Reception and recognition==\n[[File:B2.2008 fedsquare.JPG|thumb|A tram on Flinders Street, with the East Shard and the ACMI building in the background.]]\nIn 2009, [[Virtual Tourist]] awarded Federation Square with the title of the 'World's Fifth-Ugliest Building'.<ref name=\"Ugliest\"/> Criticisms of it ranged from its damage to the heritage vista to its similarity to a bombed-out war-time bunker due to its \"army camouflage\" colours.

At her second school, [[Heathfield School, Ascot]], Agar's teacher [[Lucy Kemp-Welch]] encouraged her to continue to develop her art. In 1914 at the onset of World War I Agar was sent away to Tudor Hall from her home in London to avoid the hardships of war. In Kent the music master Horace Kesteven began introducing her to various artists. Through Kesteven, Agar met [[Charles Sims (painter)|Charles Sims]] who exposed her to some of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]]'s early works. Agar describes her time with Sims as \"I found myself in a milieu of art where art was a valued part of daily life\". \n\nBefore the war ended, Agar attended the Demoiselles Ozanne to improve her French and while she was there she took weekly oil painting lessons at the [[Byam Shaw School of Art]] in Kensington. Agar found the Byam Shaw too academic and pleaded with her family to allow her to look elsewhere to continue her schooling. This infuriated her mother and after an argument with her parents Agar notes in her diary that she got up early, ate lunch with her sisters, and packed her bags and departed from Paddington Station. She left a note for her parents stating that she was on her way to Truro and St Mawes where she would stay with a family friend the De Kays.\n\nThen, from 1920\u20131, she studied under [[Leon Underwood]] at his school at [[Brook Green]]. There she made friends with [[Blair Hughes-Stanton]] and [[Gertrude Hermes]], amongst others. She studied part-time under the legendary [[Henry Tonks]] at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] in London from 1921 to 1924, alongside [[Rex Whistler]] and [[Cecil Beaton]], and her first husband \u2013 Robin Bartlett.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eileen Agar, 1899\u20131991|last=Simpson, Ann.|date=1999|publisher=NGS|others=Gascoyne, David, 1916\u20132001., Lambirth, Andrew, 1959\u2013, National Galleries of Scotland., Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.|isbn=1903278007|location=Edinburgh|oclc=43338591}}</ref> With him and others, Agar travelled around France and Spain.

In the period 1928\u201330, Agar studied with the Czech [[Cubism|cubist]], [[:cs:Franti\u0161ek_Folt\u00fdn|Franti\u0161ek Folt\u00fdn]]. With Pound, Agar visited [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]'s studio.\n\nIn 1930, Agar returned to England, and painted her first surrealist piece, ''The Flying Pillar,'' based on Andr\u00e9 Breton's surrealist manifesto. Agar describes her piece in her memoir as \"her first attempt at an imaginative approach to painting and although the result was surreal, it was not done with that intention\". Agar said that \"Surrealism was in the air in France and poets in France, later in England, were kissing that sleeping beauty troubled by nightmares, and it was the kiss of life that they gave\". ''The Flying Pillar'' was later renamed the ''Three Symbols,'' and is described by Agar as a reference both to Greek art and to [[Gustave Eiffel]] and his famous tower, the symbol of modernity. The painting represented the classical world merging with the modern at a crossroads in time. She describes the various images in her painting in her 1928 diary entry as Greece being the meeting place of Judaeo-Egyptian and Greco-Christian followed by the words \"'the Judaeo-Graeco pillar' as if it were a note to bear in mind and to later be developed\". \n\nIn 1931, the first of four issues of ''The Island'' was published, edited by Leon Underwood and Joseph Bard. Agar contributed to all four issues.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eileen Agar, 1899\u20131991|last=Simpson, Ann.|date=1999|publisher=NGS|others=Gascoyne, David, 1916\u20132001., Lambirth, Andrew, 1959\u2013, National Galleries of Scotland., Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.|isbn=1903278007|location=Edinburgh|oclc=43338591}}</ref> Two years later she had her first solo show at the Bloomsbury Gallery. She was a member of the [[London Group]] from 1934 onwards - in the same year, she made her first collage.\n\nIn 1934, Agar and Bard took a house for the summer at [[Swanage]], Dorset. Here she met [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and the two began an intense artistic and sexual relationship. In 1935 Nash introduced Agar to the concept of the ''found object.'' Together, they collaborated on a number of works, such as ''Seashore Monster at Swanage''. Nash recommended her work to [[Roland Penrose]] and [[Herbert Read]], the organisers of the 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] at the [[New Burlington Galleries]], despite Agar's denial of the moniker of Surrealist throughout her life. She was one of only a very few women included in the exhibition. Agar exhibited with the Surrealists in England and abroad. During the 1930s Agar's work focused on natural objects often in a light-hearted manner such as ''Bum-Thumb Rock'', a set of photographs of an unusual rock formation she noticed in Brittany. She started to experiment with automatic techniques and new materials, taking photographs and making collages and objects. ''The Angel of Anarchy'', a plaster head covered in fabric and other media, is such an example from 1936\u201340 and is now in the [[Tate]] collection. She created two versions of ''The Angel of Anarchy'' after her first Angel of Anarchy was lost on its way back from a show in Amsterdam. She made her second version in 1940 using the same cast of Joseph Bard's head and kept the original title ''The Angel of Anarchy''. The bust was divided into two parts, one with white fur and one with black fur, with most of the head covered in green osprey and ostrich feathers and dollies that she received from her mother who used to wear them as a head dress.\n\nIn 1937, \u00c9luard visited Agar and Bard in London, travelled down to Cornwall with [[Nusch|Nusch \u00c9luard]], [[Roland Penrose]] and [[Lee Miller]], and begun an affair with [[Paul \u00c9luard]]. She visited [[Picasso]] and [[Dora Maar]]'s home in Mougins, Alpes-Maritimes, along with Lee Miller, who photographed her. By 1940, works by Agar had appeared in surrealist exhibitions in Amsterdam, New York, Paris and Tokyo. \"The war interrupted her artistic activity, and she only began to paint again in 1946 and exhibited fairly regularly from then on until her death.\"\n\nAfter World War Two, Agar started a new productive phase of her life, holding almost 16 solo exhibitions between 1946 and 1985. By the 1960s she was producing [[Tachisme|Tachist]] paintings with Surrealist elements. In 1988 she published her autobiography ''A Look At My Life.'' then in 1990, she was elected as a Royal Academy Associate. She died in London. Agar has paintings in the collection of several British institutions including Tate, [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery|Derby Art Gallery]], Bradford and the UK Government collection.\n\nEileen Agar is buried in the Pere Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

Later author's notes claimed that someone hacked into Gilesbie's account and wrote chapters 39 and 40.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nThe true identity of the author became subject to wide speculation, and since the publication of the final chapter, various individuals have claimed to have written the work in jest or as a hoax.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Due to its \"systematically terrible\" quality, the work is often believed to be a [[satire]] or [[parody]] of fan fiction.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nAt the same time, the \"exceedingly complicated\" details of the work, including a series of related online accounts outside of FanFiction.net and the effort of writing a work of such length, led to a \"consensus\" among users of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] \u2014 a website notorious for online trolling and dedicated to cataloging \"internet culture\" \u2014 that it would be too difficult to fake and that Gilesbie was writing sincerely, a sentiment apparently shared by other online communities who mocked the author.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> [[Brad Kim]], editor of [[Know Your Meme]], supported the work as genuine, citing his experiences with writing workshops on [[LiveJournal]] and [[Xanga]] where he encountered similar works, as \"these were the kinds of things that would be formulated by a high-school teenager in the early 2000s\".<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Writing for [[Vulture.com]], Abraham Riesman wrote that \"[t]he mystery of the authorship of 'My Immortal' \u2014 even in this privacy-averse age \u2014 appears unsolvable.\"<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nA series of videos were uploaded to a [[YouTube]] account named ''xXblo0dyxkissxX'' in 2008 and 2009, with their most recent video being uploaded in 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJWq0j9vfGc|title=Guess Who's Back?|date=15 January 2016}}</ref> in which two [[goth (subculture)|goths]] named Tara and Raven discuss their lives.

The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice. In early August 2017, Christo posted an update to a previously unknown FictionPress account seemingly related to Tara Gilesbie that similarly received little attention.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/13/16275802/who-wrote-my-immortal-tara-rose-christo|title=My Immortal: solving the mystery of the internet's most beloved \u2014 and notorious \u2014 fanfic|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=September 13, 2017|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater in August, an [[Self-publishing|independently published]] ''[[Handbook for Mortals]]'' came to public attention after it was discovered that its sales were artificially inflated to push it to the top of the young adult [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], from which it was subsequently removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html|title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list?|work=LA Times|author=Jessica Roy|date=August 24, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Italie>{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}</ref> Writing similarities between the novel and ''My Immortal'' led to speculation that ''Handbook for Mortals'' author [[Lani Sarem]] was the author of ''My Immortal''.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

It connects with [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] at its southwestern terminus, {{ttcs|Kennedy}}, and terminates in the northeast at {{ttcs|McCowan}}.\n\nRather than the larger [[Passenger car (rail)|subway trains]] used by the other lines in the system, the rolling stock of Line 3 consists of smaller, fully automated, [[medium-capacity rail system|medium-capacity]] trains, designated by the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC) as the [[S series (Toronto subway)|S series]], which are [[Bombardier Innovia Metro|Intermediate Capacity Transit System]] (ICTS) Mark I trains built by the [[Urban Transportation Development Corporation]] (UTDC). The trains are powered by [[linear induction motor]]s, operating on {{Track gauge|sg|allk=on}} tracks, unlike the city's subway lines and the [[Toronto streetcar system]], which use the unique {{Track gauge|Toronto|first=met|allk=on}}.\n\nThe line has remained unchanged since its opening in 1985 and contains two of the least used stations in the system.

In September 2013, the [[Government of Ontario]], under Premier [[Kathleen Wynne]] of the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], announced it would fund the extension of Line 2 to [[Scarborough City Centre]] along a new alignment, which will result in the eventual closure of Line 3.<ref name=\"Subway deal\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/scarborough-subway-will-be-built-with-shortened-route-ontario-to-announce/article14104101/ |title=Scarborough subway to be built with shortened route, Ontario announces |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=September 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/10/08/scarborough_subway_confirmed_by_toronto_council.html |title=Scarborough subway confirmed by Toronto council |work=Toronto Star}}</ref> In April 2019, Premier [[Doug Ford]] of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative Party]] committed $5.5{{nbsp}}billion from the provincial government to complete what the TTC is calling the \"Line 2 East Extension\" by 2030.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2019/04/premier-ford-unveils-transportation-vision.html|title=Premier Ford Unveils Transportation Vision|website=news.ontario.ca|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref><ref name=\"Line 2 East Extension\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Projects/Scarborough_Subway_P/index.jsp|title=Line 2 East Extension|website=www.ttc.ca|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>{{clarify|date=August 2019|reason=what is the Line 2 East Extension\" and how does it impact Line 3?}}\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2018|}}\n[[Image:Scarborough RT logo.svg|thumb|left|The original Scarborough RT logo (1985\u20132015)]]\n[[Image:Kennedylowlevel.jpg|thumb|The original streetcar platform can be seen at Kennedy station.

However, [[Krauss-Maffei]] was forced to abandon development when the [[West Germany|West German]] federal government declined further funding.<ref>{{cite news |title=GO-Urban's bright future fades suddenly |work=Toronto Star |date=November 14, 1974}}</ref> GO-Urban then used some of the technologies from the Transurban to develop a simpler steel-wheeled version, the [[Bombardier Innovia Metro|ICTS system]].\n\nDuring this period, the TTC had been working on plans to extend its own network with a series of [[Tram|streetcar]] systems using a new and greatly enlarged streetcar design, the [[Canadian Light Rail Vehicle]] (CLRV). The Ontario government, in charge of the GO network, was looking for a test site for the ICTS system and demanded that the TTC use it for one of their planned streetcar projects, selecting the Scarborough extension. The TTC initially refused to make the change, arguing it was both the wrong solution and that since the construction of the line had already commenced this would be a waste of money. However, as the Ontario government was providing 75% of the funding for the line, they changed their minds when the government threatened to cut the funding.\n\nAt [[Kennedy station]], there are clues revealing that it was originally built for streetcar operation; it is possible to see old low-level streetcar platforms protruding under the current high-level platforms, and the loop to turn streetcars proved too sharp for safe operation of the ICTS cars, which did not have a reason to turn around, so the loop was replaced by a [[Spanish solution]]-like crossover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Toronto's Subway and the Scarborough RT \u2013 Transit Toronto \u2013 Content |website=Transit Toronto}}</ref> Ontario wanted to develop and promote its new technology, which had been designed for a proposed urban [[GO Transit]] service known as [[GO-ALRT]]. Changes to federal railway regulations had made the new system unnecessary for GO, so the government hoped to sell it to other transit services in order to recoup its investment.\n\n[[Image:TTC_UTDC_ICTS_Mark_I_3012.jpg|thumb|left|An [[S series (Toronto subway)|S-series]] train in its original (1985\u20132015) livery]]\nThe Scarborough line opened in March 1985 as the Scarborough RT. Three years after it opened, the TTC renovated its southwestern terminus at Kennedy station, because the looped turnaround track, designed for uni-directional streetcars under the earlier plan and not needed for the bi-directional ICTS trains, was causing derailments; it was replaced with a single terminal track and the station was thus quasi-Spanish solution, with one side for boarding and another side for alighting, though the boarding side is also used for alighting during off-peak hours and weekends.\n\nFrom when the line opened in 1985 until 2015, it was known as the \"Scarborough RT\" or \"SRT\". The \"RT\" in Scarborough RT stood for \"rapid transit\". Locals have often referred to the line as ''SRT'' or ''the RT'' for short.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ttc.ca/Subway/index.jsp|title=TTC Subway|website=www.ttc.ca}}</ref> The name Scarborough Line is used on the official TTC website and 2014 TTC Ride Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ttc.ca/PDF/Maps/SubwayRT_Map_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120055/http://ttc.ca/PDF/Maps/SubwayRT_Map_2014.pdf |archivedate=August 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>http://ttc.ca/Subway/index.jsp</ref> In October 2013, the TTC announced plans to give the lines official numbers to help riders and visitors to navigate the system.

The business proposal initially bore little fruit\u2014a proposed pilot project in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] was cancelled after meeting widespread public opposition, and the only other transit systems to use the technology, named the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS), at the time were [[Vancouver]]'s [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] and the [[Detroit People Mover|People Mover]] in [[Detroit]]. After Bombardier took over UTDC, it redesigned the technology with newer, longer cars, used to expand the SkyTrain network and also for new installations across the world. ICTS was rebranded as \"Advanced Rapid Transit\" (ART) and became a success for the company. Later, the technology was again rebranded, this time as [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]].\n\nOne unusual feature of the ICTS cars is that they are driven by [[linear motor|linear induction motors]]: instead of using [[electric motor|conventional motors]] to turn the wheels, they push themselves along the route using alternating flat [[magnet]]s reacting with the distinctive di-magnetic [[Aluminium|aluminum]] metal plate that runs down the centre of the tracks. This system requires very few moving parts and therefore leads to lower maintenance costs. When the car motors are accelerating, they actually lift the car off the track an extremely small distance, repelling against the aluminum plate.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0_XvdbL620C&pg=PA13&dq=Linear+repulsion+motors#v=onepage&q=Linear%20repulsion%20motors&f=false |title=Linear motion electromagnetic devices |first1=Ion |last1=Boldea |first2=S.

Fourth Rail was chosen to eliminate stray current problems and is common on modern systems globally --> Instead of using the conventional method, in which motive power is supplied by a single [[third rail]], with return current travelling through the running rails, a separate positive and negative power rail are provided on one side of the track. With respect to the accelerating trucks and the micro-lifting, the truck wheels have a somewhat larger flange than normal in order to keep the car inline on the track during the micro-lifting.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}} The linear induction motors also allow the cars to climb steeper grades than would be possible with traditional subway technology since wheel slip is not an issue.\n\nThe trains are also able to be operated exclusively by computers, becoming one of the earliest installations of [[Standard Elektrik Lorenz]]'s \"[[SelTrac]] IS\" system (now owned and delivered by [[Thales Rail Signalling Solutions]]), doing away with the need for a human operator. However, due to opposition from the transit [[Trade union|workers' union]] and public perception, [[Railroad engineer|operators]] were retained; the union has firmly opposed driverless trains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gttavisions.blogspot.com/2006/11/ttc-eyes-driverless-subway-toronto-star.html |title=TTC eyes driverless subway |work=[[Toronto Star]] |first=David |last=Bruser |date=November 17, 2006 |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref> (Other systems took full advantage of the automated operation and Vancouver's SkyTrain has been automated since 1985 with no mishaps.)

([[Line 4 Sheppard]], however, has used a single operator only since October 2016.) In practice, the Scarborough line trains [[Automatic train operation|drive themselves]]; the operator monitors their operations and controls the doors. One feature, which was not implemented at the time of Scarborough line's opening, is the automated next stop announcement system, which was introduced in January 2008 (which means operators are no longer required to call out stops manually) and uses the voice-over of Susan Bigioni, a TTC employee, identical to those used on the [[T series (Toronto subway)|T1 series]] and the retired H4, H5, and H6 trains.\n\n==Track<span id=\"Track\"></span>==\n<!--Linked to from [[Railway electrification system#Five rail system]]-->\nLine 3 uses 5-rail track, which a TTC document describes as follows: \n{{quote|Track is the [[5 rail system]] on direct fixation and car is powered by an induction or \"[[reaction rail]]\" situated between the running rails at the same top of rail elevation.

The Scarborough line's ICTS trains have their own small yard east of McCowan station. This yard is large enough to store the existing fleet, but would have to be expanded or replaced if the TTC were to expand the line's capacity with new trains. Basic maintenance is performed in this yard; for more extensive work the cars are taken to the subway's [[Greenwood Yard]] by truck, given the train's different track gauge. The north\u2013south section of the route, where it follows the Stouffville line tracks, is at ground level; the shorter east\u2013west section (except for the ground-level yard) is elevated, as is the Kennedy terminus. The line dives briefly underground just north of [[Ellesmere station]] to cross under the Stouffville line tracks. After that, it is elevated towards McCowan station. Two stations, Kennedy and Scarborough Centre, are wheelchair accessible as those two are the busiest stations of Line 3.\n\nFrom 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., when the Scarborough line is not operating, the 302 Kingston Rd-McCowan [[Blue Night Network|Blue Night]] bus serves the same area. The 302 originates at [[Bingham Loop]], where it connects with the 322 Coxwell bus that travels to the west, as well as the 324 Victoria Park, that runs north. From the loop, the 302 travels east along Kingston Road to Brimley, then north along Brimley to Danforth Road, then north on McCowan Road to Steeles. With the exception of [[McCowan station]], it does not pass near any of the rapid transit stations, though other [[night service (public transport)|night bus services]] pass near stations. Bus service is extended on Sundays because the rapid transit lines start at 8&nbsp;a.m. (beginning January 3, 2016) instead of the usual 6&nbsp;a.m. start.

Under the Murray plan, there would be only two stations and there would be no direct connection with the Sheppard LRT.

City Council based its decision to choose a subway extension over an LRT conversion based on the higher number.\n\nIn June 2016, city planning staff proposed to eliminate two of the three stops along the planned Scarborough Subway Extension terminating [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] at Scarborough Town Centre in order to free up funding for a proposed [[Line 5 Eglinton#Crosstown East|Crosstown East LRT line]].

Plans to revitalize and expand it\u2014whether to convert the line to use modern light rail vehicles or to close the line and extend Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth further into Scarborough\u2014have been debated for over a decade by the [[municipal government of Toronto]].

This image also clearly shows the [[Fourth rail|pusher plate]] for the linear motor between the rails, and the two inductive communications wires on either side of the plate.]]\nIn 1972, the provincial government announced the [[GO-Urban]] plan to build an intermediate capacity transit system across suburban Toronto using the experimental [[Krauss-Maffei Transurban]]. However, [[Krauss-Maffei]] was forced to abandon development when the [[West Germany|West German]] federal government declined further funding.<ref>{{cite news |title=GO-Urban's bright future fades suddenly |work=Toronto Star |date=November 14, 1974}}</ref> GO-Urban then used some of the technologies from the Transurban to develop a simpler steel-wheeled version, the [[Bombardier Innovia Metro|ICTS system]].\n\nDuring this period, the TTC had been working on plans to extend its own network with a series of [[Tram|streetcar]] systems using a new and greatly enlarged streetcar design, the [[Canadian Light Rail Vehicle]] (CLRV). The Ontario government, in charge of the GO network, was looking for a test site for the ICTS system and demanded that the TTC use it for one of their planned streetcar projects, selecting the Scarborough extension. The TTC initially refused to make the change, arguing it was both the wrong solution and that since the construction of the line had already commenced this would be a waste of money. However, as the Ontario government was providing 75% of the funding for the line, they changed their minds when the government threatened to cut the funding.\n\nAt [[Kennedy station]], there are clues revealing that it was originally built for streetcar operation; it is possible to see old low-level streetcar platforms protruding under the current high-level platforms, and the loop to turn streetcars proved too sharp for safe operation of the ICTS cars, which did not have a reason to turn around, so the loop was replaced by a [[Spanish solution]]-like crossover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Toronto's Subway and the Scarborough RT \u2013 Transit Toronto \u2013 Content |website=Transit Toronto}}</ref> Ontario wanted to develop and promote its new technology, which had been designed for a proposed urban [[GO Transit]] service known as [[GO-ALRT]]. Changes to federal railway regulations had made the new system unnecessary for GO, so the government hoped to sell it to other transit services in order to recoup its investment.\n\n[[Image:TTC_UTDC_ICTS_Mark_I_3012.jpg|thumb|left|An [[S series (Toronto subway)|S-series]] train in its original (1985\u20132015) livery]]\nThe Scarborough line opened in March 1985 as the Scarborough RT. Three years after it opened, the TTC renovated its southwestern terminus at Kennedy station, because the looped turnaround track, designed for uni-directional streetcars under the earlier plan and not needed for the bi-directional ICTS trains, was causing derailments; it was replaced with a single terminal track and the station was thus quasi-Spanish solution, with one side for boarding and another side for alighting, though the boarding side is also used for alighting during off-peak hours and weekends.\n\nFrom when the line opened in 1985 until 2015, it was known as the \"Scarborough RT\" or \"SRT\". The \"RT\" in Scarborough RT stood for \"rapid transit\".

The business proposal initially bore little fruit\u2014a proposed pilot project in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] was cancelled after meeting widespread public opposition, and the only other transit systems to use the technology, named the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS), at the time were [[Vancouver]]'s [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] and the [[Detroit People Mover|People Mover]] in [[Detroit]]. After Bombardier took over UTDC, it redesigned the technology with newer, longer cars, used to expand the SkyTrain network and also for new installations across the world. ICTS was rebranded as \"Advanced Rapid Transit\" (ART) and became a success for the company. Later, the technology was again rebranded, this time as [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]].\n\nOne unusual feature of the ICTS cars is that they are driven by [[linear motor|linear induction motors]]: instead of using [[electric motor|conventional motors]] to turn the wheels, they push themselves along the route using alternating flat [[magnet]]s reacting with the distinctive di-magnetic [[Aluminium|aluminum]] metal plate that runs down the centre of the tracks. This system requires very few moving parts and therefore leads to lower maintenance costs. When the car motors are accelerating, they actually lift the car off the track an extremely small distance, repelling against the aluminum plate.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0_XvdbL620C&pg=PA13&dq=Linear+repulsion+motors#v=onepage&q=Linear%20repulsion%20motors&f=false |title=Linear motion electromagnetic devices |first1=Ion |last1=Boldea |first2=S.

Fourth Rail was chosen to eliminate stray current problems and is common on modern systems globally --> Instead of using the conventional method, in which motive power is supplied by a single [[third rail]], with return current travelling through the running rails, a separate positive and negative power rail are provided on one side of the track. With respect to the accelerating trucks and the micro-lifting, the truck wheels have a somewhat larger flange than normal in order to keep the car inline on the track during the micro-lifting.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}} The linear induction motors also allow the cars to climb steeper grades than would be possible with traditional subway technology since wheel slip is not an issue.\n\nThe trains are also able to be operated exclusively by computers, becoming one of the earliest installations of [[Standard Elektrik Lorenz]]'s \"[[SelTrac]] IS\" system (now owned and delivered by [[Thales Rail Signalling Solutions]]), doing away with the need for a human operator. However, due to opposition from the transit [[Trade union|workers' union]] and public perception, [[Railroad engineer|operators]] were retained; the union has firmly opposed driverless trains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gttavisions.blogspot.com/2006/11/ttc-eyes-driverless-subway-toronto-star.html |title=TTC eyes driverless subway |work=[[Toronto Star]] |first=David |last=Bruser |date=November 17, 2006 |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref> (Other systems took full advantage of the automated operation and Vancouver's SkyTrain has been automated since 1985 with no mishaps.) The Scarborough line trains have only [[One-man operation|one operator]], unlike most of the other TTC subway lines, which carry both a guard at the rear, who operates the train's doors, and an operator, who drives the train from the front. ([[Line 4 Sheppard]], however, has used a single operator only since October 2016.) In practice, the Scarborough line trains [[Automatic train operation|drive themselves]]; the operator monitors their operations and controls the doors. One feature, which was not implemented at the time of Scarborough line's opening, is the automated next stop announcement system, which was introduced in January 2008 (which means operators are no longer required to call out stops manually) and uses the voice-over of Susan Bigioni, a TTC employee, identical to those used on the [[T series (Toronto subway)|T1 series]] and the retired H4, H5, and H6 trains.\n\n==Track<span id=\"Track\"></span>==\n<!--Linked to from [[Railway electrification system#Five rail system]]-->\nLine 3 uses 5-rail track, which a TTC document describes as follows: \n{{quote|Track is the [[5 rail system]] on direct fixation and car is powered by an induction or \"[[reaction rail]]\" situated between the running rails at the same top of rail elevation.

The Scarborough line's ICTS trains have their own small yard east of McCowan station. This yard is large enough to store the existing fleet, but would have to be expanded or replaced if the TTC were to expand the line's capacity with new trains. Basic maintenance is performed in this yard; for more extensive work the cars are taken to the subway's [[Greenwood Yard]] by truck, given the train's different track gauge. The north\u2013south section of the route, where it follows the Stouffville line tracks, is at ground level; the shorter east\u2013west section (except for the ground-level yard) is elevated, as is the Kennedy terminus. The line dives briefly underground just north of [[Ellesmere station]] to cross under the Stouffville line tracks. After that, it is elevated towards McCowan station. Two stations, Kennedy and Scarborough Centre, are wheelchair accessible as those two are the busiest stations of Line 3.\n\nFrom 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., when the Scarborough line is not operating, the 302 Kingston Rd-McCowan [[Blue Night Network|Blue Night]] bus serves the same area. The 302 originates at [[Bingham Loop]], where it connects with the 322 Coxwell bus that travels to the west, as well as the 324 Victoria Park, that runs north. From the loop, the 302 travels east along Kingston to Brimley, then north along Brimley to Danforth Road, then north on McCowan Road to Steeles. With the exception of [[McCowan station]], it does not pass near any of the rapid transit stations, though other [[night service (public transport)|night bus services]] pass near stations. Bus service is extended on Sundays because the rapid transit lines start at 8&nbsp;a.m. (beginning January 3, 2016) instead of the usual 6&nbsp;a.m. start. Service frequency is 30 minutes.\n\nThe frequency for this line is 4\u20135 minutes during peak periods and 5\u20136 minutes during off-peak periods.\n\n==Future==\n{{Line 3 Extension}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Scarborough LRT Subway Map Options.jpg|thumb|right|The different options considered for the proposed Scarborough line extension.

After many proposals and various initial funding commitments, the [[Toronto City Council]] approved plans in 2016 for the \"Line 2 East Extension\" (L2EE) and the eventual closure of Line 3. The extension of [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] will proceed east from Line 2's current terminus at [[Kennedy station|Kennedy Station]] along Eglinton Avenue East before turning north along Danforth Road and McCowan Road, terminating at a newly constructed Scarborough Centre subway and bus station.<ref name=\"Line 2 East Extension\"/> In April 2019, the City Council announced that the project will cost nearly $3.9{{Nbsp}}billion and will be completed by 2027, while in that same month the provincial government committed $5.5{{Nbsp}}billion for the project as part of a wider package of funding for transit expansion in the Toronto metropolitan area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2019/04/premier-ford-unveils-transportation-vision.html|title=Premier Ford Unveils Transportation Vision|website=news.ontario.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed expansion===\nIn 2006, a study was completed on the prospects of the Scarborough line.<ref name=\"2006SRT\">{{cite web |url=http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2006/Aug_30_2006/Other/Scarborough_Rt_Strat.pdf |title=Scarborough RT Strategic Plan |accessdate=March 9, 2012 |date=August 30, 2006 |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name=\"2006Strategic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/pdf/scarborough_rt_strategic_plan_study_report.pdf |accessdate=August 5, 2013 |date=August 2006 |title=Scarborough RT Strategic Plan \u2013 Study Report \u2013 Final Report \u2013 August 2006 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625121344/http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/pdf/scarborough_rt_strategic_plan_study_report.pdf |archivedate=June 25, 2008}}</ref> It recommended upgrading the line to handle larger [[Bombardier Innovia Metro|ART]] Mark II vehicles, at a cost of $190{{nbsp}}million (in 2006 dollars) with an eight-month service suspension for the upgrade and to purchase $170{{nbsp}}million of new rolling stock.<ref name=\"TTC-2006-09-20\" /> Rebuilding the curve in the tunnel north of Ellesmere station would have been required to accommodate Mark II cars.

The existing line would have closed after the [[2015 Pan American Games]] and be completed in 2020.

''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that Scarborough councillors had argued that providing Scarborough residents with light rail, not heavy rail, treated them as \"second class citizens\".\n\nTwo competing subway plans were proposed to replace the Scarborough line. TTC Chair [[Karen Stintz]] proposed to extend the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line to the east before turning north with three new stations at Lawrence Avenue and McCowan Road (primarily to serve the [[Scarborough Health Network|Scarborough Hospital's]] General Campus), at [[Scarborough Town Centre]] and then at Sheppard Avenue East and McCowan Road, where it would connect to the [[Sheppard East LRT]]. Transportation Minister [[Glen Murray (politician)|Glen Murray]] made an alternative proposal to extend Line 2 along the route of the current Scarborough line but terminating at Scarborough Town Centre. Under the Murray plan, there would be only two stations and there would be no direct connection with the Sheppard LRT. The Murray plan would have required the relocation of Kennedy station as a new northbound curve from the existing Kennedy station would have been too tight for subway trains. The Murray plan would also have required the complete shutdown of the line during construction, something that the Stintz plan avoided.<ref name=\"Subway deal\" />\n\nOn October 8, 2013, Toronto City Council voted 24\u201320 to replace the Scarborough line with a three-station extension of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line.
