It serves light rail, intercity rail, intercity bus, and local bus services.\n\nIt is the eastern terminus for the [[METRO Green Line]] light rail line, with the stop located outside the station's [[headhouse]]. It is also the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]]' stop for [[Amtrak]], the national intercity railroad service. In addition to rail, Union Depot also serves [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]], [[Minnesota Valley Transit Authority|MVTA]], [[Jefferson Lines]], [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], and [[Megabus (North America)|MegaBus]].\n\nThe headhouse, located at the 4th Street entrance, was designed by architect [[Charles Sumner Frost]] and is [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] in style. The [[concourse]] and the waiting room that extend over the tracks are viewed as a great architectural achievements. The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974. It is also a [[contributing property]] to the [[Lowertown Historic District (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Lowertown Historic District]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lowertown Historic District|url=http://nrhp.mnhs.org/DistrictProperties.cfm?NPSNum=83000935|work=Minnesota National Register Properties Database|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]|year=2009|accessdate=January 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to its transit uses, Union Depot also contains a [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]] rental car location, coffee shop, restaurant, a bike shop, offices, a museum, and loft condominiums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://streets.mn/2018/03/14/living-in-union-depot/|title=Living in Union Depot|last=Browender|first=Wolfie|date=2018-03-14|website=streets.mn|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Original Union Depot===\n{{Multiple image\n|align = left\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 200\n|image1 = Pf026545-1-.jpg\n|image2 = Saint Paul Union Depot.jpg\n|footer = The original depot before 1886 ''(top)'' and in 1890 ''(bottom)''\n}}\n\nThere have been two Union Depots in Saint Paul. The first was completed in 1881, and combined the services of several different railroads into one building (hence the \"union\"; see [[Union station]]). In 1888 the old station had its peak year, handling eight million passengers. That year, about 150 trains departed daily.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Around this time, the building was remodeled with a taller central tower and other alterations to the [[roof]]line.  This station burned in 1915.\n\n===Current building===\nThe current structure was started in 1917 but was not completed until 1923 because [[World War I]] caused construction to halt for several years.\n\nDuring its heyday, the depot hosted the passenger trains of nine railroads, and more than 20 million pieces of mail passed through the station to the neighboring St. Paul Central Downtown Post Office annually. At its peak in the 1920s, there were 282 train movements daily. The waiting room stood atop nine platforms serving 18 tracks; the eight northern ones closest to the headhouse were stub-end tracks, while the other ten ran through.  However, track ownership and trackage rights west of the station meant that most trains operated as though the station was a stub terminal. These trains, when they were intended to continue beyond the station, instead backed up to a wye just to the east to get to other main lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniondepot.org/docs/2003%20LTK%20Depot%20Study/LTKFinalreport.pdf|title=Saint Paul Union Depot Analysis Final Report|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Saint Paul Union Depot Company controlled {{convert|9.24|mi|km}} of St. Paul trackage and terminal facilities, including the depot building. The company was operated in tandem with the Minnesota Transfer Railway Company, with effective control of both properties exercised by the same board, composed of representatives of the nine tenants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00770.xml|title=Saint Paul Union Depot Company|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref>  \n\nTrain ridership began to erode in the 1920s as the automobile took hold and airlines began to operate.  The railroads sought ways stem the flow of passengers and compete with these new forms of transportation.  As the [[Great Depression]] unfolded, more aggressive moves were required.  The [[streamliner]] era in the United States began in 1934 with the introduction of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]]'s ''[[Pioneer Zephyr|Zephyr]]''.  After making a \"Dawn-to-Dusk Dash\" from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to [[Denver, Colorado]], the CB&Q's interest soon turned to the Twin Cities run. A demonstration run was completed in 6 hours and 4 minutes, including six one-minute stops.<ref name=\"hiawatha\">{{Scribbins-Hiawatha-2007}}</ref> Other railroads were soon busy investigating how to run faster trains to Saint Paul and Minneapolis.\n[[Image:Locomotive William Crooks at St. Paul Union Depot 1954.jpg|thumb|left|William Crooks locomotive being set up as a static display in the station's waiting room in 1954.

The [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]]'s ''[[Twin Cities Hiawatha|Hiawatha]]'' and the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]]'s ''[[Twin Cities Zephyr]]'' were introduced with 6\u00bd hour service a few months later at the same time, and C&NW  matched their schedules.<ref name=\"hiawatha\"/><ref name=\"400-story\">{{Scribbins-400-2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Burlington ''Zephyrs'' were the first [[streamliner|streamlined]] [[diesel-electric locomotive|diesel-electric]] trains to serve the Twin Cities, and originally ran in an [[articulated car|articulated]] configuration.  The ''400'' (now renamed the ''Twin Cities 400'') followed in 1939, but using more conventional trucks and couplers to link passenger cars together.  The ''Hiawatha'' had always been powered by a streamlined (or, in the terminology of the Milwaukee Road, \"speedlined\") [[steam locomotive]].  The ''Twin Cities Zephyrs'' added a second set of trains daily in 1936, running the ''Morning Zephyr'' and ''Afternoon Zephyr'' from each terminal.  The ''Hiawatha'' added a second set of trains in 1939, and the ''Morning Hiawatha'' and ''Afternoon Hiawatha'' each provided daily service from Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago.\n\nThe ''Morning Hiawatha'' may have held the record as the world's [[land speed record for rail vehicles|fastest steam train]] on two or more measures: The {{convert|78.3|miles|km}} run from [[Sparta, Wisconsin|Sparta]] to [[Portage, Wisconsin]] was scheduled for 58 minutes&mdash;an average of {{convert|81|mph|km/h}}.  Speeds up to and above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} were achieved on a daily basis, and the powerful [[Milwaukee Road class F7]] engines (designed for a \"reserve speed\" of {{convert|125|mph|km/h}}) likely ran more miles at or above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} than any other steam locomotives in history.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Benn|url=http://www.germansteam.co.uk/FastestLoco/fastestloco.html#MR2|title=Fastest Steam Locomotive?|access-date=February 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420181235/http://www.germansteam.co.uk/FastestLoco/fastestloco.html#MR2|archive-date=April 20, 2006|df=}}</ref>\n\nBurlington's diesel ''Zephyrs'' were also very fast, and they had to be\u2014the ''Zephyr'' route was about {{convert|20|mi|km}} longer than the competition.  In southwestern Wisconsin, a stretch of track between stations required an average speed of {{convert|84.4|mph|km/h}}.\n\nEventually, the ''Hiawathas'', ''Zephyrs'', and the ''400'' ran 6\u00bc-hour service between St. Paul and Chicago, and for a time the ''Morning Zephyr'' from Chicago reached St. Paul in six hours flat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://streamlinermemories.info/Zephyr/TwinZephyrsbro.pdf|title=Heritage from the Gods: Burlington\u2019s new 8 car Twin Zephyrs|publisher=[[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]]|format=PDF|year=1937|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref>  In the 1950s, the federal government began imposing stricter rules for high-speed operation, and expensive advanced signaling was installed along the routes to the Twin Cities, though trains generally traveled a maximum of {{convert|90|to|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Unable to keep up with an increasing automobile speeds on an improving road network and other factors that kept passengers away from trains, train ridership declined and the five daily fast trains became unprofitable.\n\n===End of service===\nThe ''Twin Cities 400'' was the first victim, ending service on July 23, 1963.\n\nIt was announced that when [[Amtrak]] formally took over most passenger service on May 1, 1971, it would consolidate its Twin Cities service in Minneapolis at the [[Minneapolis Great Northern Depot]]. Accordingly, the Burlington (later [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington Northern]]) ''Zephyrs'' ended service on April 30, 1971, the same day the depot closed.  The ''Afternoon Zephyr'' was the last train to serve the depot when it departed that evening bound for Minneapolis. At this time, this train was normally combined with the ''Empire Builder'' and ''North Coast Limited'' from Chicago to St. Paul, except on Fridays when it ran as a separate train. Since April 30 was a Friday, the ''Zephyr'' had the \"honor\" of being the last train to depart the station.<ref>Steve Glischinski, eyewitness account at depot on April 30, 1971.</ref>\n\n===Restoration and return of passenger service===\n[[File:Concourse of the Saint Paul Union Depot during renovation, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of the station during renovation]]\nArea boosters had long hoped that trains would return to the Union Depot, and plans gathered steam as the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]] [[light rail]] project in Minneapolis drew toward completion. Planners envisioned the depot being used for a restored Amtrak service along with Metro and Jefferson Lines buses.\n\nA few businesses had occupied the headhouse since the halt of train service in 1971, while the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) took over the rear of the building. The concourse and waiting room were used for some postal service activities and storage. After lying dormant for several years in the 1970s, the train tracks were removed from the train deck and it was paved with a flat surface. It began to be used for staging [[semi-trailer truck]]s carrying mail to and from the neighboring Downtown St. Paul Central Post Office as well as USPS employee parking. A driveway ramp was sliced into the train deck at the intersection of Kellogg Boulevard and Broadway Street for USPS vehicles. In the early 2000s, the upper levels of the headhouse were  converted into 33 2-story loft condominiums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpaulcondos.com/project/union-depot-lofts/|title=Union Depot Lofts|website=StPaulCondos.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Paul Union Depot Waiting Room Opening Day 3.jpg|thumb|left|Grand opening of the newly renovated waiting room]]\nIn 2005, the Ramsey County Regional Railroad Authority secured funding to renovate the station as an [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]] transit hub served by Amtrak trains, [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] light rail, and intercity bus lines.<ref name=\"minnesota.publicradio.org\">{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/12/08/regional/union-depot-reopening/|title=Party marks reopening of St. Paul's Union Depot|last=Shenoy|first=Rupa|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"minnesota.cbslocal.com\">{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/12/08/thousands-visit-st-pauls-newly-renovated-union-depot/|title=Thousands Visit St. Paul\u2019s Newly Renovated Union Depot|last=Melo|first=Frederick|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"stpauluniondepot.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stpauluniondepot.com/st-paul-depot-renovation/|title=Renovation|website=www.stpauluniondepot.com|access-date=May 10, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221408/http://www.stpauluniondepot.com/st-paul-depot-renovation/|archive-date=May 12, 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, the Ramsey County Board approved purchasing the depot headhouse for $8.2 million, to serve as a [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]] [[light rail]] station and for future passenger rail use.<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Paul Union Depot purchase approved|url=http://www.railwayage.com//content/view/907/121/|work=[[Railway Age]]|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}</ref> In 2010, USPS moved most of the truck operations to a [[bulk mail]] processing center in [[Eagan, Minnesota]], making way for rehabilitation of the depot as a rail hub. Demolition of the Postal Service building that blocked track access to the station began in mid-March 2011. The USPS ramp cut all the way across the train deck and blocked the ability for tracks to be installed, so the ramp was modified during restoration to make a roughly right-angle turn to access new bus platforms on the north end of the train deck while freeing up room for a few tracks to be restored on the south end.\n\nThe renovation was completed in late November 2012 at a cost of $243 million, of which $35 million was provided by the US government through the [[Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery|TIGER]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article/USDOT-approves-TIGER-grant-agreement-for-Minnesotas-Union-Depot--25091|title=USDOT approves TIGER grant agreement for Minnesota's Union Depot|website=www.progressiverailroading.com|publisher=Progressive Railroading|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> The renovated station re-opened to the public on December 8, 2012.<ref name=\"minnesota.publicradio.org\"/><ref name=\"minnesota.cbslocal.com\"/><ref name=\"stpauluniondepot.com\"/>\n\nThe first Amtrak train to service Saint Paul Union Depot was the westbound ''Empire Builder'' which stopped at the station at 11:30pm on May 7, 2014, 70 minutes late heading en route to [[Seattle]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].

The southern terminus of this route is planned to be at St. Paul Union Depot. The [[Gateway Corridor]] (now called the Gold Line) is also planned to be bus rapid transit and will operate between St. Paul and [[Woodbury, Minnesota|Woodbury]]. The [[Red Rock Corridor]] has also been proposed as a BRT service and eventually being upgraded to commuter rail, however plans are on hold as ridership on the current bus routes in this corridor are low.\n\nThe [[Riverview Corridor]] is planned to be a LRT/modern streetcar hybrid operating between St. Paul Union Depot and Mall of America. Riverview Corridor trains would share tracks and stations with the Metro Green Line between Central Station and Union Depot Station.\n\n===Regional rail===\nNumerous existing freight rail lines branch out from St. Paul Union Depot and could be upgraded and utilized by regional passenger trains. Currently MnDOT has studied regional rail from St. Paul Union Depot to [[Mankato]], [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]], and Minneapolis (continuing further west as a through-service). In 2010, the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] also released a plan for regional rail stretching out from the Twin Cities to rural Minnesota and neighboring states, and at least some of the lines would run to Saint Paul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/planning/railplan/files/DraftSRPFinalReport.pdf|title=Minnesota Comprehensive Statewide Freight and Passenger Rail Plan (Draft Final Report)|date=December 2009|author=Cambridge Systematics, Inc., Kimley Horn and Associates, Inc., and TKDA, Inc.|publisher=[[Minnesota Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===High-speed rail===\nNew trains running at speeds above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} to Chicago have also been discussed since at least 1991.

The first was completed in 1881, and combined the services of several different railroads into one building (hence the \"union\"; see [[Union station]]). In 1888 the old station had its peak year, handling eight million passengers. That year, about 150 trains departed daily.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Around this time, the building was remodeled with a taller central tower and other alterations to the [[roof]]line.  This station burned in 1915.\n\n===Current building===\nThe current structure was started in 1917 but was not completed until 1923 because [[World War I]] caused construction to halt for several years.\n\nDuring its heyday, the depot hosted the passenger trains of nine railroads, and more than 20 million pieces of mail passed through the station to the neighboring St. Paul Central Downtown Post Office annually. At its peak in the 1920s, there were 282 train movements daily. The waiting room stood atop nine platforms serving 18 tracks; the eight northern ones closest to the headhouse were stub-end tracks, while the other ten ran through.  However, track ownership and trackage rights west of the station meant that most trains operated as though the station was a stub terminal. These trains, when they were intended to continue beyond the station, instead backed up to a wye just to the east to get to other main lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniondepot.org/docs/2003%20LTK%20Depot%20Study/LTKFinalreport.pdf|title=Saint Paul Union Depot Analysis Final Report|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Saint Paul Union Depot Company controlled {{convert|9.24|mi|km}} of St. Paul trackage and terminal facilities, including the depot building.

The railroads sought ways stem the flow of passengers and compete with these new forms of transportation.  As the [[Great Depression]] unfolded, more aggressive moves were required.  The [[streamliner]] era in the United States began in 1934 with the introduction of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]]'s ''[[Pioneer Zephyr|Zephyr]]''.  After making a \"Dawn-to-Dusk Dash\" from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to [[Denver, Colorado]], the CB&Q's interest soon turned to the Twin Cities run. A demonstration run was completed in 6 hours and 4 minutes, including six one-minute stops.<ref name=\"hiawatha\">{{Scribbins-Hiawatha-2007}}</ref> Other railroads were soon busy investigating how to run faster trains to Saint Paul and Minneapolis.\n[[Image:Locomotive William Crooks at St. Paul Union Depot 1954.jpg|thumb|left|William Crooks locomotive being set up as a static display in the station's waiting room in 1954.

The [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]]'s ''[[Twin Cities Hiawatha|Hiawatha]]'' and the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]]'s ''[[Twin Cities Zephyr]]'' were introduced with 6\u00bd hour service a few months later at the same time, and C&NW  matched their schedules.<ref name=\"hiawatha\"/><ref name=\"400-story\">{{Scribbins-400-2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Burlington ''Zephyrs'' were the first [[streamliner|streamlined]] [[diesel-electric locomotive|diesel-electric]] trains to serve the Twin Cities, and originally ran in an [[articulated car|articulated]] configuration.  The ''400'' (now renamed the ''Twin Cities 400'') followed in 1939, but using more conventional trucks and couplers to link passenger cars together.  The ''Hiawatha'' had always been powered by a streamlined (or, in the terminology of the Milwaukee Road, \"speedlined\") [[steam locomotive]].  The ''Twin Cities Zephyrs'' added a second set of trains daily in 1936, running the ''Morning Zephyr'' and ''Afternoon Zephyr'' from each terminal.  The ''Hiawatha'' added a second set of trains in 1939, and the ''Morning Hiawatha'' and ''Afternoon Hiawatha'' each provided daily service from Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago.\n\nThe ''Morning Hiawatha'' may have held the record as the world's [[land speed record for rail vehicles|fastest steam train]] on two or more measures: The {{convert|78.3|miles|km}} run from [[Sparta, Wisconsin|Sparta]] to [[Portage, Wisconsin]] was scheduled for 58 minutes&mdash;an average of {{convert|81|mph|km/h}}.  Speeds up to and above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} were achieved on a daily basis, and the powerful [[Milwaukee Road class F7]] engines (designed for a \"reserve speed\" of {{convert|125|mph|km/h}}) likely ran more miles at or above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} than any other steam locomotives in history.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Benn|url=http://www.germansteam.co.uk/FastestLoco/fastestloco.html#MR2|title=Fastest Steam Locomotive?|access-date=February 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420181235/http://www.germansteam.co.uk/FastestLoco/fastestloco.html#MR2|archive-date=April 20, 2006|df=}}</ref>\n\nBurlington's diesel ''Zephyrs'' were also very fast, and they had to be\u2014the ''Zephyr'' route was about {{convert|20|mi|km}} longer than the competition.

Unable to keep up with an increasing automobile speeds on an improving road network and other factors that kept passengers away from trains, train ridership declined and the five daily fast trains became unprofitable.\n\n===End of service===\nThe ''Twin Cities 400'' was the first victim, ending service on July 23, 1963.\n\nIt was announced that when [[Amtrak]] formally took over most passenger service on May 1, 1971, it would consolidate its Twin Cities service in Minneapolis at the [[Minneapolis Great Northern Depot]]. Accordingly, the Burlington (later [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington Northern]]) ''Zephyrs'' ended service on April 30, 1971, the same day the depot closed.  The ''Afternoon Zephyr'' was the last train to serve the depot when it departed that evening bound for Minneapolis. At this time, this train was normally combined with the ''Empire Builder'' and ''North Coast Limited'' from Chicago to St. Paul, except on Fridays when it ran as a separate train. Since April 30 was a Friday, the ''Zephyr'' had the \"honor\" of being the last train to depart the station.<ref>Steve Glischinski, eyewitness account at depot on April 30, 1971.</ref>\n\n===Restoration and return of passenger service===\n[[File:Concourse of the Saint Paul Union Depot during renovation, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of the station during renovation]]\nArea boosters had long hoped that trains would return to the Union Depot, and plans gathered steam as the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]] [[light rail]] project in Minneapolis drew toward completion. Planners envisioned the depot being used for a restored Amtrak service along with Metro and Jefferson Lines buses.\n\nA few businesses had occupied the headhouse since the halt of train service in 1971, while the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) took over the rear of the building. The concourse and waiting room were used for some postal service activities and storage. After lying dormant for several years in the 1970s, the train tracks were removed from the train deck and it was paved with a flat surface. It began to be used for staging [[semi-trailer truck]]s carrying mail to and from the neighboring Downtown St. Paul Central Post Office as well as USPS employee parking. A driveway ramp was sliced into the train deck at the intersection of Kellogg Boulevard and Broadway Street for USPS vehicles. In the early 2000\u2019s, the upper levels of the headhouse were  converted into 33 2-story loft condominiums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpaulcondos.com/project/union-depot-lofts/|title=Union Depot Lofts|website=StPaulCondos.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Paul Union Depot Waiting Room Opening Day 3.jpg|thumb|left|Grand opening of the newly renovated waiting room]]\nIn 2005, the Ramsey County Regional Railroad Authority secured funding to renovate the station as an [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]] transit hub served by Amtrak trains, [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] light rail, and intercity bus lines.<ref name=\"minnesota.publicradio.org\">{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/12/08/regional/union-depot-reopening/|title=Party marks reopening of St. Paul's Union Depot|last=Shenoy|first=Rupa|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"minnesota.cbslocal.com\">{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/12/08/thousands-visit-st-pauls-newly-renovated-union-depot/|title=Thousands Visit St. Paul\u2019s Newly Renovated Union Depot|last=Melo|first=Frederick|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"stpauluniondepot.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stpauluniondepot.com/st-paul-depot-renovation/|title=Renovation|website=www.stpauluniondepot.com|access-date=May 10, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221408/http://www.stpauluniondepot.com/st-paul-depot-renovation/|archive-date=May 12, 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, the Ramsey County Board approved purchasing the depot headhouse for $8.2 million, to serve as a [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]] [[light rail]] station and for future passenger rail use.<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Paul Union Depot purchase approved|url=http://www.railwayage.com//content/view/907/121/|work=[[Railway Age]]|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}</ref> In 2010, USPS moved most of the truck operations to a [[bulk mail]] processing center in [[Eagan, Minnesota]], making way for rehabilitation of the depot as a rail hub.

The USPS ramp cut all the way across the train deck and blocked the ability for tracks to be installed, so the ramp was modified during restoration to make a roughly right-angle turn to access new bus platforms on the north end of the train deck while freeing up room for a few tracks to be restored on the south end.\n\nThe renovation was completed in late November 2012 at a cost of $243 million, of which $35 million was provided by the US government through the [[Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery|TIGER]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article/USDOT-approves-TIGER-grant-agreement-for-Minnesotas-Union-Depot--25091|title=USDOT approves TIGER grant agreement for Minnesota's Union Depot|website=www.progressiverailroading.com|publisher=Progressive Railroading|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> The renovated station re-opened to the public on December 8, 2012.<ref name=\"minnesota.publicradio.org\"/><ref name=\"minnesota.cbslocal.com\"/><ref name=\"stpauluniondepot.com\"/>\n\nThe first Amtrak train to service Saint Paul Union Depot was the westbound ''Empire Builder'' which stopped at the station at 11:30pm on May 7, 2014, 70 minutes late heading en route to [[Seattle]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].

Currently MnDOT has studied regional rail from St. Paul Union Depot to [[Mankato]], [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]], and Minneapolis (continuing further west as a through-service). In 2010, the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] also released a plan for regional rail stretching out from the Twin Cities to rural Minnesota and neighboring states, and at least some of the lines would run to Saint Paul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/planning/railplan/files/DraftSRPFinalReport.pdf|title=Minnesota Comprehensive Statewide Freight and Passenger Rail Plan (Draft Final Report)|date=December 2009|author=Cambridge Systematics, Inc., Kimley Horn and Associates, Inc., and TKDA, Inc.|publisher=[[Minnesota Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===High-speed rail===\nNew trains running at speeds above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} to Chicago have also been discussed since at least 1991. The [[Midwest Regional Rail Initiative]] (MWRRI), led by the [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]], has proposed a link to the Twin Cities running at up to {{convert|110|mph|abbr=on}}. The planned schedule time to Saint Paul would be just 5\u00bd hours.  Others including the French national railway [[SNCF]], which operates the [[TGV]] network, have proposed trains running at up to {{convert|220|mph|km/h}}.<ref name=\"sncf-midwest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/sncf/Midwest.pdf|title=Midwest|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=SNCF|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/09/19/breaking-sncf-proposes-development-of-high-speed-rail-in-midwest-texas-florida-and-california-corridors/|title=SNCF Proposes Development of High-Speed Rail in Midwest, Texas, Florida, and California Corridors|last=Freemark|first=Yonah|work=The Transport Politic|date=September 19, 2009|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Local significance==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 250\n| image1    = Saint Paul Union Depot Frieze.jpg\n| caption1  = \n| image2    = St Paul Union Depot Waiting Room Steam Locomotive Frieze.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Frieze]] detailing on the waiting room walls\n}}\nPrior to the station's reopening in December 2012, Josh Collins, a spokesperson for Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority, referred to the potential of the station to be \"the living room of Saint Paul.\"<ref name=\"Duchschere new day\">{{cite news|last=Duchschere|first=Kevin|title=A new day is coming for St. Paul's Union Depot|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/182112301.html?page=all&prepage=1&c=y&refer=y|accessdate=December 5, 2012|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|date=December 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nThe entrance to Union Depot, the [[headhouse]], is considered a somewhat severe example of [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[architecture]], with a robust aesthetic.  A series of tall Doric columns line the front fa\u00e7ade.  The [[concourse]] and the waiting room that extends out to the platforms, where trains once rolled in, is considered to be one of the great architectural achievements in the city.  The building was designed by Charles Frost.<ref name=\"Duchschere new day\"/>\n\nThe waiting room is flooded with natural light from skylights.  These skylights were blackened during the [[Second World War]], but restored for the 2012 re-opening.<ref name=\"Duchschere new day\"/>\n\nThe building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]<ref name=\"Duchschere new day\"/> in 1974.\n\nThe restoration and new addition were designed by [[Hammel, Green and Abrahamson]] Architects & Engineers (HGA).\n\n===Railway mapping===\nMilepost for rail lines that originated in Saint Paul, such as the Great Northern and Northern Pacific, had used the depot as milepost 0.

He built a fan base in Puerto Rico, campaigning there for his first 23 bouts, including winning and losing the Puerto Rican Featherweight title v.s [[Francisco Villegas]]. For his 24th bout, he traveled to [[Panama City]], where he met future world Featherweight champion [[Ernesto Marcel]], who beat him on points in 10 rounds. That would be his last defeat in a long time.\n\nHe then continued his winning ways, including a 10-round decision win over tough veteran [[Cocoa Perez]] and one win over former title challenger [[Diego Alcala]], also by decision in 10. Serrano then travelled in 1976 to [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], to meet reigning [[Lineal championship|Lineal]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] world jr. Lightweight champion, the [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[Ben Villaflor]]. By most writer's accounts, Serrano beat Villaflor, but he had to return home only with a 15-round draw (tie).\n\nThe [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] ordered an immediate rematch, and so on October 16 of the same year, Villaflor went to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] to defend his title for the second time vs. Serrano. Serrano beat Villaflor by using his ring technique to win 12 of the 15 rounds on each judges' scorecards. As life had it, Samuel Serrano was destined to become a world champion in front of his fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jrlight.htm|title=Samuel Serrano - Lineal Jr. Lightweight Champion|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\nSerrano became a traveling champion, defending his title in places like [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], [[South Africa]], Japan (twice) and, of course, Puerto Rico. One of his defenses, against [[Julio Diablito Valdez]], resulted in an after-fight brawl when Serrano was announced as winner by a unanimous decision and went to greet his rival but was received with a punch to the face. Serrano retaliated, and police intervention was needed. Both fighters were escorted to their dressing rooms by the police. But disaster struck for Serrano in [[Detroit]] on August 2 of 1980, when, after leading on all scorecards, he was struck by a [[Yasutsune Uehara]] right hand to the chin in round six, and lost his title by knockout to the Japanese. After that loss, he set his eyes on recovering his world title from the Japanese world champion, and so  on April 9, 1981, they met again, this time in [[Wakayama, Japan]]. Serrano was more cautious this time, and didn't try to go for the knockout after building a points lead. Even though Uehara was fighting in his homeland, all judges agreed and gave Serrano more rounds than they gave Uehara, and Serrano the world title back by a fifteen-round unanimous decision.\n\nSerrano made two defenses and then went to [[Chile]] to give challenger [[Benedicto Villablanca]] a chance at the title on June 3, 1982. It proved to be a highly controversial fight. After 5 rounds, Serrano was ahead on the scorecards. However, a cut appeared over his eye during the 6th, and the referee ruled it to be from a punch. Serrano kept fighting, but during the 11th round, the cut was so deep, the fight had to be stopped by the doctor and Serrano had to be taken to a [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] hospital. Since the referee ruled the cut came from a punch, initially the fight and the world title were given to Villablanca.\n\nSerrano and his corner filed a complaint, however, claiming the cut had been caused by a headbutt instead, and upon review at the WBA's [[Panama City]] offices, WBA officials announced they had effectively seen the headbutt that Serrano claimed opened his cut happen. So the WBA decided the cut had come from a headbutt, and the judges' scorecards were reviewed. They had Serrano ahead on points after 10 rounds, so the fight, and the crown, were given back to Serrano by a [[technical decision]].\n\nIn his next defense he met the younger and physically stronger [[Roger Mayweather]]. Serrano and Mayweather gave it a good fight for most of 7 rounds, but Serrano was weakened by a barrage of punches towards the end of the 7th, and downed with a right hand in the 8th, this time, losing the title definitively.\n\n==Retirement==\nSerrano retired from the ring for one year and came back in 1984, winning by first round [[knockout]]. Then, he retired again.\n\nIn 1996, Serrano won the Puerto Rican Lightweight title vs Sammy Mejias on a 12-round decision in 1996 and won a 10-round decision vs Anthony Ivory in 1997. Serrano retired after the Ivory fight with a final record of 50 wins, 5 defeats and 17 knockouts.\n\nHe made a television commercial for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] in Puerto Rico in 1982. \n \nAs of 2017, Serrano was living in a beach house at Islote, [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|ciudad de Arecibo]]. He dedicated himself to fixing beachfront apartments and renting them, as well as to creating mosaic art, some of which he sold.<ref>https://www.elnuevodia.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/samuelserranoesuntorbellinoqueahorareposa-2297410/</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing

''Sammy'' and ''El Torbellino'' (''The Whirlwind''), is a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] who won [[boxing]]'s world junior lightweight championship twice.\n\nAccording to Serrano during a 2017 interview with [[El Nuevo Dia]] newspaper, he learned to box starting at age 5 when he lived at Palmarejos barrio in [[Corozal, Puerto Rico|Corozal]].<ref>https://www.elnuevodia.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/samuelserranoesuntorbellinoqueahorareposa-2297410/</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing career==\nSerrano, owner of long arms, began his career on October 29, 1969 with a four-round decision win over Ramon Laureano. He built a fan base in Puerto Rico, campaigning there for his first 23 bouts, including winning and losing the Puerto Rican Featherweight title v.s [[Francisco Villegas]]. For his 24th bout, he traveled to [[Panama City]], where he met future world Featherweight champion [[Ernesto Marcel]], who beat him on points in 10 rounds. That would be his last defeat in a long time.\n\nHe then continued his winning ways, including a 10-round decision win over tough veteran [[Cocoa Perez]] and one win over former title challenger [[Diego Alcala]], also by decision in 10. Serrano then travelled in 1976 to [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], to meet reigning [[Lineal championship|Lineal]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] world jr. Lightweight champion, the [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[Ben Villaflor]]. By most writer's accounts, Serrano beat Villaflor, but he had to return home only with a 15-round draw (tie).\n\nThe [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] ordered an immediate rematch, and so on October 16 of the same year, Villaflor went to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] to defend his title for the second time vs. Serrano. Serrano beat Villaflor by using his ring technique to win 12 of the 15 rounds on each judges' scorecards. As life had it, Samuel Serrano was destined to become a world champion in front of his fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jrlight.htm|title=Samuel Serrano - Lineal Jr. Lightweight Champion|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\nSerrano became a traveling champion, defending his title in places like [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], [[South Africa]], Japan (twice) and, of course, Puerto Rico. One of his defenses, against [[Julio Diablito Valdez]], resulted in an after-fight brawl when Serrano was announced as winner by a unanimous decision and went to greet his rival but was received with a punch to the face. Serrano retaliated, and police intervention was needed. Both fighters were escorted to their dressing rooms by the police. But disaster struck for Serrano in [[Detroit]] on August 2 of 1980, when, after leading on all scorecards, he was struck by a [[Yasutsune Uehara]] right hand to the chin in round six, and lost his title by knockout to the Japanese. After that loss, he set his eyes on recovering his world title from the Japanese world champion, and so  on April 9, 1981, they met again, this time in [[Wakayama, Japan]]. Serrano was more cautious this time, and didn't try to go for the knockout after building a points lead. Even though Uehara was fighting in his homeland, all judges agreed and gave Serrano more rounds than they gave Uehara, and Serrano the world title back by a fifteen-round unanimous decision.\n\nSerrano made two defenses and then went to [[Chile]] to give challenger [[Benedicto Villablanca]] a chance at the title on June 3, 1982. It proved to be a highly controversial fight. After 5 rounds, Serrano was ahead on the scorecards. However, a cut appeared over his eye during the 6th, and the referee ruled it to be from a punch. Serrano kept fighting, but during the 11th round, the cut was so deep, the fight had to be stopped by the doctor and Serrano had to be taken to a [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] hospital. Since the referee ruled the cut came from a punch, initially the fight and the world title were given to Villablanca.\n\nSerrano and his corner filed a complaint, however, claiming the cut had been caused by a headbutt instead, and upon review at the WBA's [[Panama City]] offices, WBA officials announced they had effectively seen the headbutt that Serrano claimed opened his cut happen. So the WBA decided the cut had come from a headbutt, and the judges' scorecards were reviewed. They had Serrano ahead on points after 10 rounds, so the fight, and the crown, were given back to Serrano by a [[technical decision]].\n\nIn his next defense he met the younger and physically stronger [[Roger Mayweather]]. Serrano and Mayweather gave it a good fight for most of 7 rounds, but Serrano was weakened by a barrage of punches towards the end of the 7th, and downed with a right hand in the 8th, this time, losing the title definitively.\n\n==Retirement==\nSerrano retired from the ring for one year and came back in 1984, winning by first round [[knockout]]. Then, he retired again.\n\nIn 1996, Serrano won the Puerto Rican Lightweight title vs Sammy Mejias on a 12-round decision in 1996 and won a 10-round decision vs Anthony Ivory in 1997. Serrano retired after the Ivory fight with a final record of 50 wins, 5 defeats and 17 knockouts.\n\nHe made a television commercial for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] in Puerto Rico in 1982. \n \nAs of 2017, Serrano was living in a beach house at Islote, [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|ciudad de Arecibo]]. He dedicated himself to fixing beachfront apartments and renting them, as well as to creating mosaic art, some of which he sold.<ref>https://www.elnuevodia.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/samuelserranoesuntorbellinoqueahorareposa-2297410/</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing

A thermometer has two important elements: (1) a temperature sensor (e.g. the bulb of a [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] or the pyrometric sensor in an [[infrared thermometer]]) in which some change occurs with a change in temperature; and (2) some means of converting this change into a numerical value (e.g. the visible scale that is marked on a mercury-in-glass thermometer or the digital readout on an infrared model). Thermometers are widely used in technology and industry to monitor processes, in [[meteorology]], in medicine, and in scientific research.\n\nSome of the principles of the thermometer were known to Greek philosophers of two thousand years ago.

Today there is an absolute [[thermodynamic temperature]] scale. Internationally agreed temperature scales are designed to approximate this closely, based on fixed points and interpolating thermometers. The most recent official temperature scale is the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]]. It extends from {{convert|0.65|K|C F|lk=in|1}} to approximately {{convert|1358|K|C F}}.\n\n[[File:Raumthermometer Fahrenheit+Celsius.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Thermometer with [[Fahrenheit]] (symbol \u00b0F) and [[Celsius]] (symbol \u00b0C) units.]]\n\n===Early developments===\n{{See also|Thermometry|Temperature scale|Thermoscope|Alcohol thermometer|Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology}}\n[[File:Termometri cinquantigradi inv 85 IF 46774.jpg|thumb|Fifty-degree thermometers from the mid-17th century on exhibit at the [[Museo Galileo]] with black dots representing single degrees and white represented 10-degree increments; used to measure atmospheric temperatures]]\nVarious authors have credited the invention of the thermometer to [[Hero of Alexandria]]. The thermometer was [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|not a single invention, however, but a development]].\n[[Hero of Alexandria]] (10\u201370 AD) knew of the principle that certain substances, notably air, expand and contract and described a demonstration in which a closed tube partially filled with air had its end in a container of water.<ref>T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'' {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}</ref> The expansion and contraction of the air caused the position of the water/air interface to move along the tube.\n\nSuch a mechanism was later used to show the hotness and coldness of the air with a tube in which the water level is controlled by the expansion and contraction of the gas. These devices were developed by several European scientists in the 16th and 17th centuries, notably [[Galileo Galilei]]<ref name=Doak>R.S. Doak (2005) Galileo: astronomer and physicist {{ISBN|0-7565-0813-4}} p36</ref> and [[Santorio Santorio]]<ref name=\":0\" />. As a result, devices were shown to produce this effect reliably, and the term ''thermoscope'' was adopted because it reflected the changes in [[sensible heat]] (the modern concept of temperature was yet to arise).<ref name=Doak/> The difference between a [[thermoscope]] and a thermometer is that the latter has a scale.<ref>T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'' page 3, {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}</ref> Though Galileo is often said to be the inventor of the thermometer, there is no surviving document that he actually produced any such instrument.\n\nThe first clear diagram of a thermoscope was published in 1617 by [[Giuseppe Biancani]] (1566 \u2013 1624): the first showing a scale and thus constituting a thermometer was [[Santorio Santorio]] in 1625<ref name=\":0\" />. This was a vertical tube, closed by a bulb of air at the top, with the lower end opening into a vessel of water. The water level in the tube is controlled by the expansion and contraction of the air, so it is what we would now call an air thermometer.<ref>T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'', pages 2\u20134 {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}</ref>\n\nThe word thermometer (in its French form) first appeared in 1624 in ''La R\u00e9cr\u00e9ation Math\u00e9matique'' by J. Leurechon, who describes one with a scale of 8 degrees.<ref name=\"page4\">R.P. Benedict (1984) Fundamentals of Temperature, Pressure, and Flow Measurements, 3rd ed, {{ISBN|0-471-89383-8}} page 4</ref> The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words [[wikt:\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2|\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2]], ''thermos'', meaning \"hot\" and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, ''metron'', meaning \"measure\".\n\nThe above instruments suffered from the disadvantage that they were also [[barometer]]s, i.e. sensitive to air pressure. In 1629, [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], a student of Galileo and Santorio in Padua, published what is apparently the first description and illustration of a sealed liquid-in-glass thermometer.  It is described as having a bulb at the bottom of a sealed tube partially filled with brandy.  The tube has a numbered scale. Delmedigo does not claim to have invented this instrument, nor does he name anyone else as its inventor.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Adler | first1 = Jacob | year = 1997 | title = J. S.

That is, the thermometer did not hold the temperature reading after it was moved to a place with a different temperature. Determining the temperature of a pot of hot liquid required the user to leave the thermometer in the hot liquid until after reading it. If the non-registering thermometer was removed from the hot liquid, then the temperature indicated on the thermometer would immediately begin changing to reflect the temperature of its new conditions (in this case, the air temperature). Registering thermometers are designed to hold the temperature indefinitely, so that the thermometer can be removed and read at a later time or in a more convenient place. Mechanical registering thermometers hold either the highest or lowest temperature recorded, until manually re-set, e.g., by shaking down a mercury-in-glass thermometer, or until an even more extreme temperature is experienced. Electronic registering thermometers may be designed to remember the highest or lowest temperature, or to remember whatever temperature was present at a specified point in time.\n\nThermometers increasingly use electronic means to provide a digital display or input to a computer.\n\n==Physical principles of thermometry==\n[[File:Oldthermometers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Various thermometers from the 19th century.]]\n[[File:Thermometer CF.svg|thumb|upright|Comparison of the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales]]\n\nThermometers may be described as empirical or absolute. Absolute thermometers are calibrated numerically by the thermodynamic absolute temperature scale. Empirical thermometers are not in general necessarily in exact agreement with absolute thermometers as to their numerical scale readings, but to qualify as thermometers at all they must agree with absolute thermometers and with each other in the following way: given any two bodies isolated in their separate respective thermodynamic equilibrium states, all thermometers agree as to which of the two has the higher temperature, or that the two have equal temperatures.<ref>Beattie, J.A., Oppenheim, I.

Another way of identifying hotter as opposed to colder conditions is supplied by Planck's principle, that when a process of isochoric adiabatic work is the sole means of change of internal energy of a closed system, the final state of the system is never colder than the initial state; except for phase changes with latent heat, it is hotter than the initial state.<ref>[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1926). \u00dcber die Begr\u00fcndung des zweiten Hauptsatzes der Thermodynamik, ''S.-B.

Several such principles are essentially based on the constitutive relation between the state of a suitably selected particular material and its temperature. Only some materials are suitable for this purpose, and they may be considered as \"thermometric materials\". Radiometric thermometry, in contrast, can be only slightly dependent on the constitutive relations of materials. In a sense then, radiometric thermometry might be thought of as \"universal\". This is because it rests mainly on a universality character of thermodynamic equilibrium, that it has the universal property of producing [[blackbody]] radiation.\n\n===Thermometric materials===\n[[File:Thermometers in pitcher.jpg|thumb|Bi-metallic stem thermometers used to measure the temperature of steamed milk]]\n[[File:Backofenthermometer.jpg|thumb|upright|Bi-metallic thermometer for cooking and baking in an oven]]\nThere are various kinds of empirical thermometer based on material properties.\n\nMany empirical thermometers rely on the constitutive relation between pressure, volume and temperature of their thermometric material. For example, mercury expands when heated.\n\nIf it is used for its relation between pressure and volume and temperature, a thermometric material must have three properties:\n\n(1) Its heating and cooling must be rapid. That is to say, when a quantity of heat enters or leaves a body of the material, the material must expand or contract to its final volume or reach its final pressure and must reach its final temperature with practically no delay; some of the heat that enters can be considered to change the volume of the body at constant temperature, and is called the [[Calorimetry|latent heat of expansion at constant temperature]]; and the rest of it can be considered to change the temperature of the body at constant volume, and is called the [[Calorimetry|specific heat at constant volume]]. Some materials do not have this property, and take some time to distribute the heat between temperature and volume change.<ref name=\"Truesdell Bharatha 1977 20\">Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977).

A small enough hole in the wall of the cavity emits near enough blackbody radiation of which the [[spectral radiance]] can be precisely measured. The walls of the cavity, provided they are completely opaque and poorly reflective, can be of any material indifferently. This provides a well-reproducible absolute thermometer over a very wide range of temperatures, able to measure the absolute temperature of a body inside the cavity.\n\n==Primary and secondary thermometers==\nA thermometer is called primary or secondary based on how the raw physical quantity it measures is mapped to a temperature. As summarized by Kauppinen et al., \"For '''primary thermometers''' the measured property of matter is known so well that temperature can be calculated without any unknown quantities. Examples of these are thermometers based on the equation of state of a gas, on the [[velocity]] of sound in a gas, on the [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise|thermal noise]] [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] of an electrical resistor, and on the angular [[anisotropy]] of [[gamma ray]] emission of certain [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a [[magnetic field]].\"<ref name=\"kauppinen1998\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kauppinen | first1 = J.

Also, they are often much more sensitive than primary ones. For secondary thermometers knowledge of the measured property is not sufficient to allow direct calculation of temperature. They have to be calibrated against a primary thermometer at least at one temperature or at a number of fixed temperatures. Such fixed points, for example, [[triple point]]s and [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] transitions, occur reproducibly at the same temperature.\"<ref name=\"kauppinen1998\"/>\n\n==Calibration==\n[[File:Maximum thermometer close up 2.JPG|thumb|[[Mercury-in-glass thermometer]]]]\nThermometers can be calibrated either by comparing them with other calibrated thermometers or by checking them against known fixed points on the temperature scale. The best known of these fixed points are the melting and boiling points of pure water. (Note that the boiling point of water varies with pressure, so this must be controlled.)\n\nThe traditional way of putting a scale on a liquid-in-glass or liquid-in-metal thermometer was in three stages:\n#Immerse the sensing portion in a stirred mixture of pure ice and water at atmospheric pressure and mark the point indicated when it had come to thermal equilibrium.\n#Immerse the sensing portion in a steam bath at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|Standard atmospheric pressure]] and again mark the point indicated.\n#Divide the distance between these marks into equal portions according to the temperature scale being used.\n\nOther fixed points used in the past are the body temperature (of a healthy adult male) which was originally used by Fahrenheit as his upper fixed point ({{convert|96|F|sigfig=3}} to be a number divisible by 12) and the lowest temperature given by a mixture of salt and ice, which was originally the definition of {{convert|0|F|sigfig=3}}.<ref name=Benedict5>R.P. Benedict (1984) ''Fundamentals of Temperature, Pressure, and Flow Measurements'', 3rd ed, {{ISBN|0-471-89383-8}}, page 5</ref> (This is an example of a [[Frigorific mixture]]). As body temperature varies, the Fahrenheit scale was later changed to use an upper fixed point of boiling water at {{convert|212|F}}.<ref>J. Lord (1994) ''Sizes'' {{ISBN|0-06-273228-5}} page 293</ref>\n\nThese have now been replaced by the defining points in the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]], though in practice the melting point of water is more commonly used than its triple point, the latter being more difficult to manage and thus restricted to critical standard measurement. Nowadays manufacturers will often use a [[thermostat]] bath or solid block where the temperature is held constant relative to a calibrated thermometer. Other thermometers to be calibrated are put into the same bath or block and allowed to come to equilibrium, then the scale marked, or any deviation from the instrument scale recorded.<ref name=Benedict11>R.P.

For high temperature work it may only be possible to measure to the nearest 10&nbsp;\u00b0C or more. Clinical thermometers and many electronic thermometers are usually readable to 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C. Special instruments can give readings to one thousandth of a degree.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, this precision does not mean the reading is true or accurate, it only means that very small changes can be observed.\n\nA thermometer calibrated to a known fixed point is accurate (i.e. gives a true reading) at that point. Most thermometers are originally calibrated to a constant-volume [[gas thermometer]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In between fixed calibration points, [[interpolation]] is used, usually linear.<ref name=Benedict11/> This may give significant differences between different types of thermometer at points far away from the fixed points. For example, the expansion of mercury in a glass thermometer is slightly different from the change in resistance of a [[platinum]] resistance thermometer, so these two will disagree slightly at around 50&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Duncan>T. Duncan (1973) Advanced Physics: Materials and Mechanics (John Murray, London) {{ISBN|0-7195-2844-5}}</ref> There may be other causes due to imperfections in the instrument, e.g. in a liquid-in-glass thermometer if the [[Capillary action|capillary tube]] varies in diameter.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nFor many purposes reproducibility is important. That is, does the same thermometer give the same reading for the same temperature (or do replacement or multiple thermometers give the same reading)? Reproducible [[temperature measurement]] means that comparisons are valid in scientific experiments and industrial processes are consistent. Thus if the same type of thermometer is calibrated in the same way its readings will be valid even if it is slightly inaccurate compared to the absolute scale.\n\nAn example of a reference thermometer used to check others to industrial standards would be a platinum [[resistance thermometer]] with a digital display to 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C (its precision) which has been calibrated at 5 points against national standards (\u221218, 0, 40, 70, 100&nbsp;\u00b0C) and which is certified to an accuracy of \u00b10.2&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Peak>[http://www.peaksensors.co.uk/acatalog/Reference_Thermometer.html Peak Sensors] Reference Thermometer</ref>\n\nAccording to [[British Standards]], correctly calibrated, used and maintained liquid-in-glass thermometers can achieve a measurement uncertainty of \u00b10.01&nbsp;\u00b0C in the range 0 to 100&nbsp;\u00b0C, and a larger uncertainty outside this range: \u00b10.05&nbsp;\u00b0C up to 200 or down to \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C, \u00b10.2&nbsp;\u00b0C up to 450 or down to \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=BS1041>BS1041-2.1:1985 Temperature Measurement- Part 2: Expansion thermometers.

A thermometer has two important elements: (1) a temperature sensor (e.g. the bulb of a [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] or the pyrometric sensor in an [[infrared thermometer]]) in which some change occurs with a change in temperature; and (2) some means of converting this change into a numerical value (e.g. the visible scale that is marked on a mercury-in-glass thermometer or the digital readout on an infrared model). Thermometers are widely used in technology and industry to monitor processes, in [[meteorology]], in medicine, and in scientific research.\n\nSome of the principles of the thermometer were known to Greek philosophers of two thousand years ago.

Today there is an absolute [[thermodynamic temperature]] scale. Internationally agreed temperature scales are designed to approximate this closely, based on fixed points and interpolating thermometers.

The thermometer was [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|not a single invention, however, but a development]].\n[[Hero of Alexandria]] (10\u201370 AD) knew of the principle that certain substances, notably air, expand and contract and described a demonstration in which a closed tube partially filled with air had its end in a container of water.<ref>T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'' {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}</ref> The expansion and contraction of the air caused the position of the water/air interface to move along the tube.\n\nSuch a mechanism was later used to show the hotness and coldness of the air with a tube in which the water level is controlled by the expansion and contraction of the gas. These devices were developed by several European scientists in the 16th and 17th centuries, notably [[Galileo Galilei]]<ref name=Doak>R.S. Doak (2005) Galileo: astronomer and physicist {{ISBN|0-7565-0813-4}} p36</ref> and [[Santorio Santorio]]<ref name=\":0\" />. As a result, devices were shown to produce this effect reliably, and the term ''thermoscope'' was adopted because it reflected the changes in [[sensible heat]] (the modern concept of temperature was yet to arise).<ref name=Doak/> The difference between a [[thermoscope]] and a thermometer is that the latter has a scale.<ref>T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'' page 3, {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}</ref> Though Galileo is often said to be the inventor of the thermometer, there is no surviving document that he actually produced any such instrument.\n\nThe first clear diagram of a thermoscope was published in 1617 by [[Giuseppe Biancani]] (1566 \u2013 1624): the first showing a scale and thus constituting a thermometer was [[Santorio Santorio]] in 1625<ref name=\":0\" />. This was a vertical tube, closed by a bulb of air at the top, with the lower end opening into a vessel of water. The water level in the tube is controlled by the expansion and contraction of the air, so it is what we would now call an air thermometer.<ref>T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'', pages 2\u20134 {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}</ref>\n\nThe word thermometer (in its French form) first appeared in 1624 in ''La R\u00e9cr\u00e9ation Math\u00e9matique'' by J.

In 1629, [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], a student of Galileo and Santorio in Padua, published what is apparently the first description and illustration of a sealed liquid-in-glass thermometer.  It is described as having a bulb at the bottom of a sealed tube partially filled with brandy.  The tube has a numbered scale. Delmedigo does not claim to have invented this instrument, nor does he name anyone else as its inventor.<ref>Jacob Adler, \"J. S.

That is, the thermometer did not hold the temperature reading after it was moved to a place with a different temperature. Determining the temperature of a pot of hot liquid required the user to leave the thermometer in the hot liquid until after reading it. If the non-registering thermometer was removed from the hot liquid, then the temperature indicated on the thermometer would immediately begin changing to reflect the temperature of its new conditions (in this case, the air temperature). Registering thermometers are designed to hold the temperature indefinitely, so that the thermometer can be removed and read at a later time or in a more convenient place. Mechanical registering thermometers hold either the highest or lowest temperature recorded, until manually re-set, e.g., by shaking down a mercury-in-glass thermometer, or until an even more extreme temperature is experienced. Electronic registering thermometers may be designed to remember the highest or lowest temperature, or to remember whatever temperature was present at a specified point in time.\n\nThermometers increasingly use electronic means to provide a digital display or input to a computer.\n\n==Physical principles of thermometry==\n[[File:Oldthermometers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Various thermometers from the 19th century.]]\n[[File:Thermometer CF.svg|thumb|upright|Comparison of the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales]]\n\nThermometers may be described as empirical or absolute. Absolute thermometers are calibrated numerically by the thermodynamic absolute temperature scale. Empirical thermometers are not in general necessarily in exact agreement with absolute thermometers as to their numerical scale readings, but to qualify as thermometers at all they must agree with absolute thermometers and with each other in the following way: given any two bodies isolated in their separate respective thermodynamic equilibrium states, all thermometers agree as to which of the two has the higher temperature, or that the two have equal temperatures.<ref>Beattie, J.A., Oppenheim, I. (1979).

Several such principles are essentially based on the constitutive relation between the state of a suitably selected particular material and its temperature. Only some materials are suitable for this purpose, and they may be considered as \"thermometric materials\". Radiometric thermometry, in contrast, can be only slightly dependent on the constitutive relations of materials. In a sense then, radiometric thermometry might be thought of as \"universal\". This is because it rests mainly on a universality character of thermodynamic equilibrium, that it has the universal property of producing [[blackbody]] radiation.\n\n===Thermometric materials===\n[[File:Thermometers in pitcher.jpg|thumb|Bi-metallic stem thermometers used to measure the temperature of steamed milk]]\n[[File:Backofenthermometer.jpg|thumb|upright|Bi-metallic thermometer for cooking and baking in an oven]]\nThere are various kinds of empirical thermometer based on material properties.\n\nMany empirical thermometers rely on the constitutive relation between pressure, volume and temperature of their thermometric material. For example, mercury expands when heated.\n\nIf it is used for its relation between pressure and volume and temperature, a thermometric material must have three properties:\n\n(1) Its heating and cooling must be rapid. That is to say, when a quantity of heat enters or leaves a body of the material, the material must expand or contract to its final volume or reach its final pressure and must reach its final temperature with practically no delay; some of the heat that enters can be considered to change the volume of the body at constant temperature, and is called the [[Calorimetry|latent heat of expansion at constant temperature]]; and the rest of it can be considered to change the temperature of the body at constant volume, and is called the [[Calorimetry|specific heat at constant volume]]. Some materials do not have this property, and take some time to distribute the heat between temperature and volume change.<ref name=\"Truesdell Bharatha 1977 20\">Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977).

A small enough hole in the wall of the cavity emits near enough blackbody radiation of which the [[spectral radiance]] can be precisely measured. The walls of the cavity, provided they are completely opaque and poorly reflective, can be of any material indifferently. This provides a well-reproducible absolute thermometer over a very wide range of temperatures, able to measure the absolute temperature of a body inside the cavity.\n\n==Primary and secondary thermometers==\nA thermometer is called primary or secondary based on how the raw physical quantity it measures is mapped to a temperature. As summarized by Kauppinen et al., \"For '''primary thermometers''' the measured property of matter is known so well that temperature can be calculated without any unknown quantities. Examples of these are thermometers based on the equation of state of a gas, on the [[velocity]] of sound in a gas, on the [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise|thermal noise]] [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] of an electrical resistor, and on the angular [[anisotropy]] of [[gamma ray]] emission of certain [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a [[magnetic field]].\"<ref name=\"kauppinen1998\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kauppinen | first1 = J.

Also, they are often much more sensitive than primary ones. For secondary thermometers knowledge of the measured property is not sufficient to allow direct calculation of temperature. They have to be calibrated against a primary thermometer at least at one temperature or at a number of fixed temperatures. Such fixed points, for example, [[triple point]]s and [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] transitions, occur reproducibly at the same temperature.\"<ref name=\"kauppinen1998\"/>\n\n==Calibration==\n[[File:Maximum thermometer close up 2.JPG|thumb|[[Mercury-in-glass thermometer]]]]\nThermometers can be calibrated either by comparing them with other calibrated thermometers or by checking them against known fixed points on the temperature scale. The best known of these fixed points are the melting and boiling points of pure water. (Note that the boiling point of water varies with pressure, so this must be controlled.)\n\nThe traditional way of putting a scale on a liquid-in-glass or liquid-in-metal thermometer was in three stages:\n#Immerse the sensing portion in a stirred mixture of pure ice and water at atmospheric pressure and mark the point indicated when it had come to thermal equilibrium.\n#Immerse the sensing portion in a steam bath at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|Standard atmospheric pressure]] and again mark the point indicated.\n#Divide the distance between these marks into equal portions according to the temperature scale being used.\n\nOther fixed points used in the past are the body temperature (of a healthy adult male) which was originally used by Fahrenheit as his upper fixed point ({{convert|96|F|sigfig=3}} to be a number divisible by 12) and the lowest temperature given by a mixture of salt and ice, which was originally the definition of {{convert|0|F|sigfig=3}}.<ref name=Benedict5>R.P. Benedict (1984) ''Fundamentals of Temperature, Pressure, and Flow Measurements'', 3rd ed, {{ISBN|0-471-89383-8}}, page 5</ref> (This is an example of a [[Frigorific mixture]]). As body temperature varies, the Fahrenheit scale was later changed to use an upper fixed point of boiling water at {{convert|212|F}}.<ref>J. Lord (1994) ''Sizes'' {{ISBN|0-06-273228-5}} page 293</ref>\n\nThese have now been replaced by the defining points in the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]], though in practice the melting point of water is more commonly used than its triple point, the latter being more difficult to manage and thus restricted to critical standard measurement. Nowadays manufacturers will often use a [[thermostat]] bath or solid block where the temperature is held constant relative to a calibrated thermometer. Other thermometers to be calibrated are put into the same bath or block and allowed to come to equilibrium, then the scale marked, or any deviation from the instrument scale recorded.<ref name=Benedict11>R.P.

For high temperature work it may only be possible to measure to the nearest 10&nbsp;\u00b0C or more. Clinical thermometers and many electronic thermometers are usually readable to 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C. Special instruments can give readings to one thousandth of a degree.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, this precision does not mean the reading is true or accurate, it only means that very small changes can be observed.\n\nA thermometer calibrated to a known fixed point is accurate (i.e. gives a true reading) at that point. Most thermometers are originally calibrated to a constant-volume [[gas thermometer]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In between fixed calibration points, [[interpolation]] is used, usually linear.<ref name=Benedict11/> This may give significant differences between different types of thermometer at points far away from the fixed points. For example, the expansion of mercury in a glass thermometer is slightly different from the change in resistance of a [[platinum]] resistance thermometer, so these two will disagree slightly at around 50&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Duncan>T. Duncan (1973) Advanced Physics: Materials and Mechanics (John Murray, London) {{ISBN|0-7195-2844-5}}</ref> There may be other causes due to imperfections in the instrument, e.g. in a liquid-in-glass thermometer if the [[Capillary action|capillary tube]] varies in diameter.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nFor many purposes reproducibility is important. That is, does the same thermometer give the same reading for the same temperature (or do replacement or multiple thermometers give the same reading)? Reproducible [[temperature measurement]] means that comparisons are valid in scientific experiments and industrial processes are consistent. Thus if the same type of thermometer is calibrated in the same way its readings will be valid even if it is slightly inaccurate compared to the absolute scale.\n\nAn example of a reference thermometer used to check others to industrial standards would be a platinum [[resistance thermometer]] with a digital display to 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C (its precision) which has been calibrated at 5 points against national standards (\u221218, 0, 40, 70, 100&nbsp;\u00b0C) and which is certified to an accuracy of \u00b10.2&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Peak>[http://www.peaksensors.co.uk/acatalog/Reference_Thermometer.html Peak Sensors] Reference Thermometer</ref>\n\nAccording to [[British Standards]], correctly calibrated, used and maintained liquid-in-glass thermometers can achieve a measurement uncertainty of \u00b10.01&nbsp;\u00b0C in the range 0 to 100&nbsp;\u00b0C, and a larger uncertainty outside this range: \u00b10.05&nbsp;\u00b0C up to 200 or down to \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C, \u00b10.2&nbsp;\u00b0C up to 450 or down to \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=BS1041>BS1041-2.1:1985 Temperature Measurement- Part 2: Expansion thermometers.

Dragalina was born in the city of Karansebesch (now [[Caransebe\u015f]], Romania), which at the time was part of the [[Austrian Empire]].\n\nIoan Dragalina was a descendant of a military family. His father, Alexandru Dragalina, served as an officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] until his resignation in 1859. His parents moved to Romania, where his father was appointed administrator of the border region. However, Marta Lazaroni, his mother, wanted to give birth in her ancestral home and thus the family returned to Karansebesch, where in 1860 Ioan, the first of their four sons, was born.\n\n==Education and early life==\nIoan Dragalina went to primary school in Karansebesch and then to military school in Temesv\u00e1r ([[Timi\u0219oara]]). He continued his studies at the Military Academy in Vienna (1884) and joined the Austro-Hungarian Army. While at the Military Academy, he enrolled and graduated from the School of Geodetic Engineering. In 1886, he married Elena Giurginca. They had six children: two sons (Corneliu \u2013 born in 1887, and Virgiliu \u2013 born in 1890) and four daughters (Aurora, Elena, Cornelia and Viorica).\n\nLike his father, Dragalina graduated from the [[Wiener Neustadt]] [[Theresian Military Academy|Military Academy]], where he specialized in geodetic engineering. Dragalina served as a lieutenant in the Line Regiment No. 43, which was headquartered in Kar\u00e1nsebes. During the Hungarian parliamentary elections of 1884, two candidates were competing in [[Boks\u00e1nb\u00e1nya]]: the would-be Hungarian Prime Minister [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]] and the lawyer [[Coriolan Brediceanu]] of the [[Romanian National Party]]. Lieutenant Dragalina was in command of the troops assigned with maintaining order during the elections. Dragalina refused the instructions of the local civil authorities: to allow only the voters supporting the Hungarian candidate to pass. In response, Dragalina was publicly humiliated to the point of demanding satisfaction. Dragalina officially reported this to his superiors, and on 1 December 1887 he resigned from the Austro-Hungarian Army.<ref>Paul Miller, Claire Morelon, Berghahn Books, Nov 29, 2018, ''Embers of Empire: Continuity and Rupture in the Habsburg Successor States after 1918'', pp. 143-144</ref>\n\n==Career in the Romanian Army==\nOn 1 December 1887, Ioan Dragalina resigned from the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and moved to Romania where he joined the [[Romanian Army]] ten days later, retaining his rank of Lieutenant. Thanks to the skills and qualifications he had acquired in Austria-Hungary, Dragalina embarked upon a successful military career in Romania. As Captain Dragalina, he served under then-Colonel [[Constantin Prezan]], a Romanian General during the First World War who eulogized him in 1936: \"to his teachings I owe the tactics and strategy and all I knew and applied during the war and as Chief of the General Staff\".<ref>Paul Miller, Claire Morelon, Berghahn Books, Nov 29, 2018, ''Embers of Empire: Continuity and Rupture in the Habsburg Successor States after 1918'', p. 144</ref>  \n\nHe advanced through the ranks becoming captain in 1892, major in 1899 and lieutenant-colonel in 1908. Between 1908 and 1911, lieutenant-colonel Dragalina was the commander of the Military Infantry School in Bucharest. For his work in developing the scientific curriculum and for the order and discipline instilled in the military education system, Ioan Dragalina was made a member of the [[Order of the Star of Romania]], First class.\n\nIn April 1911, colonel Ioan Dragalina took over the command of the 34th Regiment in [[Constan\u0163a]]. During this time, he was made a member of the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]], Fourth Class. In 1915 he was promoted to Brigadier General and had under his command the Third Territorial Commandment.\n\nDuring the years of Romania's neutrality, Dragalina worked on fortifications in the Prahova Valley.\n\n==World War I==\nIn 1916, prior to Romania entering the First World War on the side of the Allied Forces, Dragalina was named commander of the First Infantry Division, stationed at Drobeta-Turnu Severin. His troops patrolled a very large area on the western border, extending from the sources of the [[Arge\u015f River]] to the city of [[Calafat]]. \n\n===Capture of Orsova===\n{{Further information|Battle of Orsova}}\nThe Romanian 1st Division - part of General [[Ioan Culcer]]'s [[First Army (Romania)|1st Army]] - took the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] town of Orsova ([[Or\u0219ova]]) in the [[Banat]] region on 4 September. The division was commanded by General Ioan Dragalina. The battle started on the morning of 28 August, with a bombardment of [[Turnu Severin]] by the ''\u00c1lmos''. The monitor had left Orsova at dawn, shelling harbor facilities, the rail yards, a cavalry barracks and some shipyards at Turnu Severin, where Dragalina's division had its headquarters. The Austrian warship fired almost 500 artillery rounds of 75 mm, as well as considerable machine gun fire. Returning upstream to Orsova, ''\u00c1lmos'' couldn't overcome the current until her crew threw 25 tons of coal overboard. In retaliation, the Romanians under Dragalina put Orsova under artillery fire around noon on that day. Dragalina recognized the Alion Height, towering above the city on the east side of the Cerna's mouth, as the key to the Austrian position. The Romanians launched a full-scale assault on 1 September, their numbers enabling them to take the Alion Height by the end of the day. A simultaneous diversionary attack to the north on that same day enabled the Romanians to capture Meh\u00e1dia (today [[Mehadia]]) and Herkulesf\u00fcrd\u0151 (today [[B\u0103ile Herculane]]). The Austro-Hungarians conducted a rear-guard action, but lost Orsova along with the west bank of the Cerna on 4 September, retreating north of Meh\u00e1dia.<ref>Michael B.

On 24 October 1916, General Dragalina was summoned to Craiova and ordered to take over the command of the First Army. He decided to fight Kneu\u00dfl in the mountains and called upon his Romanian soldiers:\n\n''\"Officers and soldiers of the First Romanian Army, from this moment on I am at the helm of the army and demand from all of you, from General to the last soldier: first that you defend with your life the sacred ground of our fatherland, our ancestral home, our land and the honor of the Romanian name. I demand from all of you total discipline and the strictest execution of orders. The troop which cannot advance should die fighting.\"''\n\nEarly on the morning of 25 October 1916 General Dragalina left by car for the Jiu Vally, accompanied by two officers \u2013 Colonel Toma Dumitrescu and Major Constantin Militiade. He wanted personally to assess the situation on the front and reconnect with his military leaders, since phone lines were out of order.<ref>{{citation\n |last        = Sperlea\n |first       = Florin\n |title       = Cum a murit generalul Dragalina?

He stopped there to confess and take communion. While crossing the narrow Lainici bridge on his way back, the car was caught in machine gun cross fire. Speeding under a hail of bullets, his driver managed to cross the bridge, but the General was hit in his left upper arm and scapula.\n\nDragalina was urgently transported to the medical outpost at [[Gura Sadului]], where the wound was disinfected and his arm was bandaged. From Gura Sadului he was transported to [[T\u00e2rgu Jiu]] and that very same day to Craiova, where doctors recommended amputation. However, a telegram from Military Headquarters in Bucharest ordered his urgent transfer by train to the Military Hospital at the Royal Palace in Bucharest. The tedious and long trip delayed his arrival (the train arrived in Bucharest on the evening of 13 October) and his wound became infected. In Bucharest, doctors disinfected the wound, extracted the bullet from his scapula, and set his arm in a cast. \n\nOn his hospital bed, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania]] conferred upon him the [[Order of Michael the Brave]]. On 16 October 1916 his left arm was amputated. His condition began to ameliorate, but then [[sepsis]] set in. He died on the evening of 9 November 1916.<ref>John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, ''A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres'', p. 248</ref>\n\nMemorial services were held at Biserica Alb\u0103 in Bucharest. In attendance were King Ferdinand and Prince [[Carol II of Romania|Carol]] (the future King Carol II) as well as many political personalities: [[Ion I.C. Br\u0103tianu]] (Prime-Minister of Romania), [[Vintil\u0103 Br\u0103tianu]] (War Minister), the writer [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu-Delavrancea]], Mihai Cantacuzino (Justice Minister), [[Take Ionescu]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs), Henry Catargi (Marshal of the Royal Palace), generals and foreign military attach\u00e9s in Romania. He was laid to rest in the Heroes' Cemetery ([[Bellu cemetery|Bellu Military Cemetery]]) in Bucharest.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Dragalina.jpg|thumb|Site where Dragalina was wounded]]\nAlthough he was in command of the 1st Army for only one day (24-25 October 1916), it is General Dragalina who is credited with the Romanian [[First Battle of the Jiu Valley|success]] at the Jiu Valley, the most conspicuous Romanian victory of the 1916 campaign, given that it was achieved against forces superior in both numbers and artillery. Dragalina had inferior numbers and no reserves, but addressed the issue of his numerically inferior forces by borrowing detachments from two nearby groups. Although he was wounded in action and replaced as commander of the 1st Army on 25 October, his dispositions - made with great tactical skill - ensured the success of the Romanian counterattack which began on 27 October, and lasted as late as 1 November.<ref>John Buchan, T.

Among these:\n\n* A memorial in the Jiu gorge near the spot where General Dragalina was wounded, erected on 12 October 1927\n* A bronze statue was placed in front of the military barracks, in the Park General Ioan Dragalina in Caransebe\u0219.

As Captain Dragalina, he served under then-Colonel [[Constantin Prezan]], a Romanian General during the First World War who eulogized him in 1936: \"to his teachings I owe the tactics and strategy and all I knew and applied during the war and as Chief of the General Staff\".<ref>Paul Miller, Claire Morelon, Berghahn Books, Nov 29, 2018, ''Embers of Empire: Continuity and Rupture in the Habsburg Successor States after 1918'', p. 144</ref>  \n\nHe advanced through the ranks becoming captain in 1892, major in 1899 and lieutenant-colonel in 1908. Between 1908 and 1911, lieutenant-colonel Dragalina was the commander of the Military Infantry School in Bucharest. For his work in developing the scientific curriculum and for the order and discipline instilled in the military education system, Ioan Dragalina was made a member of the [[Order of the Star of Romania]], First class.\n\nIn April 1911, colonel Ioan Dragalina took over the command of the 34th Regiment in [[Constan\u0163a]]. During this time, he was made a member of the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]], Fourth Class. In 1915 he was promoted to Brigadier General and had under his command the Third Territorial Commandment.\n\nDuring the years of Romania's neutrality, Dragalina worked on fortifications in the Prahova Valley.\n\n==World War I==\nIn 1916, prior to Romania entering the First World War on the side of the Allied Forces, Dragalina was named commander of the First Infantry Division, stationed at Drobeta-Turnu Severin. His troops patrolled a very large area on the western border, extending from the sources of the [[Arge\u015f River]] to the city of [[Calafat]]. \n\n===Capture of Orsova===\n{{Further information|Battle of Orsova}}\nThe Romanian 1st Division - part of General [[Ioan Culcer]]'s [[First Army (Romania)|1st Army]] - took the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] town of Orsova ([[Or\u0219ova]]) in the [[Banat]] region on 4 September. The division was commanded by General Ioan Dragalina. The battle started on the morning of 28 August, with a bombardment of [[Turnu Severin]] by the ''\u00c1lmos''. The monitor had left Orsova at dawn, shelling harbor facilities, the rail yards, a cavalry barracks and some shipyards at Turnu Severin, where Dragalina's division had its headquarters. The Austrian warship fired almost 500 artillery rounds of 75 mm, as well as considerable machine gun fire. Returning upstream to Orsova, ''\u00c1lmos'' couldn't overcome the current until her crew threw 25 tons of coal overboard. In retaliation, the Romanians under Dragalina put Orsova under artillery fire around noon on that day. Dragalina recognized the Alion Height, towering above the city on the east side of the Cerna's mouth, as the key to the Austrian position. The Romanians launched a full-scale assault on 1 September, their numbers enabling them to take the Alion Height by the end of the day. A simultaneous diversionary attack to the north on that same day enabled the Romanians to capture Meh\u00e1dia (today [[Mehadia]]) and Herkulesf\u00fcrd\u0151 (today [[B\u0103ile Herculane]]). The Austro-Hungarians conducted a rear-guard action, but lost Orsova along with the west bank of the Cerna on 4 September, retreating north of Meh\u00e1dia.<ref>Michael B.

On 24 October 1916, General Dragalina was summoned to Craiova and ordered to take over the command of the First Army. He decided to fight Kneu\u00dfl in the mountains and called upon his Romanian soldiers:\n\n''\"Officers and soldiers of the First Romanian Army, from this moment on I am at the helm of the army and demand from all of you, from General to the last soldier: first that you defend with your life the sacred ground of our fatherland, our ancestral home, our land and the honor of the Romanian name. I demand from all of you total discipline and the strictest execution of orders. The troop which cannot advance should die fighting.\"''\n\nEarly on the morning of 25 October 1916 General Dragalina left by car for the Jiu Vally, accompanied by two officers \u2013 Colonel Toma Dumitrescu and Major Constantin Militiade. He wanted personally to assess the situation on the front and reconnect with his military leaders, since phone lines were out of order.<ref>{{citation\n |last        = Sperlea\n |first       = Florin\n |title       = Cum a murit generalul Dragalina?

He stopped there to confess and take communion. While crossing the narrow Lainici bridge on his way back, the car was caught in machine gun cross fire. Speeding under a hail of bullets, his driver managed to cross the bridge, but the General was hit in his left upper arm and scapula.\n\nDragalina was urgently transported to the medical outpost at [[Gura Sadului]], where the wound was disinfected and his arm was bandaged. From Gura Sadului he was transported to [[T\u00e2rgu Jiu]] and that very same day to Craiova, where doctors recommended amputation. However, a telegram from Military Headquarters in Bucharest ordered his urgent transfer by train to the Military Hospital at the Royal Palace in Bucharest. The tedious and long trip delayed his arrival (the train arrived in Bucharest on the evening of 13 October) and his wound became infected. In Bucharest, doctors disinfected the wound, extracted the bullet from his scapula, and set his arm in a cast. \n\nOn his hospital bed, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania]] conferred upon him the [[Order of Michael the Brave]]. On 16 October 1916 his left arm was amputated. His condition began to ameliorate, but then [[sepsis]] set in. He died on the evening of 9 November 1916.<ref>John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, ''A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres'', p. 248</ref>\n\nMemorial services were held at Biserica Alb\u0103 in Bucharest. In attendance were King Ferdinand and Prince [[Carol II of Romania|Carol]] (the future King Carol II) as well as many political personalities: [[Ion I.C. Br\u0103tianu]] (Prime-Minister of Romania), [[Vintil\u0103 Br\u0103tianu]] (War Minister), the writer [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu-Delavrancea]], Mihai Cantacuzino (Justice Minister), [[Take Ionescu]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs), Henry Catargi (Marshal of the Royal Palace), generals and foreign military attach\u00e9s in Romania. He was laid to rest in the Heroes' Cemetery ([[Bellu cemetery|Bellu Military Cemetery]]) in Bucharest.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Dragalina.jpg|thumb|Site where Dragalina was wounded]]\nAlthough he was in command of the 1st Army for only one day (24-25 October 1916), it is General Dragalina who is credited with the Romanian [[First Battle of the Jiu Valley|success]] at the Jiu Valley, the most conspicuous Romanian victory of the 1916 campaign, given that it was achieved against forces superior in both numbers and artillery. Dragalina had inferior numbers and no reserves, but addressed the issue of his numerically inferior forces by borrowing detachments from two nearby groups. Although he was wounded in action and replaced as commander of the 1st Army on 25 October, his dispositions - made with great tactical skill - ensured the success of the Romanian counterattack which began on 27 October, and lasted as late as 1 November.<ref>John Buchan, T.

Among these:\n\n* A memorial in the Jiu gorge near the spot where General Dragalina was wounded, erected on 12 October 1927\n* A bronze statue was placed in front of the military barracks, in the Park General Ioan Dragalina in Caransebe\u0219.

{"title_page": "List of diplomatic missions of Germany", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n[[Image:Diplomatic missions of Germany.png|thumb|right|400px|Diplomatic missions of Germany]]\nThis is a '''list of diplomatic missions of Germany'''. Historically, the German state of [[Prussia]] and several smaller German states had sent emissaries abroad prior to the establishment of the [[North German Confederation]], the precursor to the modern [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]].\n\nIn 1874, Germany had only four embassies (in [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Saint Petersburg]], and [[Vienna]]), but this was complemented by non-ambassadorial representation in the form of 14 ministerial posts (in [[Athens]], [[Bern]], [[Brussels]], [[The Hague]], [[Constantinople]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Lisbon]], [[Madrid]], [[Rome]], [[Stockholm]], [[Peking]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and to the [[Holy See]]), seven consulates-general with diplomatic status (in [[Alexandria]], [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]], [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Budapest]], and [[Warsaw]]), and 37 consulates and vice-consulates headed by consular officers. By 1914, five additional embassies were established in [[Constantinople]], [[Madrid]], [[Rome]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Tokyo]]. The Foreign Office progressively reformed itself at this time to serve Germany's rising commercial and colonial interests abroad, as well as to reflect the professionalization of [[diplomacy]] generally.\n\nPolitics of the [[Third Reich]] affected the Foreign Office. In 1935 the [[Reich Citizenship Law|Reich Citizenship Act]] led to the forced retirement of over 120 tenured civil servants. Positions and structures were created to imbed [[NSDAP]] representatives, and the [[SS]] began to be posted abroad as \"police attach\u00e9s\". Under [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] the Reich Foreign Ministry grew from 2,665 officers in 1938 to a peak of 6,458 in 1943, despite missions abroad closing as a consequence of the [[Second World War]].\n\nGermany's post-war diplomatic network started as early as 1949 with a mission in [[Paris]] to the newly formed [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. The following year consulates-general were (re)opened in [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Istanbul]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Rome]], and [[Athens]] (until 1951 these were not embassies, as by virtue of the Occupation Statute the three allied powers had competence of foreign affairs; these consulates were intended to just manage commercial and consular affairs).  [[West Germany]]'s [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]] grew, and by the time of Germany's reunification in 1990, there were 214 diplomatic missions abroad. Following [[German reunification]], the Federal Republic inherited several diplomatic representations of the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (East Germany)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] of former [[East Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/AAmt/Geschichte/GeschichteAApdf.pdf|title=The History of the German Foreign Office|first=Ludwig|last=Biewer|website=auswaertiges-amt.de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621165456/https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/AAmt/Geschichte/GeschichteAApdf.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe West German embassy in [[Stockholm]] was [[West German embassy siege|occupied]] by the [[Red Army Faction]] in 1975. In 1989 its embassies in [[Embassy of Germany in Budapest|Budapest]] and [[Embassy of Germany in Prague|Prague]] sheltered fleeing East Germans while waiting for permission to travel onwards to West Germany; permission was subsequently given by the Czechoslovakian and Hungarian governments, accelerating the collapse of socialist hegemony in Eastern Europe. \n\nGermany \"assists\" [[Sweden]] in its duties as protecting power for several Western states in [[North Korea]] \"when necessary\".\n\nToday Germany manages 226 diplomatic missions abroad (listed below). There are also 354 unpaid honorary consuls.\n\n==Africa==\n[[File:German Embassy, central Baghdad, Iraq.jpg|thumb|right|German Embassy in Baghdad]]\n[[Image:Nesterov pal\u00e1c

Under [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] the Reich Foreign Ministry grew from 2,665 officers in 1938 to a peak of 6,458 in 1943, despite missions abroad closing as a consequence of the [[Second World War]].\n\nGermany's post-war diplomatic network started as early as 1949 with a mission in [[Paris]] to the newly formed [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. The following year consulates-general were (re)opened in [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Istanbul]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Rome]], and [[Athens]] (until 1951 these were not embassies, as by virtue of the Occupation Statute the three allied powers had competence of foreign affairs; these consulates were intended to just manage commercial and consular affairs).  [[West Germany]]'s [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]] grew, and by the time of Germany's reunification in 1990, there were 214 diplomatic missions abroad. Following [[German reunification]], the Federal Republic inherited several diplomatic representations of the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (East Germany)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] of former [[East Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/AAmt/Geschichte/GeschichteAApdf.pdf|title=The History of the German Foreign Office|first=Ludwig|last=Biewer|website=auswaertiges-amt.de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621165456/https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/AAmt/Geschichte/GeschichteAApdf.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe West German embassy in [[Stockholm]] was [[West German embassy siege|occupied]] by the [[Red Army Faction]] in 1975.

McKay brought this to the attention of [[Greene Vardiman Black]], and Black's interest was followed by greater interest within the dental profession.\n\nInitial hypotheses for the staining included poor nutrition, overconsumption of pork or milk, [[radium]] exposure, [[List of childhood diseases|childhood disease]]s, or a [[calcium]] deficiency in the local drinking water.<ref name=\"csdshistory\" /> In 1931, researchers from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) concluded that the cause of the [[Colorado]] stain was a high concentration of fluoride ions in the region's drinking water (ranging from 2 to 13.7&nbsp;mg/L) and areas with lower concentrations had no staining (1&nbsp;mg/L or less).<ref>Meiers, Peter: [http://www.fluoride-history.de/bauxite.htm \"The Bauxite Story \u2013 A look at ALCOA\"], from the [http://www.fluoride-history.de Fluoride History] website, page accessed May 12, 2006.</ref> Pikes Peak's rock formations contained the mineral [[cryolite]], one of whose constituents is fluorine.  As the rain and snow fell, the resulting runoff water dissolved fluoride which made its way into the water supply.\n\n[[Dentistry|Dental]] and aluminum [[researchers]] then moved toward determining a relatively safe level of [[fluoride]] to be added to water supplies. The research had two goals: (1) to warn communities with a high concentration of fluoride of the danger, initiating a reduction of the fluoride levels in order to reduce incidences of fluorosis, and (2) to encourage communities with a low concentration of fluoride in drinking water to add fluoride in order to help prevent [[tooth decay]]. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.<ref name=US-CDC-WF-Stats-2006 />\n\nIn April 2015, fluoride levels in the United States were lowered for the first time in 50 years, to the minimum recommended levels of 0.7ppm, because too much fluoride exposure has become a common issue for children teeth, visible in the form of white splotches. The basis were the results of two national surveys (1999\u20132004 NHANES) which assessed the prevalence of dental fluorosis, and found that two out of five adolescents had tooth streaking or spottiness on their teeth - an increase of mostly very mild or mild forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/fluoride-levels-us-drinking-water-lowered-splotchy-teeth|title=US lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for first time in over 50 years|date=27 April 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |accessdate=18 May 2017 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/guidelines/|title=U.S. Public Health Service Recommendation for Fluoride Concentration in Drinking Water for the Prevention of Dental Caries|publisher=CDC}}</ref>\n\n=== Early studies ===\n[[Image:H-Trendley-Dean.jpeg|thumb|left|[[H.

State courts consistently held in favor of allowing fluoridation to continue, analogizing fluoridation to mandatory vaccination and the use of other chemicals to clean the public water supply, both of which had a long-standing history of acceptance by courts.\n\nIn 1952, a [[Code of Federal Regulations|Federal Regulation]] was adopted that stated in part, \"The [[Federal Security Agency]] will regard water supplies containing fluorine, within the limitations recommended\nby the Public Health Service, as not actionable under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].\"<ref>17 Fed. Reg. 6743 (July 23, 1952).</ref> <!--what exactly did this do?-->\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Oklahoma]] analogized water fluoridation to mandatory vaccination in a 1954 case.<ref name=\"dowell\">273 P.2d 859, 862\u201363 (Okl. 1954) (available at [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=ok&vol=/supreme/1954/&invol=1954OK194 FindLaw for Legal Professionals])</ref> The court noted, \"we think the weight of well-reasoned modern precedent sustains the right of municipalities to adopt such reasonable and undiscriminating measures to improve their water supplies as are necessary to protect and improve the public health, even though no epidemic is imminent and no contagious disease or virus is directly involved .... To us it seems ridiculous and of no consequence in considering the public health phase of the case that the substance to be added to the water may be classed as a mineral rather than a drug, antiseptic or germ killer; just as it is of little, if any, consequence whether fluoridation accomplishes its beneficial result to the public health by killing germs in the water, or by hardening the teeth or building up immunity in them to the bacteria that causes caries or tooth decay. If the latter, there can be no distinction on principle between it and compulsory vaccination or inoculation, which, for many years, has been well-established as a valid exercise of police power.\"<ref name=\"dowell\" />\n\nIn the 1955 case ''Froncek v. City of Milwaukee'', the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] affirmed the ruling of a circuit court which held that \"the fluoridation is not the practice of medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy, by the City\" and that \"the legislation is a public health measure, bearing a real, substantial, and reasonable relation to the health of the city.\"<ref>69 N.W.2d 242, 252 (Wis. 1955)</ref>\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Ohio]], in 1955's ''Kraus v. City of Cleveland'', said, \"Plaintiff's argument that fluoridation constitutes mass medication, the unlawful practice of medicine and adulteration may be answered as a whole. Clearly, the addition of fluorides to the water supply does not violate such principles any more than the chlorination of water, which has been held valid many times.\"<ref>127 N.E.2d 609, 613 (Ohio 1955)</ref>\n\n==== Fluoridation consensus ====\nIn 1973, as cases continued to be brought in state courts, a consensus developed that fluoridation, at least from a legal standpoint, was acceptable.<ref name=\"beck\">Beck v.

The matter is no longer an open question.\"<ref name=\"beck\" />\n\n==== Contemporary challenges ====\nMuch of the contemporary debate on water fluoridation revolves around questions of how consumer demand for fluoride is determined and processed, which fluoridation costs and benefits are considered, how conflicts over its provision and production are addressed or resolved, and how the merits of relevant health policies can be equally recast in terms of their presumed demerits.<ref>Roger Lee Mendoza (2011).

All the affected children were from the [[Pikes Peak]] region.  Despite the negative impact on the physical appearance of their teeth, the children with stained, mottled and pitted teeth also had fewer cavities than other children.  McKay brought this to the attention of [[Greene Vardiman Black]], and Black's interest was followed by greater interest within the dental profession.\n\nInitial hypotheses for the staining included poor nutrition, overconsumption of pork or milk, [[radium]] exposure, [[List of childhood diseases|childhood disease]]s, or a [[calcium]] deficiency in the local drinking water.<ref name=\"csdshistory\" /> In 1931, researchers from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) concluded that the cause of the [[Colorado]] stain was a high concentration of fluoride ions in the region's drinking water (ranging from 2 to 13.7&nbsp;mg/L) and areas with lower concentrations had no staining (1&nbsp;mg/L or less).<ref>Meiers, Peter: [http://www.fluoride-history.de/bauxite.htm \"The Bauxite Story \u2013 A look at ALCOA\"], from the [http://www.fluoride-history.de Fluoride History] website, page accessed May 12, 2006.</ref> Pikes Peak's rock formations contained the mineral [[cryolite]], one of whose constituents is fluorine.  As the rain and snow fell, the resulting runoff water dissolved fluoride which made its way into the water supply.\n\n[[Dentistry|Dental]] and aluminum [[researchers]] then moved toward determining a relatively safe level of [[fluoride]] to be added to water supplies. The research had two goals: (1) to warn communities with a high concentration of fluoride of the danger, initiating a reduction of the fluoride levels in order to reduce incidences of fluorosis, and (2) to encourage communities with a low concentration of fluoride in drinking water to add fluoride in order to help prevent [[tooth decay]]. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.<ref name=US-CDC-WF-Stats-2006 />\n\nIn April 2015, fluoride levels in the United States were lowered for the first time in 50 years, to the minimum recommended levels of 0.7ppm, because too much fluoride exposure has become a common issue for children teeth, visible in the form of white splotches. The basis were the results of two national surveys (1999\u20132004 NHANES) which assessed the prevalence of dental fluorosis, and found that two out of five adolescents had tooth streaking or spottiness on their teeth - an increase of mostly very mild or mild forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/fluoride-levels-us-drinking-water-lowered-splotchy-teeth|title=US lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for first time in over 50 years|date=27 April 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |accessdate=18 May 2017 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/guidelines/|title=U.S. Public Health Service Recommendation for Fluoride Concentration in Drinking Water for the Prevention of Dental Caries|publisher=CDC}}</ref>\n\n=== Early studies ===\n[[Image:H-Trendley-Dean.jpeg|thumb|left|[[H.

State courts consistently held in favor of allowing fluoridation to continue, analogizing fluoridation to mandatory vaccination and the use of other chemicals to clean the public water supply, both of which had a long-standing history of acceptance by courts.\n\nIn 1952, a [[Code of Federal Regulations|Federal Regulation]] was adopted that stated in part, \"The [[Federal Security Agency]] will regard water supplies containing fluorine, within the limitations recommended\nby the Public Health Service, as not actionable under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].\"<ref>17 Fed. Reg. 6743 (July 23, 1952).</ref> <!--what exactly did this do?-->\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Oklahoma]] analogized water fluoridation to mandatory vaccination in a 1954 case.<ref name=\"dowell\">273 P.2d 859, 862\u201363 (Okl. 1954) (available at [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=ok&vol=/supreme/1954/&invol=1954OK194 FindLaw for Legal Professionals])</ref> The court noted, \"we think the weight of well-reasoned modern precedent sustains the right of municipalities to adopt such reasonable and undiscriminating measures to improve their water supplies as are necessary to protect and improve the public health, even though no epidemic is imminent and no contagious disease or virus is directly involved .... To us it seems ridiculous and of no consequence in considering the public health phase of the case that the substance to be added to the water may be classed as a mineral rather than a drug, antiseptic or germ killer; just as it is of little, if any, consequence whether fluoridation accomplishes its beneficial result to the public health by killing germs in the water, or by hardening the teeth or building up immunity in them to the bacteria that causes caries or tooth decay. If the latter, there can be no distinction on principle between it and compulsory vaccination or inoculation, which, for many years, has been well-established as a valid exercise of police power.\"<ref name=\"dowell\" />\n\nIn the 1955 case ''Froncek v. City of Milwaukee'', the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] affirmed the ruling of a circuit court which held that \"the fluoridation is not the practice of medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy, by the City\" and that \"the legislation is a public health measure, bearing a real, substantial, and reasonable relation to the health of the city.\"<ref>69 N.W.2d 242, 252 (Wis. 1955)</ref>\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Ohio]], in 1955's ''Kraus v. City of Cleveland'', said, \"Plaintiff's argument that fluoridation constitutes mass medication, the unlawful practice of medicine and adulteration may be answered as a whole. Clearly, the addition of fluorides to the water supply does not violate such principles any more than the chlorination of water, which has been held valid many times.\"<ref>127 N.E.2d 609, 613 (Ohio 1955)</ref>\n\n==== Fluoridation consensus ====\nIn 1973, as cases continued to be brought in state courts, a consensus developed that fluoridation, at least from a legal standpoint, was acceptable.<ref name=\"beck\">Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, 30 Cal. App. 3d 112, 115 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1973) (citations omitted).</ref>  In 1973's ''Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills'', the [[California Court of Appeal]], Second District, said, \"Courts through the United States have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] in the interest of public health. The matter is no longer an open question.\"<ref name=\"beck\" />\n\n==== Contemporary challenges ====\nMuch of the contemporary debate on water fluoridation revolves around questions of how consumer demand for fluoride is determined and processed, which fluoridation costs and benefits are considered, how conflicts over its provision and production are addressed or resolved, and how the merits of relevant health policies can be equally recast in terms of their presumed demerits.<ref>Roger Lee Mendoza (2011).

For instance, in 2002, the city of [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]], California, chose to disregard a California law mandating fluoridation of water systems with 10,000 or more hookups, and the dispute between the city and the state ended up in court.  The trial court and the intermediate appellate court ruled in favor of the state and its fluoridation mandate, and the Supreme Court of California declined to hear the case in February 2006.<ref>Jones, Donna [http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2006/February/10/local/stories/07local.htm \"Supreme Court turns down Watsonville's appeal to keep fluoride out of its water.\"] Santa Cruz Sentinel.

The local ordinance was preempted by [[California]] law that requires fluoridation when an outside funding source is available.  In 2008, First 5 Commission of San Diego County, a state-funded child advocacy organization, provided nearly $4 million to San Diego, for fluoridation equipment and operating costs for the first two years of fluoridation.<ref name=\"sandiego00\">{{cite web  |url=http://www.sandiego.gov/water/quality/fluoridation.shtml |title=Water Fluoridation |accessdate=December 27, 2014 |work=www.sandiego.gov}}</ref>  That organization is funded with tobacco taxes instituted by [[California Proposition 10 (1998)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://first5sandiego.org/about-first-5-san-diego/ |title=About First 5 San Diego |accessdate=December 27, 2014 |work=first5sandiego.org}}</ref>  San Diego raises the fluoride level of its water to 0.7&nbsp;mg/L, as recommended by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]].<ref name=\"sandiego00\"/>\n\nIn 2012, [[New Hampshire]] began requiring public water systems that fluoridate to post the following notice in their consumer confidence reports:  \"Your public water supply is fluoridated.

{"title_page": "Bucharest student movement of 1956", "text_new": "{{Communist Romania}}\nThe [[Polish October|events in Poland]] which led to the elimination of that country's [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] leadership and the rise to power of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] on 19 October 1956 provoked unrest among university students in [[Eastern bloc]] countries. The state of unrest in [[Communist Poland]] began to spread into [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]. As early as 16 October 1956, students from [[Szeged]] left the [[Hungarian Workers' Party|Communist]]-created students' union (DISZ), re-establishing the MEFESZ (Union of Hungarian University and Academy Students), a democratic organisation that the regime of [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] had suppressed. Within a few days, students from [[P\u00e9cs]], [[Miskolc]] and [[Sopron]] had done likewise. On 22 October 1956, students from the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] [[Demands of Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1956|compiled a list]] of sixteen points containing key national policy demands. When they found out about the intention of the [[Hungarian Writers' Union]] to express its solidarity with Poland by placing a crown near the statue of Polish general [[J\u00f3zef Bem]], a hero of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolution of 1848-49]], the students decided to organise a parallel demonstration in support of the Poles. At the protest on the afternoon of 23 October 1956, the students read their proclamation, an act that marked the beginning of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].\n\nAlthough no student protests in support of Gomu\u0142ka took place in [[Communist Romania]], the majority of Romanian students were informed about the situation in Hungary, partly through [[Radio Free Europe]] and other Western radio stations. Their interpretation of the events in Hungary was that, under communism, students were the group that had to initiate such protests, and that, once begun, the revolt would be joined by the masses at large.\n\n==Student protests are organised==\n\nRomanian students closely followed the unfolding events in Hungary, not only in Bucharest, but also Timi\u0219oara, Cluj, T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f, and Ia\u015fi.<ref>Johanna Granville,[http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/142  \"If Hope is Sin, Then We Are All Guilty: Romanian Students\u2019 Reactions to the Hungarian Revolution and Soviet Intervention, 1956-1958\"], Carl Beck Paper, no. 1905 (April 2008): 1-78. {{open access}}</ref> At first, different students would exchange information they had heard on the radio or from other sources and discussed their prospects for undertaking similar actions. The students did not form committees, which the authorities might have considered to be clandestine organisations and attract a repression by the state security apparatus. Instead, action groups appeared in the city's different faculties.\n\nStudents in each faculty reacted differently. The most active groups were formed in the Faculties of Law, Letters, Theatre, Medicine, Architecture, Journalism, and Philosophy, as well as at the Medical-Military Institute and at the [[University Politehnica of Bucharest|Politehnica]]. Students' reactions were far more cautious in other technical learning institutes (Petroleum and Gas, Agronomy), in the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculties of Mathematics, Geography and History, and in the [[Academy of Economic Studies|Institute of Economic Sciences]].\n\nA precise list of students involved in organising protests is difficult to reconstruct. The only sources are transcripts of the trials that followed the movement's crushing, data presented in sessions to unmask rebel students and data regarding the expulsions which followed. From these sources, there emerge the following names of student organisers:\n\n* Faculty of Law: [[Eugenia Florescu]], [[Dan Mugur Rusiecki]], [[Radu Surdulescu]], [[Florin Caba]], [[Mircea Tatos]], [[Aurel Moldovan]], [[Ligia Filotti]], [[Rodica Ojog]], [[Magda Dumitrescu]], [[Rodica Baroi]], [[C\u0103lin Chiser]], [[Ligia Teodorescu]], [[Mihai Cezar Busuioc]], [[Alexandru Dinc\u0103 (journalist)|Alexandru Dinc\u0103]], [[Rodica Bujoreanu]], [[Vladimir Trifu]], [[Marin St\u0103nescu]];\n* Faculty of Medicine: [[Alexandru Ivasiuc]], Mihail Victor Serdaru, Constantin Iliescu, Dan Constantin Stavarache, Mirel Trifu, \u015eerban-Horia Popescu, Radu Cern\u0103ianu, Remus Petcu, Alexandru T\u0103taru, Vasile Br\u00e2nzan, Paul Iliescu, Octavian Lup\u0103\u015fteanu, Mircea Selten;\n* Faculty of Letters: [[Teodor Lupa\u015f]], [[\u015etefan Negrea]], [[Mihai R\u0103dulescu]], [[Christa Depner]], [[Steliana Pogorilovschi]] (Stela Covaci), [[Aurel Covaci]], [[Paul Goma]], [[Horia Florian Popescu]], [[Gloria Barna]], [[Grigore Vere\u015f]];\n* Institute of Theatre: [[Alexandru M\u0103linescu]], Petre Gheorghe, Adrian Ianuli, Gabriela Cocora;\n* Faculty of Architecture: Alexandru T\u0103taru, Dan Stoica;\n* Faculty of Journalism: Dumitru Panaitescu-Perpessicius;\n* Faculty of Philosophy: Mihai Stere Derdena, Dan Onaca, Costel Dumitrescu, Dumitru Arvat, Alexandru Bulai, Ioan Zane, Aurel Lupu, Romulus Resiga, Constantin Dumitru;\n* Polytechnic Institute: [[Marin Petri\u015for]], [[Horia \u015eerban Popescu]], [[Marian Rozenzweig]], [[Tiberiu Ionescu]], [[Adrian Cristea]], [[Nicolae Cern\u0103ianu]];\n* Construction Institute: [[Radu Gabrea]];\n* Medical-Military Institute: [[Bebe Br\u00e2nzan]], [[Paul Iliescu]], [[Remus Petcu]].\n\nMany other students were active during those days.\n\n==The first actions==\n\nAlthough students admired the Hungarian revolutionaries, they were somewhat reserved as concerns their leader, [[Imre Nagy]]. Nagy had lived in the [[Soviet Union]] from 1929 to 1944, and, by their own experience, Romanians saw communist leaders brought in and installed by the [[Red Army]] to be far worse than home-grown communists.\n\nThe students who were watching the situation in Hungary were also attentive to the international situation. Although Western radio stations assured the revolutionaries of the West's support, Romanian students were quite sceptical as they saw the [[United States]]' and the Western European powers' passive attitude and abstention from armed intervention.\n\nDespite these doubts, the first protest actions began within days after the Hungarian Revolution started. Similar ferment existed not only in Bucharest, but in other university cities too, particularly in [[Timi\u0219oara]], [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] and [[Ia\u015fi]]. Although information on what was happening did travel between these cities, coordinating actions would have been impossible in the highly repressive state that Romania was at the time, and students in each city acted independently of one another.\n\n===The state leadership is invited to a dialogue===\n\nA first protest began when students from the Faculty of Letters called on [[Iosif Chi\u015finevschi]], then vice president of the Council of Ministers, to reply to a list of questions composed by the students. They chose Chi\u015finevschi as an interlocutor not only due to his government position. Unlike in most communist countries in Eastern Europe, there had been no changes in the leadership of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] after [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death. [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] continued to lead the country using the same authoritarian methods and he was not influenced by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 23 February [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]] at the [[20th Congress of the CPSU]], in which Stalin's abuses were denounced and the negative impact of the personality cult was exposed, nor by the reactions of the other communist countries, which purged their Stalinist leadership at least partially. Still, it was known that at the March 1956 Plenum of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, [[Miron Constantinescu]] and Chi\u015finevschi had opposed Gheorghiu-Dej, arguing for the need of a liberalisation according to Khrushchev's orientation, a proposal categorically rejected by Gheorghiu-Dej. Students interpreted the lack of an armed Soviet intervention in the Hungarian Revolution's first days as Khrushchev's acceptance of the demands of the Hungarian reform movement. Hence, some students considered Iosif Chi\u015finevschi, who had backed the notion of liberalisation, however mild, to be a preferable interlocutor to other hardline leaders.\n\nThe questions they asked were provocative but did not raise ideological issues. Some of these questions were:\n\n#If the regimes in the two countries [Romania and the USSR] are identical and communist internationalism exists, why is [[Bessarabia]] not being given back [to Romania], since that province is Romanian, from an historical point of view?\n#Why must the peasants make children's coffins from fence-posts when Romania has a substantial production of wood?\n#Why must bread be bought with ration cards in an agricultural country?\n#Why is artificial wine being bought from [[Bulgaria]]?\n#Why is there no fish on the market?\n#Why are [[electricity meter]]s being sold to [[North Vietnam|Vietnam]] at a price that does not even cover the packaging?\n#Why is [[methane]] gas being provided to Hungary only for some factories planned for [[natural gas processing]]?\n\nThe goal of this action was to gauge whether at least some members of the communist leadership were prepared to begin a dialogue. For this reason, the questions put forward generally had an economic character and did not raise political issues. However, neither artificial Bulgarian wine nor electricity meters for Vietnam represented a major concern for Romanian students. The questions served as a signal to the party leadership that the students wished for a dialogue, not an ideological confrontation.\n\nNeither Chi\u015finevschi nor any other party leader replied to the invitation. But the invitation demonstrated to those who hesitated to join the movement that more energetic actions were needed as a consequence of the authorities' negative attitude.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Alexandru Malinescu.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Alexandru M\u0103linescu, student at the Institute of Theatre, sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment]] -->\n\n==Preliminary protest actions==\n\nIn many institutes of higher learning, as well as in some high schools, protests began during courses on politics and [[Russian language]]. Faced with hostile students, a number of professors had to leave their classrooms. The faculty received orders to try to calm down the students. For the party leadership, the disturbances that took place during Russian classes were an especially serious matter, as all this occurred in October, a month that had been dedicated to the Romanian-Soviet friendship in honour of the [[October Revolution]].\n\nStudents in a number of faculties asked that delegations from the Central Committee be sent to discuss the situation in Hungary with them. The escalation from the first such demand was clear, as the subject had changed from an economic one to a political one. UTM (''Uniunea Tineretului Muncitoresc'' / Union of Working Youth) sessions were boycotted, but students used several sessions convened for the purpose of resolving administrative problems, to discuss openly the Hungarian Revolution and their need to react to it. UTM leaders and students who were party members and objected to these discussions were thrown out of the conference halls. UTM leaders tried to ally themselves with the mainstream student opinion, showing support for the student movement and hostility toward the intransigent positions taken by the party committees within the faculties.\n[[File:Ligia Filotti 1956.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Ligia Filotti, law student, expelled]]\n\n==The 5 November 1956 protest is organised==\nThe first organisational action was prepared by a clandestine group which created links between all the faculties with a view to organise a protest.\n\nOn 28 October 1956 a radio station calling itself \"Romania of the future. The voice of resistance\" began broadcasting on different wavelengths. It is not known where this secret station was broadcasting from; according to one assumption it was located in  [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The station, considered a nationalist one, presented the students' demands, including:\n* \"the return of the stolen provinces, Bessarabia and [[Bukovina]]\"\n* \"the expulsion from Romania of Stalinists, who compromised communism and brought fear and hunger to the country.\"\n\nOn 29 October 1956 the [[Suez Crisis]] reached dramatic proportions with [[Israel]]'s invasion of [[Egypt]]; this disoriented those students who wanted action. For some more perceptive students, this was a clear signal that the West did not intend to intervene and that the Hungarian revolutionaries, as well as those in Romania, should not count on external assistance. Those more prudent among them considered that without such assistance, their chances of success were minimal. Others expressed contrary views, pointing out that Soviet troops had not intervened and that the Hungarian Revolution was a success, since the communist regime there had practically been overthrown.\n\nAs a result of an attempt to organise a student revolt in Timi\u0219oara, over 3,000 students had been arrested on 30\u201331 October.<ref>\"[http://www.epochtimes-romania.com/articles/article_6500.html 50 de ani de la miscarile studentesti din Timi\u0219oara anului 1956] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115020438/http://www.epochtimes-romania.com/articles/article_6500.html |date=November 15, 2006 }}\", ''[[The Epoch Times]]'', November 6, 2006.</ref> The Bucharest student leaders did not have precise information about what had happened in Timi\u0219oara, but through various indirect channels they had learned that the situation was very serious.\n\nSupport for a student protest had begun to diminish. Aware that if a protest were to take place, it could no longer be delayed, on 2 November 1956 the action committee, led by Alexandru Ivasiuc and Mihai Victor Serdaru, decided to organise a public student gathering. Since the day of 3 November was too soon to ensure sufficient mobilisation, the gathering was scheduled for 5 November in [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]]. The organising committee decided that violence had to be avoided during the protest, and so did any response to provocations. Students from the Faculties of Letters and Law wrote a series of manifestoes in which they presented their demands and urged the rest of the population to side with them. What they asked for was that firm opposition be shown toward the Communist Party's abuses, that a precedent be created for the exercising of democratic rights, including the right to assemble, and that the authorities begin negotiations. The manifestoes also contained slogans such as \"No more Russian and Marxism courses\", \"We demand science, not politics, in universities\" or \"Follow the example of the Hungarian, Czech and Polish students\". The distribution of these manifestoes was stopped when the first arrests took place.<ref>* ''Din \u015fcoal\u0103 \u00een \u00eenchisorile comumiste'' Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103 - 16 ianuarie 2009</ref>\n\nOn 4 November, the Soviet Army unexpectedly occupied Budapest and other vital centres of Hungary. Although the brutal intervention in Hungary was proof that the student protests in Romania had few chances of success, the organisers believed that the movement had to continue and that the protest had to take place. At the same time, some students were arrested in Bucharest, including a few of the initiators of the protest.\n\nOn the night of 4/5 November, troops from the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior of Romania|Ministry of the Interior]] occupied University Square. Traffic was completely stopped, and the entire area normally used by vehicles in front of the university was filled with lorries in which soldiers, armed with automatic weapons, were sitting on benches, ready to intervene. The protest had become absolutely impossible to carry out. Additional armed troops were massed inside the university building and in other nearby buildings. All those who had intended to protest saw what was happening as soon as they entered the square and kept moving. Yet, they were unaware that at the entrances to the square there were party members from the various faculties who were taking down the names of all who walked in that area.\n\n==Repression==\n[[File:Steliana Pogorirovchi.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Steliana Pogorilovschi, student at the Faculty of Journalism, sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment]]\nGiven the repression of the Hungarian Revolution by the Red Army, organising another protest in Bucharest was out of the question. In the universities, acts of dissent ceased. Students from the Faculty of Philosophy did try to organise a new protest on 15 November, but the organisers were arrested before they could go further with their plan.\n\nOn 27 October 1956, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, meeting in a crisis session, had set up a crisis command under the leadership of [[Emil Bodn\u0103ra\u015f]], whose subordinates were [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]], [[Alexandru Dr\u0103ghici]] and [[Leontin S\u0103l\u0103jan]]. The command had extensive powers, including the right to order troops to open fire and to declare a state of emergency in any part of the country. The command had the explicit right to suspend classes in institutes of higher learning.\n\nThe party organs immediately began repressive actions. A whole series of arrests followed, with arrest warrants issued by another special party committee, headed by [[Gheorghe Apostol]]. Investigations were intense; the chief interrogator was Captain Gheorghe Enoiu of the Direction of Penal Investigations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. He was aided by, among others, Lieutenant Major Vasile Dumitrescu, Lieutenant Gheorghe Blidaru, Lieutenant Horia Brestoiu, Lieutenant Nicolae Domni\u0163a, Lieutenant Major Florea Gheorghiu, Lieutenant Major Gheorghe Mih\u0103ilescu, Lieutenant Major Iosif Moldovan, and Lieutenant Major Dumitru Preda.\n\nThe majority of arrests took place in November\u2013December 1956, but arrests continued throughout 1957. Some students were sentenced to 1\u20134 years in prison; some died in prison. For instance, \u015etefan Negrea, a student at the Faculty of Letters, died in [[Gherla prison]] on 3 November 1958.\n\nAt the same time, the universities and other places associated with students were placed under strict surveillance. At the order of the [[Ministry of Education and Research of Romania|Ministry of Education]], actions against students were taken by university administrators: students who were suspected of having approved the movement were expelled and a strict system of surveillance was put in place to monitor the behaviour of students.<ref>Tugui, Pavel - Dosarul studentului Nicolae Manolescu: Povestea unei exmatricul\u0103ri - Revista 22, Nr. 760, 30 September-6 October 2004</ref>  Additionally, student organisations (UTM as well as the Union of Student Associations / ''Uniunea Asocia\u0163iilor Studen\u0163e\u015fti'') organised sessions to unmask \"enemy elements\". At these sessions, not only were students removed from these organisations, but it was asked that they be expelled &ndash; a request immediately granted by the university administration. Those expelled had no right to re-enroll in any institution of higher learning.<ref name =\"simple\" >Corbea, Constan\u0163a - Strivi\u0163i de istorie (M\u0103rturii) - Asymetria 19 Aprilie 2006</ref> Sessions were organised at which students were obliged to express their indignation against those who \"splatter with mud\" Romania's studious youth.<ref name =\"simple\"/> Furthermore, the principal protest organisers were unmasked in public sessions during which their expulsion was requested in view of their status as people enemy to the regime. These actions were coordinated by university party organisations as well as by [[Marxism-Leninism]] departments. (One especially zealous persecutor during this period was Constantin Bulai, who taught Marxism.) Students convinced professors and artists to sign petitions asking that those arrested be freed; as a result, repressive actions intensified and more were condemned and expelled.<ref>*** - Dup\u0103 50 de ani - Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103, Edi\u0163ie special\u0103, 19 December 2006 - 14 January 2007</ref>\n\nAside from the immediate measures taken against those students who headed the protest movement, a series of other organisational repressive measures took place in the political realm. On 13 November, in a session of the Political Bureau, it was decided that the Ministry of Education should draw up \"a concrete programme of measures to lead to an improvement in the social composition of students\". The first to be targeted were former political detainees who had been allowed to return to the universities in 1955-56. Although the great majority of them had not been involved in the protest movement, Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu explicitly asked for this step to be taken in a speech held in Bucharest on 15 November 1956. Around the same time, [[Virgil Trofin]], secretary of the Central Committee of UTM, declared, \"We have to know how many enemies there are in our country and are trying to fight against our party\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nConcurrently, the student organisations were reorganised. [[Ion Iliescu]], who had recently become a member of the UTM Central Committee, was also named president of the Union of Student Associations of the Romanian People's Republic in order to ensure more stringent control by the party over students.<ref># * * * - \u00cen '68 Iliescu a \u00eenfierat un colind de Cr\u0103ciun - Ziarul de Ia\u015fi 19 decembrie 2006</ref> <!-- after removing the pov, this fragment became superfluous  Also of note is the fact that Alexandru Dinc\u0103, a former student at the Faculty of Law sent to prison for his activity in 1956, became the editor of a liberal newspaper, ''Viitorul'', after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].-->\n\nIn an address to the [[Moscow]] [[Komsomol]] on 8 November 1956, Nikita Khrushchev alluded to the student protests, saying that there were ''some unhealthy moods'' among students ''in one of the educational establishments in Romania''.

The students' actions and the repression that followed have not been seriously analysed. [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania|UDMR]] deputy Dezs\u0151-K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Becsek-Garda did make a statement about the subject in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] on 19 October 1999; a few newspaper reports and a short television programme followed. The movement was generally forgotten, at least until the December 2006 publication of the Final Report of the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania]], which devotes a chapter to the events of 1956.\n\nFew of the participants at the centre of the 1956 movement have published memoirs of the events, though Mihai Stere Derdena did write an article in 2002. In 2006, Stela Covaci published a book documenting the communist repression of 1956-58 and the methods used to crush a protest movement run by students and anti-communist writers.\n\nThe Presidential Commission report states that the autumn 1956 student movement was unique in its ability to organise a protest movement with a well-defined programme, with demands covering the entirety of Romanian society. The report concludes that the protest failed due to the lack of a single coordination centre, the lack of support from other societal groups, and the authorities' actions to stop any protest movement.\n\nThese findings have drawn criticism. There was in fact a coordination centre in Bucharest, though it was not structured so as to make it less vulnerable to the machinations of repressive state organs.<!-- From the beginning, students showed that they understood the situation perfectly. They were not launching a mere protest movement, but hoped to initiate reforms; they considered certain conditions necessary for these to take place. They realised that the Western powers were not in the least willing to intervene, having shown to the USSR that it had a free hand in Hungary. Under these conditions, overthrowing the communist regime was impossible and the students' only realistic hope was to find a party leader willing to undertake serious de-Stalinisation. Although, as indicated, at the beginning of their movement they invited leaders of the communist party and attempted to find an interlocutor and have a dialogue, no Romanian party leader could be found to embark at least on the path taken by Khrushchev or Gomu\u0142ka. -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* Johanna Granville, ''If Hope is Sin, Then We Are All Guilty: Romanian Students\u2019 Reactions to the Hungarian Revolution and Soviet Intervention, 1956-1958'' ''Carl Beck Paper,'' no. 1905 (April 2008): 1-78.\n*{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.presidency.ro/static/ordine/RAPORT%20FINAL_%20CADCR.pdf Final Report of the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania], Bucharest, 2006.\n*{{in lang|ro}} \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070905162028/http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=2005-10-26&id=187349 Procesul Comunismului (II)]\", ''[[Ziua]]'', 26 October 2005.\n*{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/steno/steno.stenograma?ids=4361&idm=1,13&idl=1 Parliamentary debate], 19 October 1999.\n*{{in lang|ro}} \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20061102014608/http://www.adevarulonline.ro/2006-10-28/Dosar/loturile-studentilor-arestati-si-condamnati-in-urma-evenimentelor-din-1956_204061.html Loturile studen\u0163ilor aresta\u0163i \u015fi condamna\u0163i \u00een urma evenimentelor din 1956]\", ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'', 12 January 2007.\n*[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809265,00.html \"The Doctor's Story\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', March 25, 1957\n*{{in lang|ro}} Covaci, Stela.

The state of unrest in [[Communist Poland]] began to spread into [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]. As early as 16 October 1956, students from [[Szeged]] left the [[Hungarian Workers' Party|Communist]]-created students' union (DISZ), re-establishing the MEFESZ (Union of Hungarian University and Academy Students), a democratic organisation that the regime of [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] had suppressed. Within a few days, students from [[P\u00e9cs]], [[Miskolc]] and [[Sopron]] had done likewise. On 22 October 1956, students from the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] [[Demands of Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1956|compiled a list]] of sixteen points containing key national policy demands. When they found out about the intention of the [[Hungarian Writers' Union]] to express its solidarity with Poland by placing a crown near the statue of Polish general [[J\u00f3zef Bem]], a hero of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolution of 1848-49]], the students decided to organise a parallel demonstration in support of the Poles. At the protest on the afternoon of 23 October 1956, the students read their proclamation, an act that marked the beginning of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].\n\nAlthough no student protests in support of Gomu\u0142ka took place in [[Communist Romania]], the majority of Romanian students were informed about the situation in Hungary, partly through [[Radio Free Europe]] and other Western radio stations. Their interpretation of the events in Hungary was that, under communism, students were the group that had to initiate such protests, and that, once begun, the revolt would be joined by the masses at large.\n\n==Student protests are organised==\n\nRomanian students closely followed the unfolding events in Hungary, not only in Bucharest, but also Timi\u015foara, Cluj, T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f, and Ia\u015fi.<ref>Johanna Granville,[http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/142  \"If Hope is Sin, Then We Are All Guilty: Romanian Students\u2019 Reactions to the Hungarian Revolution and Soviet Intervention, 1956-1958\"], Carl Beck Paper, no. 1905 (April 2008): 1-78. {{open access}}</ref> At first, different students would exchange information they had heard on the radio or from other sources and discussed their prospects for undertaking similar actions. The students did not form committees, which the authorities might have considered to be clandestine organisations and attract a repression by the state security apparatus. Instead, action groups appeared in the city's different faculties.\n\nStudents in each faculty reacted differently. The most active groups were formed in the Faculties of Law, Letters, Theatre, Medicine, Architecture, Journalism, and Philosophy, as well as at the Medical-Military Institute and at the [[University Politehnica of Bucharest|Politehnica]]. Students' reactions were far more cautious in other technical learning institutes (Petroleum and Gas, Agronomy), in the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculties of Mathematics, Geography and History, and in the [[Academy of Economic Studies|Institute of Economic Sciences]].\n\nA precise list of students involved in organising protests is difficult to reconstruct. The only sources are transcripts of the trials that followed the movement's crushing, data presented in sessions to unmask rebel students and data regarding the expulsions which followed. From these sources, there emerge the following names of student organisers:\n\n* Faculty of Law: [[Eugenia Florescu]], [[Dan Mugur Rusiecki]], [[Radu Surdulescu]], [[Florin Caba]], [[Mircea Tatos]], [[Aurel Moldovan]], [[Ligia Filotti]], [[Rodica Ojog]], [[Magda Dumitrescu]], [[Rodica Baroi]], [[C\u0103lin Chiser]], [[Ligia Teodorescu]], [[Mihai Cezar Busuioc]], [[Alexandru Dinc\u0103 (journalist)|Alexandru Dinc\u0103]], [[Rodica Bujoreanu]], [[Vladimir Trifu]], [[Marin St\u0103nescu]];\n* Faculty of Medicine: [[Alexandru Ivasiuc]], Mihail Victor Serdaru, Constantin Iliescu, Dan Constantin Stavarache, Mirel Trifu, \u015eerban-Horia Popescu, Radu Cern\u0103ianu, Remus Petcu, Alexandru T\u0103taru, Vasile Br\u00e2nzan, Paul Iliescu, Octavian Lup\u0103\u015fteanu, Mircea Selten;\n* Faculty of Letters: [[Teodor Lupa\u015f]], [[\u015etefan Negrea]], [[Mihai R\u0103dulescu]], [[Christa Depner]], [[Steliana Pogorilovschi]] (Stela Covaci), [[Aurel Covaci]], [[Paul Goma]], [[Horia Florian Popescu]], [[Gloria Barna]], [[Grigore Vere\u015f]];\n* Institute of Theatre: [[Alexandru M\u0103linescu]], Petre Gheorghe, Adrian Ianuli, Gabriela Cocora;\n* Faculty of Architecture: Alexandru T\u0103taru, Dan Stoica;\n* Faculty of Journalism: Dumitru Panaitescu-Perpessicius;\n* Faculty of Philosophy: Mihai Stere Derdena, Dan Onaca, Costel Dumitrescu, Dumitru Arvat, Alexandru Bulai, Ioan Zane, Aurel Lupu, Romulus Resiga, Constantin Dumitru;\n* Polytechnic Institute: [[Marin Petri\u015for]], [[Horia \u015eerban Popescu]], [[Marian Rozenzweig]], [[Tiberiu Ionescu]], [[Adrian Cristea]], [[Nicolae Cern\u0103ianu]];\n* Construction Institute: [[Radu Gabrea]];\n* Medical-Military Institute: [[Bebe Br\u00e2nzan]], [[Paul Iliescu]], [[Remus Petcu]].\n\nMany other students were active during those days.\n\n==The first actions==\n\nAlthough students admired the Hungarian revolutionaries, they were somewhat reserved as concerns their leader, [[Imre Nagy]]. Nagy had lived in the [[Soviet Union]] from 1929 to 1944, and, by their own experience, Romanians saw communist leaders brought in and installed by the [[Red Army]] to be far worse than home-grown communists.\n\nThe students who were watching the situation in Hungary were also attentive to the international situation. Although Western radio stations assured the revolutionaries of the West's support, Romanian students were quite sceptical as they saw the [[United States]]' and the Western European powers' passive attitude and abstention from armed intervention.\n\nDespite these doubts, the first protest actions began within days after the Hungarian Revolution started. Similar ferment existed not only in Bucharest, but in other university cities too, particularly in [[Timi\u015foara]], [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] and [[Ia\u015fi]]. Although information on what was happening did travel between these cities, coordinating actions would have been impossible in the highly repressive state that Romania was at the time, and students in each city acted independently of one another.\n\n===The state leadership is invited to a dialogue===\n\nA first protest began when students from the Faculty of Letters called on [[Iosif Chi\u015finevschi]], then vice president of the Council of Ministers, to reply to a list of questions composed by the students. They chose Chi\u015finevschi as an interlocutor not only due to his government position. Unlike in most communist countries in Eastern Europe, there had been no changes in the leadership of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] after [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death. [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] continued to lead the country using the same authoritarian methods and he was not influenced by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 23 February [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]] at the [[20th Congress of the CPSU]], in which Stalin's abuses were denounced and the negative impact of the personality cult was exposed, nor by the reactions of the other communist countries, which purged their Stalinist leadership at least partially. Still, it was known that at the March 1956 Plenum of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, [[Miron Constantinescu]] and Chi\u015finevschi had opposed Gheorghiu-Dej, arguing for the need of a liberalisation according to Khrushchev's orientation, a proposal categorically rejected by Gheorghiu-Dej. Students interpreted the lack of an armed Soviet intervention in the Hungarian Revolution's first days as Khrushchev's acceptance of the demands of the Hungarian reform movement. Hence, some students considered Iosif Chi\u015finevschi, who had backed the notion of liberalisation, however mild, to be a preferable interlocutor to other hardline leaders.\n\nThe questions they asked were provocative but did not raise ideological issues. Some of these questions were:\n\n#If the regimes in the two countries [Romania and the USSR] are identical and communist internationalism exists, why is [[Bessarabia]] not being given back [to Romania], since that province is Romanian, from an historical point of view?\n#Why must the peasants make children's coffins from fence-posts when Romania has a substantial production of wood?\n#Why must bread be bought with ration cards in an agricultural country?\n#Why is artificial wine being bought from [[Bulgaria]]?\n#Why is there no fish on the market?\n#Why are [[electricity meter]]s being sold to [[North Vietnam|Vietnam]] at a price that does not even cover the packaging?\n#Why is [[methane]] gas being provided to Hungary only for some factories planned for [[natural gas processing]]?\n\nThe goal of this action was to gauge whether at least some members of the communist leadership were prepared to begin a dialogue. For this reason, the questions put forward generally had an economic character and did not raise political issues. However, neither artificial Bulgarian wine nor electricity meters for Vietnam represented a major concern for Romanian students. The questions served as a signal to the party leadership that the students wished for a dialogue, not an ideological confrontation.\n\nNeither Chi\u015finevschi nor any other party leader replied to the invitation. But the invitation demonstrated to those who hesitated to join the movement that more energetic actions were needed as a consequence of the authorities' negative attitude.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Alexandru Malinescu.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Alexandru M\u0103linescu, student at the Institute of Theatre, sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment]] -->\n\n==Preliminary protest actions==\n\nIn many institutes of higher learning, as well as in some high schools, protests began during courses on politics and [[Russian language]]. Faced with hostile students, a number of professors had to leave their classrooms. The faculty received orders to try to calm down the students. For the party leadership, the disturbances that took place during Russian classes were an especially serious matter, as all this occurred in October, a month that had been dedicated to the Romanian-Soviet friendship in honour of the [[October Revolution]].\n\nStudents in a number of faculties asked that delegations from the Central Committee be sent to discuss the situation in Hungary with them. The escalation from the first such demand was clear, as the subject had changed from an economic one to a political one. UTM (''Uniunea Tineretului Muncitoresc'' / Union of Working Youth) sessions were boycotted, but students used several sessions convened for the purpose of resolving administrative problems, to discuss openly the Hungarian Revolution and their need to react to it. UTM leaders and students who were party members and objected to these discussions were thrown out of the conference halls. UTM leaders tried to ally themselves with the mainstream student opinion, showing support for the student movement and hostility toward the intransigent positions taken by the party committees within the faculties.\n[[File:Ligia Filotti 1956.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Ligia Filotti, law student, expelled]]\n\n==The 5 November 1956 protest is organised==\nThe first organisational action was prepared by a clandestine group which created links between all the faculties with a view to organise a protest.\n\nOn 28 October 1956 a radio station calling itself \"Romania of the future. The voice of resistance\" began broadcasting on different wavelengths. It is not known where this secret station was broadcasting from; according to one assumption it was located in  [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The station, considered a nationalist one, presented the students' demands, including:\n* \"the return of the stolen provinces, Bessarabia and [[Bukovina]]\"\n* \"the expulsion from Romania of Stalinists, who compromised communism and brought fear and hunger to the country.\"\n\nOn 29 October 1956 the [[Suez Crisis]] reached dramatic proportions with [[Israel]]'s invasion of [[Egypt]]; this disoriented those students who wanted action. For some more perceptive students, this was a clear signal that the West did not intend to intervene and that the Hungarian revolutionaries, as well as those in Romania, should not count on external assistance. Those more prudent among them considered that without such assistance, their chances of success were minimal. Others expressed contrary views, pointing out that Soviet troops had not intervened and that the Hungarian Revolution was a success, since the communist regime there had practically been overthrown.\n\nAs a result of an attempt to organise a student revolt in Timi\u015foara, over 3,000 students had been arrested on 30\u201331 October.<ref>\"[http://www.epochtimes-romania.com/articles/article_6500.html 50 de ani de la miscarile studentesti din Timi\u015foara anului 1956] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115020438/http://www.epochtimes-romania.com/articles/article_6500.html |date=November 15, 2006 }}\", ''[[The Epoch Times]]'', November 6, 2006.</ref> The Bucharest student leaders did not have precise information about what had happened in Timi\u015foara, but through various indirect channels they had learned that the situation was very serious.\n\nSupport for a student protest had begun to diminish. Aware that if a protest were to take place, it could no longer be delayed, on 2 November 1956 the action committee, led by Alexandru Ivasiuc and Mihai Victor Serdaru, decided to organise a public student gathering. Since the day of 3 November was too soon to ensure sufficient mobilisation, the gathering was scheduled for 5 November in [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]]. The organising committee decided that violence had to be avoided during the protest, and so did any response to provocations. Students from the Faculties of Letters and Law wrote a series of manifestoes in which they presented their demands and urged the rest of the population to side with them. What they asked for was that firm opposition be shown toward the Communist Party's abuses, that a precedent be created for the exercising of democratic rights, including the right to assemble, and that the authorities begin negotiations. The manifestoes also contained slogans such as \"No more Russian and Marxism courses\", \"We demand science, not politics, in universities\" or \"Follow the example of the Hungarian, Czech and Polish students\". The distribution of these manifestoes was stopped when the first arrests took place.<ref>* ''Din \u015fcoal\u0103 \u00een \u00eenchisorile comumiste'' Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103 - 16 ianuarie 2009</ref>\n\nOn 4 November, the Soviet Army unexpectedly occupied Budapest and other vital centres of Hungary. Although the brutal intervention in Hungary was proof that the student protests in Romania had few chances of success, the organisers believed that the movement had to continue and that the protest had to take place. At the same time, some students were arrested in Bucharest, including a few of the initiators of the protest.\n\nOn the night of 4/5 November, troops from the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior of Romania|Ministry of the Interior]] occupied University Square. Traffic was completely stopped, and the entire area normally used by vehicles in front of the university was filled with lorries in which soldiers, armed with automatic weapons, were sitting on benches, ready to intervene. The protest had become absolutely impossible to carry out. Additional armed troops were massed inside the university building and in other nearby buildings. All those who had intended to protest saw what was happening as soon as they entered the square and kept moving. Yet, they were unaware that at the entrances to the square there were party members from the various faculties who were taking down the names of all who walked in that area.\n\n==Repression==\n[[File:Steliana Pogorirovchi.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Steliana Pogorilovschi, student at the Faculty of Journalism, sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment]]\nGiven the repression of the Hungarian Revolution by the Red Army, organising another protest in Bucharest was out of the question. In the universities, acts of dissent ceased. Students from the Faculty of Philosophy did try to organise a new protest on 15 November, but the organisers were arrested before they could go further with their plan.\n\nOn 27 October 1956, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, meeting in a crisis session, had set up a crisis command under the leadership of [[Emil Bodn\u0103ra\u015f]], whose subordinates were [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]], [[Alexandru Dr\u0103ghici]] and [[Leontin S\u0103l\u0103jan]]. The command had extensive powers, including the right to order troops to open fire and to declare a state of emergency in any part of the country. The command had the explicit right to suspend classes in institutes of higher learning.\n\nThe party organs immediately began repressive actions. A whole series of arrests followed, with arrest warrants issued by another special party committee, headed by [[Gheorghe Apostol]]. Investigations were intense; the chief interrogator was Captain Gheorghe Enoiu of the Direction of Penal Investigations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. He was aided by, among others, Lieutenant Major Vasile Dumitrescu, Lieutenant Gheorghe Blidaru, Lieutenant Horia Brestoiu, Lieutenant Nicolae Domni\u0163a, Lieutenant Major Florea Gheorghiu, Lieutenant Major Gheorghe Mih\u0103ilescu, Lieutenant Major Iosif Moldovan, and Lieutenant Major Dumitru Preda.\n\nThe majority of arrests took place in November\u2013December 1956, but arrests continued throughout 1957. Some students were sentenced to 1\u20134 years in prison; some died in prison. For instance, \u015etefan Negrea, a student at the Faculty of Letters, died in [[Gherla prison]] on 3 November 1958.\n\nAt the same time, the universities and other places associated with students were placed under strict surveillance. At the order of the [[Ministry of Education and Research of Romania|Ministry of Education]], actions against students were taken by university administrators: students who were suspected of having approved the movement were expelled and a strict system of surveillance was put in place to monitor the behaviour of students.<ref>Tugui, Pavel - Dosarul studentului Nicolae Manolescu: Povestea unei exmatricul\u0103ri - Revista 22, Nr. 760, 30 September-6 October 2004</ref>  Additionally, student organisations (UTM as well as the Union of Student Associations / ''Uniunea Asocia\u0163iilor Studen\u0163e\u015fti'') organised sessions to unmask \"enemy elements\". At these sessions, not only were students removed from these organisations, but it was asked that they be expelled &ndash; a request immediately granted by the university administration. Those expelled had no right to re-enroll in any institution of higher learning.<ref name =\"simple\" >Corbea, Constan\u0163a - Strivi\u0163i de istorie (M\u0103rturii) - Asymetria 19 Aprilie 2006</ref> Sessions were organised at which students were obliged to express their indignation against those who \"splatter with mud\" Romania's studious youth.<ref name =\"simple\"/> Furthermore, the principal protest organisers were unmasked in public sessions during which their expulsion was requested in view of their status as people enemy to the regime. These actions were coordinated by university party organisations as well as by [[Marxism-Leninism]] departments. (One especially zealous persecutor during this period was Constantin Bulai, who taught Marxism.) Students convinced professors and artists to sign petitions asking that those arrested be freed; as a result, repressive actions intensified and more were condemned and expelled.<ref>*** - Dup\u0103 50 de ani - Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103, Edi\u0163ie special\u0103, 19 December 2006 - 14 January 2007</ref>\n\nAside from the immediate measures taken against those students who headed the protest movement, a series of other organisational repressive measures took place in the political realm. On 13 November, in a session of the Political Bureau, it was decided that the Ministry of Education should draw up \"a concrete programme of measures to lead to an improvement in the social composition of students\". The first to be targeted were former political detainees who had been allowed to return to the universities in 1955-56. Although the great majority of them had not been involved in the protest movement, Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu explicitly asked for this step to be taken in a speech held in Bucharest on 15 November 1956. Around the same time, [[Virgil Trofin]], secretary of the Central Committee of UTM, declared, \"We have to know how many enemies there are in our country and are trying to fight against our party\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nConcurrently, the student organisations were reorganised. [[Ion Iliescu]], who had recently become a member of the UTM Central Committee, was also named president of the Union of Student Associations of the Romanian People's Republic in order to ensure more stringent control by the party over students.<ref># * * * - \u00cen '68 Iliescu a \u00eenfierat un colind de Cr\u0103ciun - Ziarul de Ia\u015fi 19 decembrie 2006</ref> <!-- after removing the pov, this fragment became superfluous  Also of note is the fact that Alexandru Dinc\u0103, a former student at the Faculty of Law sent to prison for his activity in 1956, became the editor of a liberal newspaper, ''Viitorul'', after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].-->\n\nIn an address to the [[Moscow]] [[Komsomol]] on 8 November 1956, Nikita Khrushchev alluded to the student protests, saying that there were ''some unhealthy moods'' among students ''in one of the educational establishments in Romania''.

The students' actions and the repression that followed have not been seriously analysed. [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania|UDMR]] deputy Dezs\u0151-K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Becsek-Garda did make a statement about the subject in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] on 19 October 1999; a few newspaper reports and a short television programme followed. The movement was generally forgotten, at least until the December 2006 publication of the Final Report of the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania]], which devotes a chapter to the events of 1956.\n\nFew of the participants at the centre of the 1956 movement have published memoirs of the events, though Mihai Stere Derdena did write an article in 2002. In 2006, Stela Covaci published a book documenting the communist repression of 1956-58 and the methods used to crush a protest movement run by students and anti-communist writers.\n\nThe Presidential Commission report states that the autumn 1956 student movement was unique in its ability to organise a protest movement with a well-defined programme, with demands covering the entirety of Romanian society. The report concludes that the protest failed due to the lack of a single coordination centre, the lack of support from other societal groups, and the authorities' actions to stop any protest movement.\n\nThese findings have drawn criticism. There was in fact a coordination centre in Bucharest, though it was not structured so as to make it less vulnerable to the machinations of repressive state organs.<!-- From the beginning, students showed that they understood the situation perfectly. They were not launching a mere protest movement, but hoped to initiate reforms; they considered certain conditions necessary for these to take place. They realised that the Western powers were not in the least willing to intervene, having shown to the USSR that it had a free hand in Hungary. Under these conditions, overthrowing the communist regime was impossible and the students' only realistic hope was to find a party leader willing to undertake serious de-Stalinisation. Although, as indicated, at the beginning of their movement they invited leaders of the communist party and attempted to find an interlocutor and have a dialogue, no Romanian party leader could be found to embark at least on the path taken by Khrushchev or Gomu\u0142ka. -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* Johanna Granville, ''If Hope is Sin, Then We Are All Guilty: Romanian Students\u2019 Reactions to the Hungarian Revolution and Soviet Intervention, 1956-1958'' ''Carl Beck Paper,'' no. 1905 (April 2008): 1-78.\n*{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.presidency.ro/static/ordine/RAPORT%20FINAL_%20CADCR.pdf Final Report of the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania], Bucharest, 2006.\n*{{in lang|ro}} \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070905162028/http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=2005-10-26&id=187349 Procesul Comunismului (II)]\", ''[[Ziua]]'', 26 October 2005.\n*{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/steno/steno.stenograma?ids=4361&idm=1,13&idl=1 Parliamentary debate], 19 October 1999.\n*{{in lang|ro}} \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20061102014608/http://www.adevarulonline.ro/2006-10-28/Dosar/loturile-studentilor-arestati-si-condamnati-in-urma-evenimentelor-din-1956_204061.html Loturile studen\u0163ilor aresta\u0163i \u015fi condamna\u0163i \u00een urma evenimentelor din 1956]\", ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'', 12 January 2007.\n*[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809265,00.html \"The Doctor's Story\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', March 25, 1957\n*{{in lang|ro}} Covaci, Stela.
