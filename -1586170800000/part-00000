It is the administrative centre of the [[European Union]], thus often dubbed, along with the region, the [[Brussels and the European Union|EU's capital city]].\n\nThe City of Brussels is a municipality consisting of the central historic town and certain additional areas within the greater Brussels-Capital Region, namely [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], [[Laeken]] and [[Neder-Over-Heembeek]] to the north, as well as [[Avenue Louise|Avenue Louise/Louizalaan]] and the [[Bois de la Cambre|Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos]] park to the south.\n\n{{As of |2017|1|1}}, the City of Brussels had a total population of 176,545. The total area is {{Convert|32.61|km2|abbr=on}} which gives a [[population density]] of {{Convert|5475|PD/km2}}. As of 2007, there were approximately 50,000 registered non-Belgians in the City of Brussels.<ref>[http://www.dofi.fgov.be/fr/statistieken/statistiques_etrangers/Stat_ETRANGERS.htm Statistics foreign population in Belgium by municipality (in French and Dutch only)]</ref> In common with all of Brussels' municipalities, it is legally [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] (French\u2013Dutch).\n\n==Territorial history==\n[[File:Brussel.1610.a.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of Brussels from c. 1610]]\nAt first, the City of Brussels was simply defined, being the area within the [[second walls of Brussels]], the modern-day [[small ring (Brussels)|small ring]]. As the city grew, the surrounding villages grew as well, eventually growing into a contiguous city, though the local governments retained control of their respective areas.\n\nThe construction of [[Avenue Louise|Avenue Louise/Louizalaan]] was commissioned in 1847 as a monumental avenue bordered by [[Aesculus hippocastanum|chestnut trees]] that would allow easy access to the popular recreational area of the [[Bois de la Cambre|Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos]]. However, fierce resistance to the project was put up by the town of [[Ixelles]] (which was then still separate from Brussels) through whose land the avenue was supposed to run. After years of fruitless negotiations, Brussels finally [[annexation|annexed]] the narrow band of land needed for the avenue plus the Bois de la Cambre itself in 1864. That decision accounts for the unusual southeastern protrusion of the City of Brussels and for Ixelles being split in two separate parts. Part of the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]]' Solbosch campus is also part of the City of Brussels, partially accounting for the bulge in the southeast end.\n\nUnlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975.<ref name=\"roots\">{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/_places/bel_places.html|title=Municipalities (1795-now)|last=Picavet|first=Georges|date=29 April 2003|publisher=Georges Picavet|accessdate=2009-04-05}}</ref> However, a few neighbouring municipalities have been merged into the City of Brussels, including [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], [[Laeken]] and [[Neder-Over-Heembeek]] in 1921.<ref name=\"Brussels\">{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/2bru/index.html|title=Brussels Capital-Region|date=4 June 2005 |publisher=Georges Picavet |accessdate=2009-04-05}}</ref> These comprise the northern bulge in the municipality. To the south-east is also a strip of land along Avenue Louise that was annexed from Ixelles.\n\n==Districts==\n\n===Pentagon===\n[[File:Pentagone Bxl.01.jpg|left|thumb|204x204px|Districts of Brussels]]\n\n====''Central District''====\nIt is in the heart of the [[Saint-G\u00e9ry Island|''Saint-G\u00e9ry''/''Sint-Goriks'' Island]], formed by the [[Zenne|Senne]] and on which a first [[keep]] was built around 979, that the origin of the city is located. Today, the neighbourhood around the {{lang|fr|Halles Saint-G\u00e9ry|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Sint-Gorikshallen|italic=no}}, a former covered market, is one of the trendy districts of the capital. In the centre of the city, there are some vestiges of the 13th-century [[Fortifications of Brussels|first walls of Brussels]], which surrounded the first port on the Senne, the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church, later replaced by the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]], and the ducal castle of [[Coudenberg]] (Royal Quarter). In the centre of this triangle are the [[Grand Place]], the ''\u00celot Sacr\u00e9'' district (which takes its name from its resistance to demolition projects), itself crossed by the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert|Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries]], the {{lang|fr|Saint-Jacques}}/{{lang|nl|Sint-Jacobs}} district which welcomed the pilgrims on their way to [[Santiago de Compostela]], and the [[Brussels Stock Exchange]], built on the site of a former convent, whose remains have been uncovered.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Bruxelles Manneken Pis cropped.jpg|[[Manneken Pis]]\nFile:SteGudule.jpg|[[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]]\nFile:Bourse Bxl 02.JPG|[[Brussels Stock Exchange]]\nFile:Cracheur Bxl.JPG|''Le Cracheur'' fountain\nFile:Galeries Royales Saint Hubert Entree.jpg|[[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert|Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries]]\n</gallery>\n\n====''Royal District''====\nThus named because it houses, on the one hand, the [[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale/Koningsplein]], built under [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles-Alexander of Lorraine]] on the [[Coudenberg]] hill, on the site of the former [[Coudenberg|Palace of the Dukes of Brabant]], of which certain levels of foundation still exist, and on the other hand, the [[Royal Palace of Brussels]], which faces [[Brussels Park|Brussels' Park]], on the other side of which is the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian Parliament]]. Below is the [[Brussels Central Station|Central Station]] and the [[Mont des Arts|Mont des Arts/Kunstberg]] where the [[Royal Library of Belgium]], the Royal Belgian Film Archive ([[Cinematek]]), the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Brussels Centre for Fine Arts]], the Museum of Cinema, the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Musical Instrument Museum (MIM)]], the [[BELvue Museum]], and the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] are located.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Place du Mus\u00e9e 01.JPG|Museum Square\nFile:Pa rc de Bruxelles 02.JPG|[[Brussels Park|Brussels' Park]]\nFile:Royalpalacebrussels.jpg|[[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]]\nFile:Mus\u00e9es Royaux des Beaux-Arts Belgique 1101.jpg|[[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]\nFile:Palais d\u2019Academies, Bruxelles.JPG|[[Academy Palace]]\n</gallery>\n\n====''Sablon/Zavel District''====\nFrom the [[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale/Koningsplein]], {{lang|fr|Rue de la R\u00e9gence|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Regentschapsstraat|italic=no}} crosses the neighbourhoods of the Small and Large [[Sablon (Brussels)|''Sablon''/''Zavel'']], a swanky district where the [[Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon]] is located and where an antiques market is held, in which antique and art dealers, as well as other luxury shops, have businesses. Not far from there was the [[Art Nouveau]] [[Maison du Peuple|''Maison du Peuple''/''Volkshuis'']] by [[Victor Horta]] until its demolition in 1965. The Sablon is also home to the [[Egmont Palace]] and the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles.JPG|[[Royal Conservatory of Brussels|Royal Conservatory]]\nFile:BxlSablonFontaine.jpg|Fountain of Minerva\nFile:Bruxelles Palais d'Egmont 802.jpg|[[Egmont Palace]]\nFile:Bruxelles Notre-Dame du Sablon.jpg|[[Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon]]\nFile:Square du Petit Sablon - Statue centrale front HDR.JPG|Fountain of the counts of Egmont and Horn\n</gallery>\n\n====''Marolles/Marollen District''====\nIn the shadow of the gigantic [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] lies the old [[Marollen|''Marolles''/''Marollen'']] district (not to be confused with the ''Marolle'' that purists delimit to only 7 streets). From the {{lang|fr|Place de la Chapelle|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Kapellemarkt|italic=no}} to the [[Place du Jeu de Balle|Place du Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein]], where a daily [[flea market]] has been held since 1873, along {{lang|fr|Rue Haute|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hogestraat|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|Rue Blaes|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Blaestraat|italic=no}}, second-hand and popular shops have for some years given way to [[antique shop]]s, marking a profound change to the neighbourhood. The ''Hellemans City'', a remarkable example of early 20th-century collective housing complexes, was built on the site of the neighbourhood's many squalid [[cul-de-sac]]s. Rue Haute, one of the longest and oldest streets in the city, follows the course of an old [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] road, and runs along the Saint Pierre Hospital, built in 1935 on the site of a [[Leprosy|leper]] hospital, to end at the [[Halle Gate]], the only survivor of the series of gates which allowed passage inside the [[Fortifications of Brussels|second walls of Brussels]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Jeu de Balle Bxl 01.JPG|[[Place du Jeu de Balle|Place du Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein]], end of a market\nFile:Cit\u00e9 Hellemans 10.JPG|''Hellemans City'', Rue Blaes\nFile:Brigittines.JPG|''Brigittines'' Chapel\nFile:Palais de Justice from Hilton.jpg|[[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]]\nFile:Porte de Hal, Brussels.jpg|[[Halle Gate]]\n</gallery>\n\n====''Midi\u2013Lemonnier District'' or ''Stalingrad District''====\nIt is in the heart of this district, where Rouppe Square is today, that Brussels' first South Station was located in 1839, the terminus of the South Line, called Bogards' Station for the eponymous convent whose site it was built on, and to which {{lang|fr|Rue des Bogards|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Bogaardenstraat|italic=no}} is nowadays the only reference. The presence of a station at this location explains the unusual width of the current Avenue of Stalingrad, which goes from the square to the small ring road, cleared of its railways since the inauguration of [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South Station]], built outside the ''Pentagon'' in 1869. At the same time, following the [[covering of the Senne]], the neighbourhood saw the construction of ''[[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|haussmannian]]'' grand central boulevards, including Maurice Lemonnier Boulevard, bordered by Fontainas Square and Anneessens Square (location of the former ''Old Market''), as well as by the Midi Palace. Each Sunday morning, the Midi district plays host to the second largest market in Europe.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Place Rouppe 01.JPG|Rouppe Square and Avenue of Stalingrad\nFile:Anneessens 01.JPG|Anneessens Square and Lucien Cooremans Institute\nFile:Palais du Midi 01.JPG|Lemonnier Boulevard and Midi Palace\n</gallery>\n\n====''Senne/Zenne District'' or ''Dansaert District''====\nThe damp and swampy grounds around the present-day {{lang|fr|Rue de la Senne|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Zennestraat|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|Rue des Fabriques|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Fabriekstraat|italic=no}} were occupied by craftsmen since the [[Middle Ages]]. An arm of the [[Zenne|river]] crossed the defences of the [[Fortifications of Brussels|second walls]] at the level of the Ninove Gate and the {{lang|fr|Petite \u00c9cluse|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Kleine Sluis|italic=no}} (\"Small Lock\"), which served as a port. An end of the lock remained there until the 1960s. Later, small industries and many artisan breweries, now disappeared, established themselves there, which is still evident by the names of {{lang|fr|Rue du Houblon|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hopstraat|italic=no}} (\"Hops Street\") and {{lang|fr|Rue du Vieux March\u00e9 aux Grains|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Oude Graanmarktstraat|italic=no}} (\"Old Grain Market Street\"). The [[Brussels Shot Tower|Shot Tower]] (''Tour \u00e0 Plomb''), which was used for the manufacture of [[Shot (pellet)|lead shot]] for hunting, and {{lang|fr|Rue de la Poudri\u00e8re|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Kruitmolenstraat|italic=no}} (\"Gunpowder Street\"), also testify to the former activities of the neighbourhood. Long neglected as a result of the relocation of businesses outside the centre, the area has for a few years been the object of a new interest and is undergoing [[gentrification]] due to the many disused industrial premises being converted into [[loft]]s. The area around {{lang|fr|Rue Antoine Dansaert|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Antoine Dansaertstraat|italic=no}} has become a trendy district and is attracting a younger, more well-off, and mostly Dutch-speaking population. This new situation, which has the consequence of rising rents, is not without problems for the less fortunate inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Coin Walvis, rue Antoine Dansaert.JPG|{{lang|fr|Rue Antoine Dansaert|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Antoine Dansaertstraat|italic=no}}\nFile:Pace du Jardin aux fleurs 01.JPG|Flower Garden Square\nFile:Loft Bxl 01.JPG|Industrial building transformed into housing ([[loft]])\nFile:Tour \u00e0 plomb Bxl 01.JPG|''Tour \u00e0 Plomb''\n</gallery>\n\n====''Quays District'' or ''Maritime District''====\nThis district is that of the old [[port of Brussels]], which played for a long time the role of ''belly'' of the city. The boats coming from the [[Scheldt]] penetrated through the Rivage Gate, at the site of present-day Yser Square, to join one of the canals, whose docks were each reserved for one type of goods. Filled in the 19th century, at the opening of Brussels' new port, the canals were replaced by wide boulevards, the two sides of which retain in their names the memory of their former function: {{lang|fr|Quai aux Briques|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Baksteenkaai|italic=no}} (\"Brick Wharf\"), {{lang|fr|Quai au Bois \u00e0 Br\u00fbler|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Brandhoutkaai|italic=no}} (\"Firewood Wharf\"), {{lang|fr|Quai aux Pierres de Taille|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Arduinkaai|italic=no}} (\"Quarry Stone Wharf\"), {{lang|fr|Quai au Foin|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hooikaai|italic=no}} (\"Hay Wharf\"), etc. or references to the neighbourhood's commercial activities: {{lang|fr|Rue du Magasin|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Pakhuisstraat|italic=no}} (\"Warehouse Street\"), {{lang|fr|Rue des Commer\u00e7ants|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Koopliedenstraat|italic=no}} (\"Traders Street\"), {{lang|fr|Rue du March\u00e9 aux Porcs|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Varkensmarktstraat|italic=no}} (\"Pig Market Street\") and {{lang|fr|Quai du Commerce|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Handelskaai|italic=no}} (\"Trade Wharf\"). Along the quaysides, numerous [[Bourgeois of Brussels|bourgeois]] houses, once belonging to wealthy merchants, have preserved the entrances to the warehouses. On Ypres Boulevard, one can still cross food wholesalers, supplied nowadays by trucks, which have replaced the boats. The neighbourhood also includes the [[beguinage]] of Brussels, with the [[Saint John the Baptist at the B\u00e9guinage|Church of Saint John the Baptist]] and the remarkable ''Grand Hospice Pach\u00e9co''.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Sint-Jan Baptist ten Begijnhofkerk (Brussel) 22-09-2018 15-08-16.jpg|[[Saint John the Baptist at the B\u00e9guinage]]\nFile:Fontaine Anspach Bxl 01.JPG|Anspach fountain\nFile:Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal Flamand Bxl 01.JPG|Royal Flemish Theatre of Brussels\nFile:Potale St Roch Bxl.JPG|''Potale Saint Roch'', invoked against the plague\nFile:316 - Maison de la Bellone - Bruxelles.jpg|''La Bellone''\n</gallery>\n\n====''Marais\u2013Jacqmain District''====\nFew are the buildings in the former {{lang|fr|Marais}} district which have escaped 20th-century demolition, from Pach\u00e9co Boulevard to [[Rue Neuve (Brussels)|Rue Neuve/Nieuwstraat]]. They have been replaced by the State Administrative City, press printers, banking facilities, and commercial galleries. The current trend is to restore the neighbourhood's social mix by redeveloping housing in former office buildings. Despite the longtime grim aspect of the district, the [[Meyboom]] tradition has been maintained for centuries, and the former [[Art Nouveau]] Waucquez stores by [[Victor Horta]] have been preserved and house, since 1993, the [[Belgian Comic Strip Center]]. Another preserved islet is the 18th-century [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Place des Martyrs, Brussels|Martyrs' Square]], which has gradually been renovated. The victims of the [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian Revolution of 1830]] are buried there in an open crypt with a memorial. Nearby is Rue Neuve, one of the main commercial streets in Belgium, with on its two sides more than one kilometer long entirely occupied by shops; [[Boulevard Adolphe Max|Adolphe Max Boulevard]], a traditional artery with 19th-century facades; and \u00c9mile Jacqmain Boulevard (where the National Theatre of Belgium was installed in 2004) close to [[De Brouck\u00e8re Square]]. The latter, a very busy central point of the city centre, is dominated at its southern end by two block-style building towers, but for the rest, it has totally ([[Hotel Metropole, Brussels|Hotel Metropole]] and its neighbour the Hotel Atlanta) or partially ([[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC cinema]]) preserved its old facades.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Metro-Brussels-De Brouck\u00e8re.jpg|[[De Brouck\u00e8re Square]]\nFile:Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie 1.JPG|The [[La Monnaie|Royal Theatre of La Monnaie]]\nFile:Place des Martyrs 01.JPG|[[Place des Martyrs, Brussels|Martyrs' Square]]\nFile:Eglise Notre-Dame du Finist\u00e8re.JPG|Church of Our Lady of Finist\u00e8re\n</gallery>\n\n====''Freedom District''====\nThe Freedom district is situated between the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian Parliament]] and [[Rue Royale, Brussels|Rue Royale/Koningsstraat]], not far from the crossroads with the small ring road, and has as its focal point the [[Congress Column]], built in memory of the National Congress of 1830\u20131831, the founder of democratic liberties in Belgium, and under which also lies the [[tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] with the Sacred Flame. Not far from there is the [[Hotel Astoria, Brussels|Hotel Astoria]], a 1911 palace, which is currently being renovated and enlarged, and will be reopened in the coming years. In the 19th century, the district was known as {{lang|fr|Notre-Dame-aux-Neiges}}/{{lang|nl|Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ter-Sneeuw}} and was inhabited in majority by working-class people. The authorities' desire to clean up the squalid parts of the city led to the expulsion of the population and the neighbourhood's complete destruction. A new [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] district was developed during the last quarter of the century. The choice was made to commemorate the memory of the [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian Independence]]: the {{lang|fr|Place de la Libert\u00e9|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Vrijheidsplein|italic=no}} (\"Liberty Square\"), the {{lang|fr|Place des Barricades|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Barricadenplein|italic=no}} (\"Barricades' Square\"), {{lang|fr|Rue de la R\u00e9volution|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Revolutiestraat|italic=no}} (\"Revolution Street\"), {{lang|fr|Rue du Congr\u00e8s|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Congresstraat|italic=no}} (\"Congress Street\"), etc. The four streets overlooking Liberty Square bear the names of the four constitutional freedoms, symbolised by the four female figures surrounding the Congress Column: [[Freedom of the press|Freedom of the Press]], [[Freedom of religion|Religion]], [[Freedom of association|Association]] and [[Freedom of education|Education]]. This [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]] urban complex is one of the best preserved of the ''Pentagon'' today.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Colonne du Congr\u00e8s Bxl.01.JPG|The [[Congress Column]] ([[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]])\nFile:Place de la Libert\u00e9 Bxl 01.JPG|Liberty Square ([[Charles Rogier]])\nFile:Braban\u00e7onne Place Surlet de Chokier 01.JPG|Surlet de Chokier Square (The ''Braban\u00e7onne'')\nFile:Place des Barricades Bxl 01.JPG|Barricades' Square ([[Andreas Vesalius]])\n</gallery>\n\n===Eastern districts===\n\n====''European District'' and ''Leopold Quarter''====\nThe [[Brussels and the European Union#European Quarter|European District]] is located to the east of the ''Pentagon'', around [[Place du Luxembourg|Luxembourg Square]] and the [[Schuman roundabout]], and includes the smaller [[Leopold Quarter]]. The [[Espace L\u00e9opold|European Parliament]] was built near Luxembourg Square, on the site of the former {{lang|fr|Quartier L\u00e9opold}} Station, and of which only the central building overlooking the square remains, having been replaced by the underground [[Brussels-Luxembourg railway station]]. The [[European Commission]], housed in the [[Berlaymont building]], is located on the Schuman roundabout, not far from the [[Cinquantenaire|Cinquantenaire Park]]. Across the street stands the [[Justus Lipsius building]] and the [[Europa building]] (part of the ''Residence Palace''), serving as the seat of the [[European Council]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of the EU]]. In [[Leopold Park]], the [[House of European History]] provides visitors with a social history of the continent of Europe. There is a visitor centre in the main European Parliament building, known as the ''Parliamentarium'', and another smaller one in the Justus Lipsius building, for the council of Europe. It is accessible on certain days, by appointment.

Laeken is home to, among others, the Royal Domain of Laeken, the [[Castle of Laeken]], the [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken]] (1873), the [[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]] (whose crypt contains the tombs of the [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgian Royal Family]]) and the [[Laeken Cemetery]], known for its wealth of monuments and sculptures. On the territory of Laeken, there is also the [[Heysel Plateau|''Heysel/Heizel'' Plateau]], where were held the [[World's fair|World's Fairs]] of [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|1935]] and [[Expo 58|1958]] and which includes the [[King Baudouin Stadium]], Bruparck (with the [[Atomium]], [[Mini-Europe]] [[miniature park]], [[Kinepolis]] cinema and Oc\u00e9ade water park), the Brussels Exhibition Centre and the [[Port of Brussels]], next to which the ''Monument to Work'' by [[Constantin Meunier]] was erected.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Carte-Laeken.jpg|Map of [[Laeken]]\nFile:0 Ch\u00e2teau Royal de Laeken.JPG|[[Castle of Laeken]]\nFile:Bxl, Eglise Notre-Dame de Laeken-2.jpg|[[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]]\nFile:Atomium w.jpg|[[Atomium]]\n</gallery>\n\n====''Mutsaard''====\nSometimes also known as the ''Pagoda'' district, the ''Japanese tower'' district or ''De Wand'' district, ''Mutsaard'' (also spelled ''Mutsaert''), is an old hamlet and a historic district located between Laeken and Neder-over-Heembeek and centred around Mutsaard Square. The district was part of the former municipality of Laeken (postcode: 1020) but also a piece of Neder-over-Heembeek, annexed by Laeken in 1897. It is separated from the rest of Laeken by the Royal Domain and is the site of the [[Museums of the Far East]].

But it is the presence, southwest of the town, of an airfield, created by the Germans during the [[World War I|First World War]], and where the Belgian national airline [[Sabena]] was born, which precipitated the annexation of Haren. For almost fifty years, Haren has been home to the [[NATO]] headquarters. It is also the location of many other administrations and companies, such as the headquarters of [[Eurocontrol]].\n\n==Mayors==\n{{main|List of mayors of the City of Brussels}}\nAs in every other Belgian municipality, the City of Brussels is headed by a mayor, who should not be confused with the [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region]] or the [[Governor of Brussels-Capital]].\n\n==Culture==\nThere are many museums in and around Brussels' city centre.

Premi\u00e8re phase: De gueules plain\", in: ''\u00c9tudes in\u00e9dites'', Brussels, 1936, p. 111-113: \u00ab A text from 1339 \u00a0informs us with precision on this point. This first coat of arms of the city of Brussels were gules plain. Why ? The legend, which the Luyster van Brabant echoes, reports that Leo Torgotus, crowned king of Tongeren in 3609 of creation - or 368 before the birth of Christ - after having defeated tribes united against him, advanced in Brabant to hold his winter quarters there. He built two castles there, one on the heights of Coudenberg, the other on an island in the Senne, and in between, a tower, the Saint-Nicolas tower. He gave this place the name of Broidsel or Broedsel, and there was formed Brussels ... In memory of the battles fought by L\u00e9o Torgotus and where the blood was shed in such abundance that the water of the rivers was reddened, the city adopted for his coat of arms \"a simple red field\" (een simpel roodt veldt) and kept it such until the moment when the image of the Archangel Michael was placed in said field that the city had chosen as its patron. Heraldic science allows us to formulate the following hypothesis: the red would be a reminder of the coat of arms of Lothier which are gules to a fess of silver ... Different documents show us these very plain Brussels arms: notably a drawing representing the seat of Brussels by Count Ferrand and a table depicting the siege of Neuss by Charles the Bold. Red was, moreover the color of the city. In the sixteenth century, the archivist of the Sainte-\u00c9lisabeth convent, explaining the meaning of the coat of arms adopted by his convent, tells us from the start of his description that the background is Gules, i.e. red, and that this indicates Brussels (dat is root ende beteekent Bruessel). It is also the small shield of gules which adorns the marvelous tapestries taken out of the workshops of Brussels. \". And P. 115: \u201cSaint Michael, whose image was then placed in the ancient red badge of the city. In reality, it was in the course of the sixteenth century that the modification took place, and Saint Michael is obviously the emblem of the seal. This shield Gules in the shade of Saint Michael remained until the end of the old regime that of the city of Brussels: this is how in the eighteenth century it adorned the magistrates' book. \".</ref> From the 16th century on, it was customary to put the figure of the city seal representing Saint Michael, first as a shadow then a more elaborate form.<ref>Louis Robyns de Schneidauer, ''La couronne comtale de la ville de Bruxelles'', in ''Le Parchemin'', Gendbrugge-lez-Gand, 1939 (March\u2013April).</ref>\n\n'''Note''': many of the arms of the [[Seven Noble Houses of Brussels]] were variants of these arms.\n|-\n|[[File:Greater_Coat_of_Arms_of_Brussels_(1730).svg|295x295px]]\n|'''''1730 arms'''''\n|-\n|{{center|[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Brussels_(Napoleon).svg|232x232px]]}}\n|'''''[[French heraldry#Napoleonic heraldry|Napoleonic arms]]'''''<ref>(en)[https://www.heraldry-wiki.com/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Brussel Brussels][archive], on the Heraldry of the World website.</ref>\n|}\n\n== Vexillology ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

As the city grew, the surrounding villages grew as well, eventually growing into a contiguous city, though the local governments retained control of their respective areas.\n\nThe construction of [[Avenue Louise|Avenue Louise/Louizalaan]] was commissioned in 1847 as a monumental avenue bordered by [[Aesculus hippocastanum|chestnut trees]] that would allow easy access to the popular recreational area of the [[Bois de la Cambre|Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos]]. However, fierce resistance to the project was put up by the town of [[Ixelles]] (which was then still separate from Brussels) through whose land the avenue was supposed to run. After years of fruitless negotiations, Brussels finally [[annexation|annexed]] the narrow band of land needed for the avenue plus the Bois de la Cambre itself in 1864. That decision accounts for the unusual southeastern protrusion of the City of Brussels and for Ixelles being split in two separate parts. Part of the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]]' Solbosch campus is also part of the City of Brussels, partially accounting for the bulge in the southeast end.\n\nUnlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975.<ref name=\"roots\">{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/_places/bel_places.html|title=Municipalities (1795-now)|last=Picavet|first=Georges|date=29 April 2003|publisher=Georges Picavet|accessdate=2009-04-05}}</ref> However, a few neighbouring municipalities have been merged into the City of Brussels, including [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], [[Laeken]] and [[Neder-Over-Heembeek]] in 1921.<ref name=\"Brussels\">{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/2bru/index.html|title=Brussels Capital-Region|date=4 June 2005 |publisher=Georges Picavet |accessdate=2009-04-05}}</ref> These comprise the northern bulge in the municipality.

From the {{lang|fr|Place de la Chapelle|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Kapellemarkt|italic=no}} to the [[Place du Jeu de Balle|Place du Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein]], where a daily [[flea market]] has been held since 1873, along {{lang|fr|Rue Haute|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hogestraat|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|Rue Blaes|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Blaestraat|italic=no}}, second-hand and popular shops have for some years given way to [[antique shop]]s, marking a profound change to the neighbourhood. The ''Hellemans City'', a remarkable example of early 20th-century collective housing complexes, was built on the site of the neighbourhood's many squalid [[cul-de-sac]]s. Rue Haute, one of the longest and oldest streets in the city, follows the course of an old [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] road, and runs along the Saint Pierre Hospital, built in 1935 on the site of a [[Leprosy|leper]] hospital, to end at the [[Halle Gate]], the only survivor of the series of gates which allowed passage inside the [[Fortifications of Brussels|second walls of Brussels]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Jeu de Balle Bxl 01.JPG|[[Place du Jeu de Balle|Place du Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein]], end of a market\nFile:Cit\u00e9 Hellemans 10.JPG|''Hellemans City'', Rue Blaes\nFile:Brigittines.JPG|''Brigittines'' Chapel\nFile:Palais de Justice from Hilton.jpg|[[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]]\nFile:Porte de Hal, Brussels.jpg|[[Halle Gate]]\n</gallery>\n\n====''Midi\u2013Lemonnier District'' or ''Stalingrad District''====\nIt is in the heart of this district, where Rouppe Square is today, that Brussels' first South Station was located in 1839, the terminus of the South Line, called Bogards' Station for the eponymous convent whose site it was built on, and to which {{lang|fr|Rue des Bogards|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Bogaardenstraat|italic=no}} is nowadays the only reference. The presence of a station at this location explains the unusual width of the current Avenue of Stalingrad, which goes from the square to the small ring road, cleared of its railways since the inauguration of [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South Station]], built outside the ''Pentagon'' in 1869. At the same time, following the [[covering of the Senne]], the neighbourhood saw the construction of ''[[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|haussmannian]]'' grand central boulevards, including Maurice Lemonnier Boulevard, bordered by Fontainas Square and Anneessens Square (location of the former ''Old Market''), as well as by the Midi Palace. Each Sunday morning, the Midi district plays host to the second largest market in Europe.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Place Rouppe 01.JPG|Rouppe Square and Avenue of Stalingrad\nFile:Anneessens 01.JPG|Anneessens Square and Lucien Cooremans Institute\nFile:Palais du Midi 01.JPG|Lemonnier Boulevard and Midi Palace\n</gallery>\n\n====''Senne/Zenne District'' or ''Dansaert District''====\nThe damp and swampy grounds around the present-day {{lang|fr|Rue de la Senne|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Zennestraat|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|Rue des Fabriques|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Fabriekstraat|italic=no}} were occupied by craftsmen since the [[Middle Ages]]. An arm of the [[Zenne|river]] crossed the defences of the [[Fortifications of Brussels|second walls]] at the level of the Ninove Gate and the {{lang|fr|Petite \u00c9cluse|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Kleine Sluis|italic=no}} (\"Small Lock\"), which served as a port. An end of the lock remained there until the 1960s. Later, small industries and many artisan breweries, now disappeared, established themselves there, which is still evident by the names of {{lang|fr|Rue du Houblon|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hopstraat|italic=no}} (\"Hops Street\") and {{lang|fr|Rue du Vieux March\u00e9 aux Grains|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Oude Graanmarktstraat|italic=no}} (\"Old Grain Market Street\"). The [[Brussels Shot Tower|Shot Tower]] (''Tour \u00e0 Plomb''), which was used for the manufacture of [[Shot (pellet)|lead shot]] for hunting, and {{lang|fr|Rue de la Poudri\u00e8re|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Kruitmolenstraat|italic=no}} (\"Gunpowder Street\"), also testify to the former activities of the neighbourhood. Long neglected as a result of the relocation of businesses outside the centre, the area has for a few years been the object of a new interest and is undergoing [[gentrification]] due to the many disused industrial premises being converted into [[loft]]s. The area around {{lang|fr|Rue Antoine Dansaert|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Antoine Dansaertstraat|italic=no}} has become a trendy district and is attracting a younger, more well-off, and mostly Dutch-speaking population. This new situation, which has the consequence of rising rents, is not without problems for the less fortunate inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Coin Walvis, rue Antoine Dansaert.JPG|{{lang|fr|Rue Antoine Dansaert|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Antoine Dansaertstraat|italic=no}}\nFile:Pace du Jardin aux fleurs 01.JPG|Flower Garden Square\nFile:Loft Bxl 01.JPG|Industrial building transformed into housing ([[loft]])\nFile:Tour \u00e0 plomb Bxl 01.JPG|''Tour \u00e0 Plomb''\n</gallery>\n\n====''Quays District'' or ''Maritime District''====\nThis district is that of the old [[port of Brussels]], which played for a long time the role of ''belly'' of the city. The boats coming from the [[Scheldt]] penetrated through the Rivage Gate, at the site of present-day Yser Square, to join one of the canals, whose docks were each reserved for one type of goods. Filled in the 19th century, at the opening of Brussels' new port, the canals were replaced by wide boulevards, the two sides of which retain in their names the memory of their former function: {{lang|fr|Quai aux Briques|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Baksteenkaai|italic=no}} (\"Brick Wharf\"), {{lang|fr|Quai au Bois \u00e0 Br\u00fbler|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Brandhoutkaai|italic=no}} (\"Firewood Wharf\"), {{lang|fr|Quai aux Pierres de Taille|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Arduinkaai|italic=no}} (\"Quarry Stone Wharf\"), {{lang|fr|Quai au Foin|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hooikaai|italic=no}} (\"Hay Wharf\"), etc. or references to the neighbourhood's commercial activities: {{lang|fr|Rue du Magasin|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Pakhuisstraat|italic=no}} (\"Warehouse Street\"), {{lang|fr|Rue des Commer\u00e7ants|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Koopliedenstraat|italic=no}} (\"Traders Street\"), {{lang|fr|Rue du March\u00e9 aux Porcs|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Varkensmarktstraat|italic=no}} (\"Pig Market Street\") and {{lang|fr|Quai du Commerce|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Handelskaai|italic=no}} (\"Trade Wharf\"). Along the quaysides, numerous [[Bourgeois of Brussels|bourgeois]] houses, once belonging to wealthy merchants, have preserved the entrances to the warehouses. On Ypres Boulevard, one can still cross food wholesalers, supplied nowadays by trucks, which have replaced the boats. The neighbourhood also includes the [[beguinage]] of Brussels, with the [[Saint John the Baptist at the B\u00e9guinage|Church of Saint John the Baptist]] and the remarkable ''Grand Hospice Pach\u00e9co''.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Sint-Jan Baptist ten Begijnhofkerk (Brussel) 22-09-2018 15-08-16.jpg|[[Saint John the Baptist at the B\u00e9guinage]]\nFile:Fontaine Anspach Bxl 01.JPG|Anspach fountain\nFile:Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal Flamand Bxl 01.JPG|Royal Flemish Theatre of Brussels\nFile:Potale St Roch Bxl.JPG|''Potale Saint Roch'', invoked against the plague\nFile:316 - Maison de la Bellone - Bruxelles.jpg|''La Bellone''\n</gallery>\n\n====''Marais\u2013Jacqmain District''====\nFew are the buildings in the former {{lang|fr|Marais}} district which have escaped 20th-century demolition, from Pach\u00e9co Boulevard to [[Rue Neuve (Brussels)|Rue Neuve/Nieuwstraat]]. They have been replaced by the State Administrative City, press printers, banking facilities, and commercial galleries. The current trend is to restore the neighbourhood's social mix by redeveloping housing in former office buildings. Despite the longtime grim aspect of the district, the [[Meyboom]] tradition has been maintained for centuries, and the former [[Art Nouveau]] Waucquez stores by [[Victor Horta]] have been preserved and house, since 1993, the [[Belgian Comic Strip Center]]. Another preserved islet is the 18th-century [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Place des Martyrs, Brussels|Martyrs' Square]], which has gradually been renovated. The victims of the [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian Revolution of 1830]] are buried there in an open crypt with a memorial. Nearby is Rue Neuve, one of the main commercial streets in Belgium, with on its two sides more than one kilometer long entirely occupied by shops; [[Boulevard Adolphe Max|Adolphe Max Boulevard]], a traditional artery with 19th-century facades; and \u00c9mile Jacqmain Boulevard (where the National Theatre of Belgium was installed in 2004) close to [[De Brouck\u00e8re Square]]. The latter, a very busy central point of the city centre, is dominated at its southern end by two block-style building towers, but for the rest, it has totally ([[Hotel Metropole, Brussels|Hotel Metropole]] and its neighbour the Hotel Atlanta) or partially ([[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC cinema]]) preserved its old facades.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Metro-Brussels-De Brouck\u00e8re.jpg|[[De Brouck\u00e8re Square]]\nFile:Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie 1.JPG|The [[La Monnaie|Royal Theatre of La Monnaie]]\nFile:Place des Martyrs 01.JPG|[[Place des Martyrs, Brussels|Martyrs' Square]]\nFile:Eglise Notre-Dame du Finist\u00e8re.JPG|Church of Our Lady of Finist\u00e8re\n</gallery>\n\n====''Freedom District''====\nThe Freedom district is situated between the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian Parliament]] and [[Rue Royale, Brussels|Rue Royale/Koningsstraat]], not far from the crossroads with the small ring road, and has as its focal point the [[Congress Column]], built in memory of the National Congress of 1830\u20131831, the founder of democratic liberties in Belgium, and under which also lies the [[tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] with the Sacred Flame. Not far from there is the [[Hotel Astoria, Brussels|Hotel Astoria]], a 1911 palace, which is currently being renovated and enlarged, and will be reopened in the coming years. In the 19th century, the district was known as {{lang|fr|Notre-Dame-aux-Neiges}}/{{lang|nl|Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ter-Sneeuw}} and was inhabited in majority by working-class people. The authorities' desire to clean up the squalid parts of the city led to the expulsion of the population and the neighbourhood's complete destruction. A new [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] district was developed during the last quarter of the century. The choice was made to commemorate the memory of the [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian Independence]]: the {{lang|fr|Place de la Libert\u00e9|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Vrijheidsplein|italic=no}} (\"Liberty Square\"), the {{lang|fr|Place des Barricades|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Barricadenplein|italic=no}} (\"Barricades' Square\"), {{lang|fr|Rue de la R\u00e9volution|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Revolutiestraat|italic=no}} (\"Revolution Street\"), {{lang|fr|Rue du Congr\u00e8s|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Congresstraat|italic=no}} (\"Congress Street\"), etc. The four streets overlooking Liberty Square bear the names of the four constitutional freedoms, symbolised by the four female figures surrounding the Congress Column: [[Freedom of the press|Freedom of the Press]], [[Freedom of religion|Religion]], [[Freedom of association|Association]] and [[Freedom of education|Education]]. This [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]] urban complex is one of the best preserved of the ''Pentagon'' today.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Colonne du Congr\u00e8s Bxl.01.JPG|The [[Congress Column]] ([[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]])\nFile:Place de la Libert\u00e9 Bxl 01.JPG|Liberty Square ([[Charles Rogier]])\nFile:Braban\u00e7onne Place Surlet de Chokier 01.JPG|Surlet de Chokier Square (The ''Braban\u00e7onne'')\nFile:Place des Barricades Bxl 01.JPG|Barricades' Square ([[Andreas Vesalius]])\n</gallery>\n\n===Eastern districts===\n\n====''European District'' and ''Leopold Quarter''====\nThe [[Brussels and the European Union#European Quarter|European District]] is located to the east of the ''Pentagon'', around [[Place du Luxembourg|Luxembourg Square]] and the [[Schuman roundabout]], and includes the smaller [[Leopold Quarter]]. The [[Espace L\u00e9opold|European Parliament]] was built near Luxembourg Square, on the site of the former {{lang|fr|Quartier L\u00e9opold}} Station, and of which only the central building overlooking the square remains, having been replaced by the underground [[Brussels-Luxembourg railway station]]. The [[European Commission]], housed in the [[Berlaymont building]], is located on the Schuman roundabout, not far from the [[Cinquantenaire|Cinquantenaire Park]]. Across the street stands the [[Justus Lipsius building]] and the [[Europa building]] (part of the ''Residence Palace''), serving as the seat of the [[European Council]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of the EU]]. In [[Leopold Park]], the [[House of European History]] provides visitors with a social history of the continent of Europe. There is a visitor centre in the main European Parliament building, known as the ''Parliamentarium'', and another smaller one in the Justus Lipsius building, for the council of Europe. It is accessible on certain days, by appointment. Many of the attractions in the European quarter are free to visit.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Placeluxmarch2011.jpg|[[Place du Luxembourg|Place du Luxembourg/Luxemburgplein]]\nFile:Berlaymont building 2015.jpg|[[Berlaymont building]]\nFile:Parc du Cinquantenaire 30-05-06.JPG|[[Cinquantenaire|Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Northern districts===\n\n====''Laeken''====\n[[Laeken]] is a former municipality in the north of the Brussels-Capital Region, annexed by the City of Brussels in 1921. Laeken is home to, among others, the Royal Domain of Laeken, the [[Castle of Laeken]], the [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken]] (1873), the [[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]] (whose crypt contains the tombs of the [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgian Royal Family]]) and the [[Laeken Cemetery]], known for its wealth of monuments and sculptures. On the territory of Laeken, there is also the [[Heysel Plateau|''Heysel/Heizel'' Plateau]], where were held the [[World's fair|World's Fairs]] of [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|1935]] and [[Expo 58|1958]] and which includes the [[King Baudouin Stadium]], Bruparck (with the [[Atomium]], [[Mini-Europe]] [[miniature park]], [[Kinepolis]] cinema and Oc\u00e9ade water park), the Brussels Exhibition Centre and the [[Port of Brussels]], next to which the ''Monument to Work'' by [[Constantin Meunier]] was erected.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Carte-Laeken.jpg|Map of [[Laeken]]\nFile:0 Ch\u00e2teau Royal de Laeken.JPG|[[Castle of Laeken]]\nFile:Bxl, Eglise Notre-Dame de Laeken-2.jpg|[[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]]\nFile:Atomium w.jpg|[[Atomium]]\n</gallery>\n\n====''Mutsaard''====\nSometimes also known as the ''Pagoda'' district, the ''Japanese tower'' district or ''De Wand'' district, ''Mutsaard'' (also spelled ''Mutsaert''), is an old hamlet and a historic district located between Laeken and Neder-over-Heembeek and centred around Mutsaard Square. The district was part of the former municipality of Laeken (postcode: 1020) but also a piece of Neder-over-Heembeek, annexed by Laeken in 1897. It is separated from the rest of Laeken by the Royal Domain and is the site of the [[Museums of the Far East]]. The district also extends a little on the neighbouring Flemish municipalities of [[Vilvoorde]] and [[Grimbergen]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Map mutsaert.jpg|Map of Mutsaard\nFile:Mus\u00e9es Extr\u00eame-Orient 944.jpg|Japanese tower\nFile:Pavillon chinois Bruxelles.jpg|Chinese pavilion\n</gallery>\n\n====''Neder-Over-Heembeek''====\n[[Neder-Over-Heembeek]] is a former municipality incorporated in the city of Brussels in 1921, at the same time as Laeken and Haren. It has the distinction of having the oldest place name in the Brussels-Capital Region, as it was mentioned in an ordinance as early as the 7th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} This is where the Queen Astrid Military Hospital, which is the National Burns and Poisons centre, as well as recruitment services of the [[Belgian Armed Forces]] are located.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Carte Neder-Over-Hembeek.jpg|Map of [[Neder-Over-Heembeek]]\nFile:N-O-Heembbek Bxl 01.JPG|Old [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] tower in Lower Heembeek\nFile:Neder-over-Hembeek, Eglise Saint Nicolas.JPG|Church of St Nicholas in Upper Heembeek\n</gallery>\n\n====''Haren''====\nLike Laeken and Neder-Over-Heembeek, the former municipality of [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] was annexed by the municipality (City) of Brussels in 1921, which allowed the extension of the [[Schaarbeek railway station|Schaerbeek railway station]] north of its territory. But it is the presence, southwest of the town, of an airfield, created by the Germans during the [[World War I|First World War]], and where the Belgian national airline [[Sabena]] was born, which precipitated the annexation of Haren. For almost fifty years, Haren has been home to the [[NATO]] headquarters. It is also the location of many other administrations and companies, such as the headquarters of [[Eurocontrol]].\n\n==Mayors==\n{{main|List of mayors of the City of Brussels}}\nAs in every other Belgian municipality, the City of Brussels is headed by a mayor, who should not be confused with the [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region]] or the [[Governor of Brussels-Capital]].\n\n==Culture==\nThere are many museums in and around Brussels' city centre.

Premi\u00e8re phase: De gueules plain\", in: ''\u00c9tudes in\u00e9dites'', Brussels, 1936, p. 111-113: \u00ab A text from 1339 \u00a0informs us with precision on this point. This first coat of arms of the city of Brussels were gules plain. Why ? The legend, which the Luyster van Brabant echoes, reports that Leo Torgotus, crowned king of Tongeren in 3609 of creation - or 368 before the birth of Christ - after having defeated tribes united against him, advanced in Brabant to hold his winter quarters there. He built two castles there, one on the heights of Coudenberg, the other on an island in the Senne, and in between, a tower, the Saint-Nicolas tower. He gave this place the name of Broidsel or Broedsel, and there was formed Brussels ... In memory of the battles fought by L\u00e9o Torgotus and where the blood was shed in such abundance that the water of the rivers was reddened, the city adopted for his coat of arms \"a simple red field\" (een simpel roodt veldt) and kept it such until the moment when the image of the Archangel Michael was placed in said field that the city had chosen as its patron. Heraldic science allows us to formulate the following hypothesis: the red would be a reminder of the coat of arms of Lothier which are gules to a fess of silver ... Different documents show us these very plain Brussels arms: notably a drawing representing the seat of Brussels by Count Ferrand and a table depicting the siege of Neuss by Charles the Bold. Red was, moreover the color of the city. In the sixteenth century, the archivist of the Sainte-\u00c9lisabeth convent, explaining the meaning of the coat of arms adopted by his convent, tells us from the start of his description that the background is Gules, i.e. red, and that this indicates Brussels (dat is root ende beteekent Bruessel). It is also the small shield of gules which adorns the marvelous tapestries taken out of the workshops of Brussels. \".

The fourth reviewer, Lynzee Loveridge, was put off by the infantile cast of high school girls having \"caricatures of female relationships\" with uninteresting topics and the overly sweet art style encompassing the episode without a hint of realism to ground it.<ref name=\"slow start\"/>\n\n==Note==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://slow-start.com/ Anime official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{ann|manga|19568}}\n\n{{CloverWorks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slow Start}}\n[[Category:Anime series based on manga]]\n[[Category:CloverWorks]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Houbunsha manga]]\n[[Category:School life in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Slice of life anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Yonkoma]]\n[[Category:LGBT in anime and manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Slow Start\n| image           = Slow Start volume 1 cover.jpg\n| caption         = Cover of ''Slow Start'' volume 1 by Houbunsha featuring (from top to bottom): Tamate, Hana, Kamuri, and Eiko.\n| ja_kanji        = \u30b9\u30ed\u30a6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\n| ja_romaji       = Surou Sut\u0101to\n| genre           = [[Comedy]], [[Slice of life]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Aniplex of America to Stream New Slice of Life Comedy, ''Slow Start'', on Crunchyroll in January 2018|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2017-12-13/aniplex-of-america-to-stream-new-slice-of-life-comedy-slow-start-on-crunchyroll-in-january-2018/.125257|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=February 17, 2018|date=December 13, 2017}}</ref><!-- Genres should be based on what reliable sources list them as and not on personal interpretations.

The fourth reviewer, Lynzee Loveridge, was put off by the infantile cast of high school girls having \"caricatures of female relationships\" with uninteresting topics and the overly sweet art style encompassing the episode without a hint of realism to ground it.<ref name=\"slow start\"/>\n\n==Note==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://slow-start.com/ Anime official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{ann|manga|19568}}\n\n{{CloverWorks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slow Start}}\n[[Category:Anime series based on manga]]\n[[Category:CloverWorks]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Houbunsha manga]]\n[[Category:School life in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Slice of life anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Yonkoma]]\n[[Category:LGBT in anime and manga]]\n", "name_user": "Narutolovehinata5", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eManga:oops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Start_(manga)"}

The chapel joined an existing congregation, which had first met in the house of Thomas Willoughby in Horwich from 1672 and this led to the building of a new chapel there in 1774. In this way the Horwich and Rivington chapels were \"rent in twain\", to quote the local historian [[Thomas Hampson]] writing in 1893.<ref name=\"Hampson 1883 93\"/>\n\nA [[manse]], or minister's house, was built in 1787. A [[Sunday school]] began in 1795 in the adjacent school house and a library was added by Rev James Taylor<ref>{{Harvnb|Irvine|1904|p=109}}</ref>, operating between 1821 and 1985. The congregation of the chapel stopped an invasion of [[Methodists]] who tried to convert them by holding a loud service at the chapel gates in 1893 in an attempt to overpower the congregation of the chapel indoors. The Methodist preacher was overcome by the noise from the banging of a silver tea tray by the occupant of New Hall, who like other villagers was annoyed at the intrusion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hampson|1893|pp=171\u2013172}}</ref> [[J. M. Andrews]], the second [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], was married to Jessie Ormrod at the chapel in 1902.\n<ref name=\"angelfire\"/>\n\nThe interior of the chapel had extensive repairs in 1960. The chapel was the focus of a national pilgrimage of Unitarians in 1961.<ref name=\"Uni\"/> The manse is now a private residence; money from the sale was used to create a garden of remembrance in 1970 with surrounding wall containing niches for [[crematorium]] ashes. After the library closed in 1985, the building became a caf\u00e9, now known as Rivington Village Green Tea Room.\n\n==Architecture==\n===Exterior===\nThe chapel is a plain structure, built of [[gritstone]] with [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] at the corners and a slate roof. It has a small, hexagonal [[bellcote]] on the west gable. The side walls have two cross-windows with rectangular panes of glass and the gable walls have windows with small diamond-latticed panes of glass. On the south side are two doorways with [[chamfered]] surrounds; over one door is a [[lintel]] dated 1703. At the north-west corner is a two-storey wing with a tall chimney stack, which was the school house.<ref name=\"IoE\"/> The building is surrounded by a [[drystone wall]] and the chapel's original [[cast iron]] gates survive.<ref name=angelfire/>\n\n===Interior===\nThe ceiling is [[Timber framing|supported by oak beams]]; the walls are plain and decorated with [[lime wash]]. On the north wall between the windows is a raised five-sided panelled [[pulpit]] with carved [[frieze]] and moulded [[cornice]], one of few remaining in its original position, most having been moved in the [[Victorian era]]. A rail at the front of the pulpit is inscribed with the words 'Marriages may be solemnised in this chapel', this originates to eventual recognition in 1754 of marriages conducted in the chapel and is a reminder that the congregation was once oppressed. The chapel retains its [[box pews]], which were originally individually owned or rented. The Willoughby pew by the south wall has a large ornate [[Canopy (building)|canopy]] with panelled [[reredos]] and a moulded and carved [[cornice]] in the classical style. There is a [[choir stall]] at the east end. The [[church organ]] at the south-east corner was a gift in 1843 from Halliwell Road Unitarian Chapel in [[Bolton]], and has been restored, some of the original pews were removed to make way for the organ. Inscribed in the wood of the pews at this side highlighted in gold leaf are the words 'Let the peeling organ blow'. The chapel has electric lighting but the original [[candle holder]]s have been retained.<ref name=angelfire/>\n\n==Monuments==\n===Interior===\nThe memorial to Rev. Samuel Newton is a broken piece of slate that was recovered from the chapel yard by workmen in 1844 and was reassembled and mounted in a frame above the entrance and reads \"Rev Samuel Newton driven from Church on Bartholomew Sunday 1662\". On the north wall is large 18th-century monument to the family of the [[Baron Willoughby of Parham|11th to 15th Barons Willoughby of Parham]].<ref name=\"IoE\"/> Brass plates on two pew doors are inscribed \"Robert Andrews, John William Crompton, Andrew Crompton\" and \"The Right Honorable Hugh Lord Willoughyby F.R.S of Parham obit 1765\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Irvine|1904|p=111}}</ref>. Other memorials are that of the Andrews of [[Rivington Hall]] inscribed with the words \"In memory of their beloved Uncle, Robert Andrews, of Rivington Esquire,  who died July 4th 1858 aged 73 years and of John Andrews, his brother who died December 22 1865 in the 80th year of his age. The monument was erected by their surviving nieces.\" The memorial to the Cromptons who were the last hereditary owners of Rivington Hall before sale to [[Leverhulme]] reads \"In memory of my beloved husband and devoted father and brother, Andrew Crompton of Rivington who died 4th February 1933 aged 64 years also his father John William Crompton of Rivington Esquire who died 23rd March 1905 age 70 years and his mother Margaret Evelyn who died 11 February 1910 age 65 years and his wife Teresa Richardson who died 15th September 1858 age 81.\" There is a memorial to a former minister that reads \"In affectionate memory of Rev Samuel Thompson, the faithful minister of this chapel, from January 1st 1881 to July 1st 1909, he being dead yet speaketh\". other memorials are to the families of Lowe, Smithells and Brindle. The Norris memorial was created from a brass plaque that was unearthed during maintenance work in the 1990s in the oldest part of the chapel yard.\n\n=== Chapel Yard ===\nThe original chapel yard had no path and was covered by grass. Until the early 20th century the chapel was heavily covered in [[Ivy]] and the gate was kept locked and entry was accompanied if no service was being conducted, during which the service was conducted with windows open in summer.<ref name=Croston1883pp130>{{Harvnb|Croston|1883|pp=130-131}}</ref> Gravestones are a variety of types, with the earlier ones being slabs raised by stone sides, many of the raised grave slabs had to be lowered to ground level due to the supports sinking by the mid 20th century. Some graves at ground level were surrounded by decorative wrought iron railings, the ironwork was removed in [[World War II]] by government for use in munitions production.<ref name=angelfire/> There are graves here with monuments to the Pilkingtons, Andrews, and Cromptons, [[Lord of the Manor|Lords]] of the [[Manor of Rivington]];<ref>{{Harvnb|Rawlinson|1969|p=46}}</ref> the Shaws, whose ancestry can be traced to 1190;<ref name=\"Shaw1911pp280-282\"/> the Ormrods; Samuel Oldknow \"of Nottingham, late of Anderton\", who died on 7 August 1759 and whose son, [[Samuel Oldknow]], was a factory owner<ref name=\"IoE\"/> and the first [[List of Mayors of Bolton|Mayor of Bolton]], C.

The chapel joined an existing congregation, which had first met in the house of Thomas Willoughby in Horwich from 1672 and this led to the building of a new chapel there in 1774. In this way the Horwich and Rivington chapels were \"rent in twain\", to quote the local historian [[Thomas Hampson]] writing in 1893.<ref name=\"Hampson 1883 93\"/>\n\nA [[manse]], or minister's house, was built in 1787. A [[Sunday school]] began in 1795 in the adjacent school house and a library was added by Rev James Taylor<ref>{{Harvnb|Irvine|1904|p=109}}</ref>, operating between 1821 and 1985. The congregation of the chapel stopped an invasion of [[Methodists]] who tried to convert them by holding a loud service at the chapel gates in 1893 in an attempt to overpower the congregation of the chapel indoors. The Methodist preacher was overcome by the noise from the banging of a silver tea tray by the occupant of New Hall, who like other villagers was annoyed at the intrusion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hampson|1893|pp=171\u2013172}}</ref> [[J. M. Andrews]], the second [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], was married to Jessie Ormrod at the chapel in 1902.\n<ref name=\"angelfire\"/>\n\nThe interior of the chapel had extensive repairs in 1960. The chapel was the focus of a national pilgrimage of Unitarians in 1961.<ref name=\"Uni\"/> The manse is now a private residence; money from the sale was used to create a garden of remembrance in 1970 with surrounding wall containing niches for [[crematorium]] ashes. After the library closed in 1985, the building became a caf\u00e9, now known as Rivington Village Green Tea Room.\n\n==Architecture==\n===Exterior===\nThe chapel is a plain structure, built of [[gritstone]] with [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] at the corners and a slate roof. It has a small, hexagonal [[bellcote]] on the west gable. The side walls have two cross-windows with rectangular panes of glass and the gable walls have windows with small diamond-latticed panes of glass. On the south side are two doorways with [[chamfered]] surrounds; over one door is a [[lintel]] dated 1703. At the north-west corner is a two-storey wing with a tall chimney stack, which was the school house.<ref name=\"IoE\"/> The building is surrounded by a [[drystone wall]] and the chapel's original [[cast iron]] gates survive.<ref name=angelfire/>\n\n===Interior===\nThe ceiling is [[Timber framing|supported by oak beams]]; the walls are plain and decorated with [[lime wash]]. On the north wall between the windows is a raised five-sided panelled [[pulpit]] with carved [[frieze]] and moulded [[cornice]], one of few remaining in its original position, most having been moved in the [[Victorian era]]. A rail at the front of the pulpit is inscribed with the words 'Marriages may be solemnised in this chapel', this originates to eventual recognition in 1754 of marriages conducted in the chapel and is a reminder that the congregation was once oppressed. The chapel retains its [[box pews]], which were originally individually owned or rented. The Willoughby pew by the south wall has a large ornate [[Canopy (building)|canopy]] with panelled [[reredos]] and a moulded and carved [[cornice]] in the classical style. There is a [[choir stall]] at the east end. The [[church organ]] at the south-east corner was a gift in 1843 from Halliwell Road Unitarian Chapel in [[Bolton]], and has been restored, some of the original pews were removed to make way for the organ. Inscribed in the wood of the pews at this side highlighted in gold leaf are the words 'Let the peeling organ blow'. The chapel has electric lighting but the original [[candle holder]]s have been retained.<ref name=angelfire/>\n\n==Monuments==\n===Interior===\nThe memorial to Rev. Samuel Newton is a broken piece of slate that was recovered from the chapel yard by workmen in 1844 and was reassembled and mounted in a frame above the entrance and reads \"Rev Samuel Newton driven from Church on Bartholomew Sunday 1662\". On the north wall is large 18th-century monument to the family of the [[Baron Willoughby of Parham|11th to 15th Barons Willoughby of Parham]].<ref name=\"IoE\"/> Brass plates on two pew doors are inscribed \"Robert Andrews, John William Crompton, Andrew Crompton\" and \"The Right Honorable Hugh Lord Willoughyby F.R.S of Parham obit 1765\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Irvine|1904|p=111}}</ref>. Other memorials are that of the Andrews of [[Rivington Hall]] inscribed with the words \"In memory of their beloved Uncle, Robert Andrews, of Rivington Esquire,  who died July 4th 1858 aged 73 years and of John Andrews, his brother who died December 22 1865 in the 80th year of his age. The monument was erected by their surviving nieces.\" The memorial to the Cromptons who were the last hereditary owners of Rivington Hall before sale to [[Leverhulme]] reads \"In memory of my beloved husband and devoted father and brother, Andrew Crompton of Rivington who died 4th February 1933 aged 64 years also his father John William Crompton of Rivington Esquire who died 23rd March 1905 age 70 years and his mother Margaret Evelyn who died 11 February 1910 age 65 years and his wife Teresa Richardson who died 15th September 1858 age 81.\" There is a memorial to a former minister that reads \"In affectionate memory of Rev Samuel Thompson, the faithful minister of this chapel, from January 1st 1881 to July 1st 1909, he being dead yet speaketh\". other memorials are to the families of Lowe, Smithells and Brindle. The Norris memorial was created from a brass plaque that was unearthed during maintenance work in the 1990s in the oldest part of the chapel yard.\n\n=== Chapel Yard ===\nThe original chapel yard had no path and was covered by grass. Until the early 20th century the chapel was heavily covered in [[Ivy]] and the gate was kept locked and entry was accompanied if no service was being conducted, during which the service was conducted with windows open in summer.<ref name=Croston1883pp130>{{Harvnb|Croston|1883|pp=130-131}}</ref> Gravestones are a variety of types, with the earlier ones being slabs raised by stone sides, many of the raised grave slabs had to be lowered to ground level due to the supports sinking by the mid 20th century. Some graves at ground level were surrounded by decorative wrought iron railings, the ironwork was removed in [[World War II]] by government for use in munitions production.<ref name=angelfire/> There are graves here with monuments to the Pilkingtons, Andrews, and Cromptons, [[Lord of the Manor|Lords]] of the [[Manor of Rivington]];<ref>{{Harvnb|Rawlinson|1969|p=46}}</ref> the Shaws, whose ancestry can be traced to 1190;<ref name=\"Shaw1911pp280-282\"/> the Ormrods; Samuel Oldknow \"of Nottingham, late of Anderton\", who died on 7 August 1759 and whose son, [[Samuel Oldknow]], was a factory owner<ref name=\"IoE\"/> and the first [[List of Mayors of Bolton|Mayor of Bolton]], C.

Historical relations have oscillated among grudging cooperation, neutrality, open hatred and hostility.\n\nBoth countries refused to [[International recognition of Kosovo|recognize]] [[Kosovo]]'s [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declaration of independence]] from [[Serbia]] and strongly supported its territorial integrity. About 30,000 Russians live in Romania, mainly in the [[Tulcea County]] (''see [[Lipovans]]''). About 5,308 Romanians live in Russia, mainly in the [[Russian Far East]]. Both countries are full members of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].\n\nIn 1992 and 1993, relations between the two were especially strained when they backed opposite sides in the [[Transnistria conflict]]. Romania is part of [[NATO]], which Russia views in a highly negative light. Debates over the status of [[Transnistria]] maintain antagonism between Romanians and Russians. Furthermore, according to ''The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804-1999'' by Misha Glenny, [[Russophobia|dislike of Russia and Russians]] is deeply integrated into Romanian culture since the end of the 19th century due to chronic quarrels between the two countries, and has been for most of the modern era.\n\nRussian opinion on Romania is highly mixed and varied according to the geo-political considerations at one given time, ranging from predominantly indifference, sometimes to slight esteem, at times deep frustration and even profound disconsideration. As Romania most often does not infringe on Russia's sensibilities as a great opportunity or menace, the general Russian opinion is of triviliality; Romania barely exists to the Russian mind for an opinion to form. The slight esteem derived from common grounds reached between the two sides at various times, a common Christian Orthodox faith and some common cultural values. Deep frustration and even profound disconsideration remained nevertheless the predominant Russian reaction when both sides were locked into geopolitical struggles.\n\nAs one primary Russian geopolitical objective has been expansion of its influence into the Balkan Peninsula the two sides became more often adversaries than partners.\n\n== History ==\n\n===18th and early 19th centuries. Russian Protectorate===\nThe relationship between the two countries started during the 15th century, when a Moldavian prince, [[Stephen the Great]], married his daughter to the Tsar's son.\nIn 1712, another Moldavian prince, [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] allied with [[Peter the Great]] to gain independence from Ottoman Empire. He became one of Peter's courtiers.\n\nRussian-Romanian relations were generally cordial until the end of the 18th century when Russia was helping [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], two principalities that would later join to create Romania, free themselves of Ottoman domination. Russia's role as a spiritual \"guardian\" for the Ottomon Empire's Orthodox Christian subjects was affirmed in the 1774 [[Treaty of Kuchuk Kainardji]], and Russia soon after gained a border with the [[Ottomon Empire]] right next to the principalities.<ref>Glenny, Misha. ''The Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers; 1804-1999''. Page 15</ref> The \"Danubian Principalities\" were then semi-autonomous, ruled by Greek Phanariot ''hospodars'', whom the Romanians (both the boyars and the peasantry) widely resented.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRussia's influence waxed in Walachia and Moldavia as Ottoman power waned. In 1739 and 1769 the Russians briefly occupied the principalities. Then in 1774, Catherine the Great agreed to return Moldavia, Walachia, and Bessarabia to the Turks, but she obtained the right to represent Orthodox Christians within the Ottoman Empire and oversee the principalities' internal affairs. In 1787 the Russian army again marched into the principalities, but a stalemate gripped forces on all fronts and in 1792 the empress and sultan agreed to reaffirm existing treaties. In 1802 the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] agreed to halt the rapid turnover of [[Phanariotes|Phanariot]] princes; henceforth, the princes would reign for seven-year terms and could not be dethroned without Russian approval.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\">{{Cite web|title = Romania - The Russian Protectorate|url = http://countrystudies.us/romania/14.htm|website = countrystudies.us|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 1806 forces of [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]] reoccupied the principalities, and the local peasants were subjected to forced requisitions, heavy labor obligations, and real threats of exile to Siberia. As a result, the Romanians, who once had looked to the tsar for liberation, developed an abiding mistrust of the Russians that would deepen in the next century. In 1812 Russia and the Porte signed the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Peace of Bucharest]], which returned the principalities to the Ottomans and secured Russia's southern flank during Napoleon's invasion; Russia, however, annexed Bessarabia and retained its right to interfere in the principalities' affairs. Despite Russia's concessions, the treaty so displeased the sultan that he had his negotiators beheaded.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\nIn 1821 Greek nationalists headquartered in Odessa took control of Moldavia as the first step in a plan to extricate Greece from Ottoman domination. Phanariot rule in Walachia and Moldavia led the Greek nationalists to view the principalities as possible components of a renascent Byzantine Empire. The insurgency's leader, [[Alexander Ypsilantis|Alexander Ypsilanti]], a general in the Russian army and son of a Phanariot prince, enjoyed the support of some Greek and Romanian boyars in the principalities; after more than a century of extortion, however, most Romanians resented the Phanariots and craved the end of Greek control. [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], a peasant-born Romanian whose wits and military skill had elevated him to boyar rank, assumed power in Walachia in an anti-Phanariot national uprising directed at establishing a Romanian government under Ottoman suzerainty. Russia denounced both Ypsilanti and Vladimirescu. The two rebel leaders argued in Bucharest; afterwards, Greek officers shot the Romanian, mutilated his body, and dumped it into a pond, an act that also ended Romanian resistance, which evaporated after Vladimirescu's death. Then the Turks, with Russia's approval, attacked the principalities, scattered the Greek forces, and chased Ypsilanti into Transylvania. The [[Greek War of Independence|Greek rebellion]] shocked the Porte, which no longer appointed Phanariot princes to the Walachian and Moldavian thrones and chose instead native Romanians.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\nLater, in 1826, an internal crisis forced the sultan to accede to Russia's demand for greater influence in the principalities. The Porte gave Russia the right of consultation regarding changes on the two thrones; this concession assured Russia predominant influence at Bucharest and Ia\u0219i. Russia again invaded the principalities during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201329)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828]], which resulted in the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|1829 Treaty of Adrianople]]. The treaty provided for Russian occupation of the principalities until the Ottomans had fully paid an indemnity, the election of native Romanian princes for life, and an independent national administration and freedom of worship and commerce under Russian protection. Despite the fact that the Porte remained the principalities' suzerain and could exact a fixed tribute and direct certain aspects of foreign policy, the sultan could neither reject nor remove a prince without Russian consent.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\nDuring Russia's occupation, a capable administrator, Count [[Pavel Kiselyov]], improved health conditions, organized a well-disciplined police force, built up grain reserves, and oversaw the drafting and ratification of the principalities' first fundamental laws, the ''[[Regulamentul Organic|R\u00e8glement Organique]]''. Russia used these charters to co-opt Romanian boyars by protecting their privileges, including their tax-exempt status and oligarchic control of the government. However flawed, the charters gave Romanians their first taste of government by law. The ''R\u00e8glement'' provided for elected assemblies of boyars to choose each prince, reformed the principalities' judicial systems, and established public education. At the same time, the documents' economic provisions enabled the boyars to stiffen peasant obligations and reduced the peasants' freedom of mobility. After Russia's withdrawal in 1834, Walachia and Moldavia entered a period of self-government during which Russia guaranteed the privileges that the Ottomans had granted.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\n=== 1848 to 1853 ===\nRussia's actions caused a multiplication of anti-Russian sentiment throughout the Principalities, for each group having a different reason. The urban elite (the later Liberals) were frustrated by Russia's opposition to reform in Romania; while landowning boyars (the later Conservatives) were frustrated by Russia's impediments on the economy.<ref name=GlennyEarlyRomania>Glenny, Misha. ''The Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers''. Pages 57-69</ref> Romania was flooded with French literary works transmitting Enlightenment ideas, and due to the similarity of Romanian and French, these had a much faster effect on Romania than other areas.<ref name=\"GlennyEarlyRomania\" /> Hence, from a very early time, there was competition between France and Russia for Romania's affinities, even though Russia was the only one of the two to have any real immediate significance to Romania. These feelings provided only strengthened the [[Russophobia#Romania|anti-Russian sentiment]] in Romania.\n\nIn 1848, Romanians for the first time revolted against Russia, and the Russian flag and the Organic Declarations were burned in public.<ref name=\"GlennyEarlyRomania\" /> Romania in fact wooed [[Ottomon Empire|the Porte]], which had to be \"persuaded\" by Russia not to aid the Romanians.\n\nThe uprising of Transylvania's Romanian peasants during the 1848 European revolutions ignited Romanian national movements in Walachia and Moldavia. In Moldavia, Sturdza quashed the revolution overnight by arresting its leaders. In Walachia, however, a majority of the younger generation was averse to Russian and boyar dominance. Revolutionary platforms called for universal suffrage, equal rights, unification of the two principalities, and freedom of speech, association, and assembly. Although he sympathized with the revolutionary movement, Bibescu lacked the courage to lead it. After naming a revolutionary cabinet and signing a new constitution, he fled into Transylvania. The new government of Walachia quickly affirmed its loyalty to the Porte and appealed to Austria, France, and Britain for support, hoping to avert a Russian invasion. The government also formed a committee composed equally of boyars and peasants to discuss land reform. Shocked by the revolution's success in Europe and fearful that it might spread into Russia, the tsar invaded Moldavia and pressured the Porte to crush the rebels in Bucharest. Dissatisfied with Turkey's weak resolve, Russia invaded Walachia and restored the R\u00e8glement. After 1849 the two empires suppressed the boyar assemblies in Walachia and Moldavia and limited the tenure of their princes to seven years.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\nIn July 1853, Russia invaded and occupied Romania.<ref name=\"GlennyEarlyRomania\" />{{dubious|date=December 2013}} Russian occupation was harsh and all political organizations were suppressed. When the Porte declared war on Russia in October of that year, Romanians hoped desperately that Russia would be driven from their country (ironically by the country which they had just recently separated from). This wish was granted by the coalition of both Turkey and Austria against Russia.\n\n=== Romanian Independence  ===\n[[File:Russian Army in Bucharest, The Illustrated London News, 1877.jpg|thumb|The Russian Army in [[Bucharest]] in 1877]]\nRomania's independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] was achieved mainly with Russian assistance, although during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877 the Russians requested military assistance from Romania during the [[Siege of Plevna]], after suffering heavy losses.<ref>\"Reminiscences of the King of Roumania\",  ed.

Page 61-2</ref>\n\n===1877 to World War I===\nFear of Russian encroachment in the Balkans drove the Romanians in 1883 into a  secret pact with Vienna. The king, Prime Minister Ioan Bratianu, Foreign Minister D. A. Sturdza, and Romanian Minister to Vienna P. P. Carp supported Romania's orientation toward the Central Powers.<ref>Nicolae Cazan, \"The secret treaty of alliance between Romania and Austria-Hungary\" ''Revue Roumaine d'Etudes Internationales'' (1973) 4#19 pp 185-205.</ref>  In addition there was economic competition with Russia. From very early on, however, Romanian economic competition with Russia throttled good relations. Romania is a natural economic rival of Russia (on the eve of World War II, in fact, it was the world's fourth largest food exporter, after Russia, Canada and the US).<ref>Glenny, Misha. ''The Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers''. Page 61</ref> Balkans expert Misha Glenny explains Russia's historical attitude towards Romania as such:<blockquote>\n''...Russia saw wheat cultivation in Romania as a threat to its own harvests in southern Russia, much of it sold on to Britain and France. If the Principalities were able to modernize the port facilities on the [[Danube]] and the [[Black Sea]], they could begin to undercut the price of Russian wheat on world markets. To throttle this competition, Russia exploited its position as protector of the Principalities by allowing the mouth of the Danube to silt up. Russia's interest in the Principalities was essentially strategic. St. Petersburg wanted a pliant satellite, not an economic competitor. ''\n</blockquote>Russia's expansionist designs in the Balkan Peninsula with its conclusive geo-political objective the capture of the strait of [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]] convinced Romania that Russia has no good faith, and forced Romania to look for support somewhere else. Russia's aggressiveness, its projects for territorial conquests was being executed under the policy of [[Pan-Slavism]]. Bratianu denounced the danger of the Pan-Slavic idea for the entire Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Le panslavisme et ses dangers pour L'Europe|last = Br\u0103tianu|first = G.|publisher = |year = 1877|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 53}}</ref> There, on the shores of Bosphorus and Dardanelles, was the key to Europe. Romanian Prime Minister [[Take Ionescu]] concludes:  \u201cAll the efforts made by the empire, all its aspirations, all the Russian impetus are heading towards that point\u201d. The Russian conquests in this region would have threatened Romania's existence itself. \u201cWe cannot talk about agreements, compromises and concessions. If we still exist, Russia will experience a failure in its plans which have animated the heart of the Russians, for two centuries. If the neighbouring empire succeeds in accomplishing the dream it has pursued with so much confidence and tenacity, the Romanian state and people will become just a memory.

Russia's efforts to expand its influence in the Balkans met with the Austro-Hungarian resistance. Since Russia's claims in the Balkans were sustained in most cases by France and Great Britain, and the Austro-Hungarian claims were sustained by Germany, the Balkan Peninsula was about to face the strong political pressures from both side.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Balancing Romania-Russia Relations: A Grounding of the Balkan Crisis Through Proper Application of Political Conditionalities |url=http://cis01.central.ucv.ro/revistadestiintepolitice/files/numarul45_2015/8.%20Balancing%20Romania-Russia%20Relations%20A%20Grounding%20of%20the%20Balkan%20Crisis...%20pp.%2076-88.pdf |last = Dinu|first = Elena Stelu\u021ba|date = 2015|journal =  Revista de Stiinte Politice |issue=45 |pages=76\u201388|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> During the Balkan crisis of 1885-1886 there were marked Russian-Romanian divergences because the Romanian diplomacy supported the election of [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg]] at the Bulgarian throne, the candidate backed by Austria-Hungary.\n\nIn order to improve relations, [[Bucharest Russian Church|St. Nicholas Russian Church]](Romanian: ''Biserica Rus\u0103'') was started in central Bucharest in 1905, initiated by Russian Ambassador Mikhail Nikolaevich Giers. The Court of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II]] provided the funds needed for the building (600,000 gold rubles). The structure occupies a surface of 350 m\u00b2 and it was set in brick and stone. The seven domes (taking the shape of onion domes \u2014 characteristic of Russia, but unusual in Romania) were initially covered in gold. The iconostasis was carved in wood and then covered in gold, following the model of [[Church of the Twelve Apostles]] in the Moscow Kremlin.

Its main goal was to obtain Transylvania, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire that was part of the he Triple Alliance. . that Empire in turn was supported by Germany.  Romania therefore was pulled toward  the Russian orbit especially during the Balkan Wars of 1912 - 1913 the Russians appreciated their entry into the Balkans.  High-level royal visits were exchanged. In 1914, however, Romania remained neutral at first, finally joining with Russia, France and Britain in 1916.<ref>Sorin Arhire, \"From Hostility to Friendship: the Russian-Romanian Relations in the Years Prior to the Outbreak of the First World War.\" \u2018\u2019\u0411\u044b\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u044b. \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u2019\u2019 3.53 (2019): 1383-1393.</ref>\n\n===World War I (1916\u20131918)===\nWhen the war began Romania declared neutrality, but began secret negotiations with Russia and Britain whereby they would recognize Romanian acquisition of Transylvania.

King [[Michael of Romania]] [[King Michael's Coup|led a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] that deposed the Antonescu regime and put Romania on the side of the Soviet Union for the remainder of the war. Despite this late association with the winning side, [[Greater Romania]] was largely dismantled, losing territory to [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n=== Interbellum ===\n\n===Romania-Soviet Union relations (1945/47\u20131990)===\n[[File:Gheorghiu-Dej & Khrushchev at Bucharest's Baneasa Airport (June 1960).jpg|thumb|[[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] (with [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] at his right hand side) and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] at Bucharest's [[Baneasa Airport]] in June 1960]]\nAfter coming under communist control in 1948, Romania was closely aligned with the international policies and goals of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. But after mid-1952, when Gheorghiu-Dej had gained full control of the party and had become head of state, Romania began a slow disengagement from Kremlin domination, being careful not to incur the suspicions or disapproval of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Soviet troops left Romania in 1958, no [[Warsaw Pact]] troops were allowed on Romanian territory after 1962, and Romanian forces essentially quit participating in joint [[Warsaw Pact]] field exercises in the late 1960s. At the same time, Ceausescu announced that Romania would no longer put its military forces under the Warsaw Pact's joint command, even during peacetime maneuvers. By that period, the Soviet Union and Romania established [[SovRom]]s, which were the new tax-exempt Soviet-Romanian economic corporations that helped the reconstruction of Romania until they were dismantled in 1956: albeit, some lasted until 1975 with the main focus to assure Soviet access to resources like Uranium.\n\nIn 1976 Ceausescu received [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Bucharest\u2014the first official visit by a Soviet leader since 1955. The final communique of the meeting reflected continuing disagreements between the two countries, as Romania refused to side with the Soviets in [[Sino-Soviet split|their dispute with China]]. In 1978, after visiting China, Ceausescu attended a [[Warsaw Pact]] summit meeting in Moscow, where he rejected a Soviet proposal that member countries increase their military expenditures. On his return to Bucharest, Ceausescu explained the refusal by stating that any increase in military expenditure was contrary to the [[Communist block|socialist countries']] effort to reduce military tensions in Europe.<ref name=\"Country data- Romania\">[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-11273.html Country data- Romania]</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of Ceausescu's uncooperative attitude, a 1980 Romanian attempt to secure supplies of energy and [[raw materials]] from the Soviet Union and other [[Comecon]] countries failed when those countries demanded world market prices and payment in [[hard currency]]. Nor would the Soviet Union guarantee that it would increase or even maintain existing levels of oil exports to Romania for the following year.\n[[File:Prunariu with Brejnev.jpg|thumb|[[Dumitru Prunariu]] and [[Leonid Popov]] with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1981]]\nThe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused Romania to distance itself further from Brezhnev. When the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops, Romania broke with its Warsaw Pact allies and abstained. And one month later, at a meeting of communist states in Sofia, Romania joined the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) in refusing to endorse the invasion.<ref name=\"Country data- Romania\"/>\n\nDuring [[Yuri Andropov]]'s brief tenure as Soviet leader, relations remained frigid. The wording of the [[communique]] following a meeting with Ceausescu in Moscow suggested that Andropov intended to pressure Romania to bring its foreign policy into line with the Warsaw Pact. The Romanian leadership appeared to suspect Andropov of pro-[[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] sympathies because of his close personal friendship with First Secretary [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] of Hungary. Romanian disagreements with the Soviet position on intermediate nuclear forces in Europe also surfaced during the Andropov period.\n\n===Romanian relations with the Russian Federation===\n[[File:Vladimir Putin with Constantin Mihail Grigorie.jpg|thumb|The Ambassador of Romania, [[Constantin Grigorie|Constantin Mihail Grigorie]], presenting his credentials to the President of Russia, [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2008]]\nRomania's foreign policy after 1990 was built exclusively on geo-strategic reasons and less on economic relations, which has led to minimal relations with Russia. Romania to officially declare, in 1993, its desire to join NATO and EU to consolidate its precarious national security. In an effort to reassure its former ally, Romania and Russia signed a treaty concerning bilateral military cooperation in 1994 and agreed to continue negotiations on the signing of the bilateral treaty on good-neighborly relations. Despite these efforts, bilateral relations quickly deteriorated. In April 1996, the Romanian-Russian relationship experienced one of its tensest moments, as the [[Russian Foreign Minister]] [[Yevgeny Primakov]] flew to Bucharest at the invitation of Romanian authorities to sign a renegotiated version of the bilateral good-neighborly relations treaty. Pressed by the opposition parties, president Iliescu changed his mind and Romania refused to sign the treaty, because it failed to address two of the most enduring bilateral disputes between the two countries: Romania decried the treaty's lack of clauses that condemned the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] (1939) and that would establish a clear roadmap for the return of Romania's National Treasure stored in Moscow. Russia furiously denounced Romanian intentions as hostile and driven by irredentist inclinations towards territories within the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, to which Moscow considered Romania might lay claim. Also, Russia complained that Romania refused to include a provision that would commit the two parties not to join alliances that are targeted against the other. Following this episode, all bilateral diplomatic visits were canceled. It was only in 1999 that Bucharest said it was ready to reconsider its relations with Moscow, both at political and economic level. By the mid-2000s, a third window of opportunity to normalize relations opened as a result of the [[Romanian general election, 2000|2000 Romanian general elections]], which saw the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social-Democrat Party]], considered to be [[Russophilia|closer to Moscow]] than other [[List of political parties in Romania|Romanian political parties]], return to power. Eventually, in 2003, the bilateral treaty on good-neighborly relations was signed, but without addressing any of the contentious issues between the two parties: the condemnation of the Ribbentrop\u2013Molotov Pact, the return of Romania's national treasury, and the provision concerning the parties\u2019 commitment not to participate in that are targeted against the other.\n\nA series of high-level contacts culminated with a visit of [[President of Romania|President]] [[Traian Basescu]] to Moscow in 2005, but his statements at the time, of overcoming historical prejudice of the previous 15 years, did not take shape as the relations continued to freeze.\n\nA main source of tension now is the status of Moldova. The conflict over Moldova, or [[Bessarabia]], is not new. It has been ongoing between Romania and Russia for over a century, due to Russia's strategic interests in the region conflicting with Romania's goal of a [[Movement for the unification of Romania and Moldova|unified pan-Romanian state]]. Bessarabia, now known to most of the world as [[Moldova]], was originally a region within Moldavia; Romania was forced to hand it over to Russia at the 1870s [[Congress of Berlin]]. It was briefly regained, then retaken by the Soviet Union after World War II. Romanians may view Moldova as being \"stolen\" by Russia. Romania regained the territory at the end of World War I, only to lose it again at the end of World War II. At the time of the fall of the Soviet Union, the Romanian language (under the controversial name of the \"Moldovan language\") with a Latin script was mandated as the official language of Moldova, causing conflict with non Romanian-speaking regions (namely, [[Gagauzia]] and Transnistria). However, Moldova opted against rejoining Romania at the time, claiming that it had a separate [[national identity]] (see: [[Moldova\u2013Romania relations]]; [[movement for the unification of Romania and Moldova]]).

Romania has an embassy in Moscow and consulates-general in [[Rostov-on-Don]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]. Russia has an embassy in [[Bucharest]] and a consulate-general in [[Constan\u0163a]]. Historical relations have oscillated among grudging cooperation, neutrality, open hatred and hostility.\n\nBoth countries refused to [[International recognition of Kosovo|recognize]] [[Kosovo]]'s [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declaration of independence]] from [[Serbia]] and strongly supported its territorial integrity. About 30,000 Russians live in Romania, mainly in the [[Tulcea County]] (''see [[Lipovans]]''). About 5,308 Romanians live in Russia, mainly in the [[Russian Far East]]. Both countries are full members of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].\n\nIn 1992 and 1993, relations between the two were especially strained when they backed opposite sides in the [[Transnistria conflict]]. Romania is part of [[NATO]], which Russia views in a highly negative light. Debates over the status of [[Transnistria]] maintain antagonism between Romanians and Russians. Furthermore, according to ''The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804-1999'' by Misha Glenny, [[Russophobia|dislike of Russia and Russians]] is deeply integrated into Romanian culture since the end of the 19th century due to chronic quarrels between the two countries, and has been for most of the modern era.\n\nRussian opinion on Romania is highly mixed and varied according to the geo-political considerations at one given time, ranging from predominantly indifference, sometimes to slight esteem, at times deep frustration and even profound disconsideration. As Romania most often does not infringe on Russia's sensibilities as a great opportunity or menace, the general Russian opinion is of triviliality; Romania barely exists to the Russian mind for an opinion to form. The slight esteem derived from common grounds reached between the two sides at various times, a common Christian Orthodox faith and some common cultural values. Deep frustration and even profound disconsideration remained nevertheless the predominant Russian reaction when both sides were locked into geopolitical struggles.\n\nAs one primary Russian geopolitical objective has been expansion of its influence into the Balkan Peninsula the two sides became more often adversaries than partners.\n\n== History ==\n\n===18th and early 19th centuries. Russian Protectorate===\nThe relationship between the two countries started during the 15th century, when a Moldavian prince, [[Stephen the Great]], married his daughter to the Tsar's son.\nIn 1712, another Moldavian prince, [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] allied with [[Peter the Great]] to gain independence from Ottoman Empire. He became one of Peter's courtiers.\n\nRussian-Romanian relations were generally cordial until the end of the 18th century when Russia was helping [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], two principalities that would later join to create Romania, free themselves of Ottoman domination. Russia's role as a spiritual \"guardian\" for the Ottomon Empire's Orthodox Christian subjects was affirmed in the 1774 [[Treaty of Kuchuk Kainardji]], and Russia soon after gained a border with the [[Ottomon Empire]] right next to the principalities.<ref>Glenny, Misha. ''The Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers; 1804-1999''. Page 15</ref> The \"Danubian Principalities\" were then semi-autonomous, ruled by Greek Phanariot ''hospodars'', whom the Romanians (both the boyars and the peasantry) widely resented.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRussia's influence waxed in Walachia and Moldavia as Ottoman power waned. In 1739 and 1769 the Russians briefly occupied the principalities. Then in 1774, Catherine the Great agreed to return Moldavia, Walachia, and Bessarabia to the Turks, but she obtained the right to represent Orthodox Christians within the Ottoman Empire and oversee the principalities' internal affairs. In 1787 the Russian army again marched into the principalities, but a stalemate gripped forces on all fronts and in 1792 the empress and sultan agreed to reaffirm existing treaties. In 1802 the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] agreed to halt the rapid turnover of [[Phanariotes|Phanariot]] princes; henceforth, the princes would reign for seven-year terms and could not be dethroned without Russian approval.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\">{{Cite web|title = Romania - The Russian Protectorate|url = http://countrystudies.us/romania/14.htm|website = countrystudies.us|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 1806 forces of [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]] reoccupied the principalities, and the local peasants were subjected to forced requisitions, heavy labor obligations, and real threats of exile to Siberia. As a result, the Romanians, who once had looked to the tsar for liberation, developed an abiding mistrust of the Russians that would deepen in the next century. In 1812 Russia and the Porte signed the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Peace of Bucharest]], which returned the principalities to the Ottomans and secured Russia's southern flank during Napoleon's invasion; Russia, however, annexed Bessarabia and retained its right to interfere in the principalities' affairs. Despite Russia's concessions, the treaty so displeased the sultan that he had his negotiators beheaded.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\nIn 1821 Greek nationalists headquartered in Odessa took control of Moldavia as the first step in a plan to extricate Greece from Ottoman domination. Phanariot rule in Walachia and Moldavia led the Greek nationalists to view the principalities as possible components of a renascent Byzantine Empire. The insurgency's leader, [[Alexander Ypsilantis|Alexander Ypsilanti]], a general in the Russian army and son of a Phanariot prince, enjoyed the support of some Greek and Romanian boyars in the principalities; after more than a century of extortion, however, most Romanians resented the Phanariots and craved the end of Greek control. [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], a peasant-born Romanian whose wits and military skill had elevated him to boyar rank, assumed power in Walachia in an anti-Phanariot national uprising directed at establishing a Romanian government under Ottoman suzerainty. Russia denounced both Ypsilanti and Vladimirescu. The two rebel leaders argued in Bucharest; afterwards, Greek officers shot the Romanian, mutilated his body, and dumped it into a pond, an act that also ended Romanian resistance, which evaporated after Vladimirescu's death. Then the Turks, with Russia's approval, attacked the principalities, scattered the Greek forces, and chased Ypsilanti into Transylvania. The [[Greek War of Independence|Greek rebellion]] shocked the Porte, which no longer appointed Phanariot princes to the Walachian and Moldavian thrones and chose instead native Romanians.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\nLater, in 1826, an internal crisis forced the sultan to accede to Russia's demand for greater influence in the principalities. The Porte gave Russia the right of consultation regarding changes on the two thrones; this concession assured Russia predominant influence at Bucharest and Ia\u0219i. Russia again invaded the principalities during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201329)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828]], which resulted in the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|1829 Treaty of Adrianople]]. The treaty provided for Russian occupation of the principalities until the Ottomans had fully paid an indemnity, the election of native Romanian princes for life, and an independent national administration and freedom of worship and commerce under Russian protection. Despite the fact that the Porte remained the principalities' suzerain and could exact a fixed tribute and direct certain aspects of foreign policy, the sultan could neither reject nor remove a prince without Russian consent.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\nDuring Russia's occupation, a capable administrator, Count [[Pavel Kiselyov]], improved health conditions, organized a well-disciplined police force, built up grain reserves, and oversaw the drafting and ratification of the principalities' first fundamental laws, the ''[[Regulamentul Organic|R\u00e8glement Organique]]''. Russia used these charters to co-opt Romanian boyars by protecting their privileges, including their tax-exempt status and oligarchic control of the government. However flawed, the charters gave Romanians their first taste of government by law. The ''R\u00e8glement'' provided for elected assemblies of boyars to choose each prince, reformed the principalities' judicial systems, and established public education. At the same time, the documents' economic provisions enabled the boyars to stiffen peasant obligations and reduced the peasants' freedom of mobility. After Russia's withdrawal in 1834, Walachia and Moldavia entered a period of self-government during which Russia guaranteed the privileges that the Ottomans had granted.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\n=== 1848 to 1853 ===\nRussia's actions caused a multiplication of anti-Russian sentiment throughout the Principalities, for each group having a different reason. The urban elite (the later Liberals) were frustrated by Russia's opposition to reform in Romania; while landowning boyars (the later Conservatives) were frustrated by Russia's impediments on the economy.<ref name=GlennyEarlyRomania>Glenny, Misha. ''The Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers''. Pages 57-69</ref> Romania was flooded with French literary works transmitting Enlightenment ideas, and due to the similarity of Romanian and French, these had a much faster effect on Romania than other areas.<ref name=\"GlennyEarlyRomania\" /> Hence, from a very early time, there was competition between France and Russia for Romania's affinities, even though Russia was the only one of the two to have any real immediate significance to Romania. These feelings provided only strengthened the [[Russophobia#Romania|anti-Russian sentiment]] in Romania.\n\nIn 1848, Romanians for the first time revolted against Russia, and the Russian flag and the Organic Declarations were burned in public.<ref name=\"GlennyEarlyRomania\" /> Romania in fact wooed [[Ottomon Empire|the Porte]], which had to be \"persuaded\" by Russia not to aid the Romanians.\n\nThe uprising of Transylvania's Romanian peasants during the 1848 European revolutions ignited Romanian national movements in Walachia and Moldavia. In Moldavia, Sturdza quashed the revolution overnight by arresting its leaders. In Walachia, however, a majority of the younger generation was averse to Russian and boyar dominance. Revolutionary platforms called for universal suffrage, equal rights, unification of the two principalities, and freedom of speech, association, and assembly. Although he sympathized with the revolutionary movement, Bibescu lacked the courage to lead it. After naming a revolutionary cabinet and signing a new constitution, he fled into Transylvania. The new government of Walachia quickly affirmed its loyalty to the Porte and appealed to Austria, France, and Britain for support, hoping to avert a Russian invasion. The government also formed a committee composed equally of boyars and peasants to discuss land reform. Shocked by the revolution's success in Europe and fearful that it might spread into Russia, the tsar invaded Moldavia and pressured the Porte to crush the rebels in Bucharest. Dissatisfied with Turkey's weak resolve, Russia invaded Walachia and restored the R\u00e8glement. After 1849 the two empires suppressed the boyar assemblies in Walachia and Moldavia and limited the tenure of their princes to seven years.<ref name=\"Romania - The Russian Protectorate\"/>\n\nIn July 1853, Russia invaded and occupied Romania.<ref name=\"GlennyEarlyRomania\" />{{dubious|date=December 2013}} Russian occupation was harsh and all political organizations were suppressed. When the Porte declared war on Russia in October of that year, Romanians hoped desperately that Russia would be driven from their country (ironically by the country which they had just recently separated from). This wish was granted by the coalition of both Turkey and Austria against Russia.\n\n=== Romanian Independence  ===\n[[File:Russian Army in Bucharest, The Illustrated London News, 1877.jpg|thumb|The Russian Army in [[Bucharest]] in 1877]]\nRomania's independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] was achieved mainly with Russian assistance, although during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877 the Russians requested military assistance from Romania during the [[Siege of Plevna]], after suffering heavy losses.<ref>\"Reminiscences of the King of Roumania\",  ed.

From very early on, however, Romanian economic competition with Russia throttled good relations. Romania is a natural economic rival of Russia (on the eve of World War II, in fact, it was the world's fourth largest food exporter, after Russia, Canada and the US).<ref>Glenny, Misha. ''The Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers''. Page 61</ref> Balkans expert Misha Glenny explains Russia's historical attitude towards Romania as such:<blockquote>\n''...Russia saw wheat cultivation in Romania as a threat to its own harvests in southern Russia, much of it sold on to Britain and France. If the Principalities were able to modernize the port facilities on the [[Danube]] and the [[Black Sea]], they could begin to undercut the price of Russian wheat on world markets. To throttle this competition, Russia exploited its position as protector of the Principalities by allowing the mouth of the Danube to silt up. Russia's interest in the Principalities was essentially strategic. St. Petersburg wanted a pliant satellite, not an economic competitor.

King [[Michael of Romania]] [[King Michael's Coup|led a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] that deposed the Antonescu regime and put Romania on the side of the Soviet Union for the remainder of the war. Despite this late association with the winning side, [[Greater Romania]] was largely dismantled, losing territory to [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n=== Interbellum ===\n\n===Romania-Soviet Union relations (1945/47\u20131990)===\n[[File:Gheorghiu-Dej & Khrushchev at Bucharest's Baneasa Airport (June 1960).jpg|thumb|[[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] (with [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] at his right hand side) and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] at Bucharest's [[Baneasa Airport]] in June 1960]]\nAfter coming under communist control in 1948, Romania was closely aligned with the international policies and goals of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. But after mid-1952, when Gheorghiu-Dej had gained full control of the party and had become head of state, Romania began a slow disengagement from Kremlin domination, being careful not to incur the suspicions or disapproval of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Soviet troops left Romania in 1958, no [[Warsaw Pact]] troops were allowed on Romanian territory after 1962, and Romanian forces essentially quit participating in joint [[Warsaw Pact]] field exercises in the late 1960s. At the same time, Ceausescu announced that Romania would no longer put its military forces under the Warsaw Pact's joint command, even during peacetime maneuvers. By that period, the Soviet Union and Romania established [[SovRom]]s, which were the new tax-exempt Soviet-Romanian economic corporations that helped the reconstruction of Romania until they were dismantled in 1956: albeit, some lasted until 1975 with the main focus to assure Soviet access to resources like Uranium.\n\nIn 1976 Ceausescu received [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Bucharest\u2014the first official visit by a Soviet leader since 1955. The final communique of the meeting reflected continuing disagreements between the two countries, as Romania refused to side with the Soviets in [[Sino-Soviet split|their dispute with China]]. In 1978, after visiting China, Ceausescu attended a [[Warsaw Pact]] summit meeting in Moscow, where he rejected a Soviet proposal that member countries increase their military expenditures. On his return to Bucharest, Ceausescu explained the refusal by stating that any increase in military expenditure was contrary to the [[Communist block|socialist countries']] effort to reduce military tensions in Europe.<ref name=\"Country data- Romania\">[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-11273.html Country data- Romania]</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of Ceausescu's uncooperative attitude, a 1980 Romanian attempt to secure supplies of energy and [[raw materials]] from the Soviet Union and other [[Comecon]] countries failed when those countries demanded world market prices and payment in [[hard currency]]. Nor would the Soviet Union guarantee that it would increase or even maintain existing levels of oil exports to Romania for the following year.\n[[File:Prunariu with Brejnev.jpg|thumb|[[Dumitru Prunariu]] and [[Leonid Popov]] with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1981]]\nThe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused Romania to distance itself further from Brezhnev. When the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops, Romania broke with its Warsaw Pact allies and abstained. And one month later, at a meeting of communist states in Sofia, Romania joined the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) in refusing to endorse the invasion.<ref name=\"Country data- Romania\"/>\n\nDuring [[Yuri Andropov]]'s brief tenure as Soviet leader, relations remained frigid. The wording of the [[communique]] following a meeting with Ceausescu in Moscow suggested that Andropov intended to pressure Romania to bring its foreign policy into line with the Warsaw Pact. The Romanian leadership appeared to suspect Andropov of pro-[[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] sympathies because of his close personal friendship with First Secretary [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] of Hungary. Romanian disagreements with the Soviet position on intermediate nuclear forces in Europe also surfaced during the Andropov period.\n\n===Romanian relations with the Russian Federation===\n[[File:Vladimir Putin with Constantin Mihail Grigorie.jpg|thumb|The Ambassador of Romania, [[Constantin Grigorie|Constantin Mihail Grigorie]], presenting his credentials to the President of Russia, [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2008]]\nRomania's foreign policy after 1990 was built exclusively on geo-strategic reasons and less on economic relations, which has led to minimal relations with Russia. Romania to officially declare, in 1993, its desire to join NATO and EU to consolidate its precarious national security. In an effort to reassure its former ally, Romania and Russia signed a treaty concerning bilateral military cooperation in 1994 and agreed to continue negotiations on the signing of the bilateral treaty on good-neighborly relations. Despite these efforts, bilateral relations quickly deteriorated. In April 1996, the Romanian-Russian relationship experienced one of its tensest moments, as the [[Russian Foreign Minister]] [[Yevgeny Primakov]] flew to Bucharest at the invitation of Romanian authorities to sign a renegotiated version of the bilateral good-neighborly relations treaty. Pressed by the opposition parties, president Iliescu changed his mind and Romania refused to sign the treaty, because it failed to address two of the most enduring bilateral disputes between the two countries: Romania decried the treaty's lack of clauses that condemned the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] (1939) and that would establish a clear roadmap for the return of Romania's National Treasure stored in Moscow. Russia furiously denounced Romanian intentions as hostile and driven by irredentist inclinations towards territories within the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, to which Moscow considered Romania might lay claim. Also, Russia complained that Romania refused to include a provision that would commit the two parties not to join alliances that are targeted against the other. Following this episode, all bilateral diplomatic visits were canceled. It was only in 1999 that Bucharest said it was ready to reconsider its relations with Moscow, both at political and economic level. By the mid-2000s, a third window of opportunity to normalize relations opened as a result of the [[Romanian general election, 2000|2000 Romanian general elections]], which saw the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social-Democrat Party]], considered to be [[Russophilia|closer to Moscow]] than other [[List of political parties in Romania|Romanian political parties]], return to power. Eventually, in 2003, the bilateral treaty on good-neighborly relations was signed, but without addressing any of the contentious issues between the two parties: the condemnation of the Ribbentrop\u2013Molotov Pact, the return of Romania's national treasury, and the provision concerning the parties\u2019 commitment not to participate in that are targeted against the other.\n\nA series of high-level contacts culminated with a visit of [[President of Romania|President]] [[Traian Basescu]] to Moscow in 2005, but his statements at the time, of overcoming historical prejudice of the previous 15 years, did not take shape as the relations continued to freeze.\n\nA main source of tension now is the status of Moldova. The conflict over Moldova, or [[Bessarabia]], is not new. It has been ongoing between Romania and Russia for over a century, due to Russia's strategic interests in the region conflicting with Romania's goal of a [[Movement for the unification of Romania and Moldova|unified pan-Romanian state]]. Bessarabia, now known to most of the world as [[Moldova]], was originally a region within Moldavia; Romania was forced to hand it over to Russia at the 1870s [[Congress of Berlin]]. It was briefly regained, then retaken by the Soviet Union after World War II. Romanians may view Moldova as being \"stolen\" by Russia. Romania regained the territory at the end of World War I, only to lose it again at the end of World War II. At the time of the fall of the Soviet Union, the Romanian language (under the controversial name of the \"Moldovan language\") with a Latin script was mandated as the official language of Moldova, causing conflict with non Romanian-speaking regions (namely, [[Gagauzia]] and Transnistria). However, Moldova opted against rejoining Romania at the time, claiming that it had a separate [[national identity]] (see: [[Moldova\u2013Romania relations]]; [[movement for the unification of Romania and Moldova]]). Romanians may view Moldovans as being victims of forced Russification and brainwashing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nMost recently, on 10 February 2015, Vladimir Evseev, the director of Moscow's Center for Political and Military Studies, has warned that if Romania allows itself to be involved in the confrontation between Russia and NATO, \"it is impossible not to put various military bases in Romania on the list of targets to be neutralized with various kinds of weapons.\" He says that \"Russia is terribly worried that cruise missiles may be launched [from military bases about to be built in Romania] as well\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nineoclock.ro/russia-warns-romania/ | title=Russia warns Romania | work=Nine O' Clock, World Section | date=12 February 2015 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.gandul.info/international/avertismentul-rusiei-pentru-romania-dupa-anuntul-nato-vom-cauta-mijloace-de-a-anihila-flota-militara-romaneasca-13812862 | title=Avertismentul Rusiei pentru Rom\u00e2nia, dup\u0103 anun\u0163ul NATO: \"Vom c\u0103uta mijloace de a anihila flota militar\u0103 rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\" | work=G\u00e2ndul, International section | date=10 February 2015 | accessdate=14 February 2015 | author=Popescu, Andrei Luca | location=Romania | language=Romanian}}</ref> Romania's president Klaus Iohannis responded to this by approving the temporary deployment of up to 250 U.S. soldiers at a military base in the east of the country.

The origin of the word is an adjective meaning \"noble\", \"highborn\".

A few have moved to other places in order to trade or because they have bought land.\n \nThe Ashraf of the Hassan branch live mainly in the interior of the country (some of them of course may have gone to live in Mogadishu), and mostly are not [[Benadiri]]. However, the Asharaf al-Ahdali in [[Merca]], who are [[Benadiri]], are said to be Hassan.\n \nThe Asharaf elders indicated that they are living in Southern Somali and in [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] however they mostly like in urban locations such as [[Bardera]], [[Kismayo]], [[Baidoa]], [[Hudur]], [[Merca]], [[Barawa|Brava]], [[Luuq]], [[Jalalaqsi]], [[Buur Ukur]], [[Beledweyne]], and [[Mogadishu]].

Idris I and his people fled from Syria to Morocco in 786 from the Abbasids after losing to them in the [[Battle of Fakhkh]] near [[Mecca]] in which his family was massacred. In 788, he was greeted by the Amazigh people of [[Volubilis]], a Roman city near [[Meknes]]. He founded the Imperial City of [[Fez]]. It is believed that Idris I was poisoned in 791 by a servant sent by Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]], leaving his wife [[Kenza al-Awrabiya|Kenza]] pregnant. His servant [[Rached]], a freed slave, helped Kenza raise Idris II who was born 2 months later.\n\nIdris II came to the throne at the age of eleven. His tomb is located in [[Moulay Idriss]], a village up on a mountainside near Volubilis. Idriss II's descendants ruled the country until the second half of the 10th century, when they lost their authority to the invasions of the [[Zenata]], an Amazigh tribe under the orders of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], later the [[Caliph of Cordoba]].\n\n=== Algeria ===\nAccording to French historians, [[Abdelkader El Djezairi]] was a descendant of Muhammad .<ref>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 languedocienne de g\u00e9ographie, University of Montpellier.

The dynasty is of the Chofra descent through their sixth Senussi sultan, [[Ali ibn Omar]]. They came to be the kings of Libya.\n\nThe last king of Libya, [[Idris of Libya|Idris]], was overthrown by a military coup in 1969.

There are, however, some families of [[Husseinid]] origin established mainly in [[Ouadane]], in particular the ''Ahl Moulaye Ibrahim''.\n\nThe [[Idrissid]] families descending from [[Hassan ibn Ali]] are: the [[Tichit]]t Sharifs (''Ahl Abd El Mou\u2019min'') and the ''Ahl Cherif Al Ak\u2019hal'' of the Laghlal tribe, who both claim descent from Moulaye Abdallah ibn [[Idriss II]].\n\nThe ''Ahl Moulaye Zein'' and the ''Ahl Mohamed Sidi Cherif'' (the lineage from which Sheikh [[Hamallah]] descends), and which both go back to Moulaye Omar ibn [[Idriss II]].\n\nThe ''Ahl Ahmed Cherif'' of [[Ouadane]] also traces its descent back to Moulaye Mohamed ibn [[Idriss II]].\n\nNote that the cherifs of [[N\u00e9ma]] and [[Oualata]] claim to be descendants of [[Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya]], just like the [[Alaouite dynasty]] (the current royal family of Morocco), and the sheikh [[Ahmad al-Tijani]] of the [[Tijaniya]] [[tariqa]].\n\nIn addition, some of these families continued their migrations to West Africa, particularly to [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], and [[Guinea]], among others.\n\n==Yemen==\nThe Asharaf are from the  descendants of [[Muhammed]].\nSharif (the word of which Asharaf is the superlative). It is an Arabic word meaning 'noble' or 'respected'. It can be attached to one of a person's names or to more than one, and an individual may use it at one time but not at another. It can be used by all Ashraf, but is not necessarily and many nowadays prefer to omit it. It is not generally a personal name, and hence will not necessarily appear on documents such as identity card or passport. It is sometimes used as a personal name, not only among the Asharaf. The most popular person with Sharif title in hadhramout, Yemen is Alsharif Mudhir bin Abdulrahman Ba Alawi who lived in Tarim and died in 2010.\n\n==Far East==\n\nThe [[Bolkiah]] [[Dynasty]] of Sultans of [[Brunei]] claim their Sharifian ancestry to [[Sharif Ali]] bin Ajlaan bin Rumaytha bin Muhammad AbuNumayy I who was the son of the Emir of Makkah and had migrated and settled in Borneo by marrying the daughter of the 3rd Sultan Ahmed.\n\nMany Royal Families currently and previous of Malaysia, Indonesia, Java, Sumatra, Philippines and Singapore had Sharifian lineage for examples: the Hashemite Dynasty of Sultans of [[Sulu]] whose ancestor was [[Sharif ul-H\u0101shim of Sulu]] and another ex-royal family is the [[Alsagoff Family]] of Singapore.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Arabic words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Hashemite people]]\n[[Category:Islamic honorifics]]\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Titles in Pakistan]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Sheriff}}\n{{about|the use of ''sharif'' as a title|other uses||the descendants of Muhammad's daughter Fatimah|Ashraf}}\n{{redirect|Sharifian|the army of the Sharif of Mecca|Sharifian Army}}\n{{Usul al-fiqh}}\n'''''Sharif''''' (also transliterated '''Shareef''', '''Sherif''', shreef '''Shareef''', '''Alsharif''', '''Alshareef''' ({{lang-ar|\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u0161ar\u012bf}}''), or '''Ch\u00e9rif''' ([[Darija]]: Chorfa)) is a traditional [[Arabic]] [[title]].
