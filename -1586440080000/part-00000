''BBC''. 30 April 2008</ref> A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a '''freezer'''. The refrigerator replaced the [[icebox]], which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half.\n\nThe first cooling systems for food involved ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of [[Freon]] in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.\n\nFreezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. The freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style had been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern refrigerators broke the trend. A vapor compression cycle is used in most [https://womenperfectsolution.com/best-refrigerator-in-india-2020/ household refrigerators], refrigerator\u2013freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include [[Auto-defrost|automatic defrosting]], chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door.\n\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest are Peltier-type refrigerators designed to chill beverages. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1&nbsp;m wide with a capacity of 600&nbsp;L. Refrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen. The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before. Freezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and [[economies of scale|bulk purchases save money]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Technology development===\n{{See also|Refrigeration|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}\n\nBefore the invention of the refrigerator, [[Icehouse (building)|icehouses]] were used to provide cool storage for most of the year. Placed near freshwater lakes or packed with snow and ice during the winter, they were once very common. Natural means are still used to cool foods today. On mountainsides, runoff from melting snow is a convenient way to cool drinks, and during the winter one can keep milk fresh much longer just by keeping it outdoors. The word \"refrigeratory\" was used at least as early as the 17th century<ref>Venetum Britannicum, 1676, London, p. 176 in the 1678 edition.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n   | width     = 140\n   | direction = vertical\n   | image_style = border:0\n   | image1    = Gorrie Ice Machine.png\n   | alt1      = Mechanical drawing\n   | caption1  = Schematic of Dr. John Gorrie's 1841 mechanical ice machine\n   | image2    = AppareilCarr\u00e9.jpg\n   | alt2      = Mechanical drawing\n   | caption2  = [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]]'s ice-making device\n  }}\nThe history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor [[William Cullen]] designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755. Cullen used a pump to create a partial [[vacuum]] over a container of [[diethyl ether]], which then [[boiling point|boiled]], absorbing [[heat of vaporization|heat]] from the surrounding air.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arora|first=Ramesh Chandra|title=Refrigeration and Air Conditioning|publisher=PHI Learning|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81-203-3915-0|page=3|chapter=Mechanical vapour compression refrigeration}}</ref> The experiment even created a small amount of ice, but had no practical application at that time.\n\nIn 1805, American inventor [[Oliver Evans]] described a closed [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle for the production of ice by ether under vacuum. In 1820, the British scientist [[Michael Faraday]] liquefied [[ammonia]] and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate in Great Britain, [[Jacob Perkins]], built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system. It was a closed-cycle device that could operate continuously.<ref name=burstall>{{cite book |last = Burstall |first = Aubrey F. |year = 1965 |title = A History of Mechanical Engineering |publisher = The MIT Press |isbn = 0-262-52001-X}}</ref> A similar attempt was made in 1842, by American physician, [[John Gorrie]],<ref>{{US patent|8080}}</ref> who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure. American engineer [[Alexander Twining]] took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapor compression system that used ether.\n\nThe first practical vapor compression refrigeration system was built by [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]], a Scottish Australian. His 1856 patent was for a vapor compression system using ether, alcohol or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapor-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation.\n\nThe first [[absorption refrigeration|gas absorption]] refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as \"aqua ammonia\") was developed by [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]] of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. [[Carl von Linde]], an engineering professor at the Technological University Munich in Germany, patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876. His new process made possible the use of gases such as [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[methyl chloride]] (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl) as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s.\n\n{{Clear}}\n=== Commercial refrigerators ===\nCommercial refrigerator and freezer units, which go by many other names, were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. They used gas systems such as [[ammonia]] (R-717) or [[sulfur dioxide]] (R-764), which occasionally leaked, making them unsafe for home use. Practical household refrigerators were introduced in 1915 and gained wider acceptance in the United States in the 1930s as prices fell and non-toxic, non-flammable synthetic [[refrigerant]]s such as [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|Freon-12]] (R-12) were introduced.  However, R-12 damaged the [[ozone layer]], causing governments to issue a ban on its use in new refrigerators and air-conditioning systems in 1994. The less harmful replacement for R-12, R-134a (tetrafluoroethane), has been in common use since 1990, but R-12 is still found in many old systems today.\n\nA common commercial refrigerator is the glass fronted beverage cooler. These type of appliances are typically designed for specific re-load conditions meaning that they generally have a larger cooling system. This ensures that they are able to cope with a large throughput of drinks and frequent door opening.  As a result, it is common for these types of commercial refrigerators to have energy consumption of >4 kWh/day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chest Freezer Reviews|url=http://groomandstyle.com/best-chest-freezer-review-top-5/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912012151/http://groomandstyle.com/best-chest-freezer-review-top-5/|archivedate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic refrigerators===\nIn 1913, refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by [[Fred W.

Wales]] of Detroit, Michigan, introduced an idea for a practical electric refrigeration unit, which later became the basis for the [[Kelvinator]]. A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet was invented by [[Alfred Mellowes]] in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by [[William C. Durant]] in 1918, who started the [[Frigidaire]] company to [[Mass production|mass-produce]] refrigerators. In 1918, Kelvinator company introduced the first refrigerator with any type of automatic control. The [[absorption refrigerator]] was invented by [[Baltzar von Platen (inventor)|Baltzar von Platen]] and [[Carl Munters]] from [[Sweden]] in 1922, while they were still students at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm. It became a worldwide success and was commercialized by [[Electrolux]]. Other pioneers included [[Charles Tellier]], [[David Boyle (inventor)|David Boyle]], and [[Raoul Pictet]]. [[Carl von Linde]] was the first to patent and make a practical and compact refrigerator.\n\nThese home units usually required the installation of the mechanical parts, motor and compressor, in the basement or an adjacent room while the cold box was located in the kitchen. There was a 1922 model that consisted of a wooden cold box, [[Watercooling|water-cooled]] compressor, an [[ice cube]] tray and a {{convert|9|cuft|adj=on}} compartment, and cost $714. (A 1922 [[Model-T]] Ford cost about $450.) By 1923, Kelvinator held 80 percent of the market for electric refrigerators. Also in 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. About this same time porcelain-covered metal cabinets began to appear. Ice cube trays were introduced more and more during the 1920s; up to this time freezing was not an auxiliary function of the modern refrigerator.\n\n[[File:Monitor refer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|General Electric \"Monitor-Top\" refrigerator, introduced in 1927, priced at $525, with the first all-steel cabinet, designed by Christian Steenstrup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.industrialdesignhistory.com/book/export/html/148|title=G.E. Monitor Top Refrigerator|website=www.industrialdesignhistory.com|accessdate=2020-01-25}}</ref>]]\n\nThe first refrigerator to see widespread use was the General Electric \"Monitor-Top\" refrigerator introduced in 1927, so-called, by the public, because of its resemblance to the gun turret on the ironclad warship [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] of the 1860s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://refresearch.com/the-general-electric-monitor-top-refrigerator/|title=The General Electric Monitor Top Refrigerator|first=Neil|last=Lobocki|date=2017-10-04|accessdate=2020-01-25}}</ref> The compressor assembly, which emitted a great deal of heat, was placed above the cabinet, and enclosed by a decorative ring. Over a million units were produced. As the refrigerating medium, these refrigerators used either [[sulfur dioxide]], which is corrosive to the eyes and may cause loss of vision, painful skin burns and lesions, or [[methyl formate]], which is highly flammable, harmful to the eyes, and toxic if inhaled or ingested. Many of these units are still functional today, after requiring little more service than a replacement start relay or thermostat if at all. These cooling systems cannot legally be recharged with the hazardous original refrigerants if they leak or break down.\n\nThe introduction of [[Freon]] in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s and provided a safer, low-toxicity alternative to previously used refrigerants.  Separate freezers became common during the 1940s; the popular term at the time for the unit was a ''deep freeze''. These devices, or ''appliances'', did not go into mass production for use in the home until after World War II.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.history.com/exhibits/modern/fridge.html| url-status = dead | title = The History of Household Wonders: History of the Refrigerator | year = 2006 | work = [[History (U.S. TV network)|History.com]] | publisher = A&E Television Networks | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080326092256/http://www.history.com/exhibits/modern/fridge.html | archive-date = 26 March 2008}}</ref> The 1950s and 1960s saw technical advances like automatic [[defrost]]ing and automatic ice making. More efficient refrigerators were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, even though [[Ozone depletion|environmental issues]] led to the banning of very effective (Freon) refrigerants. Early refrigerator models (from 1916) had a cold compartment for ice cube trays. From the late 1920s fresh vegetables were successfully processed through freezing by the [[Post Foods|Postum Company]] (the forerunner of [[General Foods]]), which had acquired the technology when it bought the rights to [[Clarence Birdseye]]'s successful fresh freezing methods.\n\n== Styles of refrigerators ==\nIn the early 1950s most refrigerators were white, but from the mid-1950s through present day designers and manufacturers put color onto refrigerators. In the late-1950s/early-1960s, pastel colors like turquoise and pink became popular, and brushed chrome-plating (similar to stainless finish) was available on some models. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, [[earth tone]] colors were popular, including [[Gold (color)|Harvest Gold]], [[Green|Avocado Green]] and almond. In the 1980s, black became fashionable. In the late 1990s [[stainless steel]] came into vogue, and in 2009, one manufacturer introduced multi-color designs. Since 1961 the [[Color Marketing Group]] has attempted to coordinate the colors of appliances and other consumer goods.\n\nRefigerators can also be classified according to the number and arrangement of their doors:\n*One Door: the freezer and refrigerator compartment are behind the same door and in the same common compartment. The freezer is on the top part of the common compartment and may have an uninsulated and transparent plastic door covering it. The freezer compartment is formed by a sheet of metal or plastic that has been bent to form a floor and side walls, which is then fastened to the ceiling of the common compartment. The sheet has internal cavities and passageways, making it the evaporator of the refigerator.\nThere are also one door refrigerators that don't have a freezer compartment; these are available for both commercial and residential settings, and some can be switched between freezer and refrigerator mode.  \n*Conventional: the freezer compartment is above the refrigerator compartment, and are separated by a layer of insulation and have separate doors that can be opened independently from each other. A variation inverts this order, placing the freezer compartment below the refigerator compartment. In this variation, the freezer compartment may not have door shelves and may have several internal compartments. The freezer is always smaller than the refrigerator compartment. \n* Side by Side: once mainstream, this arrangement places the freezer and refigerator compartments side by side. Again, the freezer and refigerator are separated by insulation. The freezer is narrower than the refigerator and they may even use different lighting systems; freezer compartments tend to use incandescent lighting while refrigerator compartments may use fluorescent lighting instead, although both have been replaced with LED lighting in modern refrigerators. \n*French door: these have largely replaced side by side refrigerators in domestic settings. The refrigerator is above the freezer. The refigerator has a french door while the freezer tends to be a drawer. Some models have 2 drawers, and some use french doors for both the freezer and refigerator. If it has 2 drawers, the upper drawer is often refigerated (it is not a freezer) and its temperature may be precisely controlled. \n*Multi door or six door: mainly made by Japanese companies like Hitachi, Panasonic and Mitsubishi Electric. <ref>https://www.hitachi-hk.com.hk/en/products/multi-door.html</ref><ref>https://www.panasonic.com/my/consumer/home-appliances/refrigerator/multi-door.html</ref><ref>https://www.mitsubishielectric.com.sg/products/refrigerators/folio-series</ref> These use a french door for the refrigerator compartment, which is at the top, and below are 4 drawers, organized in 3 levels. (From top to bottom) In the first level, on the left is an (often automatic) ice maker whose compartment is frozen and on the right is a small freezer, originally intended for fish. On the second level is a freezer, and on the third level is a refrigerated vegetable compartment. The drawers may have 2 internal drawers or baskets that sit on top of each other and can be moved towards the back of the freezer while the drawer is open. This also applies to french door refrigerators.\n\n[[Kimchi refrigerator]]s are usually made by South Korean companies (LG, Dimchae and Samsung) and are designed with long-term (several months) kimchi storage in mind, and may be designed to also simultaneously store items other than kimchi.\n\n==Freezer==\n{{redirect|Freezer}}<!-- Freezer redirects to this subsection -->\n'''Freezer''' units are used in households and in industry and commerce.

Domestic freezers can be included as a separate compartment in a refrigerator, or can be a separate appliance. Domestic freezers may be either upright units resembling a refrigerator, or chests (with the lid or door on top, sacrificing convenience for efficiency and partial immunity to power outages).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46453245 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |location=Australia, Australia |date=19 September 1973 |access-date=13 January 2020 |page=26 |via=Trove }}</ref> Many modern upright freezers come with an ice dispenser built into their door.

In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as [[R134a]] enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below the temperature of the refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the ''condenser''; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as ''auto-refrigeration''. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment (\"box air\") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.\n\nModern domestic refrigerators are extremely reliable because motor and compressor are integrated within a welded container, \"sealed unit\", with greatly reduced likelihood of leakage or contamination.  By comparison, externally-coupled refrigeration compressors, such as those in automobile air conditioning, inevitably leak fluid and lubricant past the shaft seals.  This leads to a requirement for periodic recharging and, if ignored, possible compressor failure.\n\n===Absorption refrigerators===\nAn [[absorption refrigerator]] works differently from a compressor refrigerator, using a source of [[heat]], such as [[combustion]] of [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[solar thermal energy]] or an electric heating element. These heat sources are much quieter than the compressor motor in a typical refrigerator. A fan or pump might be the only mechanical moving parts; reliance on convection is considered impractical.\n\nOther uses of an absorption refrigerator (or \"chiller\") include large systems used in office buildings or complexes such as hospitals and universities. These large systems are used to chill a brine solution that is circulated through the building.\n\n===Peltier effect refrigerators===\nThe [[Peltier effect]] uses electricity to pump heat directly; refrigerators employing this system are sometimes used for camping, or in situations where noise is not acceptable. They can be totally silent (if a fan for air circulation is not fitted) but are less energy-efficient than other methods.\n\n===Dual compressor refrigerators===\nA few manufacturers offer dual compressor models.  These models have separate freezer and refrigerator compartments that operate independently of each other, sometimes mounted within a single cabinet.  Each has its own separate compressor, condenser and evaporator coils, insulation, thermostat, and door.  Typically, the compressors and condenser coils are mounted at the top of the cabinet, with a single fan to cool them both.\n\n===Ultra-low temperature refrigerators===\n\"Ultra-cold\" or \"[[ULT freezer|ultra-low temperature (ULT)]]\" (typically \u221280{{nbsp}}C) freezers, as used for storing biological samples, also generally employ two stages of cooling, but in cascade. The lower temperature stage uses [[methane]], or a similar gas, as a refrigerant, with its condenser kept at around \u221240{{nbsp}}C by a second stage which uses a more conventional refrigerant. Well known brands include Forma and Revco (both now Thermo Scientific) and Thermoline. For much lower temperatures (around \u2212196{{nbsp}}C), laboratories usually purchase [[liquid nitrogen]], kept in a [[Dewar flask]], into which the samples are suspended.\n\n===Other refrigerators===\nAlternatives to the vapor-compression cycle not in current mass production include:\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[Thermoacoustic heat engine|Acoustic cooling]]\n* [[Air cycle]]\n* [[Magnetic cooling]]\n* [[Malone engine]]\n* [[Pulse tube refrigerator|Pulse tube]]\n* [[Stirling engine|Stirling cycle]]\n* [[Thermoelectric cooling]] \n* [[Thermionic emission|Thermionic cooling]]\n* [[Vortex tube]]\n* [[Water cycle system]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.iifiir.org/en/doc/1051.pdf |title=Developments in domestic refrigeration and consumer attitudes |author=James, Stephen J. |journal=Bulletin of the IIR |year=2003 |volume=5 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319205159/http://www.iifiir.org/en/doc/1051.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2009 }}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Architecture==\nMany modern refrigerator/freezers have the freezer on top and the refrigerator on the bottom. Most refrigerator-freezers\u2014except for manual defrost models or cheaper units\u2014use what appears to be two thermostats. Only the refrigerator compartment is properly temperature controlled. When the refrigerator gets too warm, the thermostat starts the cooling process and a fan circulates the air around the freezer. During this time, the refrigerator also gets colder. The freezer control knob only controls the amount of air that flows into the refrigerator via a damper system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060705170456/http://www.geappliances.com/search/fast/infobase/10000661.htm Refrigerator \u2013 Adjusting Temperature Controls]. geappliances.com</ref> Changing the refrigerator temperature will inadvertently change the freezer temperature in the opposite direction. Changing the freezer temperature will have no effect on the refrigerator temperature. The freezer control may also be adjusted to compensate for any refrigerator adjustment.\n\nThis means the refrigerator may become too warm. However, because only enough air is diverted to the refrigerator compartment, the freezer usually re-acquires the set temperature quickly, unless the door is opened. When a door is opened, either in the refrigerator or the freezer, the fan in some units stops immediately to prevent excessive frost build up on the freezer's evaporator coil, because this coil is cooling two areas. When the freezer reaches temperature, the unit cycles off, no matter what the refrigerator temperature is. Modern computerized refrigerators do not use the damper system. The computer manages fan speed for both compartments, although air is still blown from the freezer.\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Fridgeinterior.jpg|thumb|200px|The inside of a home refrigerator containing a large variety of everyday food items.]]\n\nNewer refrigerators may include:\n*[[Auto-defrost|Automatic defrosting]]\n*A power failure warning that alerts the user by flashing a temperature display. It may display the maximum temperature reached during the power failure, and whether frozen food has defrosted or may contain harmful bacteria.\n*Chilled water and ice from a dispenser in the door. Water and ice dispensing became available in the 1970s. In some refrigerators, the process of making ice is built-in so the user doesn't have to manually use ice trays. Some refrigerators have water chillers and water filtration systems.\n*Cabinet rollers that lets the refrigerator roll out for easier cleaning\n*Adjustable shelves and trays\n*A status indicator that notifies when it is time to change the [[Filter (water)|water filter]]\n*An in-door ice caddy, which relocates the ice-maker storage to the freezer door and saves approximately 60 litres (2&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft) of usable freezer space. It is also removable, and helps to prevent ice-maker clogging.\n*A cooling zone in the refrigerator door shelves. Air from the freezer section is diverted to the refrigerator door, to cool milk or juice stored in the door shelf.\n*A drop down door built into the refrigerator main door, giving easy access to frequently used items such as milk, thus saving energy by not having to open the main door.\n*A Fast Freeze function to rapidly cool foods by running the compressor for a predetermined amount of time and thus temporarily lowering the freezer temperature below normal operating levels. It is recommended to use this feature several hours before adding more than 1&nbsp;kg of unfrozen food to the freezer. For freezers without this feature, lowering the temperature setting to the coldest will have the same effect.\n\n* Freezer Defrost: Early freezer units accumulated [[ice crystals]] around the freezing units. This was a result of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing (\"defrosting\") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the freezer compartment (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the freezer's walls for a short amount of time to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate freezer compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.\nThese older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around {{convert|-6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, which is suitable for keeping food for a week.\n\n* Butter heater: In the early 1950s, the butter conditioner's patent was filed and published by the inventor Nave Alfred E. This feature was supposed to \"provide a new and improved food storage receptacle for storing butter or the like which may quickly and easily be removed from the refrigerator cabinet for the purpose of cleaning.\"<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US2579848 Butter Conditioner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026070427/https://www.google.com/patents/US2579848 |date=26 October 2016 }}. Google Patents.</ref><ref>{{US patent|2579848}}</ref> Because of the high interest to the invention, companies in UK, New Zealand, and Australia started to include the feature into the mass fridge production and soon it became a symbol of the local culture. However, not long after that it was removed from production as according to the companies this was the only way for them to meet new ecology regulations and they found it inefficient to have a heat generating device inside a fridge.\n\nLater advances included automatic ice units and self compartmentalized freezing units.\n\n== Types of domestic refrigerators ==\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest is a 4&nbsp;L Peltier refrigerator advertised as being able to hold 6 cans of beer. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1&nbsp;m wide with a capacity of 600&nbsp;L. Some models for small [[household]]s fit under kitchen work surfaces, usually about 86&nbsp;cm high. Refrigerators may be combined with freezers, either stacked with refrigerator or freezer above, below, or side by side. A refrigerator without a frozen food storage compartment may have a small section just to make ice cubes. Freezers may have drawers to store food in, or they may have no divisions (chest freezers).\n\nRefrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen.\n\nThree distinct classes of refrigerator are common:\n===Compressor refrigerators===\n*Compressor refrigerators are by far the most common type; they make a noticeable noise, but are most efficient and give greatest cooling effect. Portable compressor refrigerators for [[recreational vehicle]] (RV) and camping use are expensive but effective and reliable. Refrigeration units for commercial and industrial applications can be made in various sizes, shapes and styles to fit customer needs. Commercial and industrial refrigerators may have their compressors located away from the cabinet (similar to [[Air conditioning#Split systems|split system air conditioners]]) to reduce noise nuisance and reduce the load on air conditioning in hot weather.\n===Absorption refrigerator===\n*[[Absorption refrigerator]]s may be used in caravans and trailers, and dwellings lacking electricity, such as farms or rural cabins, where they have a long history. They may be powered by any heat source: gas (natural or propane) or kerosene being common. Models made for camping and RV use often have the option of running (inefficiently) on 12 volt battery power.\n\n===Solar refrigerator===\n**[[Solar refrigerator]]s and [[Thermal mass refrigerator]]s are designed to reduce electrical consumption. Solar refrigerators have the added advantage that they do not use refrigerants that are harmful to the environment or flammable. Typical solar designs are [[absorption refrigerator]]s that use ammonia as the working gas, and employ large mirrors to concentrate sufficient sunlight to reach the temperature required to free gaseous ammonia from the solvent.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210202228/http://blog.thegreenv.com/?p=191 The Green V.

News.cnet.com.</ref> Most thermal mass refrigerators are designed to use electricity intermittently. As these units are heavily insulated, cooling load is limited primarily to heat introduced by new items to be refrigerated, and ambient air transfer when the unit is open. Very little power is therefore required if opened infrequently.\n\n===Peltier refrigerators===\n*[[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier refrigerators]] are powered by electricity, usually 12 volt DC, but mains-powered wine coolers are available. Peltier refrigerators are inexpensive but inefficient and become progressively more inefficient with increased cooling effect; much of this inefficiency may be related to the temperature differential across the short distance between the \"hot\" and \"cold\" sides of the [[Peltier cell]]. Peltier refrigerators generally use heat sinks and fans to lower this differential; the only noise produced comes from the fan. Reversing the polarity of the voltage applied to the Peltier cells results in a heating rather than cooling effect.\n\nOther specialized cooling mechanisms may be used for cooling, but have not been applied to domestic or commercial refrigerators.\n\n===Magnetic refrigerator===\n*[[Magnetic refrigeration|Magnetic refrigerator]]s are refrigerators that work on the magnetocaloric effect. The cooling effect is triggered by placing a metal alloy in a magnetic field.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news64851465.html \"Towards the magnetic fridge\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207135221/http://www.physorg.com/news64851465.html |date=7 December 2008 }}. ''Physorg''. 21 April 2006</ref>\n*[[Acoustic refrigerator]]s are refrigerators that use resonant linear reciprocating motors/alternators to generate a sound that is converted to heat and cold using compressed helium gas. The heat is discarded and the cold is routed to the refrigerator.\n\n== Energy efficiency ==\n[[File:Energy label 2010.svg|thumb|A European energy label for a fridge.]]\n\nIn a house without air-conditioning (space heating and/or cooling) refrigerators consumed more energy than any other home device.<ref>{{cite web|title=Which UK \u2013 Saving Energy|url=http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/energy-labels-explained/fridge-and-freezer-energy-labels|work=Which UK|accessdate=10 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110161250/http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/energy-labels-explained/fridge-and-freezer-energy-labels|archivedate=10 November 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s a competition was held among the major manufacturers to encourage energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Feist, J.

Tier 1 refrigerators are those that are 20% to 24.9% more efficient than the Federal minimum standards set by the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] (NAECA). Tier 2 are those that are 25% to 29.9% more efficient.

Although these designs generally use a much larger amount of energy compared to compressor refrigeration, other qualities such as silent operation or the ability to use gas can favor these refrigeration units in small enclosures, a mobile environment or in environments where unit failure would lead to devastating consequences.\n\nMany refrigerators made in the 1930s and 1940s were far more efficient than most that were made later. This is partly attributable to the addition of new features, such as auto-defrost, that reduced efficiency. Additionally, after World War 2, refrigerator style became more important than efficiency. This was especially true in the US in the 1970s, when side-by-side models (known as American fridgefreezers outside of the US) with ice dispensers and water chillers became popular. However, the reduction in efficiency also arose partly from reduction in the amount of insulation to cut costs.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:ExpensiveRefrigerators.JPG|thumb|260px|Display of modern American-style / side-by-side refrigerators, available for purchase in a store]]\nBecause of the introduction of new energy efficiency standards, refrigerators made today are much more efficient than those made in the 1930s; they consume the same amount of energy while being three times as large.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Successes of Energy Efficiency: The United States and California National Trust | url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-999-2007-023/CEC-999-2007-023.PDF | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225075006/http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-999-2007-023/CEC-999-2007-023.PDF | archivedate=25 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news  |title=Out With the Old, In With the New  |url=http://www.nrdc.org/air/energy/appliance/app1.pdf  |author1=Calwell, Chris  |author2=Reeder, Travis  |lastauthoramp=yes  |year=2001  |work=Natural Resources Defense Council  |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608090449/http://www.nrdc.org/air/energy/appliance/app1.pdf  |archivedate=8 June 2011    }}</ref>\n\nThe efficiency of older refrigerators can be improved by defrosting (if the unit is manual defrost) and cleaning them regularly, replacing old and worn door seals with new ones, adjusting the thermostat to accommodate the actual contents (a refrigerator needn't be colder than {{convert|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to store drinks and non-perishable items) and also replacing insulation, where applicable. Some sites recommend cleaning condenser coils every month or so on units with coils on the rear, to add life to the coils and not suffer an unnoticeable deterioration in efficiency over an extended period, the unit should be able to ventilate or \"breathe\" with adequate spaces around the front, back, sides and above the unit. If the refrigerator uses a fan to keep the condenser cool, then this must be cleaned or seviced, at per individual manufactures recommendations.\n\nFrost-free refrigerators or freezers use electric fans to cool the appropriate compartment.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bvxCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21|title=Low Temperature and Cryogenic Refrigeration|last=Kaka\u00e7|first=Sadik|last2=Avelino|first2=M.

The air is drawn in through an inlet duct and passed through the evaporator where it is cooled, the air is then circulated throughout the cabinet via a series of ducts and vents. Because the air passing the evaporator is supposedly warm and moist, frost begins to form on the evaporator (especially on a freezer's evaporator). In cheaper and/or older models, a defrost cycle is controlled via a mechanical timer. This timer is set to shut off the compressor and fan and energize a heating element located near or around the evaporator for about 15 to 30 minutes at every 6 to 12 hours. This melts any frost or ice build up and allows the refrigerator to work normally once more. It is believed that frost free units have a lower tolerance for frost, due to their air-conditioner like evaporator coils. Therefore, if a door is left open accidentally (especially the freezer), the defrost system may not remove all frost, in this case, the freezer (or refrigerator) must be defrosted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIf the defrosting system melts all the ice before the timed defrosting period ends, then a small device (called a defrost limiter) acts like a thermostat and shuts off the heating element to prevent too large a temperature fluctuation, it also prevents hot blasts of air when the system starts again, should it finish defrosting early. On some early frost-free models, the defrost limiter also sends a signal to the defrost timer to start the compressor and fan as soon as it shuts off the heating element before the timed defrost cycle ends. When the defrost cycle is completed, the compressor and fan are allowed to cycle back on.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFrost-free refrigerators, including some early frost free refrigerator/freezers that used a cold plate in their refrigerator section instead of airflow from the freezer section, generally don't shut off their refrigerator fans during defrosting. This allows consumers to leave food in the main refrigerator compartment uncovered, and also helps keep vegetables moist. This method also helps reduce energy consumption, because the refrigerator is above freeze point and can pass the warmer-than-freezing air through the evaporator or cold plate to aid the defrosting cycle.\n\nWith the advent of digital [[inverter compressor]]s, the energy consumption is even further reduced than a single-speed induction motor compressor, and thus contributes far less in the way of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/how-the-digital-inverter-compressor-has-transformed-the-modern-refrigerator|title=How the Digital Inverter Compressor Has Transformed the Modern Refrigerator|website=news.samsung.com|accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Regular Refrigerators vs Inverter Refrigerators ===\n\nThe energy consumption of a refrigerator is also dependent on the type of refrigeration being done. For instance, Inverter Refrigerators consume comparatively lesser energy than a typical non-inverter refrigerator. \n\nIn an inverter refrigerator, the compressor is used conditionally on requirement basis. For instance, an inverter refrigerator might use less energy during the winters than it does during the summers. This is because the compressor works for very less duration than it does during the summers.\n\n== Effect on lifestyle ==\nThe refrigerator allows the modern family to keep food fresh for longer than before. The most notable improvement is for meat and other highly perishable wares, which needed to be refined to gain anything resembling shelf life. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} (On the other hand, refrigerators and freezers can also be stocked with processed, quick-cook foods that are less healthy.) Refrigeration in transit makes it possible to enjoy food from distant places.\n\nDairy products, meats, fish, poultry and vegetables can be kept refrigerated in the same space within the kitchen (although raw meat should be kept separate from other food for reasons of [[hygiene]]).\n\nFreezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and [[economies of scale|bulk purchases save money]]. Ice cream, a popular commodity of the 20th century, could previously only be obtained by traveling to where the product was made and eating it on the spot. Now it is a common food item. Ice on demand not only adds to the enjoyment of cold drinks, but is useful for first-aid, and for cold packs that can be kept frozen for picnics or in case of emergency.\n\n== Temperature zones and ratings ==\n===Residential units===\n\nThe capacity of a refrigerator is measured in either liters or cubic feet. Typically the volume of a combined refrigerator-freezer is split with 1/3rds to 1/4th of the volume allocated to the freezer although these values are highly variable.\n\nTemperature settings for refrigerator and freezer compartments are often given arbitrary numbers by manufacturers (for example, 1 through 9, warmest to coldest), but generally {{convert|3 |to|5|C|F}}<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> is ideal for the refrigerator compartment and {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} for the freezer. Some refrigerators must be within certain external temperature parameters to run properly. This can be an issue when placing units in an unfinished area, such as a garage. \n\nSome refrigerators are now divided into four zones to store different types of food:\n*{{Convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (freezer)\n*{{Convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (meat zone)\n*{{Convert|5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (cooling zone)\n*{{Convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} ([[crisper drawer|crisper]])\n\n[[Europe]]an freezers, and refrigerators with a freezer compartment, have a four [[Star (classification)| star rating system]] to grade freezers. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n* [\u2217]     : min temperature = {{convert|-6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is 1 week\n* [\u2217\u2217]    : min temperature = {{convert|-12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is 1 month\n* [\u2217\u2217\u2217]   : min temperature = {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is between 3 and 12 months \n::::depending on type (meat, vegetables, fish, etc.)\n* [\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217] : min temperature = {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for pre-frozen or frozen-from-fresh food is between 3 and 12 months\n\nAlthough both the three and four star ratings specify the same storage times and same minimum temperature of {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, only a four star freezer is intended for freezing fresh food, and may include a \"fast freeze\" function (runs the compressor continually, down to as low as {{convert|-26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}) to facilitate this. Three (or fewer) stars are used for frozen food compartments that are only suitable for storing frozen food; introducing fresh food into such a compartment is likely to result in unacceptable temperature rises. This difference in categorization is shown in the design of the 4-star logo, where the \"standard\" three stars are displayed in a box using \"positive\" colours, denoting the same normal operation as a 3-star freezer, and the fourth star showing the additional fresh food/fast freeze function is prefixed to the box in \"negative\" colours or with other distinct formatting. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nMost European refrigerators include a moist cold refrigerator section (which does require (automatic) defrosting at irregular intervals) and a (rarely frost free) freezer section.\n\n=== Commercial refrigeration temperatures ===\n(from warmest to coolest)<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=https://northeastcooling.com/category/commercial-refrigeration-maintenance-tips/\n |date=\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422134813/http://northeastcooling.com/category/commercial-refrigeration-maintenance-tips/page/5/\n |url-status = dead\n |archive-date=22 April 2017\n |access-date=25 January 2020\n |title=Commercial Refrigeration Maintenance Tips Archives - Page 5 of 5\n |website=Northeast Cooling\n }}\n</ref><!--\u25e6-->\n; Refrigerators : {{convert|35|to|38|F|C|0}}, and not greater than maximum refrigerator temperature at {{convert|41|F|C|0}}\n; Freezer, Reach-in : {{convert|-10|to|+5|F|C|0}}\n; Freezer, Walk-in : {{convert|-10|to|0|F|C|0}}\n; Freezer, Ice Cream : {{convert|-20|to|-10|F|C|0}}\n\n== Disposal ==\n[[File:Servel Electrolux Gas Refrigerator ad, 1941.jpg|thumb|1941 Ad for [[Servel]] [[Electrolux]] Gas Refrigerator ([[Absorption refrigerator|Absorption]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://refresearch.com/the-first-absorption-refrigerator/|title=The First Absorption Refrigerator|first=Neil|last=Lobocki|date=4 October 2017|accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref> designed by [[Norman Bel Geddes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WiXuznGGhz8C&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=Norman+Bel+Geddes+%2295817%22&hl=en|title=\"95,817 DESIGN FOR A REFRIGERATOR CABINET Norman Bel Geddes, New York, and William I.

Modern refrigerators usually use a refrigerant called HFC-134a ([[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane]]), which does not deplete the ozone layer, instead of Freon. A R-134a is now becoming very uncommon in Europe. Newer refrigerants are being used instead. The main refrigerant now used is R-600a, or [[isobutane]] which has a smaller effect on the atmosphere if released. There have been reports of refrigerators exploding if the refrigerant leaks isobutane in the presence of a spark.  If the coolant leaks into the fridge, at times when the door is not being opened (such as overnight) the concentration of coolant in the air within the fridge can build up to form an explosive mixture that can be ignited either by a spark from the thermostat or when the light comes on as the door is opened, resulting in documented cases of serious property damage and injury or even death from the resulting explosion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432767/Homeowner-left-cuts-bruises-fridge-freezer-exploded-kitchen-says-survived-kneeling-down.html |title=Homeowner left with serious cuts and bruises after fridge-freezer exploded in his kitchen says he only survived because he was kneeling down |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206084025/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432767/Homeowner-left-cuts-bruises-fridge-freezer-exploded-kitchen-says-survived-kneeling-down.html |archivedate=6 February 2016  }} [[Daily Mail]] February 2016</ref><ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tragic-bride-killed-after-fridge-6817075 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805221722/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tragic-bride-killed-after-fridge-6817075 |archivedate=5 August 2017  }} [[Daily Mirror]] November 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210334/Alert-new-wave-exploding-fridges-caused-environmentally-friendly-coolant.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225213551/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210334/Alert-new-wave-exploding-fridges-caused-environmentally-friendly-coolant.html |archivedate=25 February 2017  }} [[Daily Mail]] September 2009</ref>\n\nDisposal of discarded refrigerators is regulated, often mandating the removal of doors for safety reasons.

One example is the Phoenix refrigerator program launched in Australia. This government incentive picked up old refrigerators, paying their owners for \"donating\" the refrigerator. The refrigerator was then refurbished, with new door seals, a thorough cleaning and the removal of items, such as the cover that is strapped to the back of many older units. The resulting refrigerators, now over 10% more efficient, were then distributed to low income families.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>\nFile:Commercial Refrigerator Advertisement 1905.jpg|thumb|left|McCray pre-electric home refrigerator ad from 1905; this company, founded in 1887, is still in business\nFile:Antique refrigerator - Hemingway House.jpg|thumb|A 1930s era General Electric \"Globe Top\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiqueappliances.com/monitor-tops/ | work = Antique Appliances |title=Monitor Tops|accessdate=2020-01-25}}</ref> refrigerator in the [[Ernest Hemingway House]]\nFile:MonitorTopFridgeHarvard.jpg|thumb|upright|General Electric \"Monitor-Top\" refrigerator, still in use, June 2007\nFile:1963 Frigidaire Imperial refrigerator.jpg|thumb|Frigidaire Imperial \"Frost Proof\" model FPI-16BC-63, top refrigerator/bottom freezer with brushed chrome door finish made by [[Frigidaire|General Motors]] Canada in 1963\nFile:LG refrigerator interior.jpg|thumb|A side-by-side refrigerator-freezer with an [[icemaker]] (2011)\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Theater commercial, electric refrigerator, 1926.ogv|left|thumb|Commercial for electric refrigerators in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], 1926]]\n{{PanoViewer|Inside a refrigerator \u2013 360\u00b0 Photo.jpg|Inside a regular family refrigerator \u2013 360\u00b0 photo}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cold chain]]\n* [[Continuous freezers]]\n* [[Ice cream maker]]\n* [[Ice famine]]\n* [[Internet refrigerator]]\n* [[List of home appliances]]\n* [[Pot-in-pot refrigerator]]\n* [[Refrigerator death]]\n* [[Refrigerator magnet]]\n* [[Solar-powered refrigerator]]\n* [[Star (classification)|Star rating]]\n* [[Kimchi refrigerator]]\n* [[Wine cellar]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Rees, Jonathan.

''BBC''. 30 April 2008</ref> A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a '''freezer'''. The refrigerator replaced the [[icebox]], which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half.\n\nThe first cooling systems for food involved ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of [[Freon]] in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.\n\nFreezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. The freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style had been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern refrigerators broke the trend. A vapor compression cycle is used in most [https://womenperfectsolution.com/best-refrigerator-in-india-2020/ household refrigerators], refrigerator\u2013freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include [[Auto-defrost|automatic defrosting]], chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door.\n\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest are Peltier-type refrigerators designed to chill beverages. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1&nbsp;m wide with a capacity of 600&nbsp;L. Refrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen. The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before. Freezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and [[economies of scale|bulk purchases save money]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Technology development===\n{{See also|Refrigeration|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}\n\nBefore the invention of the refrigerator, [[Icehouse (building)|icehouses]] were used to provide cool storage for most of the year. Placed near freshwater lakes or packed with snow and ice during the winter, they were once very common. Natural means are still used to cool foods today. On mountainsides, runoff from melting snow is a convenient way to cool drinks, and during the winter one can keep milk fresh much longer just by keeping it outdoors. The word \"refrigeratory\" was used at least as early as the 17th century<ref>Venetum Britannicum, 1676, London, p. 176 in the 1678 edition.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n   | width     = 140\n   | direction = vertical\n   | image_style = border:0\n   | image1    = Gorrie Ice Machine.png\n   | alt1      = Mechanical drawing\n   | caption1  = Schematic of Dr. John Gorrie's 1841 mechanical ice machine\n   | image2    = AppareilCarr\u00e9.jpg\n   | alt2      = Mechanical drawing\n   | caption2  = [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]]'s ice-making device\n  }}\nThe history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor [[William Cullen]] designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755. Cullen used a pump to create a partial [[vacuum]] over a container of [[diethyl ether]], which then [[boiling point|boiled]], absorbing [[heat of vaporization|heat]] from the surrounding air.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arora|first=Ramesh Chandra|title=Refrigeration and Air Conditioning|publisher=PHI Learning|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81-203-3915-0|page=3|chapter=Mechanical vapour compression refrigeration}}</ref> The experiment even created a small amount of ice, but had no practical application at that time.\n\nIn 1805, American inventor [[Oliver Evans]] described a closed [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle for the production of ice by ether under vacuum. In 1820, the British scientist [[Michael Faraday]] liquefied [[ammonia]] and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate in Great Britain, [[Jacob Perkins]], built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system. It was a closed-cycle device that could operate continuously.<ref name=burstall>{{cite book |last = Burstall |first = Aubrey F. |year = 1965 |title = A History of Mechanical Engineering |publisher = The MIT Press |isbn = 0-262-52001-X}}</ref> A similar attempt was made in 1842, by American physician, [[John Gorrie]],<ref>{{US patent|8080}}</ref> who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure. American engineer [[Alexander Twining]] took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapor compression system that used ether.\n\nThe first practical vapor compression refrigeration system was built by [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]], a Scottish Australian. His 1856 patent was for a vapor compression system using ether, alcohol or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapor-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation.\n\nThe first [[absorption refrigeration|gas absorption]] refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as \"aqua ammonia\") was developed by [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]] of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. [[Carl von Linde]], an engineering professor at the Technological University Munich in Germany, patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876. His new process made possible the use of gases such as [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[methyl chloride]] (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl) as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s.\n\n{{Clear}}\n=== Commercial refrigerators ===\nCommercial refrigerator and freezer units, which go by many other names, were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. They used gas systems such as [[ammonia]] (R-717) or [[sulfur dioxide]] (R-764), which occasionally leaked, making them unsafe for home use. Practical household refrigerators were introduced in 1915 and gained wider acceptance in the United States in the 1930s as prices fell and non-toxic, non-flammable synthetic [[refrigerant]]s such as [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|Freon-12]] (R-12) were introduced.  However, R-12 damaged the [[ozone layer]], causing governments to issue a ban on its use in new refrigerators and air-conditioning systems in 1994. The less harmful replacement for R-12, R-134a (tetrafluoroethane), has been in common use since 1990, but R-12 is still found in many old systems today.\n\nA common commercial refrigerator is the glass fronted beverage cooler. These type of appliances are typically designed for specific re-load conditions meaning that they generally have a larger cooling system. This ensures that they are able to cope with a large throughput of drinks and frequent door opening.  As a result, it is common for these types of commercial refrigerators to have energy consumption of >4 kWh/day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chest Freezer Reviews|url=http://groomandstyle.com/best-chest-freezer-review-top-5/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912012151/http://groomandstyle.com/best-chest-freezer-review-top-5/|archivedate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic refrigerators===\nIn 1913, refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by [[Fred W.

Wales]] of Detroit, Michigan, introduced an idea for a practical electric refrigeration unit, which later became the basis for the [[Kelvinator]]. A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet was invented by [[Alfred Mellowes]] in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by [[William C. Durant]] in 1918, who started the [[Frigidaire]] company to [[Mass production|mass-produce]] refrigerators. In 1918, Kelvinator company introduced the first refrigerator with any type of automatic control. The [[absorption refrigerator]] was invented by [[Baltzar von Platen (inventor)|Baltzar von Platen]] and [[Carl Munters]] from [[Sweden]] in 1922, while they were still students at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm. It became a worldwide success and was commercialized by [[Electrolux]]. Other pioneers included [[Charles Tellier]], [[David Boyle (inventor)|David Boyle]], and [[Raoul Pictet]]. [[Carl von Linde]] was the first to patent and make a practical and compact refrigerator.\n\nThese home units usually required the installation of the mechanical parts, motor and compressor, in the basement or an adjacent room while the cold box was located in the kitchen. There was a 1922 model that consisted of a wooden cold box, [[Watercooling|water-cooled]] compressor, an [[ice cube]] tray and a {{convert|9|cuft|adj=on}} compartment, and cost $714. (A 1922 [[Model-T]] Ford cost about $450.) By 1923, Kelvinator held 80 percent of the market for electric refrigerators. Also in 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. About this same time porcelain-covered metal cabinets began to appear. Ice cube trays were introduced more and more during the 1920s; up to this time freezing was not an auxiliary function of the modern refrigerator.\n\n[[File:Monitor refer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|General Electric \"Monitor-Top\" refrigerator, introduced in 1927, priced at $525, with the first all-steel cabinet, designed by Christian Steenstrup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.industrialdesignhistory.com/book/export/html/148|title=G.E.

Over a million units were produced. As the refrigerating medium, these refrigerators used either [[sulfur dioxide]], which is corrosive to the eyes and may cause loss of vision, painful skin burns and lesions, or [[methyl formate]], which is highly flammable, harmful to the eyes, and toxic if inhaled or ingested. Many of these units are still functional today, after requiring little more service than a replacement start relay or thermostat if at all. These cooling systems cannot legally be recharged with the hazardous original refrigerants if they leak or break down.\n\nThe introduction of [[Freon]] in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s and provided a safer, low-toxicity alternative to previously used refrigerants.  Separate freezers became common during the 1940s; the popular term at the time for the unit was a ''deep freeze''. These devices, or ''appliances'', did not go into mass production for use in the home until after World War II.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.history.com/exhibits/modern/fridge.html| url-status = dead | title = The History of Household Wonders: History of the Refrigerator | year = 2006 | work = [[History (U.S. TV network)|History.com]] | publisher = A&E Television Networks | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080326092256/http://www.history.com/exhibits/modern/fridge.html | archive-date = 26 March 2008}}</ref> The 1950s and 1960s saw technical advances like automatic [[defrost]]ing and automatic ice making. More efficient refrigerators were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, even though [[Ozone depletion|environmental issues]] led to the banning of very effective (Freon) refrigerants. Early refrigerator models (from 1916) had a cold compartment for ice cube trays. From the late 1920s fresh vegetables were successfully processed through freezing by the [[Post Foods|Postum Company]] (the forerunner of [[General Foods]]), which had acquired the technology when it bought the rights to [[Clarence Birdseye]]'s successful fresh freezing methods.\n\n== Styles of refrigerators ==\nIn the early 1950s most refrigerators were white, but from the mid-1950s through present day designers and manufacturers put color onto refrigerators. In the late-1950s/early-1960s, pastel colors like turquoise and pink became popular, and brushed chrome-plating (similar to stainless finish) was available on some models. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, [[earth tone]] colors were popular, including [[Gold (color)|Harvest Gold]], [[Green|Avocado Green]] and almond. In the 1980s, black became fashionable. In the late 1990s [[stainless steel]] came into vogue, and in 2009, one manufacturer introduced multi-color designs. Since 1961 the [[Color Marketing Group]] has attempted to coordinate the colors of appliances and other consumer goods.\n\nRefigerators can also be classified according to the number and arrangement of their doors:\n*One Door: the freezer and refrigerator compartment are behind the same door and in the same common compartment. The freezer is on the top part of the common compartment and may have an uninsulated and transparent plastic door covering it. The freezer compartment is formed by a sheet of metal or plastic that has been bent to form a floor and side walls, which is then fastened to the ceiling of the common compartment. The sheet has internal cavities and passageways, making it the evaporator of the refigerator.\nThere are also one door refrigerators that don't have a freezer compartment; these are available for both commercial and residential settings, and some can be switched between freezer and refrigerator mode.  \n*Conventional: the freezer compartment is above the refrigerator compartment, and are separated by a layer of insulation and have separate doors that can be opened independently from each other. A variation inverts this order, placing the freezer compartment below the refigerator compartment. In this variation, the freezer compartment may not have door shelves and may have several internal compartments. The freezer is always smaller than the refrigerator compartment. \n* Side by Side: once mainstream, this arrangement places the freezer and refigerator compartments side by side. Again, the freezer and refigerator are separated by insulation. The freezer is narrower than the refigerator and they may even use different lighting systems; freezer compartments tend to use incandescent lighting while refrigerator compartments may use fluorescent lighting instead, although both have been replaced with LED lighting in modern refrigerators. \n*French door: these have largely replaced side by side refrigerators in domestic settings. The refrigerator is above the freezer. The refigerator has a french door while the freezer tends to be a drawer. Some models have 2 drawers, and some use french doors for both the freezer and refigerator. If it has 2 drawers, the upper drawer is often refigerated (it is not a freezer) and its temperature may be precisely controlled. \n*Multi door or six door: mainly made by Japanese companies like Hitachi, Panasonic and Mitsubishi Electric. <ref>https://www.hitachi-hk.com.hk/en/products/multi-door.html</ref><ref>https://www.panasonic.com/my/consumer/home-appliances/refrigerator/multi-door.html</ref><ref>https://www.mitsubishielectric.com.sg/products/refrigerators/folio-series</ref> These use a french door for the refrigerator compartment, which is at the top, and below are 4 drawers, organized in 3 levels. (From top to bottom) In the first level, on the left is an (often automatic) ice maker whose compartment is frozen and on the right is a small freezer, originally intended for fish. On the second level is a freezer, and on the third level is a refrigerated vegetable compartment. The drawers may have 2 internal drawers or baskets that sit on top of each other and can be moved towards the back of the freezer while the drawer is open. This also applies to french door refrigerators.\n\n[[Kimchi refrigerator]]s are usually made by South Korean companies (LG, Dimchae and Samsung) and are designed with long-term (several months) kimchi storage in mind, and may be designed to also simultaneously store items other than kimchi.\n\n==Freezer==\n{{redirect|Freezer}}<!-- Freezer redirects to this subsection -->\n'''Freezer''' units are used in households and in industry and commerce.

In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as [[R134a]] enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below the temperature of the refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the ''condenser''; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as ''auto-refrigeration''. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment (\"box air\") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.\n\nModern domestic refrigerators are extremely reliable because motor and compressor are integrated within a welded container, \"sealed unit\", with greatly reduced likelihood of leakage or contamination.  By comparison, externally-coupled refrigeration compressors, such as those in automobile air conditioning, inevitably leak fluid and lubricant past the shaft seals.  This leads to a requirement for periodic recharging and, if ignored, possible compressor failure.\n\n===Absorption refrigerators===\nAn [[absorption refrigerator]] works differently from a compressor refrigerator, using a source of [[heat]], such as [[combustion]] of [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[solar thermal energy]] or an electric heating element. These heat sources are much quieter than the compressor motor in a typical refrigerator. A fan or pump might be the only mechanical moving parts; reliance on convection is considered impractical.\n\nOther uses of an absorption refrigerator (or \"chiller\") include large systems used in office buildings or complexes such as hospitals and universities. These large systems are used to chill a brine solution that is circulated through the building.\n\n===Peltier effect refrigerators===\nThe [[Peltier effect]] uses electricity to pump heat directly; refrigerators employing this system are sometimes used for camping, or in situations where noise is not acceptable. They can be totally silent (if a fan for air circulation is not fitted) but are less energy-efficient than other methods.\n\n===Dual compressor refrigerators===\nA few manufacturers offer dual compressor models.  These models have separate freezer and refrigerator compartments that operate independently of each other, sometimes mounted within a single cabinet.  Each has its own separate compressor, condenser and evaporator coils, insulation, thermostat, and door.  Typically, the compressors and condenser coils are mounted at the top of the cabinet, with a single fan to cool them both.\n\n===Ultra-low temperature refrigerators===\n\"Ultra-cold\" or \"[[ULT freezer|ultra-low temperature (ULT)]]\" (typically \u221280{{nbsp}}C) freezers, as used for storing biological samples, also generally employ two stages of cooling, but in cascade. The lower temperature stage uses [[methane]], or a similar gas, as a refrigerant, with its condenser kept at around \u221240{{nbsp}}C by a second stage which uses a more conventional refrigerant. Well known brands include Forma and Revco (both now Thermo Scientific) and Thermoline. For much lower temperatures (around \u2212196{{nbsp}}C), laboratories usually purchase [[liquid nitrogen]], kept in a [[Dewar flask]], into which the samples are suspended.\n\n===Other refrigerators===\nAlternatives to the vapor-compression cycle not in current mass production include:\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[Thermoacoustic heat engine|Acoustic cooling]]\n* [[Air cycle]]\n* [[Magnetic cooling]]\n* [[Malone engine]]\n* [[Pulse tube refrigerator|Pulse tube]]\n* [[Stirling engine|Stirling cycle]]\n* [[Thermoelectric cooling]] \n* [[Thermionic emission|Thermionic cooling]]\n* [[Vortex tube]]\n* [[Water cycle system]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.iifiir.org/en/doc/1051.pdf |title=Developments in domestic refrigeration and consumer attitudes |author=James, Stephen J. |journal=Bulletin of the IIR |year=2003 |volume=5 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319205159/http://www.iifiir.org/en/doc/1051.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2009 }}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Architecture==\nMany modern refrigerator/freezers have the freezer on top and the refrigerator on the bottom. Most refrigerator-freezers\u2014except for manual defrost models or cheaper units\u2014use what appears to be two thermostats. Only the refrigerator compartment is properly temperature controlled. When the refrigerator gets too warm, the thermostat starts the cooling process and a fan circulates the air around the freezer. During this time, the refrigerator also gets colder. The freezer control knob only controls the amount of air that flows into the refrigerator via a damper system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060705170456/http://www.geappliances.com/search/fast/infobase/10000661.htm Refrigerator \u2013 Adjusting Temperature Controls]. geappliances.com</ref> Changing the refrigerator temperature will inadvertently change the freezer temperature in the opposite direction. Changing the freezer temperature will have no effect on the refrigerator temperature. The freezer control may also be adjusted to compensate for any refrigerator adjustment.\n\nThis means the refrigerator may become too warm. However, because only enough air is diverted to the refrigerator compartment, the freezer usually re-acquires the set temperature quickly, unless the door is opened. When a door is opened, either in the refrigerator or the freezer, the fan in some units stops immediately to prevent excessive frost build up on the freezer's evaporator coil, because this coil is cooling two areas. When the freezer reaches temperature, the unit cycles off, no matter what the refrigerator temperature is. Modern computerized refrigerators do not use the damper system. The computer manages fan speed for both compartments, although air is still blown from the freezer.\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Fridgeinterior.jpg|thumb|200px|The inside of a home refrigerator containing a large variety of everyday food items.]]\n\nNewer refrigerators may include:\n*[[Auto-defrost|Automatic defrosting]]\n*A power failure warning that alerts the user by flashing a temperature display. It may display the maximum temperature reached during the power failure, and whether frozen food has defrosted or may contain harmful bacteria.\n*Chilled water and ice from a dispenser in the door. Water and ice dispensing became available in the 1970s. In some refrigerators, the process of making ice is built-in so the user doesn't have to manually use ice trays. Some refrigerators have water chillers and water filtration systems.\n*Cabinet rollers that lets the refrigerator roll out for easier cleaning\n*Adjustable shelves and trays\n*A status indicator that notifies when it is time to change the [[Filter (water)|water filter]]\n*An in-door ice caddy, which relocates the ice-maker storage to the freezer door and saves approximately 60 litres (2&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft) of usable freezer space. It is also removable, and helps to prevent ice-maker clogging.\n*A cooling zone in the refrigerator door shelves. Air from the freezer section is diverted to the refrigerator door, to cool milk or juice stored in the door shelf.\n*A drop down door built into the refrigerator main door, giving easy access to frequently used items such as milk, thus saving energy by not having to open the main door.\n*A Fast Freeze function to rapidly cool foods by running the compressor for a predetermined amount of time and thus temporarily lowering the freezer temperature below normal operating levels. It is recommended to use this feature several hours before adding more than 1&nbsp;kg of unfrozen food to the freezer. For freezers without this feature, lowering the temperature setting to the coldest will have the same effect.\n\n* Freezer Defrost: Early freezer units accumulated [[ice crystals]] around the freezing units. This was a result of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing (\"defrosting\") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the freezer compartment (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the freezer's walls for a short amount of time to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate freezer compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.\nThese older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around {{convert|-6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, which is suitable for keeping food for a week.\n\n* Butter heater: In the early 1950s, the butter conditioner's patent was filed and published by the inventor Nave Alfred E. This feature was supposed to \"provide a new and improved food storage receptacle for storing butter or the like which may quickly and easily be removed from the refrigerator cabinet for the purpose of cleaning.\"<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US2579848 Butter Conditioner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026070427/https://www.google.com/patents/US2579848 |date=26 October 2016 }}. Google Patents.</ref><ref>{{US patent|2579848}}</ref> Because of the high interest to the invention, companies in UK, New Zealand, and Australia started to include the feature into the mass fridge production and soon it became a symbol of the local culture. However, not long after that it was removed from production as according to the companies this was the only way for them to meet new ecology regulations and they found it inefficient to have a heat generating device inside a fridge.\n\nLater advances included automatic ice units and self compartmentalized freezing units.\n\n== Types of domestic refrigerators ==\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest is a 4&nbsp;L Peltier refrigerator advertised as being able to hold 6 cans of beer. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1&nbsp;m wide with a capacity of 600&nbsp;L. Some models for small [[household]]s fit under kitchen work surfaces, usually about 86&nbsp;cm high. Refrigerators may be combined with freezers, either stacked with refrigerator or freezer above, below, or side by side. A refrigerator without a frozen food storage compartment may have a small section just to make ice cubes. Freezers may have drawers to store food in, or they may have no divisions (chest freezers).\n\nRefrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen.\n\nThree distinct classes of refrigerator are common:\n===Compressor refrigerators===\n*Compressor refrigerators are by far the most common type; they make a noticeable noise, but are most efficient and give greatest cooling effect. Portable compressor refrigerators for [[recreational vehicle]] (RV) and camping use are expensive but effective and reliable. Refrigeration units for commercial and industrial applications can be made in various sizes, shapes and styles to fit customer needs. Commercial and industrial refrigerators may have their compressors located away from the cabinet (similar to [[Air conditioning#Split systems|split system air conditioners]]) to reduce noise nuisance and reduce the load on air conditioning in hot weather.\n===Absorption refrigerator===\n*[[Absorption refrigerator]]s may be used in caravans and trailers, and dwellings lacking electricity, such as farms or rural cabins, where they have a long history. They may be powered by any heat source: gas (natural or propane) or kerosene being common. Models made for camping and RV use often have the option of running (inefficiently) on 12 volt battery power.\n\n===Solar refrigerator===\n**[[Solar refrigerator]]s and [[Thermal mass refrigerator]]s are designed to reduce electrical consumption. Solar refrigerators have the added advantage that they do not use refrigerants that are harmful to the environment or flammable. Typical solar designs are [[absorption refrigerator]]s that use ammonia as the working gas, and employ large mirrors to concentrate sufficient sunlight to reach the temperature required to free gaseous ammonia from the solvent.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210202228/http://blog.thegreenv.com/?p=191 The Green V.

News.cnet.com.</ref> Most thermal mass refrigerators are designed to use electricity intermittently. As these units are heavily insulated, cooling load is limited primarily to heat introduced by new items to be refrigerated, and ambient air transfer when the unit is open. Very little power is therefore required if opened infrequently.\n\n===Peltier refrigerators===\n*[[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier refrigerators]] are powered by electricity, usually 12 volt DC, but mains-powered wine coolers are available. Peltier refrigerators are inexpensive but inefficient and become progressively more inefficient with increased cooling effect; much of this inefficiency may be related to the temperature differential across the short distance between the \"hot\" and \"cold\" sides of the [[Peltier cell]]. Peltier refrigerators generally use heat sinks and fans to lower this differential; the only noise produced comes from the fan. Reversing the polarity of the voltage applied to the Peltier cells results in a heating rather than cooling effect.\n\nOther specialized cooling mechanisms may be used for cooling, but have not been applied to domestic or commercial refrigerators.\n\n===Magnetic refrigerator===\n*[[Magnetic refrigeration|Magnetic refrigerator]]s are refrigerators that work on the magnetocaloric effect. The cooling effect is triggered by placing a metal alloy in a magnetic field.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news64851465.html \"Towards the magnetic fridge\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207135221/http://www.physorg.com/news64851465.html |date=7 December 2008 }}. ''Physorg''. 21 April 2006</ref>\n*[[Acoustic refrigerator]]s are refrigerators that use resonant linear reciprocating motors/alternators to generate a sound that is converted to heat and cold using compressed helium gas. The heat is discarded and the cold is routed to the refrigerator.\n\n== Energy efficiency ==\n[[File:Energy label 2010.svg|thumb|A European energy label for a fridge.]]\n\nIn a house without air-conditioning (space heating and/or cooling) refrigerators consumed more energy than any other home device.<ref>{{cite web|title=Which UK \u2013 Saving Energy|url=http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/energy-labels-explained/fridge-and-freezer-energy-labels|work=Which UK|accessdate=10 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110161250/http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/energy-labels-explained/fridge-and-freezer-energy-labels|archivedate=10 November 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s a competition was held among the major manufacturers to encourage energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Feist, J.

Humboldt.edu</ref> But even ordinary units are quite efficient; some smaller units use less than 0.2 kWh per day (equivalent to 8 W continuously).\nLarger units, especially those with large freezers and icemakers, may use as much as 4&nbsp;kW\u00b7h per day (equivalent to 170 W continuously).\nThe European Union uses a letter-based mandatory [[European Union energy label|energy efficiency rating label]] instead of the Energy Star; thus EU refrigerators at the point of sale are labelled according to how energy-efficient they are.\n\nFor US refrigerators, the [[Consortium on Energy Efficiency]] (CEE) further differentiates between Energy Star qualified refrigerators. Tier 1 refrigerators are those that are 20% to 24.9% more efficient than the Federal minimum standards set by the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] (NAECA). Tier 2 are those that are 25% to 29.9% more efficient.

Although these designs generally use a much larger amount of energy compared to compressor refrigeration, other qualities such as silent operation or the ability to use gas can favor these refrigeration units in small enclosures, a mobile environment or in environments where unit failure would lead to devastating consequences.\n\nMany refrigerators made in the 1930s and 1940s were far more efficient than most that were made later. This is partly attributable to the addition of new features, such as auto-defrost, that reduced efficiency. Additionally, after World War 2, refrigerator style became more important than efficiency. This was especially true in the US in the 1970s, when side-by-side models (known as American fridgefreezers outside of the US) with ice dispensers and water chillers became popular. However, the reduction in efficiency also arose partly from reduction in the amount of insulation to cut costs.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:ExpensiveRefrigerators.JPG|thumb|260px|Display of modern American-style / side-by-side refrigerators, available for purchase in a store]]\nBecause of the introduction of new energy efficiency standards, refrigerators made today are much more efficient than those made in the 1930s; they consume the same amount of energy while being three times as large.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Successes of Energy Efficiency: The United States and California National Trust | url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-999-2007-023/CEC-999-2007-023.PDF | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225075006/http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-999-2007-023/CEC-999-2007-023.PDF | archivedate=25 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news  |title=Out With the Old, In With the New  |url=http://www.nrdc.org/air/energy/appliance/app1.pdf  |author1=Calwell, Chris  |author2=Reeder, Travis  |lastauthoramp=yes  |year=2001  |work=Natural Resources Defense Council  |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608090449/http://www.nrdc.org/air/energy/appliance/app1.pdf  |archivedate=8 June 2011    }}</ref>\n\nThe efficiency of older refrigerators can be improved by defrosting (if the unit is manual defrost) and cleaning them regularly, replacing old and worn door seals with new ones, adjusting the thermostat to accommodate the actual contents (a refrigerator needn't be colder than {{convert|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to store drinks and non-perishable items) and also replacing insulation, where applicable. Some sites recommend cleaning condenser coils every month or so on units with coils on the rear, to add life to the coils and not suffer an unnoticeable deterioration in efficiency over an extended period, the unit should be able to ventilate or \"breathe\" with adequate spaces around the front, back, sides and above the unit. If the refrigerator uses a fan to keep the condenser cool, then this must be cleaned or seviced, at per individual manufactures recommendations.\n\nFrost-free refrigerators or freezers use electric fans to cool the appropriate compartment.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bvxCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21|title=Low Temperature and Cryogenic Refrigeration|last=Kaka\u00e7|first=Sadik|last2=Avelino|first2=M.

The air is drawn in through an inlet duct and passed through the evaporator where it is cooled, the air is then circulated throughout the cabinet via a series of ducts and vents. Because the air passing the evaporator is supposedly warm and moist, frost begins to form on the evaporator (especially on a freezer's evaporator). In cheaper and/or older models, a defrost cycle is controlled via a mechanical timer. This timer is set to shut off the compressor and fan and energize a heating element located near or around the evaporator for about 15 to 30 minutes at every 6 to 12 hours. This melts any frost or ice build up and allows the refrigerator to work normally once more. It is believed that frost free units have a lower tolerance for frost, due to their air-conditioner like evaporator coils. Therefore, if a door is left open accidentally (especially the freezer), the defrost system may not remove all frost, in this case, the freezer (or refrigerator) must be defrosted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIf the defrosting system melts all the ice before the timed defrosting period ends, then a small device (called a defrost limiter) acts like a thermostat and shuts off the heating element to prevent too large a temperature fluctuation, it also prevents hot blasts of air when the system starts again, should it finish defrosting early. On some early frost-free models, the defrost limiter also sends a signal to the defrost timer to start the compressor and fan as soon as it shuts off the heating element before the timed defrost cycle ends. When the defrost cycle is completed, the compressor and fan are allowed to cycle back on.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFrost-free refrigerators, including some early frost free refrigerator/freezers that used a cold plate in their refrigerator section instead of airflow from the freezer section, generally don't shut off their refrigerator fans during defrosting. This allows consumers to leave food in the main refrigerator compartment uncovered, and also helps keep vegetables moist. This method also helps reduce energy consumption, because the refrigerator is above freeze point and can pass the warmer-than-freezing air through the evaporator or cold plate to aid the defrosting cycle.\n\nWith the advent of digital [[inverter compressor]]s, the energy consumption is even further reduced than a single-speed induction motor compressor, and thus contributes far less in the way of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/how-the-digital-inverter-compressor-has-transformed-the-modern-refrigerator|title=How the Digital Inverter Compressor Has Transformed the Modern Refrigerator|website=news.samsung.com|accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Regular Refrigerators vs Inverter Refrigerators ===\n\nThe energy consumption of a refrigerator is also dependent on the type of refrigeration being done. For instance, Inverter Refrigerators consume comparatively lesser energy than a typical non-inverter refrigerator. \n\nIn an inverter refrigerator, the compressor is used conditionally on requirement basis. For instance, an inverter refrigerator might use less energy during the winters than it does during the summers. This is because the compressor works for very less duration than it does during the summers.\n\n== Effect on lifestyle ==\nThe refrigerator allows the modern family to keep food fresh for longer than before. The most notable improvement is for meat and other highly perishable wares, which needed to be refined to gain anything resembling shelf life. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} (On the other hand, refrigerators and freezers can also be stocked with processed, quick-cook foods that are less healthy.) Refrigeration in transit makes it possible to enjoy food from distant places.\n\nDairy products, meats, fish, poultry and vegetables can be kept refrigerated in the same space within the kitchen (although raw meat should be kept separate from other food for reasons of [[hygiene]]).\n\nFreezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and [[economies of scale|bulk purchases save money]]. Ice cream, a popular commodity of the 20th century, could previously only be obtained by traveling to where the product was made and eating it on the spot. Now it is a common food item. Ice on demand not only adds to the enjoyment of cold drinks, but is useful for first-aid, and for cold packs that can be kept frozen for picnics or in case of emergency.\n\n== Temperature zones and ratings ==\n===Residential units===\n\nThe capacity of a refrigerator is measured in either liters or cubic feet. Typically the volume of a combined refrigerator-freezer is split with 1/3rds to 1/4th of the volume allocated to the freezer although these values are highly variable.\n\nTemperature settings for refrigerator and freezer compartments are often given arbitrary numbers by manufacturers (for example, 1 through 9, warmest to coldest), but generally {{convert|3 |to|5|C|F}}<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> is ideal for the refrigerator compartment and {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} for the freezer. Some refrigerators must be within certain external temperature parameters to run properly. This can be an issue when placing units in an unfinished area, such as a garage. \n\nSome refrigerators are now divided into four zones to store different types of food:\n*{{Convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (freezer)\n*{{Convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (meat zone)\n*{{Convert|5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (cooling zone)\n*{{Convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} ([[crisper drawer|crisper]])\n\n[[Europe]]an freezers, and refrigerators with a freezer compartment, have a four [[Star (classification)| star rating system]] to grade freezers. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n* [\u2217]     : min temperature = {{convert|-6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is 1 week\n* [\u2217\u2217]    : min temperature = {{convert|-12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is 1 month\n* [\u2217\u2217\u2217]   : min temperature = {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is between 3 and 12 months \n::::depending on type (meat, vegetables, fish, etc.)\n* [\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217] : min temperature = {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for pre-frozen or frozen-from-fresh food is between 3 and 12 months\n\nAlthough both the three and four star ratings specify the same storage times and same minimum temperature of {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, only a four star freezer is intended for freezing fresh food, and may include a \"fast freeze\" function (runs the compressor continually, down to as low as {{convert|-26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}) to facilitate this. Three (or fewer) stars are used for frozen food compartments that are only suitable for storing frozen food; introducing fresh food into such a compartment is likely to result in unacceptable temperature rises. This difference in categorization is shown in the design of the 4-star logo, where the \"standard\" three stars are displayed in a box using \"positive\" colours, denoting the same normal operation as a 3-star freezer, and the fourth star showing the additional fresh food/fast freeze function is prefixed to the box in \"negative\" colours or with other distinct formatting. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nMost European refrigerators include a moist cold refrigerator section (which does require (automatic) defrosting at irregular intervals) and a (rarely frost free) freezer section.\n\n=== Commercial refrigeration temperatures ===\n(from warmest to coolest)<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=https://northeastcooling.com/category/commercial-refrigeration-maintenance-tips/\n |date=\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422134813/http://northeastcooling.com/category/commercial-refrigeration-maintenance-tips/page/5/\n |url-status = dead\n |archive-date=22 April 2017\n |access-date=25 January 2020\n |title=Commercial Refrigeration Maintenance Tips Archives - Page 5 of 5\n |website=Northeast Cooling\n }}\n</ref><!--\u25e6-->\n; Refrigerators : {{convert|35|to|38|F|C|0}}, and not greater than maximum refrigerator temperature at {{convert|41|F|C|0}}\n; Freezer, Reach-in : {{convert|-10|to|+5|F|C|0}}\n; Freezer, Walk-in : {{convert|-10|to|0|F|C|0}}\n; Freezer, Ice Cream : {{convert|-20|to|-10|F|C|0}}\n\n== Disposal ==\n[[File:Servel Electrolux Gas Refrigerator ad, 1941.jpg|thumb|1941 Ad for [[Servel]] [[Electrolux]] Gas Refrigerator ([[Absorption refrigerator|Absorption]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://refresearch.com/the-first-absorption-refrigerator/|title=The First Absorption Refrigerator|first=Neil|last=Lobocki|date=4 October 2017|accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref> designed by [[Norman Bel Geddes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WiXuznGGhz8C&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=Norman+Bel+Geddes+%2295817%22&hl=en|title=\"95,817 DESIGN FOR A REFRIGERATOR CABINET Norman Bel Geddes, New York, and William I.

Modern refrigerators usually use a refrigerant called HFC-134a ([[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane]]), which does not deplete the ozone layer, instead of Freon. A R-134a is now becoming very uncommon in Europe. Newer refrigerants are being used instead. The main refrigerant now used is R-600a, or [[isobutane]] which has a smaller effect on the atmosphere if released. There have been reports of refrigerators exploding if the refrigerant leaks isobutane in the presence of a spark.  If the coolant leaks into the fridge, at times when the door is not being opened (such as overnight) the concentration of coolant in the air within the fridge can build up to form an explosive mixture that can be ignited either by a spark from the thermostat or when the light comes on as the door is opened, resulting in documented cases of serious property damage and injury or even death from the resulting explosion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432767/Homeowner-left-cuts-bruises-fridge-freezer-exploded-kitchen-says-survived-kneeling-down.html |title=Homeowner left with serious cuts and bruises after fridge-freezer exploded in his kitchen says he only survived because he was kneeling down |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206084025/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432767/Homeowner-left-cuts-bruises-fridge-freezer-exploded-kitchen-says-survived-kneeling-down.html |archivedate=6 February 2016  }} [[Daily Mail]] February 2016</ref><ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tragic-bride-killed-after-fridge-6817075 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805221722/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tragic-bride-killed-after-fridge-6817075 |archivedate=5 August 2017  }} [[Daily Mirror]] November 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210334/Alert-new-wave-exploding-fridges-caused-environmentally-friendly-coolant.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225213551/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210334/Alert-new-wave-exploding-fridges-caused-environmentally-friendly-coolant.html |archivedate=25 February 2017  }} [[Daily Mail]] September 2009</ref>\n\nDisposal of discarded refrigerators is regulated, often mandating the removal of doors for safety reasons.

One example is the Phoenix refrigerator program launched in Australia. This government incentive picked up old refrigerators, paying their owners for \"donating\" the refrigerator. The refrigerator was then refurbished, with new door seals, a thorough cleaning and the removal of items, such as the cover that is strapped to the back of many older units. The resulting refrigerators, now over 10% more efficient, were then distributed to low income families.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>\nFile:Commercial Refrigerator Advertisement 1905.jpg|thumb|left|McCray pre-electric home refrigerator ad from 1905; this company, founded in 1887, is still in business\nFile:Antique refrigerator - Hemingway House.jpg|thumb|A 1930s era General Electric \"Globe Top\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiqueappliances.com/monitor-tops/ | work = Antique Appliances |title=Monitor Tops|accessdate=2020-01-25}}</ref> refrigerator in the [[Ernest Hemingway House]]\nFile:MonitorTopFridgeHarvard.jpg|thumb|upright|General Electric \"Monitor-Top\" refrigerator, still in use, June 2007\nFile:1963 Frigidaire Imperial refrigerator.jpg|thumb|Frigidaire Imperial \"Frost Proof\" model FPI-16BC-63, top refrigerator/bottom freezer with brushed chrome door finish made by [[Frigidaire|General Motors]] Canada in 1963\nFile:LG refrigerator interior.jpg|thumb|A side-by-side refrigerator-freezer with an [[icemaker]] (2011)\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Theater commercial, electric refrigerator, 1926.ogv|left|thumb|Commercial for electric refrigerators in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], 1926]]\n{{PanoViewer|Inside a refrigerator \u2013 360\u00b0 Photo.jpg|Inside a regular family refrigerator \u2013 360\u00b0 photo}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cold chain]]\n* [[Continuous freezers]]\n* [[Ice cream maker]]\n* [[Ice famine]]\n* [[Internet refrigerator]]\n* [[List of home appliances]]\n* [[Pot-in-pot refrigerator]]\n* [[Refrigerator death]]\n* [[Refrigerator magnet]]\n* [[Solar-powered refrigerator]]\n* [[Star (classification)|Star rating]]\n* [[Kimchi refrigerator]]\n* [[Wine cellar]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Rees, Jonathan.

Their sound has been described as a musical hybrid of 1960s [[garage rock]] and 1990s [[alternative rock]]. The band has been through several line-up changes, with vocalist/guitarist [[Craig Nicholls]] serving as the sole constant throughout the band's history.\n\nThe Vines' success in the Australian recording industry resulted in winning an [[ARIA Music Awards of 2002|ARIA Award in 2002]], 'Breakthrough Artist \u2013 Single', for \"[[Get Free (The Vines song)|Get Free]]\" and receiving five other nominations for their debut album ''[[Highly Evolved]]'', plus two further nominations in subsequent years.

The song was included as a track heard on the in-game radio in the 2007 [[LucasArts]] published [[Thrillville: Off The Rails]]. \"Dope Train\" was released as a third single, with a music video composed of live footage of the band from Big Day Out in 2007.\n\nOn 19 July 2006, the Vines played a gig at the Annandale Hotel under the name \"Joe Dirt\", with a new bassist, [[Brad Heald]], after former bassist Patrick Matthews departed the group.\n\n===''Melodia'' (2008)===\n{{Main|Melodia (album)}}\nIn 2007, the Vines signed to [[Ivy League Records]] for an Australian album deal.
