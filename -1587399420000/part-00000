Devereux founded the town of Allegany on the grant, hoping to build a new city. Devereux approached [[John Timon]], the bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo|Buffalo]], for assistance. The two invited the [[Franciscan order]] to Western New York, and a small group under [[Pamfilo da Magliano]] arrived in 1856. The school graduated its first class in 1858. St. Bonaventure's College was granted university status by New York State in 1950. The largest residence hall on campus, Devereux Hall, is named for the founder.\n\nUnder the current leadership of its twenty-first president, Dr. Dennis DePerro, the University has made great progress to tear down silos, encourage collaboration and open the lines of communication with faculty, students, staff and alumni. He has launched a comprehensive capital campaign to build \u201cA Bolder Bonaventure,\u201d stewarding transformative gifts to help the university\u2019s new School of Health Professions become a reality.\nDr. DePerro has implemented new enrollment and marketing strategies and championed new academic program development, resulting in the two largest freshman classes in the last 11 years at St. Bonaventure. Under his watch, the university\u2019s online graduate initiative has seen significant growth.\n\nHis vision to transform the university inspired him to form a number of campus-based presidential commissions to examine critical issues early on in his presidency, including a group devoted solely to mission integration, reflecting his passionate commitment to create a transformational experience for students rooted in the university\u2019s Franciscan tradition. The university just hired a vice president for mission integration.\nThe University is thriving with a new School of Health Professions and academic programs. Since the late 1990s, the school has been on solid financial footing. Under the university's twentieth president, Sister Margaret Carney, the campus underwent millions of dollars in renovations and saw growth in the areas of the School of Business and its Franciscan Health Care Professions combined degree programs, notably the [[George Washington University]] and the [[Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine]]. The school is a major contributor to the economy and vibrancy of Western New York.\n\n[[Thomas Merton]], the religious writer, taught English at St. Bonaventure for a year just at the start of [[World War II]], living on campus on the second floor of Devereux Hall.<ref>archives.sbu.edu/Merton_Site/assets/mertonpamphlet.pdf</ref> It was at this school that Merton finally gave into his vocation and decided to join the [[Trappists]]. He entered the [[monastery]] in [[Kentucky]] in 1941. A heart-shaped clearing on a mountain in view of campus is linked to Merton in campus myth. Some students call it \"Merton's Heart\" and claim that Merton visited the place often and that the trees fell when he died. In reality, the hillside had been cleared for oil drilling in the 1920s and trees have since regrown, leaving the bald patch.<ref>[http://web.sbu.edu/friedsam/archives/mertonweb/Merton_Photos/SBUcampus/Butler_Gym/mertonsheart.html Merton's heart], ''St. Bonaventure University'', St. Bonaventure, NY, Undated, Retrieved 18 January 2014.</ref>\n\nOn the U.S. News & World Report's 2019 list of best regional university values, St. Bonaventure University was ranked No. 1 for value in New York state and No. 2 in the North.<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. News ranks St. Bonaventure University No. 1 for value in New York, No. 2 in the North |url=https://www.sbu.edu/about-sbu/news-events/latest-news/news-release/2018/09/10/u.s.-news-ranks-st.-bonaventure-br-no.-1-for-value-in-new-york-no.-2-in-north |website=St. Bonaventure University |publisher=St. Bonaventure University |accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\nThe campus sits on {{convert|500|acre|km2}} in the town of [[Allegany (town), New York|Allegany]], just over the line from the city of [[Olean, New York|Olean]] (total pop.: 15,000), at Exit 24 of [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]]. The university has its own [[United States Postal Service|US Post Office]] and is listed as a separate [[census-designated place]] by the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]]. The university's postal address is '''[[Saint Bonaventure, New York|Saint Bonaventure, NY]] 14778'''.\n\nMost campus buildings are designed in red brick with Italianate roofs, to reflect the architecture of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]]' native Italy.

Devereux founded the town of Allegany on the grant, hoping to build a new city. Devereux approached [[John Timon]], the bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo|Buffalo]], for assistance. The two invited the [[Franciscan order]] to Western New York, and a small group under [[Pamfilo da Magliano]] arrived in 1856. The school graduated its first class in 1858. St. Bonaventure's College was granted university status by New York State in 1950. The largest residence hall on campus, Devereux Hall, is named for the founder.\n\nUnder the current leadership of its twenty-first president, Dr. Dennis DePerro, the University has made great progress to tear down silos, encourage collaboration and open the lines of communication with faculty, students, staff and alumni. He has launched a comprehensive capital campaign to build \u201cA Bolder Bonaventure,\u201d stewarding transformative gifts to help the university\u2019s new School of Health Professions become a reality.\nDr. DePerro has implemented new enrollment and marketing strategies and championed new academic program development, resulting in the two largest freshman classes in the last 11 years at St. Bonaventure. Under his watch, the university\u2019s online graduate initiative has seen significant growth.\n\nHis vision to transform the university inspired him to form a number of campus-based presidential commissions to examine critical issues early on in his presidency, including a group devoted solely to mission integration, reflecting his passionate commitment to create a transformational experience for students rooted in the university\u2019s Franciscan tradition. The university just hired a vice president for mission integration.\nThe University is thriving with a new School of Health Professions and academic programs. Since the late 1990s, the school has been on solid financial footing. Under the university's twentieth president, Sister Margaret Carney, the campus underwent millions of dollars in renovations and saw growth in the areas of the School of Business and its Franciscan Health Care Professions combined degree programs, notably the [[George Washington University]] and the [[Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine]]. The school is a major contributor to the economy and vibrancy of Western New York.\n\n[[Thomas Merton]], the religious writer, taught English at St. Bonaventure for a year just at the start of [[World War II]], living on campus on the second floor of Devereux Hall.<ref>archives.sbu.edu/Merton_Site/assets/mertonpamphlet.pdf</ref> It was at this school that Merton finally gave into his vocation and decided to join the [[Trappists]]. He entered the [[monastery]] in [[Kentucky]] in 1941. A heart-shaped clearing on a mountain in view of campus is linked to Merton in campus myth. Some students call it \"Merton's Heart\" and claim that Merton visited the place often and that the trees fell when he died. In reality, the hillside had been cleared for oil drilling in the 1920s and trees have since regrown, leaving the bald patch.<ref>[http://web.sbu.edu/friedsam/archives/mertonweb/Merton_Photos/SBUcampus/Butler_Gym/mertonsheart.html Merton's heart], ''St. Bonaventure University'', St. Bonaventure, NY, Undated, Retrieved 18 January 2014.</ref>\n\nOn the U.S. News & World Report's 2019 list of best regional university values, St. Bonaventure University was ranked No. 1 for value in New York state and No. 2 in the North.<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. News ranks St. Bonaventure University No. 1 for value in New York, No. 2 in the North |url=https://www.sbu.edu/about-sbu/news-events/latest-news/news-release/2018/09/10/u.s.-news-ranks-st.-bonaventure-br-no.-1-for-value-in-new-york-no.-2-in-north |website=St. Bonaventure University |publisher=St. Bonaventure University |accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\nThe campus sits on {{convert|500|acre|km2}} in the town of [[Allegany (town), New York|Allegany]], just over the line from the city of [[Olean, New York|Olean]] (total pop.: 15,000), at Exit 24 of [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]].
