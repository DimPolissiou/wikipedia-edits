The ''OCI'' was introduced in response to demands for [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] by the [[Indian diaspora]], particularly in developed countries. It was introduced by ''The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005'' in August 2005. It was launched during the [[Pravasi Bharatiya Divas]] convention held in [[Hyderabad]] in late 2005.<ref>[http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI); Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926231018/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 |date=2009-09-26 }}, [http://www.moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&id=m3&idp=35&mainid=23 Diaspora Services: Overseas Citizenship of India Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504131659/http://moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&id=m3&idp=35&mainid=23 |date=2012-05-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitution of India]] prevents Indian citizens from holding dual citizenship.

Indian authorities have interpreted the law to mean a person cannot have a second country's passport simultaneously with an Indian one \u2014 even in the case of a child who is claimed by another country as a citizen of that country, and who may be required by the laws of the other country to use one of its passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in United States or in Australia to Indian parents), and the Indian courts have given the executive branch wide discretion over this matter.\n\nOn the recommendations of a High-Level Committee on Indian Diaspora, the [[Government of India]] decided to register Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) of a certain category, as has been specified in the Section 7A of the [[Citizenship Act, 1955]], as Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) cardholders.<ref name=\"Introduction\">{{cite web|title=Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) Cardholder - Introduction|url=http://mha1.nic.in/pdfs/intro.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs|accessdate=16 April 2016}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nBefore 29 January 2015, travellers holding OCI card were required to carry the passport which contained the lifetime visa while traveling to India. This requirement was done away with that day and OCI card holders no longer require the visa sticker passport. The OCI card (the blue booklet) in conjunction with a current valid foreign passport is sufficient to travel to and from [[India]].\n\nPreviously, the government could cancel OCI status of people who obtained it by fraud, showed acts of unpatriotism, or broke a law punishable with at least two years in jail before five years of having issued OCI. The [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]] gives the government additional power to strip people of their Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status if they violate any local law, whether it is a petty offense or a serious felony. The new act makes the rules much more strict for OCI card holders in a justified attempt to preserve the status\u2019s dignity. However, it also has a proviso which gives the person whose OCI status is at stake the power of being heard by the government before they come to a verdict.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50670393|title=Why India's new citizenship bill is controversial|date=2019-12-11|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> \n\nIn March 2020 visa-free travel granted to OCI holders were put on hold till 15 April due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/india-suspends-visas-attempt-coronavirus-spread-200312035057594.html|title=India suspends visas in attempt to contain coronavirus spread|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref>\n\n==Eligibility==\nThe Government of India, on application, may register any person as an Overseas Citizen of India, if the person:\n* was a citizen of India on 26 January 1950 or at any time thereafter; or\n* belonged to a territory that became part of India after 15 August 1947; or\n* was eligible to become a citizen of India on 26 January 1950; or\n* is a child or a grandchild or a great-grandchild of such a citizen; or\n* is a minor child of such persons mentioned above; or\n* is a minor child and whose both parents are citizens of India or one of the parents is a citizen of India; or \n* is a spouse of foreign origin of a citizen of India or spouse of foreign origin of an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder registered under section 7A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and whose marriage has been registered and subsisted for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the application\n\nNo person, who or either of whose parents or grandparents or great grandparents is or had been a citizen of Pakistan & bangladesh, is eligible for registration as an Overseas Citizen of India.<ref name=\"Eligibility criteria\">{{cite web|title=Eligibility criteria|url=http://mha1.nic.in/pdfs/oci-brochure.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs|accessdate=16 April 2016}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> Persons who served as a member of any foreign military are also ineligible to receive an OCI card.<ref>{{cite web |title=No OCI card to people with military background |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/no-oci-card-to-people-with-military-background/articleshow/55374143.cms |website=The Economic Times |accessdate=15 April 2019 |date=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Visa {{!}} India Visa Application {{!}} Faqs {{!}} Oci {{!}} General Oci Questions {{!}} Who Is Not Eligible To Apply For An Oci Card |url=https://www.in.ckgs.us/faq/oci/general-oci-questions/848/who-is-not-eligible-to-apply-for-an-oci-card#848 |website=www.in.ckgs.us |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Application==\nApplications for OCI can only be made online at [https://ociservices.gov.in/ ociservices.gov.in].

In 2009, the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs granted OCI card holders parity with NRIs for working as doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, advocates, architects, and chartered accountants. And the parity with NRIs was extended to entry fees for national monuments, historical sites, and museums. Further, in 2012, the privilege was added that Indian State governments should ensure that OCI registration booklets are treated as overseas citizens\u2019 identification and included a facilitated rule for providing proof of residence.<ref name=\"Daniel Naujoks 2013\">Daniel Naujoks. 2013.

It also omitted all provision recognizing, or relating to the commonwealth citizenship from the principle Act.\nLater, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005, expanded the scope of grant of OCI for PIOs of all countries except Pakistan as long as their home country allows dual citizenship under their local law in case it recognizes OCI as a second citizenship of India. The OCI is not actually a dual citizenship as the Indian constitution forbids dual nationality (Article 9).\n\nOn 9 January 2015, the Person of Indian Origin card scheme was withdrawn by the Government of India and was merged with the [[Overseas Citizen of India]] card scheme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiacgny.org/pages.php?id=937 |title=Website of Consulate General of India |accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref> All currently held PIO cards are treated as OCI cards.

They had to apply for a [[Protected area permit]].\n\n===Registration/Residential Permit===\nEarlier, PIO card holders needed to register with the appropriate FRRO (Foreigner Regional Registration Office) if they were planning to stay in India for more than 180 days.

This requirement was done away with that day and OCI card holders no longer require the visa sticker passport. The OCI card (the blue booklet) in conjunction with a current valid foreign passport is sufficient to travel to and from [[India]].\n\nPreviously, the government could cancel OCI status of people who obtained it by fraud, showed acts of unpatriotism, or broke a law punishable with at least two years in jail before five years of having issued OCI. The [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]] gives the government additional power to strip people of their Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status if they violate any local law, whether it is a petty offense or a serious felony. The new act makes the rules much more strict for OCI card holders in a justified attempt to preserve the status\u2019s dignity. However, it also has a proviso which gives the person whose OCI status is at stake the power of being heard by the government before they come to a verdict.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50670393|title=Why India's new citizenship bill is controversial|date=2019-12-11|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> \n\nIn March 2020 visa-free travel granted to OCI holders were put on hold till 15 April due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/india-suspends-visas-attempt-coronavirus-spread-200312035057594.html|title=India suspends visas in attempt to contain coronavirus spread|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref>\n\n==Eligibility==\nThe Government of India, on application, may register any person as an Overseas Citizen of India, if the person:\n* was a citizen of India on 26 January 1950 or at any time thereafter; or\n* belonged to a territory that became part of India after 15 August 1947; or\n* was eligible to become a citizen of India on 26 January 1950; or\n* is a child or a grandchild or a great-grandchild of such a citizen; or\n* is a minor child of such persons mentioned above; or\n* is a minor child and whose both parents are citizens of India or one of the parents is a citizen of India; or \n* is a spouse of foreign origin of a citizen of India or spouse of foreign origin of an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder registered under section 7A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and whose marriage has been registered and subsisted for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the application\n\nNo person, who or either of whose parents or grandparents or great grandparents is or had been a citizen of Pakistan, is eligible for registration as an Overseas Citizen of India.<ref name=\"Eligibility criteria\">{{cite web|title=Eligibility criteria|url=http://mha1.nic.in/pdfs/oci-brochure.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs|accessdate=16 April 2016}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> Persons who served as a member of any foreign military are also ineligible to receive an OCI card.<ref>{{cite web |title=No OCI card to people with military background |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/no-oci-card-to-people-with-military-background/articleshow/55374143.cms |website=The Economic Times |accessdate=15 April 2019 |date=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Visa {{!}} India Visa Application {{!}} Faqs {{!}} Oci {{!}} General Oci Questions {{!}} Who Is Not Eligible To Apply For An Oci Card |url=https://www.in.ckgs.us/faq/oci/general-oci-questions/848/who-is-not-eligible-to-apply-for-an-oci-card#848 |website=www.in.ckgs.us |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Application==\nApplications for OCI can only be made online at [https://ociservices.gov.in/ ociservices.gov.in].

Name\n! Location\n! Description\n|-\n| [[Anismus]]\n| muscles of the [[rectum]]\n| Causes painful defecation, [[constipation]]; may be complicated by [[encopresis]].\n|-\n| Cervical dystonia ([[spasmodic torticollis]])\n| muscles of the [[neck]]\n| Causes the head to rotate to one side, to pull down towards the chest, or back, or a combination of these postures.\n|-\n| [[Blepharospasm]]\n| muscles around the [[Human eyes|eyes]]\n| The sufferer experiences rapid blinking of the eyes or even their forced closure causing functional blindness.\n|-\n| [[Oculogyric crisis]]\n| muscles of eyes and head\n| An extreme and sustained (usually) upward deviation of the eyes often with convergence causing [[diplopia]] (double vision). It is frequently associated with backward and lateral flexion of the neck and either widely opened mouth or jaw clenching. Frequently a result of [[antiemetics]] such as the [[neuroleptics]] (e.g., [[prochlorperazine]]) or [[metoclopramide]]. Can be caused by [[Chlorpromazine]].\n|-\n| [[Oromandibular dystonia]]\n| muscles of the jaw and [[muscles of tongue]]\n| Causes distortions of the mouth and tongue.\n|-\n| [[Spasmodic dysphonia]]/Laryngeal dystonia\n| [[muscles of larynx]]\n| Causes the voice to sound broken, become hoarse, sometimes reducing it to a whisper.\n|-\n| Focal hand dystonia (also known as musician's or [[writer's cramp]]).\n| single muscle or small group of muscles in the hand\n| It interferes with activities such as writing or playing a musical instrument by causing involuntary muscular contractions. The condition is sometimes \"task-specific,\" meaning that it is generally apparent during only certain activities. Focal hand dystonia is neurological in origin and is not due to normal fatigue.

Significant muscle pain and cramping may result from very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become difficult to find a comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to [[restless leg syndrome]]. Affected persons may notice trembling in the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth, or symptoms similar to [[temporomandibular joint disorder]]. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nElectrical sensors (EMG) inserted into affected muscle groups, while painful, can provide a definitive diagnosis by showing pulsating nerve signals being transmitted to the muscles even when they are at rest. The brain appears to signal portions of fibers within the affected muscle groups at a firing speed of about 10&nbsp;Hz causing them to pulsate, tremble and contort. When called upon to perform an intentional activity, the muscles fatigue very quickly and some portions of the muscle groups do not respond (causing weakness) while other portions over-respond or become rigid (causing micro-tears under load). The symptoms worsen significantly with use, especially in the case of focal dystonia, and a \"mirror effect\" is often observed in other body parts: Use of the right hand may cause pain and cramping in that hand as well as in the other hand and legs that were not being used. Stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, sustained use and cold temperatures can worsen symptoms.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nDirect symptoms may be accompanied by secondary effects of the continuous muscle and brain activity, including disturbed sleep patterns, exhaustion, mood swings, mental stress, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, digestive problems, and short temper. People with dystonia may also become depressed and find great difficulty adapting their activities and livelihood to a progressing disability. Side-effects from treatment and medications can also present challenges in normal activities.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nIn some cases, symptoms may progress and then plateau for years, or stop progressing entirely. The progression may be delayed by treatment or adaptive lifestyle changes, while forced continued use may make symptoms progress more rapidly. In others, the symptoms may progress to total disability, making some of the more risky forms of treatment worth considering. In some cases with patients who already have dystonia, a subsequent traumatic injury or the effects of general anethesia during an unrelated surgery can cause the symptoms to progress rapidly.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAn accurate diagnosis may be difficult because of the way the disorder manifests itself. Sufferers may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including [[Parkinson's disease]], [[essential tremor]], [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[Temporomandibular joint disorder|TMD]], [[Tourette's syndrome]], [[conversion disorder]] or other neuromuscular movement disorders.

It has been suggested that the cerebellum plays an important role in dystonia etiology, from neuroanatomical research of complex networks showing that the cerebellum is connected to a wide range of other central nervous system structures involved in movement control to animal models indicating that signs of dystonia are due to cerebellum dysfunction and completely disappear after cerebellectomy, and finally to clinical observations in secondary dystonia patients with various types of cerebellar lesions. It is proposed that dystonia is a large-scale dysfunction, involving not only cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways, but the cortico-ponto-cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop as well. Even in the absence of traditional \"cerebellar signs\" in most dystonia patients, there are more subtle indications of cerebellar dysfunction. It is clear that as long as the cerebellum's role in dystonia genesis remains unexamined, it will be difficult to significantly improve the current standards of dystonia treatment or to provide curative treatment.\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2013.01.003 |pmid=23422326 |title=Dystonia and the cerebellum: A new field of interest in movement disorders? |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=124 |issue=7 |pages=1269\u201376 |year=2013 |last1=Filip |first1=Pavel |last2=Lungu |first2=Ovidiu V. |last3=Bare\u0161 |first3=Martin }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nReducing the types of movements that trigger or worsen dystonic symptoms provides some relief, as does reducing stress, getting plenty of rest, moderate exercise, and relaxation techniques.{{citation needed|reason=scientific claim|date=December 2013}} Various treatments focus on sedating brain functions or blocking nerve communications with the muscles via drugs, neuro-suppression, or denervation.{{citation needed|reason=scientific claim|date=December 2013}} All current treatments have negative side-effects and risks.\nA ''geste antagoniste'' is a physical gesture or position (such as touching one's [[chin]]) that temporarily interrupts dystonia, it is also known as a ''sensory trick''.<ref name=\"WattsKoller2004\">{{cite book|author1=Ray Lannom Watts|author2=William C.

A report from the British Civil Service also contained an early description of writer\u2019s cramp. In 1864, Solly coined the term \"scrivener\u2019s palsy\" for this affliction. These historical reports usually attributed the etiology of the motor abnormalities to overuse. Then, dystonia were reported in detail in 1911, when [[Hermann Oppenheim]],<ref name=Tarsy>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMra055549 |pmid=16928997 |title=Dystonia |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=355 |issue=8 |pages=818\u201329 |year=2006 |last1=Tarsy |first1=Daniel |last2=Simon |first2=David K. }}</ref> [[Edward Flatau]] and Wladyslaw Sterling described some Jewish children affected by a syndrome that was retrospectively considered to represent familial cases of DYT1 dystonia. Some decades later, in 1975, the first international conference on dystonia was held in New York. It was then recognized that, in addition to severe generalized forms, the dystonia phenotype also encompasses poorly-progressive focal and segmental cases with onset in adulthood, such as blepharospasm, torticollis and writer\u2019s cramp.\nThese forms were previously considered independent disorders and were mainly classified among neuroses. A modern definition of dystonia was worded some years later, in 1984. During the following years it became evident that dystonia syndromes are numerous and diversified, new terminological descriptors (e.g., dystonia plus, heredodegenerative dystonias, etc.) and additional classification schemes were introduced. The clinical complexity of dystonia was then fully recognized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movementdisorders.org/MDS/News/Online-Web-Edition/Archived-Editions/A-History-of-Dystonia.htm |title=A History of Dystonia |accessdate=6 January 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101754/http://www.movementdisorders.org/MDS/News/Online-Web-Edition/Archived-Editions/A-History-of-Dystonia.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Extrapyramidal symptoms]]\n* [[Hypertonia]]\n* [[Sydenham's chorea]]\n* [[Ulegyria]] (brain condition with dystonia symptoms)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 17912\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|G|24|9|g|20}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|333}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 128100\n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = D004421\n| GeneReviewsNBK  = NBK1155\n| GeneReviewsName = Dystonia Overview\n| oMIM_mult       = {{OMIM2|224500}} {{OMIM2|314250}} {{OMIM2|128101}} {{OMIM2|128230}} {{OMIM2|602629}} {{OMIM2|602124}} {{OMIM2|118800}} {{OMIM2|601042}} {{OMIM2|128200}} {{OMIM2|159900}} {{OMIM2|128235}} {{OMIM2|607671}} {{OMIM2|607488}} {{OMIM2|612067}} {{OMIM2|612406}} {{OMIM2|612126}} {{OMIM2|611031}} {{OMIM2|611147}}\n| geneReviewsNBK2 = NBK1492\n| geneReviewsName2= Early-Onset Primary Dystonia (DYT1)\n| ICD10CM         = {{ICD10CM|G24}}\n| SNOMED CT       = 250068003\n}}\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-boston-marathon-record-is-about-to-be-set--by-a-man-with-a-movement-disorder/2017/04/07/57523230-18a2-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html A Boston Marathon record is about to be set \u2013 by a man with a movement disorder] in [[The Washington Post]]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1155/ GeneReview/NIH/UW entry on Dystonia Overview]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1492/ GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Early-Onset Primary Dystonia]\n* [https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/twisted/film.html Film on Dystonia] from [[Public Broadcasting Service]]\n* [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19265007 A story of one woman's struggle with dystonia] at MSNBC.com\n* [http://www.care4dystonia.org/ Care4Dystonia] Newsletters, Library and Education Forum on Dystonia\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115103914/http://www.emsvillage.com/articles/article.cfm?id=1137 Down on the Pharm': All About Acute Dystonic Reaction]\n* [https://dystonia-europe.org/ The European Dystonia Association with information, links and support]\n\n{{Diseases of the nervous system}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dystonia| ]]\n[[Category:Extrapyramidal and movement disorders]]\n[[Category:Adverse effects of psychoactive drugs]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Neurological movement disorder}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Dystonia\n| image           = Dystonia2010.JPG\n| caption         = A person with medication-induced dystonia\n| field           = [[Neurology]]\n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Dystonia''' is a [[neurology|neurological]] [[Movement disorders|movement disorder]] syndrome in which sustained or repetitive muscle contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal fixed postures.<ref name=\"NINDS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Dystonias-Fact-Sheet|title=Dystonias Fact Sheet - National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423024443/https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Dystonias-Fact-Sheet|archivedate=23 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The movements may resemble a [[tremor]].

Significant muscle pain and cramping may result from very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become difficult to find a comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to [[restless leg syndrome]]. Affected persons may notice trembling in the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth, or symptoms similar to [[temporomandibular joint disorder]]. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nElectrical sensors (EMG) inserted into affected muscle groups, while painful, can provide a definitive diagnosis by showing pulsating nerve signals being transmitted to the muscles even when they are at rest. The brain appears to signal portions of fibers within the affected muscle groups at a firing speed of about 10&nbsp;Hz causing them to pulsate, tremble and contort. When called upon to perform an intentional activity, the muscles fatigue very quickly and some portions of the muscle groups do not respond (causing weakness) while other portions over-respond or become rigid (causing micro-tears under load). The symptoms worsen significantly with use, especially in the case of focal dystonia, and a \"mirror effect\" is often observed in other body parts: Use of the right hand may cause pain and cramping in that hand as well as in the other hand and legs that were not being used. Stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, sustained use and cold temperatures can worsen symptoms.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nDirect symptoms may be accompanied by secondary effects of the continuous muscle and brain activity, including disturbed sleep patterns, exhaustion, mood swings, mental stress, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, digestive problems, and short temper. People with dystonia may also become depressed and find great difficulty adapting their activities and livelihood to a progressing disability. Side-effects from treatment and medications can also present challenges in normal activities.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nIn some cases, symptoms may progress and then plateau for years, or stop progressing entirely. The progression may be delayed by treatment or adaptive lifestyle changes, while forced continued use may make symptoms progress more rapidly. In others, the symptoms may progress to total disability, making some of the more risky forms of treatment worth considering. In some cases with patients who already have dystonia, a subsequent traumatic injury or the effects of general anethesia during an unrelated surgery can cause the symptoms to progress rapidly.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAn accurate diagnosis may be difficult because of the way the disorder manifests itself. Sufferers may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including [[Parkinson's disease]], [[essential tremor]], [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[Temporomandibular joint disorder|TMD]], [[Tourette's syndrome]], [[conversion disorder]] or other neuromuscular movement disorders.

It has been suggested that the cerebellum plays an important role in dystonia etiology, from neuroanatomical research of complex networks showing that the cerebellum is connected to a wide range of other central nervous system structures involved in movement control to animal models indicating that signs of dystonia are due to cerebellum dysfunction and completely disappear after cerebellectomy, and finally to clinical observations in secondary dystonia patients with various types of cerebellar lesions. It is proposed that dystonia is a large-scale dysfunction, involving not only cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways, but the cortico-ponto-cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop as well. Even in the absence of traditional \"cerebellar signs\" in most dystonia patients, there are more subtle indications of cerebellar dysfunction. It is clear that as long as the cerebellum's role in dystonia genesis remains unexamined, it will be difficult to significantly improve the current standards of dystonia treatment or to provide curative treatment.\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2013.01.003 |pmid=23422326 |title=Dystonia and the cerebellum: A new field of interest in movement disorders? |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=124 |issue=7 |pages=1269\u201376 |year=2013 |last1=Filip |first1=Pavel |last2=Lungu |first2=Ovidiu V. |last3=Bare\u0161 |first3=Martin }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nReducing the types of movements that trigger or worsen dystonic symptoms provides some relief, as does reducing stress, getting plenty of rest, moderate exercise, and relaxation techniques.{{citation needed|reason=scientific claim|date=December 2013}} Various treatments focus on sedating brain functions or blocking nerve communications with the muscles via drugs, neuro-suppression, or denervation.{{citation needed|reason=scientific claim|date=December 2013}} All current treatments have negative side-effects and risks.\nA ''geste antagoniste'' is a physical gesture or position (such as touching one's [[chin]]) that temporarily interrupts dystonia, it is also known as a ''sensory trick''.<ref name=\"WattsKoller2004\">{{cite book|author1=Ray Lannom Watts|author2=William C.

An occupational therapist (OT) may perform needed upper extremity splinting, provide movement inhibitory techniques, train fine motor coordination, provide an assistive device, or teach alternative methods of activity performance to achieve a patient's goals for bathing, dressing, toileting, and other valued activities.\n\nRecent research has investigated further into the role of physiotherapy in the treatment of dystonia. A recent study showed that reducing psychological stress, in conjunction with exercise, is beneficial for reducing truncal dystonia in patients with [[Parkinson\u2019s Disease]].<ref name=Kawamichi /> Another study emphasized progressive relaxation, isometric muscle endurance, dynamic strength, coordination, balance, and body perception, seeing significant improvements to patients' quality of life after 4 weeks.<ref name=Zetterberg>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09593980701884816 |pmid=18574753 |title=Physiotherapy in cervical dystonia: Six experimental single-case studies |journal=Physiotherapy Theory and Practice |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=275\u201390 |year=2009 |last1=Zetterberg |first1=Lena |last2=Halvorsen |first2=Kjartan |last3=F\u00e4rnstrand |first3=Catarina |last4=Aquilonius |first4=Sten-Magnus |last5=Lindmark |first5=Birgitta }}</ref>\n\nSince the root of the problem is neurological, doctors have explored sensorimotor retraining activities to enable the brain to \"rewire\" itself and eliminate dystonic movements. The work of several doctors such as Nancy Byl and Joaquin Farias has shown that sensorimotor retraining activities and proprioceptive stimulation can induce [[neuroplasticity]], making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost due to Cervical Dystonia, hand dystonia, blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, dysphonia and musicians' dystonia.<ref>TEDx Talk.

There is a risk of temporary paralysis of the muscles being injected or the leaking of the toxin into adjacent muscle groups, causing weakness or paralysis in them. The injections must be repeated, as the effects wear off and around 15% of recipients develop immunity to the toxin.

A report from the British Civil Service also contained an early description of writer\u2019s cramp. In 1864, Solly coined the term \"scrivener\u2019s palsy\" for this affliction. These historical reports usually attributed the etiology of the motor abnormalities to overuse. Then, dystonia were reported in detail in 1911, when [[Hermann Oppenheim]],<ref name=Tarsy>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMra055549 |pmid=16928997 |title=Dystonia |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=355 |issue=8 |pages=818\u201329 |year=2006 |last1=Tarsy |first1=Daniel |last2=Simon |first2=David K. }}</ref> [[Edward Flatau]] and Wladyslaw Sterling described some Jewish children affected by a syndrome that was retrospectively considered to represent familial cases of DYT1 dystonia. Some decades later, in 1975, the first international conference on dystonia was held in New York. It was then recognized that, in addition to severe generalized forms, the dystonia phenotype also encompasses poorly-progressive focal and segmental cases with onset in adulthood, such as blepharospasm, torticollis and writer\u2019s cramp.\nThese forms were previously considered independent disorders and were mainly classified among neuroses. A modern definition of dystonia was worded some years later, in 1984. During the following years it became evident that dystonia syndromes are numerous and diversified, new terminological descriptors (e.g., dystonia plus, heredodegenerative dystonias, etc.) and additional classification schemes were introduced. The clinical complexity of dystonia was then fully recognized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movementdisorders.org/MDS/News/Online-Web-Edition/Archived-Editions/A-History-of-Dystonia.htm |title=A History of Dystonia |accessdate=6 January 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101754/http://www.movementdisorders.org/MDS/News/Online-Web-Edition/Archived-Editions/A-History-of-Dystonia.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Extrapyramidal symptoms]]\n* [[Hypertonia]]\n* [[Sydenham's chorea]]\n* [[Ulegyria]] (brain condition with dystonia symptoms)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB      = 17912 \n|  ICD10           = {{ICD10|G|24|9|g|20}} \n|  ICD9            = {{ICD9|333}} \n|  ICDO            = \n|  OMIM            = 128100 \n|  MedlinePlus     = \n|  eMedicineSubj   = \n|  eMedicineTopic  = \n|  MeshID          = D004421 \n|  GeneReviewsNBK  = NBK1155 \n|  GeneReviewsName = Dystonia Overview \n| oMIM_mult       = {{OMIM2|224500}} {{OMIM2|314250}} {{OMIM2|128101}} {{OMIM2|128230}} {{OMIM2|602629}} {{OMIM2|602124}} {{OMIM2|118800}} {{OMIM2|601042}} {{OMIM2|128200}} {{OMIM2|159900}} {{OMIM2|128235}} {{OMIM2|607671}} {{OMIM2|607488}} {{OMIM2|612067}} {{OMIM2|612406}} {{OMIM2|612126}} {{OMIM2|611031}} {{OMIM2|611147}}\n| geneReviewsNBK2 = NBK1492\n| geneReviewsName2= Early-Onset Primary Dystonia (DYT1)\n}}\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-boston-marathon-record-is-about-to-be-set--by-a-man-with-a-movement-disorder/2017/04/07/57523230-18a2-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html A Boston Marathon record is about to be set \u2013 by a man with a movement disorder] in [[The Washington Post]]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1155/ GeneReview/NIH/UW entry on Dystonia Overview]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1492/ GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Early-Onset Primary Dystonia]\n* [https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/twisted/film.html Film on Dystonia] from [[Public Broadcasting Service]]\n* [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19265007 A story of one woman's struggle with dystonia] at MSNBC.com\n* [http://www.care4dystonia.org/ Care4Dystonia] Newsletters, Library and Education Forum on Dystonia\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115103914/http://www.emsvillage.com/articles/article.cfm?id=1137 Down on the Pharm': All About Acute Dystonic Reaction]\n* [https://dystonia-europe.org/ The European Dystonia Association with information, links and support]\n\n{{Diseases of the nervous system}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dystonia| ]]\n[[Category:Extrapyramidal and movement disorders]]\n[[Category:Adverse effects of psychoactive drugs]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystonia"}

Pituitary adenomas are generally divided into three categories dependent upon their biological functioning: benign adenoma, invasive adenoma, and [[carcinomas]]. Most adenomas are benign, approximately 35% are invasive and just 0.1% to 0.2% are carcinomas.<ref name=nih-nci>[http://www.cancer.gov/types/pituitary/hp/pituitary-treatment-pdq Pituitary Tumors Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Health Professional Version] NIH National Cancer Institute</ref> Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial [[neoplasia|neoplasms]] and the estimated [[prevalence|prevalence rate]] in the general population is approximately 17%.<ref name=nih-nci /><ref name=\"pmid15274075\" />\n\nNon-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be [[Benign tumors|benign]] in the literal as well as the clinical sense; however a recent [[meta-analysis]] (Fern\u00e1ndez-Balsells, ''et al.'' 2011) of available research has shown there are to date scant studies \u2013 of poor quality \u2013 to either support or refute this assumption.\n\nAdenomas exceeding {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} in size are defined as ''macroadenomas'', with those smaller than {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} referred to as ''microadenomas''. Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas and have an estimated prevalence of 16.7% (14.4% in [[autopsy]] studies and 22.5% in [[Medical imaging|radiologic]] studies).<ref name=\"pmid15274075\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ezzat S, Asa SL, Couldwell WT, Barr CE, Dodge WE, Vance ML, McCutcheon IE | title = The prevalence of pituitary adenomas: a systematic review | journal = Cancer | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 613\u20139 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15274075 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.20412 | authorlink3 = William T.

The specifics depend on the type of hormone. Some tumors secrete more than one hormone, the most common combination{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} being [[growth hormone|GH]] and [[prolactin]], which present as [[Acromegaly|unexpected bone growth]] and unexpected [[lactation]] (in both men and women).\n\nA patient with pituitary adenoma may present with [[visual field]] defects, classically [[bitemporal hemianopsia]]. It arises from the compression of the [[optic nerve]] by the tumor. The specific area of the visual pathway at which compression by these tumours occurs is at the [[optic chiasma]].\n\nThe anatomy of this structure causes pressure on it to produce a defect in the temporal visual field on both sides, a condition called [[bitemporal hemianopsia]]. If originating superior to the [[optic chiasm]], more commonly in a [[craniopharyngioma]] of the [[pituitary stalk]], the visual field defect will first appear as [[Quadrantanopia|bitemporal inferior quadrantanopia]], if originating inferior to the [[optic chiasm]] the visual field defect will first appear as [[Quadrantanopia|bitemporal superior quadrantanopia]].

It is separated from the [[subarachnoid space]] by the [[diaphragma sella]], therefore the [[arachnoid mater]] and thus [[cerebral spinal fluid]] cannot enter the sella turcica.\n\nThe pituitary gland is divided into two lobes, the anterior lobe (which accounts for two thirds of the volume of the gland), and the posterior lobe (one third of the volume) separated by the [[pars intermedia]].\n\nThe [[Posterior pituitary|posterior lobe]] (the neural lobe or neurohypophysis) of the pituitary gland is not, despite its name, a true [[gland]]. The posterior lobe contains [[axons]] of [[neurons]] that extend from the [[hypothalamus]] to which it is connected via the pituitary stalk. The hormones [[vasopressin]] and [[oxytocin]], produced by the neurons of the [[Supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic]] and [[paraventricular nuclei]] of the hypothalamus, are stored in the posterior lobe and released from axon endings ([[dendrites]]) within the lobe.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nussey |first1=S.S |last2=S.A. |title=Endocrinology: An Integrated Approach |location=Oxford |publisher=BIOS Scientific Publishers |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-203-45043-7}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe pituitary gland's [[Anterior pituitary|anterior lobe]] (adenohypophysis) is a true gland which produces and secretes six different hormones: [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH), [[growth hormone]] (GH), and [[prolactin]] (PRL).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao Y, Mailloux CM, Hermesz E, Palk\u00f3vits M, Westphal H | title = A role of the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx2 in the regulation of pituitary development | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 337 | issue = 2 | pages = 313\u201323 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19900438 | pmc = 2832476 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.11.002 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis of pituitary adenoma can be made, or at least suspected, by a constellation of related symptoms presented above.\n\nTumors which cause visual difficulty are likely to be a ''macroadenoma'' greater than 10&nbsp;mm in diameter; tumors less than 10&nbsp;mm are ''microadenoma''.\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes pituitary tuberculoma, especially in developing countries and in immumocompromised patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saini KS, Patel AL, Shaikh WA, Magar LN, Pungaonkar SA | title = Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in pituitary tuberculoma | journal = Singapore Medical Journal | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 783\u20136 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17657390 | url = http://smj.sma.org.sg/4808/4808cr10.pdf }}</ref> The diagnosis is confirmed by testing hormone levels, and by radiographic imaging of the pituitary (for example, by [[CT scan]] or [[MRI]]).\n<gallery>\nImage:Nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (1).jpg\nImage:Pituitary adenoma (1) GH production.jpg\nImage:Pituitary adenoma (2) GH production.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Classification===\nUnlike tumors of the posterior Pituitary, Pituitary adenomas are classified as endocrine tumors (not brain tumors).

The pituitary gland is located below the brain in a depression ([[Fossa (anatomy)|fossa]]) of the [[sphenoid bone]] known as the [[sella turcica]]. Although anatomically and functionally connected to the brain, the pituitary gland<ref>Dhruve</ref> sits outside the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]].
