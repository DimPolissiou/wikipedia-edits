In this sense, communism involves the \"negation of property\" insofar as there would be little economic rationale for exclusive control over production assets in an environment of material abundance.<ref name=\"Clark1998\"/>\n\nThe fully developed communist economic system is postulated to develop from a preceding socialist system. Marx held the view that socialism\u2014a system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production\u2014would enable progress toward the development of fully developed communism by further advancing productive technology.

A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one's life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the \"realm of necessity\" to the \"realm of freedom.\" As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its [[creativity|creative]] hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner.

According to the 1986 Programme of the CPSU:\n{{quote|Communism is a classless social system with one form of public ownership of the means of production and with full social equality of all members of society. Under communism, the all-round development of people will be accompanied by the growth of the productive forces on the basis of continuous progress in science and technology, all the springs of social wealth will flow abundantly, and the great principle \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\" will be implemented. Communism is a highly organised society of free, socially conscious working people a society in which public self-government will be established, a society in which labour for the good of society will become the prime vital requirement of everyone, a clearly recognised necessity, and the ability of each person will be employed to the greatest benefit of the people.\n\nThe material and technical foundation of communism presupposes the creation of those productive forces that open up opportunities for the full satisfaction of the reasonable requirements of society and the individual. All productive activities under communism will be based on the use of highly efficient technical facilities and technologies, and the harmonious interaction of man and nature will be ensured.\n\nIn the highest phase of communism the directly social character of labor and production will become firmly established. Through the complete elimination of the remnants of the old division of labor and the essential social differences associated with it, the process of forming a socially homogeneous society will be completed.\n\nCommunism signifies the transformation of the system of socialist self-government by the people, of socialist democracy into the highest form of organization of society: communist public self-government. With the maturation of the necessary socioeconomic and ideological preconditions and the involvement of all citizens in administration, the socialist state\u2014given appropriate international conditions\u2014will, as Lenin noted, increasingly become a transitional form \"from a state to a non-state.\" The activities of state bodies will become non-political in nature, and the need for the state as a special political institution will gradually disappear.\n\nThe inalienable feature of the communist mode of life is a high level of consciousness, social activity, discipline, and self-discipline of members of society, in which observance of the uniform, generally accepted rules of communist conduct will become an inner need and habit of every person.\n\nCommunism is a social system under which the free development of each is a condition for the free development of all.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eurodos.home.xs4all.nl/docu/cpsu-texts/cpsu86-21.htm#CPSUTasks |title=The CPSU's Tasks In Perfecting Socialism And Making A Gradual Transition To Communism |work=Program of the CPSU, 27th Congress, 1986 \u2013 Part Two|author= |date=1998 |publisher=Eurodos |accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nIn [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s political theory, a classless society would be a society controlled by the direct producers, organized to produce according to socially managed goals.

Marx held the view that socialism\u2014a system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production\u2014would enable progress toward the development of fully developed communism by further advancing productive technology.

A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one's life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the \"realm of necessity\" to the \"realm of freedom.\" As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its [[creativity|creative]] hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner.

According to the 1986 Programme of the CPSU:\n{{quote|Communism is a classless social system with one form of public ownership of the means of production and with full social equality of all members of society. Under communism, the all-round development of people will be accompanied by the growth of the productive forces on the basis of continuous progress in science and technology, all the springs of social wealth will flow abundantly, and the great principle \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\" will be implemented. Communism is a highly organised society of free, socially conscious working people a society in which public self-government will be established, a society in which labour for the good of society will become the prime vital requirement of everyone, a clearly recognised necessity, and the ability of each person will be employed to the greatest benefit of the people.\n\nThe material and technical foundation of communism presupposes the creation of those productive forces that open up opportunities for the full satisfaction of the reasonable requirements of society and the individual. All productive activities under communism will be based on the use of highly efficient technical facilities and technologies, and the harmonious interaction of man and nature will be ensured.\n\nIn the highest phase of communism the directly social character of labor and production will become firmly established. Through the complete elimination of the remnants of the old division of labor and the essential social differences associated with it, the process of forming a socially homogeneous society will be completed.\n\nCommunism signifies the transformation of the system of socialist self-government by the people, of socialist democracy into the highest form of organization of society: communist public self-government. With the maturation of the necessary socioeconomic and ideological preconditions and the involvement of all citizens in administration, the socialist state\u2014given appropriate international conditions\u2014will, as Lenin noted, increasingly become a transitional form \"from a state to a non-state.\" The activities of state bodies will become non-political in nature, and the need for the state as a special political institution will gradually disappear.\n\nThe inalienable feature of the communist mode of life is a high level of consciousness, social activity, discipline, and self-discipline of members of society, in which observance of the uniform, generally accepted rules of communist conduct will become an inner need and habit of every person.\n\nCommunism is a social system under which the free development of each is a condition for the free development of all.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eurodos.home.xs4all.nl/docu/cpsu-texts/cpsu86-21.htm#CPSUTasks |title=The CPSU's Tasks In Perfecting Socialism And Making A Gradual Transition To Communism |work=Program of the CPSU, 27th Congress, 1986 \u2013 Part Two|author= |date=1998 |publisher=Eurodos |accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nIn [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s political theory, a classless society would be a society controlled by the direct producers, organized to produce according to socially managed goals.

[[F. F. Bruce]] said that the \"conflict of evidence suggests that Mr. Fromow is fairly near the mark in using the epithet 'unattached.'\"</ref> \nHe was the son of Samuel Tregelles (1789\u20131828) and his wife Dorothy (1790\u20131873) and was the nephew of [[Edwin Octavius Tregelles]]. He was educated at Falmouth classical school from 1825 to 1828.\n\nFor a time Tregelles worked at the ironworks, [[Neath Abbey]], [[Glamorgan]], where he devoted his spare time to learning Greek, Hebrew, [[Aramaic]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. His interest in Welsh developed from a desire to spread the Christian gospel and especially to combat the influence of [[atheism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Mormonism]] in Wales.<ref>Tregelles was especially distressed at the spread of Mormonism and in 1854 wrote to his evangelical friend [[Eben Fardd]], \"while Mormonism and other things are spreading themselves in Wales, it is well for some effort to be made to uphold the simple historical authority of the Scriptures which God has been pleased to give us as the sure record of His holy will.\" Quoted in Fromow, 33.</ref> Tregelles became a private tutor in Falmouth, and finally devoted himself to scholarship until incapacitated by paralysis in 1870.\n\nIn April 1839, Tregelles married Sarah Anna Prideaux (born 22 September 1807), a daughter of the Plymouth banker and Quaker Walter Prideaux, whose bank ''Hingston & Prideaux'' later became the ''[[Devon and Cornwall Bank]]''.<ref>Stunt, Timothy C.

Tregelles received an LL.D. degree from [[University of St Andrews|St. Andrews]] in 1850 and a pension of \u00a3200 from the [[civil list]] in 1862. He died at [[Plymouth]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== Works ==\nDeciding that the [[Textus Receptus]] did not rest on ancient authority, Tregelles decided to publish a new version of the Greek text of the New Testament based on ancient manuscripts and the citations of the early church fathers, his work paralleling that of German philologist and textual critic, [[Karl Lachmann]]. Tregelles first became generally known through his ''Book of Revelation in Greek Edited from Ancient Authorities'' (1844), which contained the announcement of his intention to prepare the new Greek New Testament. In 1845 he went to Rome intending to collate the codex belonging to the Vatican. Although he was not allowed to copy the manuscript, he did note important readings.<ref>S. P.

[[F. F. Bruce]] said that the \"conflict of evidence suggests that Mr. Fromow is fairly near the mark in using the epithet 'unattached.'\"</ref> \nHe was the son of Samuel Tregelles (1789\u20131828) and his wife Dorothy (1790\u20131873) and was the nephew of [[Edwin Octavius Tregelles]]. He was educated at Falmouth classical school from 1825 to 1828.\n\nFor a time Tregelles worked at the ironworks, [[Neath Abbey]], [[Glamorgan]], where he devoted his spare time to learning Greek, Hebrew, [[Aramaic]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. His interest in Welsh developed from a desire to spread the Christian gospel and especially to combat the influence of [[atheism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Mormonism]] in Wales.<ref>Tregelles was especially distressed at the spread of Mormonism and in 1854 wrote to his evangelical friend [[Eben Fardd]], \"while Mormonism and other things are spreading themselves in Wales, it is well for some effort to be made to uphold the simple historical authority of the Scriptures which God has been pleased to give us as the sure record of His holy will.\" Quoted in Fromow, 33.</ref> Tregelles became a private tutor in Falmouth, and finally devoted himself to scholarship until incapacitated by paralysis in 1870.\n\nIn April 1839, Tregelles married Sarah Anna Prideaux (born 22 September 1807), a daughter of the Plymouth banker and Quaker Walter Prideaux, whose bank ''Hingston & Prideaux'' later became the ''[[Devon and Cornwall Bank]]''.<ref>Stunt, Timothy C.

He died at [[Plymouth]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== Works ==\nDeciding that the [[Textus Receptus]] did not rest on ancient authority, Tregelles decided to publish a new version of the Greek text of the New Testament based on ancient manuscripts and the citations of the early church fathers, his work paralleling that of German philologist and textual critic, [[Karl Lachmann]]. Tregelles first became generally known through his ''Book of Revelation in Greek Edited from Ancient Authorities'' (1844), which contained the announcement of his intention to prepare the new Greek New Testament. In 1845 he went to Rome intending to collate the codex belonging to the Vatican. Although he was not allowed to copy the manuscript, he did note important readings.<ref>S. P.

The first season received the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography]] among four nominations. The series was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy and a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Song Written for Visual Media (\"[[Let Me Be Your Star]]\").\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Smash episodes}}\n{{:List of Smash episodes}}\nThe show revolves around a group of characters creating new [[Broadway musical]]s, where everyone must balance their often chaotic personal life with the all-consuming demands of life in the theater. The series features original music by composers [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]].\n\n===Season 1 (2012)===\n{{main|Smash (season 1)}}\nJulia Houston ([[Debra Messing]]) and Tom Levitt ([[Christian Borle]]), a Broadway writing team, came up with the idea of a new musical based on the life of [[Marilyn Monroe]] titled ''[[Bombshell (musical)|Bombshell]]''. Producer Eileen Rand ([[Anjelica Huston]]), in the midst of divorce proceedings from her philandering husband, jumps on board and brings with her Derek Wills ([[Jack Davenport]]), a difficult but brilliant director. Ivy Lynn ([[Megan Hilty]]) is initially cast as Marilyn, but is forced to deal with competition from the talented, yet naive ensemble member Karen Cartwright ([[Katharine McPhee]]). Julia's former lover Michael Swift ([[Will Chase]]) is initially cast in the role of [[Joe DiMaggio]]. However, when Julia and Michael's reunion causes serious trouble in her marriage to Frank ([[Brian d'Arcy James]]), the decision is made to fire Michael. The role of Marilyn is recast with film star Rebecca Duvall ([[Uma Thurman]]), leaving Ivy devastated. After a somewhat disastrous out-of-town opening in Boston, Rebecca has fallen sick due to a peanut allergy and the actor playing Joe departs the production for a better gig. Derek subsequently casts Karen in the role of Marilyn and Michael is reinstated as Joe. Karen discovers Ivy has slept with her fianc\u00e9 Dev ([[Raza Jaffrey]]), while Eileen finds out that her assistant Ellis (Jaime Cepero) was the one who poisoned Rebecca and fires him. Karen gets through her debut and the season ends with the closing number being applauded by the audience.\n\n===Season 2 (2013)===\n{{main|Smash (season 2)}}\nAs ''[[Bombshell (musical)|Bombshell]]'' works to open on Broadway in New York City, the show runs into legal and creative troubles which threaten its future.  Meanwhile, the cast and crew (featured in Season 1) attempt to find work. Karen meets two aspiring friends and partners (Kyle, a stage writer played by Andy Mientus, and Jimmy, a composer played by [[Jeremy Jordan (actor, born 1984)|Jeremy Jordan]]) and tries to get their work noticed, especially by Derek. Derek works with Broadway star Veronica Moore ([[Jennifer Hudson]]), who becomes friends with Karen. Ivy gets the lead in ''Liaisons'', a show based on the play ''[[Les liaisons dangereuses (play)|Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]''. ''[[Bombshell (musical)|Bombshell]]'' needs work in order to open on Broadway. First, Peter Gillman ([[Daniel Sunjata]]), a [[dramaturg]] with whom Julia had a rocky relationship is hired in order to help re-write the show. Second, Jerry ([[Michael Cristofer]]) replaces Eileen as the show's producer after she had to step down when the federal authorities found out (through Jerry's orchestration) that she had financed ''Bombshell'' with illegal money. Jimmy and Kyle's show, called ''[[Hit List (musical)|Hit List]]'', eventually goes to the New York Fringe Festival and then they meet a producer for an off-broadway theater called Manhattan Theatre Workshop. Karen quits ''Bombshell'' to be in ''Hit List'' because she has to choose one of them. Ivy takes Karen's role as Marilyn Monroe in ''Bombshell''. ''Hit List'' starts rehearsals. Karen and Jimmy's relationship starts to develop but may cause some disturbance in the work place with Derek's secret feelings for Karen. ''Hit List'' goes to Broadway produced by Jerry and ''Bombshell'' and ''Hit List'' go face to face at the [[Tony Awards]]. ''Hit List'' wins 7 Tonys, which is more than ''Bombshell'', however ''Bombshell'' wins Best Musical and Best Actress (Ivy Lynn) in a Leading Role.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|Characters of Smash}}\n* [[Debra Messing]] as Julia Houston,<ref name=\"smashbios\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/networks/nbcentertainment/smash/biographies |title=Smash Biographies |publisher=NBCUniversal Media Village |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205003041/http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/networks/nbcentertainment/smash/biographies |archivedate=February 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> a successful Broadway lyricist and the musical's co-writer.

Rebeck was a large part of that. As one early hire later described her to ''[[BuzzFeed]]'': \"She was this kick-ass woman [[showrunner]] who wasn't taking shit from the network. Someone who had a very clear vision who was going to stand up to the network. They were all good things in the beginning.\"<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nDespite her experience writing and producing in television, Rebeck had never been a showrunner, responsible for the day-to-day operations of a series, before. [[David Marshall Grant]], a [[playwright]] and actor who had served in that capacity during ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''' final seasons, was hired as [[executive producer]] to help her with it. Rebeck was reportedly resentful, and worried that she was being [[setting up to fail|set up to fail]] and Grant positioned to replace her. Very quickly she began shutting him out of key decisions.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nRebeck also decided she would not run a \"writers' room,\" i.e., a regular meeting with the entire writing staff to discuss and perfect episodes and plotlines. \"[They] really are not my thing, because I can only stand being in a room with people so many hours a day,\" she told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. \"And I feel like early drafts should be speedy because everyone changes their mind, so why spend a lot of time up front parsing sentences?\"<ref name=\"NY mag preview story\">{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jesse|title=A House of Mirrors Called 'Smash'|url=https://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/smash-2012-1/index2.html|newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=December 26, 2011|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}</ref>  Instead she would follow the example of showrunners like [[Matthew Weiner]] and [[Aaron Sorkin]] and have writers submit a first draft, which she then revised.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nVery quickly, the writers recalled, the show became a \"dictatorship.\" Rebeck's opinion was the only one that mattered. She insisted on writing the second and third episodes herself, and writers said that the drop in quality was evident during pre-air screenings. During this time Rebeck was often fighting with Spielberg, who wanted Hilty, Greenblatt, or Grant replaced. As a result of these distractions, plotlines like Julia's adoption dilemma (mirroring Rebeck's real life) began to assume unusual prominence, and along with them secondary characters like Leo and Ellis became almost main characters\u2014the latter because Spielberg reportedly liked him.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nSince the writers never met as a group, they found that finished episodes often repeated the same character moments instead of advancing those characters, and that strange out-of-context moments, usually musical numbers set away from the stage, had been inserted. They were particularly frustrated in trying to write for Julia, whom Rebeck had based on herself and consequently would not allow to have any difficulties. Later in the season, they were hoping that Greenblatt would win some of their fights. \"You know it's bad when ''our last hope was the network'',\" one told ''BuzzFeed''. However, many of them said the show's own problems were not entirely Rebeck's fault, since Greenblatt also intervened in things like costume design and Spielberg was not informed of the conflicts until near the end.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nAfter she left the show, Rebeck, who, citing confidentiality requirements, did not respond to the ''BuzzFeed'' story at first other than to say she \"was treated quite badly\",<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" /> spoke at some length to ''[[The New York Observer]]'' about ''Smash'':\n{{quote|One of the points of contention last year was that the network thinks they have the right to say to the writer of the show, \"We don't want her to do this. We want her to do this ... And I would sometimes say back to them, \"She would never do that.\" And they'd look at me like I was crazy, and I'd be like, \"Nope, it's not crazy, it's just who the character is.\" You have to respect who the character is. It has its own internal truth and you can't betray that. And if you don't betray that, it will not betray you. There is this sort of sense that if you don't fuck with the muse\u2014if you don't fuck with the muse, the muse will stand by you ...  It turns into bigger questions about power and art, power and storytelling. Is power itself bigger than storytelling?

The series features original music by composers [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]].\n\n===Season 1 (2012)===\n{{main|Smash (season 1)}}\nJulia Houston ([[Debra Messing]]) and Tom Levitt ([[Christian Borle]]), a Broadway writing team, came up with the idea of a new musical based on the life of [[Marilyn Monroe]] titled ''[[Bombshell (musical)|Bombshell]]''. Producer Eileen Rand ([[Anjelica Huston]]), in the midst of divorce proceedings from her philandering husband, jumps on board and brings with her Derek Wills ([[Jack Davenport]]), a difficult but brilliant director. Ivy Lynn ([[Megan Hilty]]) is initially cast as Marilyn, but is forced to deal with competition from the talented, yet naive ensemble member Karen Cartwright ([[Katharine McPhee]]). Julia's former lover Michael Swift ([[Will Chase]]) is initially cast in the role of [[Joe DiMaggio]]. However, when Julia and Michael's reunion causes serious trouble in her marriage to Frank ([[Brian d'Arcy James]]), the decision is made to fire Michael. The role of Marilyn is recast with film star Rebecca Duvall ([[Uma Thurman]]), leaving Ivy devastated. After a somewhat disastrous out-of-town opening in Boston, Rebecca has fallen sick due to a peanut allergy and the actor playing Joe departs the production for a better gig. Derek subsequently casts Karen in the role of Marilyn and Michael is reinstated as Joe. Karen discovers Ivy has slept with her fianc\u00e9 Dev ([[Raza Jaffrey]]), while Eileen finds out that her assistant Ellis (Jaime Cepero) was the one who poisoned Rebecca and fires him. Karen gets through her debut and the season ends with the closing number being applauded by the audience.\n\n===Season 2 (2013)===\n{{main|Smash (season 2)}}\nAs ''[[Bombshell (musical)|Bombshell]]'' works to open on Broadway in New York City, the show runs into legal and creative troubles which threaten its future.  Meanwhile, the cast and crew (featured in Season 1) attempt to find work. Karen meets two aspiring friends and partners (Kyle, a stage writer played by Andy Mientus, and Jimmy, a composer played by [[Jeremy Jordan (actor, born 1984)|Jeremy Jordan]]) and tries to get their work noticed, especially by Derek. Derek works with Broadway star Veronica Moore ([[Jennifer Hudson]]), who becomes friends with Karen. Ivy gets the lead in ''Liaisons'', a show based on the play ''[[Les liaisons dangereuses (play)|Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]''. ''[[Bombshell (musical)|Bombshell]]'' needs work in order to open on Broadway. First, Peter Gillman ([[Daniel Sunjata]]), a [[dramaturg]] with whom Julia had a rocky relationship is hired in order to help re-write the show. Second, Jerry ([[Michael Cristofer]]) replaces Eileen as the show's producer after she had to step down when the federal authorities found out (through Jerry's orchestration) that she had financed ''Bombshell'' with illegal money. Jimmy and Kyle's show, called ''[[Hit List (musical)|Hit List]]'', eventually goes to the New York Fringe Festival and then they meet a producer for an off-broadway theater called Manhattan Theatre Workshop. Karen quits ''Bombshell'' to be in ''Hit List'' because she has to choose one of them. Ivy takes Karen's role as Marilyn Monroe in ''Bombshell''. ''Hit List'' starts rehearsals. Karen and Jimmy's relationship starts to develop but may cause some disturbance in the work place with Derek's secret feelings for Karen. ''Hit List'' goes to Broadway produced by Jerry and ''Bombshell'' and ''Hit List'' go face to face at the [[Tony Awards]]. ''Hit List'' wins 7 Tonys, which is more than ''Bombshell'', however ''Bombshell'' wins Best Musical and Best Actress (Ivy Lynn) in a Leading Role.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|Characters of Smash}}\n* [[Debra Messing]] as Julia Houston,<ref name=\"smashbios\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/networks/nbcentertainment/smash/biographies |title=Smash Biographies |publisher=NBCUniversal Media Village |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205003041/http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/networks/nbcentertainment/smash/biographies |archivedate=February 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> a successful Broadway lyricist and the musical's co-writer.

Rebeck was a large part of that. As one early hire later described her to ''[[BuzzFeed]]'': \"She was this kick-ass woman [[showrunner]] who wasn't taking shit from the network. Someone who had a very clear vision who was going to stand up to the network. They were all good things in the beginning.\"<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nDespite her experience writing and producing in television, Rebeck had never been a showrunner, responsible for the day-to-day operations of a series, before. [[David Marshall Grant]], a [[playwright]] and actor who had served in that capacity during ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''' final seasons, was hired as [[executive producer]] to help her with it. Rebeck was reportedly resentful, and worried that she was being [[setting up to fail|set up to fail]] and Grant positioned to replace her. Very quickly she began shutting him out of key decisions.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nRebeck also decided she would not run a \"writers' room,\" i.e., a regular meeting with the entire writing staff to discuss and perfect episodes and plotlines. \"[They] really are not my thing, because I can only stand being in a room with people so many hours a day,\" she told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. \"And I feel like early drafts should be speedy because everyone changes their mind, so why spend a lot of time up front parsing sentences?\"<ref name=\"NY mag preview story\">{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jesse|title=A House of Mirrors Called 'Smash'|url=https://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/smash-2012-1/index2.html|newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=December 26, 2011|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}</ref>  Instead she would follow the example of showrunners like [[Matthew Weiner]] and [[Aaron Sorkin]] and have writers submit a first draft, which she then revised.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nVery quickly, the writers recalled, the show became a \"dictatorship.\" Rebeck's opinion was the only one that mattered. She insisted on writing the second and third episodes herself, and writers said that the drop in quality was evident during pre-air screenings. During this time Rebeck was often fighting with Spielberg, who wanted Hilty, Greenblatt, or Grant replaced. As a result of these distractions, plotlines like Julia's adoption dilemma (mirroring Rebeck's real life) began to assume unusual prominence, and along with them secondary characters like Leo and Ellis became almost main characters\u2014the latter because Spielberg reportedly liked him.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nSince the writers never met as a group, they found that finished episodes often repeated the same character moments instead of advancing those characters, and that strange out-of-context moments, usually musical numbers set away from the stage, had been inserted. They were particularly frustrated in trying to write for Julia, whom Rebeck had based on herself and consequently would not allow to have any difficulties. Later in the season, they were hoping that Greenblatt would win some of their fights. \"You know it's bad when ''our last hope was the network'',\" one told ''BuzzFeed''. However, many of them said the show's own problems were not entirely Rebeck's fault, since Greenblatt also intervened in things like costume design and Spielberg was not informed of the conflicts until near the end.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" />\n\nAfter she left the show, Rebeck, who, citing confidentiality requirements, did not respond to the ''BuzzFeed'' story at first other than to say she \"was treated quite badly\",<ref name=\"Buzzfeed story\" /> spoke at some length to ''[[The New York Observer]]'' about ''Smash'':\n{{quote|One of the points of contention last year was that the network thinks they have the right to say to the writer of the show, \"We don't want her to do this. We want her to do this ... And I would sometimes say back to them, \"She would never do that.\" And they'd look at me like I was crazy, and I'd be like, \"Nope, it's not crazy, it's just who the character is.\" You have to respect who the character is. It has its own internal truth and you can't betray that. And if you don't betray that, it will not betray you. There is this sort of sense that if you don't fuck with the muse\u2014if you don't fuck with the muse, the muse will stand by you ...  It turns into bigger questions about power and art, power and storytelling. Is power itself bigger than storytelling?

For many decades, the [[United States]] led the world in total automobile production. In 1929, before the [[Great Depression]], the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA84&dq=U.S.+makes+ninety+percent+of+world's+automobiles |title=U.S. Makes Ninety Percent of World's Automobiles |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1929 |page=84 |volume=115 |issue=5 |accessdate=6 August 2013 }}</ref> After [[World War II]], the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by [[Japan]] and then became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when [[China]] took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million units manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production, with 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third place with 9.9 million units.<ref name=\"Production Statistics\">{{cite web|publisher=OICA |url= http://oica.net/category/production-statistics/ |title=2012 Production Statistics |accessdate=6 August 2013 }}</ref> From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aichner|first1=T.|last2=Coletti|first2= P|date=2013|title=Customers' online shopping preferences in mass customization|journal=Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice|volume=15|issue=1|pages=20\u201335}}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\n{{Main|Automobile safety}}\nSafety is a state that implies to be protected from any risk, danger, damage or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators or [[manufacturers]] do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automobiles themselves, implies that there is no risk of damage.\n\nSafety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. [[Automobiles]] and other [[motor vehicles]] have to comply with a certain number of norms and regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard [[ISO 26262]], is considered as one of the best practice framework for achieving automotive [[functional safety]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54591 |title= ISO 26262-10:2012 Road vehicles -- Functional safety -- Part 10: Guideline on ISO 26262 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn case of safety issues, danger, [[product defect]] or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called [[product recall]]. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from the raw material.\n\nProduct and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the [[value chain]] are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences.\n\n==Economy==\n{{See also|Automotive industry by country}}\nAround the world, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007, consuming over {{convert|980|e9litres|m3}} of [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]] yearly.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Plunkett Research |url=http://www.plunkettresearch.com/Industries/AutomobilesTrucks/AutomobileTrends/tabid/89/Default.aspx |title=Automobile Industry Introduction |year=2008 |accessdate=25 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219120341/http://plunkettresearch.com/Industries/AutomobilesTrucks/AutomobileTrends/tabid/89/Default.aspx |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}</ref> The automobile is a primary mode of [[Transport|transportation]] for many developed economies.

For many decades, the [[United States]] led the world in total automobile production. In 1929, before the [[Great Depression]], the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA84&dq=U.S.+makes+ninety+percent+of+world's+automobiles |title=U.S. Makes Ninety Percent of World's Automobiles |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1929 |page=84 |volume=115 |issue=5 |accessdate=6 August 2013 }}</ref> After [[World War II]], the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by [[Japan]] and then became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when [[China]] took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million units manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production, with 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third place with 9.9 million units.<ref name=\"Production Statistics\">{{cite web|publisher=OICA |url= http://oica.net/category/production-statistics/ |title=2012 Production Statistics |accessdate=6 August 2013 }}</ref> From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aichner|first1=T.|last2=Coletti|first2= P|date=2013|title=Customers' online shopping preferences in mass customization|journal=Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice|volume=15|issue=1|pages=20\u201335}}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\n{{Main|Automobile safety}}\nSafety is a state that implies to be protected from any risk, danger, damage or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators or [[manufacturers]] do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automobiles themselves, implies that there is no risk of damage.\n\nSafety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. [[Automobiles]] and other [[motor vehicles]] have to comply with a certain number of norms and regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard [[ISO 26262]], is considered as one of the best practice framework for achieving automotive [[functional safety]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54591 |title= ISO 26262-10:2012 Road vehicles -- Functional safety -- Part 10: Guideline on ISO 26262 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn case of safety issues, danger, [[product defect]] or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called [[product recall]]. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from the raw material.\n\nProduct and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the [[value chain]] are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences.\n\n==Economy==\n{{See also|Automotive industry by country}}\nAround the world, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007, consuming over {{convert|980|e9litres|m3}} of [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]] yearly.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Plunkett Research |url=http://www.plunkettresearch.com/Industries/AutomobilesTrucks/AutomobileTrends/tabid/89/Default.aspx |title=Automobile Industry Introduction |year=2008 |accessdate=25 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219120341/http://plunkettresearch.com/Industries/AutomobilesTrucks/AutomobileTrends/tabid/89/Default.aspx |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}</ref> The automobile is a primary mode of [[Transport|transportation]] for many developed economies.

Also their [[digital audio workstation]] program [[FL Studio]]<ref name=\"musik\"/> but who cares... and related [[audio plugin|audio plugins]] such as [[Sytrus]]<ref name=\"sytrus\"/> and [[Harmor]].<ref name=\"Harmor\"/> Image-Line was founded in 1994.<ref name=\"Image-Line Company Page\"/> In 2007, Image-Line introduced [[Deckadance]], a virtual DJ console application.<ref name=\"musik\"/> The company also produced [[EZGenerator]], a template-based [[web development|web editing]] program.<ref name=\"awardsez\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early development===\nImage-Line was founded by Jean-Marie Cannie and Frank Van Biesen, who after seven years of creating [[stock market]] software for Pavell Software, decided in 1992 to branch into [[video games]]. Their first product was an [[adult video game]] of ''[[Tetris]]'', which they then offered on [[floppy disks]] in the ad section of ''Computer Magazine''. Around this time [[CD-ROM]] games such as [[The 7th Guest]] were becoming popular, inspiring Van Biesen and Cannie to begin working with Private, one of the larger producers of adult video games at the time. Private released multiple Image-Line CD-ROM games including ''Private Prison'' and ''Private Castle''.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> The company officially adopted the name Image-Line in 1994.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\n===Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin===\nAround the time they released the games for Private, [[IBM]] launched the \"Da Vinci\" contest where the first prizes were color laptops. Image-Line, which at the time had little money, won the contest in the multimedia category after reworking one of their game environments to fit the contest criteria.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nImage-Line took an interest in Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin, the developer who won the overall Da Vinci contest as well as the Game category. They hired the 19-year-old to work for them, and his first game for the company was the game ''Private Investigator.'' <ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> Dambrin's next project for Image-Line was the platform game ''Eat This'',<ref name=\"eat this\"/>  a [[shoot 'em up]] game that involved killing aliens.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nOther Image-Line developers created products such as the [[invoice|invoicing]] program Fact2000 and E-OfficeDirect, a content-based web tool that would a precursor to their later product [[EZGenerator]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> Image-Line also topped the Belgian game charts 4 years in a row with their CD version of the Belgian TV [[game show]] ''[[Blokken]].''<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\n===Audio software===\nIn 1997 Dambrin gained an interest in music applications of the time such as Hammerhead and Rebirth 338, and developed a simple [[MIDI]]-only [[drum machine]] in an effort to merge the two products into a [[step sequencer]] that utilized both rows and steps. Dubbed FruityLoops 1.0, the program didn't fit with Image-Line's other product lines of the time. However, the demo version released in December 1997 became so popular that the number of downloads quickly overwhelmed the Image-Line servers.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> To gather income to support their servers, Image-Line had Dambrin develop an [[EJay]] clone called FruityTracks. Image-Line then served as the program's [[OEM]] for [[Mattel]]. The program was released as Pro-DJ in [[France]] and the [[UK]], and Radio 538 Music Machine in The [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\nImage-Line continued to develop the FruityLoops application from a simple [[drum machine]] into a large and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FruityLoops was eventually renamed [[FL Studio]] for branding purposes and to avoid a prolonged trademark dispute in the [[United States]] with [[Kelloggs]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> FL Studio is now one of the most popular software production systems in the world, and Image-Line's flagship program.<ref name=\"musik\"/> A multitude of [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s have been developed by Image-Line to work with FL Studio, including [[synthesizers]] such as [[Sytrus]] and [[Audio signal processing|effects]] [[plugins]] such as Maximus and Edison.<ref name=\"musik\"/> In 2007 Image-Line released [[Deckadance]], a [[DJ]] [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] program developed by programmer [[Arguru]]. Deckadance works as both a stand-alone program and as a FL Studio plugin.\n\n===Other software===\nBeyond audio products, Image-Line developed and distributed [[EZGenerator]], a software program for website design and maintenance.

Studio]]<ref name=\"musik\"/> and related [[audio plugin|audio plugins]] such as [[Sytrus]]<ref name=\"sytrus\"/> and [[Harmor]].<ref name=\"Harmor\"/> Image-Line was founded in 1994.<ref name=\"Image-Line Company Page\"/> In 2007, Image-Line introduced [[Deckadance]], a virtual DJ console application.<ref name=\"musik\"/> The company also produced [[EZGenerator]], a template-based [[web development|web editing]] program.<ref name=\"awardsez\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early development===\nImage-Line was founded by Jean-Marie Cannie and Frank Van Biesen, who after seven years of creating [[stock market]] software for Pavell Software, decided in 1992 to branch into [[video games]]. Their first product was an [[adult video game]] of ''[[Tetris]]'', which they then offered on [[floppy disks]] in the ad section of ''Computer Magazine''. Around this time [[CD-ROM]] games such as [[The 7th Guest]] were becoming popular, inspiring Van Biesen and Cannie to begin working with Private, one of the larger producers of adult video games at the time. Private released multiple Image-Line CD-ROM games including ''Private Prison'' and ''Private Castle''.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> The company officially adopted the name Image-Line in 1994.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\n===Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin===\nAround the time they released the games for Private, [[IBM]] launched the \"Da Vinci\" contest where the first prizes were color laptops. Image-Line, which at the time had little money, won the contest in the multimedia category after reworking one of their game environments to fit the contest criteria.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nImage-Line took an interest in Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin, the developer who won the overall Da Vinci contest as well as the Game category. They hired the 19-year-old to work for them, and his first game for the company was the game ''Private Investigator.'' <ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> Dambrin's next project for Image-Line was the platform game ''Eat This'',<ref name=\"eat this\"/>  a [[shoot 'em up]] game that involved killing aliens.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nOther Image-Line developers created products such as the [[invoice|invoicing]] program Fact2000 and E-OfficeDirect, a content-based web tool that would a precursor to their later product [[EZGenerator]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> Image-Line also topped the Belgian game charts 4 years in a row with their CD version of the Belgian TV [[game show]] ''[[Blokken]].''<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\n===Audio software===\nIn 1997 Dambrin gained an interest in music applications of the time such as Hammerhead and Rebirth 338, and developed a simple [[MIDI]]-only [[drum machine]] in an effort to merge the two products into a [[step sequencer]] that utilized both rows and steps. Dubbed FruityLoops 1.0, the program didn't fit with Image-Line's other product lines of the time. However, the demo version released in December 1997 became so popular that the number of downloads quickly overwhelmed the Image-Line servers.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> To gather income to support their servers, Image-Line had Dambrin develop an [[EJay]] clone called FruityTracks. Image-Line then served as the program's [[OEM]] for [[Mattel]]. The program was released as Pro-DJ in [[France]] and the [[UK]], and Radio 538 Music Machine in The [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\nImage-Line continued to develop the FruityLoops application from a simple [[drum machine]] into a large and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FruityLoops was eventually renamed [[FL Studio]] for branding purposes and to avoid a prolonged trademark dispute in the [[United States]] with [[Kelloggs]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> FL Studio is now one of the most popular software production systems in the world, and Image-Line's flagship program.<ref name=\"musik\"/> A multitude of [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s have been developed by Image-Line to work with FL Studio, including [[synthesizers]] such as [[Sytrus]] and [[Audio signal processing|effects]] [[plugins]] such as Maximus and Edison.<ref name=\"musik\"/> In 2007 Image-Line released [[Deckadance]], a [[DJ]] [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] program developed by programmer [[Arguru]]. Deckadance works as both a stand-alone program and as a FL Studio plugin.\n\n===Other software===\nBeyond audio products, Image-Line developed and distributed [[EZGenerator]], a software program for website design and maintenance. EZGenerator has won multiple awards since its release.<ref name=\"awardsez\"/>\n\n==Products==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:left;\"\n|-\n! Software\n! Release\n!
