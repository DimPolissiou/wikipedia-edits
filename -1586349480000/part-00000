Not to be confused with ''[[Camel Caravan]]'', a former radio program.}}\nA '''camel train''' or '''caravan''' is a series of [[camel]]s carrying passengers and/or goods on a regular or semi-regular service between points. Although they rarely travelled faster than the walking speed of a person, camels' ability to withstand harsh conditions made them ideal for communication and trade in the desert areas of [[North Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] for centuries. Camel trains were also used sparingly elsewhere around the globe. Since the early 20th century they have been largely replaced by motorized vehicles or air traffic.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6070400.stm BBC: \"Dying trade of the Sahara camel train\" (2006)]</ref>\n\n==Africa, Asia and the Middle East==\n{{See also|Bedouin|Trans-Saharan trade|Silk Road}}\n\nBy far the greatest use of camel trains occurs between [[North Africa|North]] and [[West Africa]] by the [[Tuareg]], [[Shuwa Arabic|Shuwa]] and [[Hassaniyya]], as well as by culturally-affiliated groups like the [[Toubou people|Toubou]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Songhai people|Songhay]]. These camel trains conduct trade in and around the [[Sahara Desert]] and [[Sahel]]. Trains travel as far south as central [[Nigeria]] and northern [[Cameroon]] in the west, and northern [[Kenya]] in the east of the continent. In antiquity, the Arabian Peninsula was an important route for the trade with [[India]] and [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]. \n\nCamel trains have also long been used in portions of trans-Asian trade, including the [[Silk Road]]. As late as the early twentieth century, camel caravans played an important role connecting the [[Beijing]]/[[Shanxi]] region of eastern China with [[Mongolia]]n centers ([[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], [[Uliastai]], [[Khovd (city)|Kobdo]]) and [[Xinjiang]]. The routes went across [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] and/or [[Mongolia|Outer]] Mongolia. According to Owen Lattimore, who spent five months in 1926 crossing the northern edge of China (from [[Hohhot]] to [[Qitai County|Gucheng]], via Inner Mongolia) with a camel caravan, demand for caravan trade was only increased by the arrival of foreign steamships into Chinese ports and the construction of the first railways in eastern China, as they improved access to the world market for such products of western China as wool.<ref name=drt>Lattimore, Owen [1928/9] ''The Desert Road to Turkestan''. London, Methuen and Co; & various later editions. Caravan logistics and organization is discussed in Chap. VIII, \"Camel-Men All\"; route maps are found inside the back cover.</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3070496/Tea-merchants-retrace-ancient-Silk-Road-year-long-journey-China-attempts-revive-glory-fabled-trading-route.html Daily Mail: \"Tea merchants retrace Silk Road on camels\" (2015)]</ref>\n\n==Australia==\n{{See also|Australian feral camel}}\nIn the English-speaking world the term \"camel train\" often applies to [[Australia]], notably the service that once connected a railhead at [[Oodnadatta, South Australia|Oodnadatta]] in [[South Australia]] to [[Alice Springs]] in the center of the continent. The service ended when the [[train]] line was extended to Alice Springs in 1929; that train is called \"[[the Ghan]]\", a shortened version of \"Afghan Express\", and its logo is camel and rider, in honor of the \"Afghan cameleers\" who pioneered the route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatsouthernrail.com.au/site/the_ghan/history.jsp|title=The Ghan; history|publisher=Great Southern Rail|accessdate=18 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202122818/http://www.greatsouthernrail.com.au/site/the_ghan/history.jsp|archivedate=2 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==North America==\n;United States\n{{Main|US Camel Corps}}\nThe history of camel trains in the United States consists mainly of an experiment by the United States Army. On April 29, 1856, thirty-three camels and five drivers arrived at [[Indianola, Texas]]. While camels were suited to the job of transport in the American Southwest, the experiment failed. Their stubbornness and aggressiveness made them unpopular among soldiers, and they frightened horses. Many of the camels were sold to private owners, others escaped into the desert. These feral camels continued to be sighted through the early 20th century, with the last reported sighting in 1941 near [[Douglas, Texas]].<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/whatever-happened-wild-camels-american-west-180956176/?no-ist Smithsonian: \"Whatever Happened to the Wild Camels of the West?\"]</ref>\n\n;British Columbia, Canada\n{{Main|Cariboo camels}}\nCamels were used from 1862 to 1863 in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].<ref>[http://www.cariboogoldrush.com/wagonroa/camel1.htm Cabiroo.com: Camels]</ref>\n\n==Camel caravan organization==\nWhile organization of camel caravans varied over time and the territory traversed, [[Owen Lattimore]]'s account of caravan life in northern China in the 1920s gives a good idea of what camel transport is like. In his ''Desert Road to Turkestan'' he describes mostly camel caravans run by [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people|Hui]] firms from eastern China ([[Hohhot]], [[Baotou]]) or [[Xinjiang]] ([[Qitai County|Qitai]] (then called Gucheng), [[Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County|Barkol]]), plying the routes connecting those two regions through the [[Gobi Desert]] by  way of [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] (or, before Mongolia's independence, [[Mongolia|Outer]]) Mongolia. Before Outer Mongolia's effective independence of China (circa 1920) the same firms also ran caravans into [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], [[Uliassutai]], and other centers of Outer Mongolia, and to the Russian border at [[Kyakhta]], but with the creation of an international border, those routes came into decline.

Besides the camel-pullers the caravan would also include a ''xiansheng'' (\u5148\u751f, literally, \"Sir\", \"Mister\") (typically, an older man with a long experience as a camel-puller, now playing the role of a general manager), one or two cooks, and the caravan master, whose authority over the caravan and its people was as absolute as that of a captain on a ship. If the owner of the caravan did not travel with the caravan himself, he would send along a [[supercargo]]--the person who will take care of the disposal of the freight upon arrival, but had no authority during the journey. The caravan could carry a number of paying passengers as well, who would alternate between riding on top of a camel load and walking.<ref name=drt/>\n\nCamel-pullers' salary was quite low (around 2 silver [[tael]]s a  month in 1926, which would not be enough even for shoes and clothing he wore out while walking with his camels), although they were also fed and provided with tent space at the caravan owner's expense.

A sheep would be bought from the Mongols and slaughtered every now and then, and tea was the usual daily drink; as fresh vegetables were scarce, [[scurvy]] was a danger.<ref name=drt/> Besides the paid cargo and the food and gear for the men, the camels would also carry a fair amount of [[fodder]] for themselves (typically, dried [[peas]] when going west, and [[barley]] when going east, those being the cheapest types of camel feed in Hohhot and Gucheng, respectively). It was estimated that, when leaving its point of origin, for every 100 loads of merchandise the caravan would carry around 30 loads of fodder. When that was not enough (especially in winter) more fodder could be bought (very expensively) from dealers who would come to the caravan route's popular stopping places from the populated areas of Gansu or Ningxia to the south.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 74</ref>\n\n===Cargo===\nTypical cargo carried by the caravans were commodities such as wool, cotton fabrics, or tea, as well as miscellaneous manufactured goods for sale in Xinjiang and Mongolia. Opium was carried as well, typically by smaller, surreptitious, caravans, usually in winter (since in the hot weather opium would be too easily detected by the smell). More exotic loads could include [[jade]] from [[Khotan]],<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 156-157.</ref> elk [[antlers]] prized in [[Chinese medicine]], or even dead bodies of the [[Shanxi]] caravan men and traders, who happened to die while in Xinjiang. In the latter case, the bodies had been first \"temporarily\" buried in Gucheng in light-weight coffins, and when, after three or so years in the grave the flesh had been mostly \"[[mummy|consumed away]]\", the merchant guild sent the bodies to the east by a special caravan. Due to the special nature of the load, higher freight rate was charged for such \"dead passengers\".<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 230-231</ref>\n\n===Speed===\nAccording to Lattimore's diary, caravan travel in Inner Mongolia did not always follow a regular schedule. Caravans traveled or camped at any time of day or night, depending on weather, local conditions, and the  need for rest. Since the caravan traveled at the walking speed of the men, the distance made in a day (a \"stage\") was usually between {{convert|10|and|25|mi|km|0|abbr=on}}, depending on road and weather conditions, and distances between water sources. On occasions several days were spent in a camp without going forward, due to bad weather. A one-way trip from [[Hohhot]] to [[Qitai County|Gucheng]] ({{convert|1550|to|1650|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} by Lattimore's reckoning<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 100</ref>) could take anything from three to eight months.<ref name=drt50>Lattimore (1928-29), pp. 50-51.</ref>\n\nSmaller caravans owned by Mongols of the [[Alxa League|Alashan]] (the westernmost Inner Mongolia) and manned by Han Chinese from [[Minqin County|Zhenfan]], were able to make longer marches (and, thus, cover longer distances faster) than the typical Han Chinese or Hui caravans, because the Mongols were able to always use \"fresh\" camels (picked from their large herd for just a single journey), every man was provided with a camel to ride, and loads were much lighter than in the \"standard\" caravans (rarely exceeding {{convert|270|lb|kg|1}}. These caravans would typically travel by day, from sunrise to sunset.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 168.</ref> Such a camel train is described in the accounts of the journey made by [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] and [[Ella Maillart]] in the Gobi Desert in the mid-1930s.\n\n===Logistics===\nInns called [[caravanserai]] were spread along the route of a long caravan journey. These roadside inns specialized in catering to travelers along established trade routes, such as the [[Silk Road]] and the [[Royal Road]]. Because such long trade routes often passed through inhospitable desert regions, journeys would be impossible to complete successfully and profitably without caravanserai to provide necessary supplies and assistance to merchants and travelers. \n\nIt was necessary for camels to spend at least two months between long journeys to recuperate, and the best time for that recuperation was in June\u2013July, when camels shed their [[camel hair|hair]] and the grazing is best. Therefore, the best practice was for a caravan to leave [[Hohhot]] in August, just after the grazing season; upon reaching Gucheng, weaker camels could stay there until the next summer by grazing whatever vegetation is available in winter, while the stronger ones, after a few weeks of recovery on a grain diet (grain being cheaper in Xinjiang than in eastern China), would be sent back in late winter/early spring, taking along plenty of grain for fodder, and returning to Hohhot before the next grazing season. Vice versa, one could leave Hohhot in the spring, spend the summer grazing season in Xinjiang, and come back in the late fall of the same year. Either way, it would be possible for the caravan people and their best camels to make a full round trip within a year. However, such perfect scheduling was not always possible, and it was often the case that a caravan sent out from Hohhot in August would end up staying on the other end of the route until and through the next grazing season, coming back to Hohhot about a year and a half after its departure.\n<ref name=drt50/>\n\n===Loss of camels; camel hair trade===\nOn almost every journey quite a few camels in each caravan would be lost. On a particularly exhausting section of the trip, an animal already worn out by many weeks of walking, or accidentally poisoned by eating a poisonous plant, would kneel down and not rise anymore. Since killing a camel was considered bad [[karma]] by the caravan people, the hopeless animal\u2014whose death, if it was owned by an individual camel-puller, would be a huge material loss for its owner\u2014was simply left behind to die, \"thrown on the Gobi\" as the camel men would say.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 104.</ref>\n\nSince camels moult in the summer, camel owners received additional income from collecting several pounds of [[camel hair|hair]] their animals dropped during the summer grazing (and shedding season); in northern China, the camel hair trade started around the 1880s. Later, caravan men learned the art of [[knitting]] and [[crocheting]] from the defeated [[White movement|White Russians]] (in exile in Xinjiang after the [[Russian Civil War]]) and the items they had made were transported to eastern China by camel caravan. Although the hair shed by the camels or picked from them was of course considered the property of the camel owners, caravan workers were entitled to make use of some hair for making knitwear for themselves (mostly socks) or for sale. [[Owen Lattimore|Lattimore]] in 1926 observed camel-pullers \"knitting on the march; if they ran out of [[yarn]], they would reach back to the first camel of the file they were leading, pluck a handful of hair from the neck, and roll it in their palms into the beginning of a length of yarn; a weight was attached to this, and given a twist to start it spinning, and the man went on feeding wool into the thread until he had spun enough yarn to continue his knitting\".<ref name=drt52>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 52.</ref>\n\n== Cultural associations==\n\"In The Desert\" (\"\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u044b\", lit. = \"camels\") is a \"traditional Russian\" song, performed by [[Donald Swann]]. He provides an English-language translation after every line. The song is extremely repetitive (\"Another camel is approaching\"), rendering the translation largely redundant, \"a whole caravan of camels is approaching\".<ref>Flanders and Swann, \"[http://www.allmusic.com/album/flanders-amp-swann-at-the-drop-of-another-hat-mw0001321681 At the Drop of Another Hat]\" (1964)</ref>\n\n[[Fritz M\u00fchlenweg]] wrote a book called ''In geheimer Mission durch die W\u00fcste Gobi'' (part one in English ''Big Tiger and Compass Mountain''), published in 1950.

These beasts are also employed in transporting coal, and other commodities, from one part of the province to another, and they are highly esteemed by the Mongols, as they can be easily managed, and can accomplish long journeys in arid regions with scant supplies of food and water. As many of my readers are aware, the camel is physically adapted for traversing the sandy plains of Asia, where they are found in the greatest numbers. The stomach is supplied with bladders which enable the animal to carry a store of fresh water, and in like manner the humps are furnished with a store of food in the shape of fatty matter which may be absorbed in case of need.\"</ref>]]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Peter Fleming (writer)|Fleming, Peter]] (1936) ''[[News from Tartary: a journey from Peking to Kashmir]]''.

Not to be confused with ''[[Camel Caravan]]'', a former radio program.}}\nA '''camel train''' or '''caravan''' is a series of [[camel]]s carrying passengers and/or goods on a regular or semi-regular service between points. Although they rarely travelled faster than the walking speed of a person, camels' ability to withstand harsh conditions made them ideal for communication and trade in the desert areas of [[North Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] for centuries. Camel trains were also used sparingly elsewhere around the globe. Since the early 20th century they have been largely replaced by motorized vehicles or air traffic.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6070400.stm BBC: \"Dying trade of the Sahara camel train\" (2006)]</ref>\n\n==Africa, Asia and the Middle East==\n{{See also|Bedouin|Trans-Saharan trade|Silk Road}}\n\nBy far the greatest use of camel trains occurs between [[North Africa|North]] and [[West Africa]] by the [[Tuareg]], [[Shuwa Arabic|Shuwa]] and [[Hassaniyya]], as well as by culturally-affiliated groups like the [[Toubou people|Toubou]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Songhai people|Songhay]]. These camel trains conduct trade in and around the [[Sahara Desert]] and [[Sahel]]. Trains travel as far south as central [[Nigeria]] and northern [[Cameroon]] in the west, and northern [[Kenya]] in the east of the continent. In antiquity, the Arabian Peninsula was an important route for the trade with [[India]] and [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]. \n\nCamel trains have also long been used in portions of trans-Asian trade, including the [[Silk Road]]. As late as the early twentieth century, camel caravans played an important role connecting the [[Beijing]]/[[Shanxi]] region of eastern China with [[Mongolia]]n centers ([[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], [[Uliastai]], [[Khovd (city)|Kobdo]]) and [[Xinjiang]]. The routes went across [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] and/or [[Mongolia|Outer]] Mongolia. According to Owen Lattimore, who spent five months in 1926 crossing the northern edge of China (from [[Hohhot]] to [[Qitai County|Gucheng]], via Inner Mongolia) with a camel caravan, demand for caravan trade was only increased by the arrival of foreign steamships into Chinese ports and the construction of the first railways in eastern China, as they improved access to the world market for such products of western China as wool.<ref name=drt>Lattimore, Owen [1928/9] ''The Desert Road to Turkestan''.

On April 29, 1856, thirty-three camels and five drivers arrived at [[Indianola, Texas]]. While camels were suited to the job of transport in the American Southwest, the experiment failed. Their stubbornness and aggressiveness made them unpopular among soldiers, and they frightened horses. Many of the camels were sold to private owners, others escaped into the desert. These feral camels continued to be sighted through the early 20th century, with the last reported sighting in 1941 near [[Douglas, Texas]].<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/whatever-happened-wild-camels-american-west-180956176/?no-ist Smithsonian: \"Whatever Happened to the Wild Camels of the West?\"]</ref>\n\n;British Columbia, Canada\n{{Main|Cariboo camels}}\nCamels were used from 1862 to 1863 in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].<ref>[http://www.cariboogoldrush.com/wagonroa/camel1.htm Cabiroo.com: Camels]</ref>\n\n==Camel caravan organization==\nWhile organization of camel caravans varied over time and the territory traversed, [[Owen Lattimore]]'s account of caravan life in northern China in the 1920s gives a good idea of what camel transport is like. In his ''Desert Road to Turkestan'' he describes mostly camel caravans run by [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people|Hui]] firms from eastern China ([[Hohhot]], [[Baotou]]) or [[Xinjiang]] ([[Qitai County|Qitai]] (then called Gucheng), [[Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County|Barkol]]), plying the routes connecting those two regions through the [[Gobi Desert]] by  way of [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] (or, before Mongolia's independence, [[Mongolia|Outer]]) Mongolia. Before Outer Mongolia's effective independence of China (circa 1920) the same firms also ran caravans into [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], [[Uliassutai]], and other centers of Outer Mongolia, and to the Russian border at [[Kyakhta]], but with the creation of an international border, those routes came into decline. Less important caravan routes served various other areas of northern China, such as most centers in today's [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]], and northern [[Qinghai]].

More exotic loads could include [[jade]] from [[Khotan]],<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 156-157.</ref> elk [[antlers]] prized in [[Chinese medicine]], or even dead bodies of the [[Shanxi]] caravan men and traders, who happened to die while in Xinjiang. In the latter case, the bodies had been first \"temporarily\" buried in Gucheng in light-weight coffins, and when, after three or so years in the grave the flesh had been mostly \"[[mummy|consumed away]]\", the merchant guild sent the bodies to the east by a special caravan. Due to the special nature of the load, higher freight rate was charged for such \"dead passengers\".<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 230-231</ref>\n\n===Speed===\nAccording to Lattimore's diary, caravan travel in Inner Mongolia did not always follow a regular schedule. Caravans traveled or camped at any time of day or night, depending on weather, local conditions, and the  need for rest. Since the caravan traveled at the walking speed of the men, the distance made in a day (a \"stage\") was usually between {{convert|10|and|25|mi|km|0|abbr=on}}, depending on road and weather conditions, and distances between water sources. On occasions several days were spent in a camp without going forward, due to bad weather. A one-way trip from [[Hohhot]] to [[Qitai County|Gucheng]] ({{convert|1550|to|1650|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} by Lattimore's reckoning<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 100</ref>) could take anything from three to eight months.<ref name=drt50>Lattimore (1928-29), pp. 50-51.</ref>\n\nSmaller caravans owned by Mongols of the [[Alxa League|Alashan]] (the westernmost Inner Mongolia) and manned by Han Chinese from [[Minqin County|Zhenfan]], were able to make longer marches (and, thus, cover longer distances faster) than the typical Han Chinese or Hui caravans, because the Mongols were able to always use \"fresh\" camels (picked from their large herd for just a single journey), every man was provided with a camel to ride, and loads were much lighter than in the \"standard\" caravans (rarely exceeding {{convert|270|lb|kg|1}}. These caravans would typically travel by day, from sunrise to sunset.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 168.</ref> Such a camel train is described in the accounts of the journey made by [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] and [[Ella Maillart]] in the Gobi Desert in the mid-1930s.\n\n===Logistics===\nInns called [[caravanserai]] were spread along the route of a long caravan journey. These roadside inns specialized in catering to travelers along established trade routes, such as the [[Silk Road]] and the [[Royal Road]]. Because such long trade routes often passed through inhospitable desert regions, journeys would be impossible to complete successfully and profitably without caravanserai to provide necessary supplies and assistance to travelers. \n\nIt was necessary for camels to spend at least two months between long journeys to recuperate, and the best time for that recuperation was in June\u2013July, when camels shed their [[camel hair|hair]] and the grazing is best. Therefore, the best practice was for a caravan to leave [[Hohhot]] in August, just after the grazing season; upon reaching Gucheng, weaker camels could stay there until the next summer by grazing whatever vegetation is available in winter, while the stronger ones, after a few weeks of recovery on a grain diet (grain being cheaper in Xinjiang than in eastern China), would be sent back in late winter/early spring, taking along plenty of grain for fodder, and returning to Hohhot before the next grazing season. Vice versa, one could leave Hohhot in the spring, spend the summer grazing season in Xinjiang, and come back in the late fall of the same year. Either way, it would be possible for the caravan people and their best camels to make a full round trip within a year. However, such perfect scheduling was not always possible, and it was often the case that a caravan sent out from Hohhot in August would end up staying on the other end of the route until and through the next grazing season, coming back to Hohhot about a year and a half after its departure.\n<ref name=drt50/>\n\n===Loss of camels; camel hair trade===\nOn almost every journey quite a few camels in each caravan would be lost. On a particularly exhausting section of the trip, an animal already worn out by many weeks of walking, or accidentally poisoned by eating a poisonous plant, would kneel down and not rise anymore. Since killing a camel was considered bad [[karma]] by the caravan people, the hopeless animal\u2014whose death, if it was owned by an individual camel-puller, would be a huge material loss for its owner\u2014was simply left behind to die, \"thrown on the Gobi\" as the camel men would say.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 104.</ref>\n\nSince camels moult in the summer, camel owners received additional income from collecting several pounds of [[camel hair|hair]] their animals dropped during the summer grazing (and shedding season); in northern China, the camel hair trade started around the 1880s. Later, caravan men learned the art of [[knitting]] and [[crocheting]] from the defeated [[White movement|White Russians]] (in exile in Xinjiang after the [[Russian Civil War]]) and the items they had made were transported to eastern China by camel caravan. Although the hair shed by the camels or picked from them was of course considered the property of the camel owners, caravan workers were entitled to make use of some hair for making knitwear for themselves (mostly socks) or for sale. [[Owen Lattimore|Lattimore]] in 1926 observed camel-pullers \"knitting on the march; if they ran out of [[yarn]], they would reach back to the first camel of the file they were leading, pluck a handful of hair from the neck, and roll it in their palms into the beginning of a length of yarn; a weight was attached to this, and given a twist to start it spinning, and the man went on feeding wool into the thread until he had spun enough yarn to continue his knitting\".<ref name=drt52>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 52.</ref>\n\n== Cultural associations==\n\"In The Desert\" (\"\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u044b\", lit. = \"camels\") is a \"traditional Russian\" song, performed by [[Donald Swann]]. He provides an English-language translation after every line. The song is extremely repetitive (\"Another camel is approaching\"), rendering the translation largely redundant, \"a whole caravan of camels is approaching\".<ref>Flanders and Swann, \"[http://www.allmusic.com/album/flanders-amp-swann-at-the-drop-of-another-hat-mw0001321681 At the Drop of Another Hat]\" (1964)</ref>\n\n[[Fritz M\u00fchlenweg]] wrote a book called ''In geheimer Mission durch die W\u00fcste Gobi'' (part one in English ''Big Tiger and Compass Mountain''), published in 1950. It was later shortened and translated into English under the title ''Big Tiger and Christian''; it concerns the adventures of two boys who cross the [[Gobi Desert]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Caravan (travellers)]]\n*[[Caravanserai]]\n* [[Cariboo camels]]\n*[[Twenty mule team]]\n\n==References==\n[[File:THE PEKINGESE CAMEL.jpg|thumb|\"The Pekingese Camel\"; photograph by John Thomson<ref>John Thomson: \"At certain seasons of the year, camels may be encountered in tens of thousands crossing the desert of Gobi, laden with brick tea, on their way to the Russian frontier. This brick tea, in the absence of metallic currency, forms the circulating medium in Mongolia, Siberia, and Thibet. When in the province of Peichihli I witnessed the departure of a train of 2,000 of these camels laden with brick tea to be sold in the Russian markets. These beasts are also employed in transporting coal, and other commodities, from one part of the province to another, and they are highly esteemed by the Mongols, as they can be easily managed, and can accomplish long journeys in arid regions with scant supplies of food and water. As many of my readers are aware, the camel is physically adapted for traversing the sandy plains of Asia, where they are found in the greatest numbers. The stomach is supplied with bladders which enable the animal to carry a store of fresh water, and in like manner the humps are furnished with a store of food in the shape of fatty matter which may be absorbed in case of need.\"</ref>]]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Peter Fleming (writer)|Fleming, Peter]] (1936) ''[[News from Tartary: a journey from Peking to Kashmir]]''.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Their claim it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters are demanding an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings, and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] was criticised for its performance during the protests.

She was concerned over the risk to organisers regarding the possible disruption by protestors of public events and press conferences.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval rating declined to 22.3 in October 2019, lowest among all chief executives.

The establishment waited for demonstrators' aggression to increase so they could justify greater militarisation of the police and dismiss the protesters as \"insurgents\" and also their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer holds a blue flag warning the protesters to disperse at an unapproved march.]]\nThe reputation of the police took a serious drubbing following the heavy-handed treatment of protesters.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190625_policeconfusion\"/><ref name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October 2019, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, their aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represents hostility and suppression.

People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests.

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded that the government fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18&nbsp;June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August 2019, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead despite calls asking her to resign. As for the demand to set up an independent commission to investigate police misconduct, she insisted that the existing mechanism, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) would suffice.<ref name=\"scmp_3017795\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190709\"/>\n\nAfter condemning the protesters for storming the legislature on 1&nbsp;July for their \"use of extreme violence\"<ref name=\"hkfp_20190702_condemnsoccupation\"/> and defacing the national emblem during the 21&nbsp;July protest,<ref name=\"coconutshk_20190722\"/> Lam suggested in early August 2019 that the protests had deviated from their original purpose and that their goal now was to challenge China's sovereignty and damage \"one country, two systems\".<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> She suggested that radical protesters were dragging Hong Kong to a \"point of no return\"<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\" /> and that they had \"no stake in society\",<ref name=\"standardhk_132809\"/> a remark that was criticised by some civil servants.<ref name=\"standardhk_133040\"/>\n\nFollowing a rally on 18&nbsp;August that was attended by more than 1.7&nbsp;million people, Lam announced that she would create platforms for dialogue.<ref name=\"scmp_3023512\"/> On 4&nbsp;September, Lam announced that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill, introduce measures such as introducing new members to the IPCC, engaging in dialogue at the community level, and inviting academics to evaluate Hong Kong's deep-rooted problems. However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that their five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stages of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26&nbsp;September 2019.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June 2019, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>.

As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

At number 60 the register of sports associations was written down trade union sports club of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski. In July 1951 the [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]] club already had own 395-metres with path by the \u015al\u0105ska Street. After a few years of the struggle on III league paths and suspending the operations of the speedway chapter in 1953\u20131954 years, in 1955 the team is being Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski reported to gameses of the II league. In 1961 the team of \u201eStal\u201d in the end fought its way through to gameses of the [[Team Speedway Polish Championship|first division]]. In the entire season the Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski team suffered only two defeats, but surnames of Edmund Migo\u015b, Bronis\u0142aw Rogal, Edward Pilarczyk or Jerzy Padewski were already then well known for fans throughout the country. In conclusion of season sports club was an organiser one from series test-match with the representation the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. specially to this match, with the help of ''Mechanical Plants Gorz\u00f3w'' and of army unit, an artificial lighting was installed. Match, played on 17 October at hour 22, closed with the minimal victory for the representation of Poland 39:38. They acted in stocks white and red \u201eStal\u201d speedway riders: Migo\u015b, Padewski, [[Andrzej Pogorzelski]], E. Pilarczyk and Zdzis\u0142aw Boniecki. [[Igor Plechanov]] was a star of the Soviet team. In the draught of two first seasons in the first division inhabitant of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski occupied lower areas of the table. 1962 was the year difficult, but after winning play-off matches with [[ZK\u017b Zielona G\u00f3ra|Zgrzeblarki Zielona G\u00f3ra]] defended \u201eStal\u201d one's place in the first division in order for her no longer to leave for next long years. Only in 1964 the first success is coming in the form of getting a silver medal of the [[Team Speedway Polish Championship]].\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s. \u201eThe Golden Era\u201d of the club ===\n[[File:KSSG 72.jpg|thumbnail|left|Stal in season 1972]]\nThe same positions filled \u201eStal\u201d still for two next seasons. Season 1967 closed with the lack of the medal and the fourth place. A year later team again became a vice-champion of the country, and [[Edward Jancarz]], making his debut in gameses for the individual [[Speedway World Championship|world championships]], captured the after the play-off race with the representative of USSR \u2013 Giennadij Kurylenko, bronze medal. 1969 was a huge success of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski speedway sport, then for the first time team from above of [[Warta]] became a Team Speedway Polish Champion. After the success in 1969 they counted on the defence of the title in the next season, unfortunately inhabitant of \u201eStal\u201d finished gameses on the fifth place. The following year brought silver, already fifth as a matter of fact medal in the history of the club. From 1973 to 1979 inhabitant of team stood on the podium and won gold medals in years 1973, 1975 and of 1978 and silver in 1974 and of 1979. To the success of the entire team in 70 years Migo\u015b in 1970, [[Zenon Plech]] in years 1972 and of 1974, Jancarz in 1975 and Bogus\u0142aw Nowak in 1977 still got titles of individual [[Polish Individual Speedway Championship]]. Moreover, Plech in 1973 got second in the history of the club bronze medal of the individual world championships.\n\n=== 1980s and 1990s ===\n[[File:KSSG 06.JPG|thumbnail|left|Stal in season 1994]]\nIn 1980 competitors of \u201eStal\u201d took the fourth place then again of the year. In 1981 the team captured silver, in 1982 bronze, and in the season gained 1983 last up until now title of Team Speedway Polish Championship. A year later the club occupied only an eighth place. In the following years inhabitant of team went on average apart from year 1987, in which they got a bronze medal of the team Polish championship. Years brought two fourth places to 1990-1991. From the place on the podium both in 1990 as well as of 1991 only small points divided. In 1992 they were \u201eStal\u201d with team vice-champions of Poland. Four consecutive seasons proceeded without most successes. The club got around the club in 1997 and on this occasion activists implemented changes being supposed to improve the performance of the squad. A changed name of the team of ''Stal'' stayed on ''Pergo'' and from [[KS Toru\u0144|Apator Toru\u0144]] of [[Tomasz Bajerski]] was bought for the record-breaking 600.000 [[Polish z\u0142oty|PLN]]. Also a contract with an individual world champion was signed from 1994 with Swede [[Tony Rickardsson]]. And after all the club in season 1997 gained a silver medal of the team Polish championship. After this season [[Piotr \u015awist]] resigned from the club, his walking away and a few smaller factors caused that in 1998 inhabitant of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski after the heavy fight had defended before the fall themselves. After making composition look younger in the next season the \u201eStal\u201d occupied the sixth place, giving the right of the start in the season 2000 in reformed [[Ekstraliga (speedway)|Speedway Ekstraliga]]. In the new season they captured team bronze medal of the team Polish championship, in order to after the fourth for place in 2001 to spend the worst season for forty years finished with the decline for the lower league competition.\n\n=== 2003\u20132007. Race in 1st league ===\nIn 2003 \u201eStal\u201d spite of great money troubles. When \u015awist and [[Mariusz Staszewski]] left the team in the club they put to young people. Juniors bolstered up with experienced competitors with Piotr Paluch, Robert Flis and the three of Swedes they proceeded up to the season with the intention supporting the team, into reality fought to the bitter end against the third place in the table. Charges of Stanis\u0142aw Chomski are achieving 8 victories in the fundamental round, being promoted to a group of promotion-seek teams. Inhabitant of club after all are finishing the season on the fourth position. Similarly it was in the season 2004. Completely different moods accompanied speedway riders and activists before the season 2005. The purpose for the squad was clearly defined. An advance to the circle of teams was it Polish Speedway Ekstraliga. The team was strengthened with former individual world champion from 2000, with [[Mark Loram]]. The team finished the fundamental part of gameses on the top one spot. Unfortunately, the lost semi-final from the [[KM Ostr\u00f3w Wielkopolski]], that inhabitant of team to the match against the third place from [[\u017bKS ROW Rybnik|RKM Rybnik]] they set about in domestic composition and after all from the row finished the third year gameses on the fourth position. The future of the club stood up under a big question mark. The most gifted club junior left the team [[Pawe\u0142 Hlib]] which moved to the [[Unia Tarn\u00f3w]]. On the day of 19 December 2005 a reporting-election annual general meeting, during which the new 6-person management board of a sports club was chosen was held \u201eStal\u201d, at the head which W\u0142adys\u0142aw Komarnicki was chosen. In the season 2006 applied to new regulations and for the first time in the history of Polish cinder a number of starting foreign competitors wasn't reduced. Then six competitors represented the club from outside Poland. Season 2007 it for of \u201eStal\u201d special year. Before the start of gameses great achievements which were supposed to be crowning 750-years beats of the city were already being announced and 60-years of the club. To help with reaching at this target had [[Matej Ferjan]] contracting, [[Jesper B. Monberg|Jesper B. Jensen]] and [[Magnus Zetterstr\u00f6m]]. If later it turned out, the club after five years returned to the Speedway Ekstraliga. Except for very great achievement, that is winning through \u201eStal\u201d the first divisions, the guard to mention the repair work which they moved at the [[Edward Jancarz Stadium]]. In the end fans could seat themselves in about of the entire path, because a missing part of the podium was built on.\n\n=== 2008s and present ===\n[[File:KSSG 08.jpg|thumbnail|left|Stal in season 2011]]\nAfter five years spent in the first division, fans with hope looked at the consecutive season. A company became a titular sponsor of the team ''Caelum Development'' and before the season 2008 was strengthened team. An outstanding Polish competitor of [[Tomasz Gollob]] was contracted, of [[Norway|Norwegian]] with the Polish passport [[Rune Holta]] and Swede \u2013 [[Peter Karlsson (speedway rider)|Peter Karlsson]]. Projects of the further expansion of the stadium were also described, of which openly a few days came before the inauguration of the season. Team finished gameses on the sixth place. Similarly it was in the consecutive season. Before the season a former individual world champion is attaching 2010 to the \u201eStal\u201d Dane [[Nicki Pedersen]] and [[Tomasz Gapi\u0144ski]], and borrowed from the [[Unia Leszno]] \u2013 [[Przemys\u0142aw Pawlicki]]. Team are finishing the fundamental round on the second place, but before play-off's from \u201eFalubaz\u201d of injury one of leaders of \u201eStal\u201d \u2013 Pedersen and inhabitant of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski are losing match with the rival neighbouring and are taking the third time after all in gameses from the row the sixth place. In season 2010 a captain T. Gollob was a great success which got first in one's career and after 37 years - second for Poland - title of an individual world champion. \u201eStal\u201d finished season 2011 after 11 years of the break fourth in the history of the club with bronze medal of the Team Speedway Polish Championship. In the season a representative of Poland is attaching 2012 to the Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski team [[Krzysztof Kasprzak]] and the young Dane [[Michael Jepsen Jensen|Michael J. Jensen]]. After 15 years are capturing \u201eStal\u201d the vice-championship of the Team Speedway Polish Championship surrendering in final matches for gold for Azoty Unia Tarn\u00f3w 93:86.\n\n== Riders ==\n=== Current squad ===\n{{updated|15 November 2019}}\n[[File:B.Zmarzlik..jpg|thumbnail|B.

At number 60 the register of sports associations was written down trade union sports club of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski. In July 1951 the [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]] club already had own 395-metres with path by the \u015al\u0105ska Street. After a few years of the struggle on III league paths and suspending the operations of the speedway chapter in 1953\u20131954 years, in 1955 the team is being Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski reported to gameses of the II league. In 1961 the team of \u201eStal\u201d in the end fought its way through to gameses of the [[Team Speedway Polish Championship|first division]]. In the entire season the Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski team suffered only two defeats, but surnames of Edmund Migo\u015b, Bronis\u0142aw Rogal, Edward Pilarczyk or Jerzy Padewski were already then well known for fans throughout the country. In conclusion of season sports club was an organiser one from series test-match with the representation the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. specially to this match, with the help of ''Mechanical Plants Gorz\u00f3w'' and of army unit, an artificial lighting was installed. Match, played on 17 October at hour 22, closed with the minimal victory for the representation of Poland 39:38. They acted in stocks white and red \u201eStal\u201d speedway riders: Migo\u015b, Padewski, [[Andrzej Pogorzelski]], E. Pilarczyk and Zdzis\u0142aw Boniecki. [[Igor Plechanov]] was a star of the Soviet team. In the draught of two first seasons in the first division inhabitant of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski occupied lower areas of the table. 1962 was the year difficult, but after winning play-off matches with [[ZK\u017b Zielona G\u00f3ra|Zgrzeblarki Zielona G\u00f3ra]] defended \u201eStal\u201d one's place in the first division in order for her no longer to leave for next long years. Only in 1964 the first success is coming in the form of getting a silver medal of the [[Team Speedway Polish Championship]].\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s. \u201eThe Golden Era\u201d of the club ===\n[[File:KSSG 72.jpg|thumbnail|left|Stal in season 1972]]\nThe same positions filled \u201eStal\u201d still for two next seasons. Season 1967 closed with the lack of the medal and the fourth place. A year later team again became a vice-champion of the country, and [[Edward Jancarz]], making his debut in gameses for the individual [[Speedway World Championship|world championships]], captured the after the play-off race with the representative of USSR \u2013 Giennadij Kurylenko, bronze medal. 1969 was a huge success of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski speedway sport, then for the first time team from above of [[Warta]] became a Team Speedway Polish Champion. After the success in 1969 they counted on the defence of the title in the next season, unfortunately inhabitant of \u201eStal\u201d finished gameses on the fifth place. The following year brought silver, already fifth as a matter of fact medal in the history of the club. From 1973 to 1979 inhabitant of team stood on the podium and won gold medals in years 1973, 1975 and of 1978 and silver in 1974 and of 1979. To the success of the entire team in 70 years Migo\u015b in 1970, [[Zenon Plech]] in years 1972 and of 1974, Jancarz in 1975 and Bogus\u0142aw Nowak in 1977 still got titles of individual [[Polish Individual Speedway Championship]]. Moreover, Plech in 1973 got second in the history of the club bronze medal of the individual world championships.\n\n=== 1980s and 1990s ===\n[[File:KSSG 06.JPG|thumbnail|left|Stal in season 1994]]\nIn 1980 competitors of \u201eStal\u201d took the fourth place then again of the year. In 1981 the team captured silver, in 1982 bronze, and in the season gained 1983 last up until now title of Team Speedway Polish Championship. A year later the club occupied only an eighth place. In the following years inhabitant of team went on average apart from year 1987, in which they got a bronze medal of the team Polish championship. Years brought two fourth places to 1990-1991. From the place on the podium both in 1990 as well as of 1991 only small points divided. In 1992 they were \u201eStal\u201d with team vice-champions of Poland. Four consecutive seasons proceeded without most successes. The club got around the club in 1997 and on this occasion activists implemented changes being supposed to improve the performance of the squad. A changed name of the team of ''Stal'' stayed on ''Pergo'' and from [[KS Toru\u0144|Apator Toru\u0144]] of [[Tomasz Bajerski]] was bought for the record-breaking 600.000 [[Polish z\u0142oty|PLN]]. Also a contract with an individual world champion was signed from 1994 with Swede [[Tony Rickardsson]]. And after all the club in season 1997 gained a silver medal of the team Polish championship. After this season [[Piotr \u015awist]] resigned from the club, his walking away and a few smaller factors caused that in 1998 inhabitant of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski after the heavy fight had defended before the fall themselves. After making composition look younger in the next season the \u201eStal\u201d occupied the sixth place, giving the right of the start in the season 2000 in reformed [[Ekstraliga (speedway)|Speedway Ekstraliga]]. In the new season they captured team bronze medal of the team Polish championship, in order to after the fourth for place in 2001 to spend the worst season for forty years finished with the decline for the lower league competition.\n\n=== 2003\u20132007. Race in 1st league ===\nIn 2003 \u201eStal\u201d spite of great money troubles. When \u015awist and [[Mariusz Staszewski]] left the team in the club they put to young people. Juniors bolstered up with experienced competitors with Piotr Paluch, Robert Flis and the three of Swedes they proceeded up to the season with the intention supporting the team, into reality fought to the bitter end against the third place in the table. Charges of Stanis\u0142aw Chomski are achieving 8 victories in the fundamental round, being promoted to a group of promotion-seek teams. Inhabitant of club after all are finishing the season on the fourth position. Similarly it was in the season 2004. Completely different moods accompanied speedway riders and activists before the season 2005. The purpose for the squad was clearly defined. An advance to the circle of teams was it Polish Speedway Ekstraliga. The team was strengthened with former individual world champion from 2000, with [[Mark Loram]]. The team finished the fundamental part of gameses on the top one spot. Unfortunately, the lost semi-final from the [[KM Ostr\u00f3w Wielkopolski]], that inhabitant of team to the match against the third place from [[\u017bKS ROW Rybnik|RKM Rybnik]] they set about in domestic composition and after all from the row finished the third year gameses on the fourth position. The future of the club stood up under a big question mark. The most gifted club junior left the team [[Pawe\u0142 Hlib]] which moved to the [[Unia Tarn\u00f3w]]. On the day of 19 December 2005 a reporting-election annual general meeting, during which the new 6-person management board of a sports club was chosen was held \u201eStal\u201d, at the head which W\u0142adys\u0142aw Komarnicki was chosen. In the season 2006 applied to new regulations and for the first time in the history of Polish cinder a number of starting foreign competitors wasn't reduced. Then six competitors represented the club from outside Poland. Season 2007 it for of \u201eStal\u201d special year. Before the start of gameses great achievements which were supposed to be crowning 750-years beats of the city were already being announced and 60-years of the club. To help with reaching at this target had [[Matej Ferjan]] contracting, [[Jesper B. Monberg|Jesper B. Jensen]] and [[Magnus Zetterstr\u00f6m]]. If later it turned out, the club after five years returned to the Speedway Ekstraliga. Except for very great achievement, that is winning through \u201eStal\u201d the first divisions, the guard to mention the repair work which they moved at the [[Edward Jancarz Stadium]]. In the end fans could seat themselves in about of the entire path, because a missing part of the podium was built on.\n\n=== 2008s and present ===\n[[File:KSSG 08.jpg|thumbnail|left|Stal in season 2011]]\nAfter five years spent in the first division, fans with hope looked at the consecutive season. A company became a titular sponsor of the team ''Caelum Development'' and before the season 2008 was strengthened team. An outstanding Polish competitor of [[Tomasz Gollob]] was contracted, of [[Norway|Norwegian]] with the Polish passport [[Rune Holta]] and Swede \u2013 [[Peter Karlsson (speedway rider)|Peter Karlsson]]. Projects of the further expansion of the stadium were also described, of which openly a few days came before the inauguration of the season. Team finished gameses on the sixth place. Similarly it was in the consecutive season. Before the season a former individual world champion is attaching 2010 to the \u201eStal\u201d Dane [[Nicki Pedersen]] and [[Tomasz Gapi\u0144ski]], and borrowed from the [[Unia Leszno]] \u2013 [[Przemys\u0142aw Pawlicki]]. Team are finishing the fundamental round on the second place, but before play-off's from \u201eFalubaz\u201d of injury one of leaders of \u201eStal\u201d \u2013 Pedersen and inhabitant of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski are losing match with the rival neighbouring and are taking the third time after all in gameses from the row the sixth place. In season 2010 a captain T. Gollob was a great success which got first in one's career and after 37 years - second for Poland - title of an individual world champion. \u201eStal\u201d finished season 2011 after 11 years of the break fourth in the history of the club with bronze medal of the Team Speedway Polish Championship. In the season a representative of Poland is attaching 2012 to the Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski team [[Krzysztof Kasprzak]] and the young Dane [[Michael Jepsen Jensen|Michael J. Jensen]]. After 15 years are capturing \u201eStal\u201d the vice-championship of the Team Speedway Polish Championship surrendering in final matches for gold for Azoty Unia Tarn\u00f3w 93:86.\n\n== Riders ==\n=== Current squad ===\n{{updated|15 November 2019}}\n[[File:B.Zmarzlik..jpg|thumbnail|B.

But they went backwards after that with a 1-7 loss to Kyrgyzstan and a 2-5 reversal to Korea Republic. Turkmenistan were not expected to make it out of the group after poor performances in previous championships. They were uninspiring in 2005 and the following year had little chance in a group that included powerhouses Iran and ASEAN kingpins Thailand.

They were uninspiring in 2005 and the following year had little chance in a group that included powerhouses Iran and ASEAN kingpins Thailand.

He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist, who has served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

It is highly sensitive to [[friction]], heat and [[shock (mechanics)|shock]] and is mainly used as a trigger for other explosives in [[percussion cap]]s and [[blasting cap]]s. [[Mercury(II) cyanate]], though its empirical formula is identical, has a different atomic arrangement; the [[cyanate]] and [[fulminate]] [[Ion#Anions and cations|anions]] are [[isomer]]s.\n\nFirst used as a [[priming composition]] in small copper caps beginning in the 1820s, mercury fulminate quickly replaced [[flint]]s as a means to ignite [[black powder]] charges in [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] [[firearm]]s. Later, during the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, mercury fulminate or [[potassium chlorate]] became widely used in [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|primers]] for [[Cartridge (firearms)|self-contained rifle and pistol ammunition]]. Mercury fulminate has the distinct advantage over potassium chlorate of being non-corrosive, but it is known to weaken with time, by decomposing into its  constituent elements.  The reduced mercury which results forms amalgams with cartridge brass, weakening it, as well.  Today, mercury fulminate has been replaced in primers by more efficient chemical substances. These are non-corrosive, less toxic and more stable over time; they include [[lead azide]], [[lead styphnate]] and [[tetrazene]] derivatives. In addition, none of these compounds require [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] for manufacture, supplies of which can be unreliable in wartime.\n\n==Preparation==\nMercury(II) fulminate is prepared by dissolving [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in [[nitric acid]] and adding [[ethanol]] to the solution.

After completing his medical school, he turned down his job at Zaire as a personal physician of President Joseph-Desir\u00e9 Mobutu, as+++\u00e7\u00e7\u00e7\u00f1. n  he wanted to avoid the corruption associated with his country. Instead, he is hired by the mayor of a small village, Marly-Gomont, in northern France. He tells his family that he got a job in a city north of Paris, France. His wife Anne and their two children, Sivi and Kamini, are disappointed to learn that they are living in a rural village, far from the excitement of Paris. His decision to live in France is mainly motivated by the hope of a better education for his children, but he also hopes to apply for French citizenship. Seyolo and his family struggle to adapt to new life as locals - unfamiliar with African professionals - fear newcomers, children are bullied at school, and Seyolo's practice struggles to survive as locals prefer to go to the next village whenever they need a doctor, instead of being visited by a \"wizard\". Seyolo and Anne have a heated argument in front of relatives who have come for a visit, during which Seyolo reluctantly promises that they will eventually move to Brussels, where some of their relatives live. However, Seyolo and his family end up winning the trust of the villagers, and his practice becomes a success after he delivers the baby to a local farmer.\n\nFollowing Seyolo's reputation and popularity, he tells the mayor that he wants to stay in Marly-Gomont for the long term. That same evening, the mayor and his wife are having dinner at the Zantokos' house, and the mayor mentions his happiness that Seyolo is in the village. Anne is shocked and angry at this revelation, for Seyolo had promised to move to Brussels and had not told Anne that he had accepted the mayor's request to stay in Marly-Gomont. Anne leaves to stay in Brussels with her family and the couple's relationship is in danger.\n\nMeanwhile, in Marly-Gomont, Seyolo is arrested by French police for immigration irregularities, days before his French citizenship application is approved, and he is forced to stop working. Anne finally returns and agrees to stay with Seyolo in Marly-Gomont. The only hope for Seyolo and his family is that the current mayor will be reelected, although his opponent, Lavigne, is leading the polls and is determined to prevent Seyolo from practicing in the village, preferring to hire a doctor of French origin. . However, Sivi is a talented soccer player and wins the hearts of the community, helping the local team make progress in the league alone. Seyolo and his children devise a plan to show residents that if Lavigne wins the election, the family will have to leave Marly-Gomont. Residents, upset over the prospect of losing the best football player, end up voting, and the incumbent mayor is reelected. Finally, the local school children play a play that re-enacts the arrival and eventual acceptance of Seyolo and his family, and they realize that they are loved by the entire community (except Lavigne, who leaves before the end of the show).

After completing his medical school, he turned down his job at Zaire as a personal physician of President Joseph-Desir\u00e9 Mobutu, as he wanted to avoid the corruption associated with his country. Instead, he is hired by the mayor of a small village, Marly-Gomont, in northern France. He tells his family that he got a job in a city north of Paris, France. His wife Anne and their two children, Sivi and Kamini, are disappointed to learn that they are living in a rural village, far from the excitement of Paris. His decision to live in France is mainly motivated by the hope of a better education for his children, but he also hopes to apply for French citizenship. Seyolo and his family struggle to adapt to new life as locals - unfamiliar with African professionals - fear newcomers, children are bullied at school, and Seyolo's practice struggles to survive as locals prefer to go to the next village whenever they need a doctor, instead of being visited by a \"wizard\". Seyolo and Anne have a heated argument in front of relatives who have come for a visit, during which Seyolo reluctantly promises that they will eventually move to Brussels, where some of their relatives live. However, Seyolo and his family end up winning the trust of the villagers, and his practice becomes a success after he delivers the baby to a local farmer.\n\nFollowing Seyolo's reputation and popularity, he tells the mayor that he wants to stay in Marly-Gomont for the long term. That same evening, the mayor and his wife are having dinner at the Zantokos' house, and the mayor mentions his happiness that Seyolo is in the village. Anne is shocked and angry at this revelation, for Seyolo had promised to move to Brussels and had not told Anne that he had accepted the mayor's request to stay in Marly-Gomont. Anne leaves to stay in Brussels with her family and the couple's relationship is in danger.\n\nMeanwhile, in Marly-Gomont, Seyolo is arrested by French police for immigration irregularities, days before his French citizenship application is approved, and he is forced to stop working. Anne finally returns and agrees to stay with Seyolo in Marly-Gomont. The only hope for Seyolo and his family is that the current mayor will be reelected, although his opponent, Lavigne, is leading the polls and is determined to prevent Seyolo from practicing in the village, preferring to hire a doctor of French origin. . However, Sivi is a talented soccer player and wins the hearts of the community, helping the local team make progress in the league alone. Seyolo and his children devise a plan to show residents that if Lavigne wins the election, the family will have to leave Marly-Gomont. Residents, upset over the prospect of losing the best football player, end up voting, and the incumbent mayor is reelected. Finally, the local school children play a play that re-enacts the arrival and eventual acceptance of Seyolo and his family, and they realize that they are loved by the entire community (except Lavigne, who leaves before the end of the show). Seyolo's office reopens and the family remains in Marly-Gomont.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Marc Zinga]] as Seyolo Zantoko\n* [[A\u00efssa Ma\u00efga]] as Anne Zantoko\n* Bayron Lebli as [[Kamini (musician)|Kamini Zantoko]]\n* M\u00e9dina Diarra as Sivi Zantoko\n* [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] as Jean\n* [[Jonathan Lambert (actor)|Jonathan Lambert]] as Lavigne\n* [[Mata Gabin]] as Mado\n* [[Sylvestre Amoussou]] as Uncle Beki\n* [[Riton Liebman]] as The driving teacher\n\n==See also==\n* [[Marly-Gomont (song)]], [[Kamini (musician)|Kamini]]'s ode to the small, rural village in Northern France where he grew up, Marly-Gomont.
