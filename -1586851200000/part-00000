She was [[Queen regent|regent]] of Spain during her husband's long travels in Europe during 1529-1533, 1535-1536 and 1538-1539. \n\nBorn to [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and [[Maria of Aragon]], Isabella was the granddaughter of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. Throughout her life, many compared her to her grandmother for her intelligence, character and determination in politics. Her personal motto was \"aut Caesar aut nihil\" ('either Cesar or nothing'). It was thanks to her governorships that Spain was able to remain independent of imperial policies.<ref>S. Jansen: The Monstrous Regiment of Women: Female Rulers in Early Modern Europe, 2002</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood===\nIsabella was born in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on October 24, 1503 and named after her maternal grandmother and [[Isabella of Asturias|aunt]], who had been her father's first wife. She was the second child and eldest daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and his second wife, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria of Aragon]]. Isabella was second-in-line to the throne until the birth of her brother [[Luis, Duke of Beja|Luis]] in 1506.\n\nIsabella was educated under the supervision of her mother and her governess, [[Elvira de Mendoza]]. She would progressively become an intelligent young woman, learning [[politics]], [[mathematics]], the languages of [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French]], [[Renaissance]] classics, and the Christian doctrine. In addition to all this, she was possessed a vast library composed of works for prayer and more mundane works which were of her taste, especially on [[cavalry]].\n\n===Engagement===\nAs the oldest daughter of Manuel I of Portugal, Isabella was a rather attractive candidate for marriage. Her mother left in her will, and in a clear message to her husband, the desire that the 14 years-old Isabella should marry only a king or the legitimate son of kings. The ideal candidate for Isabella's husband was her first cousin [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], son of Maria's sister, [[Joanna of Castile]], and [[Philip I of Castile]]. A marriage would bring a strong alliance between the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, in accordance with the wishes of their grandparents, Isabella and Ferdinand: It would facilitate to continue the exploration of the oceans without incurring clashes, as Portugal was the only naval power that could question Spain's supremacy in the Atlantic. As Charles was sovereign of multiple kingdoms, Spain needed allies and it was necessary that Portugal (Christendom's richest kingdom) fall under its orbit and not of France, which had happened in the [[War of Castilian Succession]]. Moreover, the nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood from the Iberian peninsula, just like Isabella.\n\nHowever, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice, instead sending his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father in 1518. Charles's Flemish advisors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], later convinced him to relegate the Portuguese alliance to the background and replace it with an alliance with England. In 1521, Charles became engaged to his other first cousin [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], daughter of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Catherine of Aragon]], who was sixteen years younger than Charles and still a child. Their engagement sought to undo an alliance between England and France, articulated by the ambitious Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]]. Many in Portugal took Isabella's rejection as an offence, but Isabella remained determined and hopeful that she would marry her powerful cousin: The choice was that she would marry only Charles or she would enter a convent.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could wait no longer for Mary Tudor to get older, as he was determined to have legitimate children. His engagement was called off, the alliance with England was abandoned, and Charles finally sought to marry Isabella. There were many more advantages - she was closer to him in age (she was only three years his junior), fluent in Spanish, and offered a handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds, which was more than enough to solve many of his economic and financial problems brought on by the [[Italian War of 1521-26]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=James D.|title=Emperor Charles V, Impresario of War : campaign strategy, international finance, and domestic politics|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|isbn=9780521814317|page=114|edition=}}</ref> The negotiations and marriage contract for an alliance with Portugal were made - Isabella would marry Charles and her brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]].\n\n==Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Spain==\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] after [[Titian]], 17th century]]\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Marriage and Honeymoon===\nIn January 1526, Isabella travelled to Spain. Upon her arrival, she met a by the [[Duke of Calabria]], the [[Archbishop of Toledo]] and the [[Duke of B\u00e9jar]] at the Spanish-Portuguese border. They escorted her to [[Seville]], where she was to wait for Charkes for a week. Their wedding took place that very same day just after midnight on 11 March in the Palace of [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]].<ref>{{cite book|last=MacQuarrie|first=Kim|title=The Last Days of the Incas|url=https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1416539352|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq/page/35 35]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Richard|title=A Hand-Book for Travellers in Spain, and Readers at Home: Describing the Country and Cities, the Natives and Their Manners|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1108037534|page=258}}</ref> \n\nAlthough their marriage was originally a political arrangement, Isabella captivated her husband with her charm and beauty. Following their wedding, the couple spent a long honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]] and records show that during their honeymoon \"when [Charles and Isabella] are together, although there are many people around, they do not notice anyone else; they talk and laugh, and nothing else distracts them.\"{{quote needs citation|date=August 2018}} Charkes ordered the seeds of a Persian flower, that had never been seen before in Spain, to be planted in the gardens of the Alhambra. The seeds eventually grew into the red carnation and Isabella was so delighted by the new flower that her husband ordered thousands more to be planted in her honour. The red carnation later became Spain's [[floral emblem]].\n\n===Regency===\n[[File:Isabel de Portugal, Pompeo Leoni.jpg|thumb|left|The bronze statue of Empress Isabella by [[Leone Leoni]], 1550-1555, that was commissioned by Charles V, on display at the [[El Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]].]]\n\nIsabella proved to be a very competent politician when she served as [[List of Spanish regents|regent of Spain]] during her husband's absences due to political affairs and [[wars]] abroad between 1529\u20131532 and 1535\u20131539. She attended meetings of the governing councils, consulted with the ministers, and eventually\ntook a more active role in the policy-making process. The Emperor was impressed with many of her accomplishments and decisions.\n\nAll the documentation of the time indicates{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} that Isabella was a profound connoisseur of the problems of the peninsular kingdoms, defending intransigently the good common to particular interests. At the external level, her sensible actions were decisive in the defence of the coasts of the peninsula and of [[North Africa]], those [[investment|invested]] by [[piracy]].\n\nDuring her time as regent, Isabella traveled a lot around Spain, defending the royal power and the monarch's supreme authority. She traveled regularly in the autumn between [[Toledo]], [[Valladolid]], Seville, [[Barcelona]] and [[Majorca]]. To deal with important matters of the empire, Charles and Isabella wrote to each other regularly. Sometimes, the Emperor didn't write for months, to the point that the Empress \"scolded\" him in one letter, saying that at least, she would write \"every twenty days.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Life at Court===\nWhen she heard that her husband was about to return, Isabella sent receptions with large parties. However, the time she was alone with her children, [[ladies-in-waiting]], and counselors of the court, she had a simpler life.\n\nIsabella ensured that their children's educations, especially that of her son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], were very completed. She even personally taught them her native language, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\n==Health and Death==\n{{cns|date=August 2018|text=Isabella suffered from [[tertian fever]]s, which became chronic later in her life. She also suffered several times from malaria, causing her health to be very fragile. Due to the very hot weather of Toledo and Seville, she spent the summers in the milder [[Avila, Spain|Avila]] because she suffered several times from illness. She had a total of seven pregnancies, out of which five were successful, and suffered two miscarriages. Her husband's absences caused her great loneliness, which some historians believe further weakened her delicate health.|reason=}} There is also speculation that Isabella may have suffered from consumption and its effects debilited her further. A contemporary described her not long before her death: \"The Empress is the greatest pity in the world; she is so thin as to not resemble a person.\"\n\nIn 1539, Isabella became pregnant for the seventh time, but in the third month of the pregnancy she contracted another fever that caused antenatal complications and gave birth to a stillborn son.

When Borgia conveyed Isabella's remains and saw the effects of [[decomposition]] on the beautiful empress, he decided to \"never again serve a mortal master\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After his own wife's death in 1541, Borgia retired from court and became a Jesuit priest.\n\nIn the aftermath, Charles locked himself up in a monastery for two months, where he prayed and mourned for his wife alone, but never recovered from Isabella's death; he never remarried and dressed in black for the rest of his life.

This was done in accordance with Charles's last will and testament, in which he left a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he and Isabella would be reburied together side by side, \"half-body under the altar and half under the priest's feet\".

She was [[Queen regent|regent]] of Spain during her husband's long travels in Europe during 1529-1533, 1535-1536 and 1538-1539. \n\nBorn to [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and [[Maria of Aragon]], Isabella was the granddaughter of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. Throughout her life, many compared her to her grandmother for her intelligence, character and determination in politics. Her personal motto was \"aut Caesar aut nihil\" ('either Cesar or nothing'). It was thanks to her governorships that Spain was able to remain independent of imperial policies.<ref>S. Jansen: The Monstrous Regiment of Women: Female Rulers in Early Modern Europe, 2002</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood===\nIsabella was born in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on October 24, 1503 and named after her maternal grandmother and [[Isabella of Asturias|aunt]], who had been her father's first wife. She was the second child and eldest daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and his second wife, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria of Aragon]]. Isabella was second-in-line to the throne until the birth of her brother [[Luis, Duke of Beja|Luis]] in 1506.\n\nIsabella was educated under the supervision of her mother and her governess, [[Elvira de Mendoza]]. She would progressively become an intelligent young woman, learning [[politics]], [[mathematics]], the languages of [[Latin]], [[Spanish]] and [[French]], [[Renaissance]] classics, and the Christian doctrine. In addition to all this, she was possessed a vast library composed of works for prayer and more mundane works which were of her taste, especially on [[cavalry]].\n\n===Engagement===\nAs the oldest daughter of Manuel I of Portugal, Isabella was a rather attractive candidate for marriage. Her mother left in her will, and in a clear message to her husband, the desire that the 14 years-old Isabella should marry only a king or the legitimate son of kings. The ideal candidate for Isabella's husband was her first cousin [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], son of Maria's sister, [[Joanna of Castile]], and [[Philip I of Castile]]. A marriage would bring a strong alliance between the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, in accordance with the wishes of their grandparents, Isabella and Ferdinand: It would facilitate to continue the exploration of the oceans without incurring clashes, as Portugal was the only naval power that could question Spain's supremacy in the Atlantic. As Charles was sovereign of multiple kingdoms, Spain needed allies and it was necessary that Portugal (Christendom's richest kingdom) fall under its orbit and not of France, which had happened in the [[War of Castilian Succession]]. Moreover, the nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood from the Iberian peninsula, just like Isabella.\n\nHowever, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice, instead sending his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father in 1518. Charles's Flemish advisors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], later convinced him to relegate the Portuguese alliance to the background and replace it with an alliance with England. In 1521, Charles became engaged to his other first cousin [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], daughter of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Catherine of Aragon]], who was sixteen years younger than Charles and still a child. Their engagement sought to undo an alliance between England and France, articulated by the ambitious Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]]. Many in Portugal took Isabella's rejection as an offence, but Isabella remained determined and hopeful that she would marry her powerful cousin: The choice was that she would marry only Charles or she would enter a convent.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could wait no longer for Mary Tudor to get older, as he was determined to have legitimate children. His engagement was called off, the alliance with England was abandoned, and Charles finally sought to marry Isabella. There were many more advantages - she was closer to him in age (she was only three years his junior), fluent in Spanish, and offered a handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds, which was more than enough to solve many of his economic and financial problems brought on by the [[Italian War of 1521-26]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=James D.|title=Emperor Charles V, Impresario of War : campaign strategy, international finance, and domestic politics|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|isbn=9780521814317|page=114|edition=}}</ref> The negotiations and marriage contract for an alliance with Portugal were made - Isabella would marry Charles and her brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]].\n\n==Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Spain==\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] after [[Titian]], 17th century]]\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Marriage and Honeymoon===\nIn January 1526, Isabella travelled to Spain. Upon her arrival, she met a by the [[Duke of Calabria]], the [[Archbishop of Toledo]] and the [[Duke of B\u00e9jar]] at the Spanish-Portuguese border. They escorted her to [[Seville]], where she was to wait for Charkes for a week. Their wedding took place that very same day just after midnight on 11 March in the Palace of [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]].<ref>{{cite book|last=MacQuarrie|first=Kim|title=The Last Days of the Incas|url=https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1416539352|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq/page/35 35]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Richard|title=A Hand-Book for Travellers in Spain, and Readers at Home: Describing the Country and Cities, the Natives and Their Manners|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1108037534|page=258}}</ref> \n\nAlthough their marriage was originally a political arrangement, Isabella captivated her husband with her charm and beauty. Following their wedding, the couple spent a long honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]] and records show that during their honeymoon \"when [Charles and Isabella] are together, although there are many people around, they do not notice anyone else; they talk and laugh, and nothing else distracts them.\"{{quote needs citation|date=August 2018}} Charkes ordered the seeds of a Persian flower, that had never been seen before in Spain, to be planted in the gardens of the Alhambra. The seeds eventually grew into the red carnation and Isabella was so delighted by the new flower that her husband ordered thousands more to be planted in her honour. The red carnation later became Spain's [[floral emblem]].\n\n===Regency===\n[[File:Isabel de Portugal, Pompeo Leoni.jpg|thumb|left|The bronze statue of Empress Isabella by [[Leone Leoni]], 1550-1555, that was commissioned by Charles V, on display at the [[El Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]].]]\n\nIsabella proved to be a very competent politician when she served as [[List of Spanish regents|regent of Spain]] during her husband's absences due to political affairs and [[wars]] abroad between 1529\u20131532 and 1535\u20131539. She attended meetings of the governing councils, consulted with the ministers, and eventually\ntook a more active role in the policy-making process. The Emperor was impressed with many of her accomplishments and decisions.\n\nAll the documentation of the time indicates{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} that Isabella was a profound connoisseur of the problems of the peninsular kingdoms, defending intransigently the good common to particular interests. At the external level, her sensible actions were decisive in the defence of the coasts of the peninsula and of [[North Africa]], those [[investment|invested]] by [[piracy]].\n\nDuring her time as regent, Isabella traveled a lot around Spain, defending the royal power and the monarch's supreme authority. She traveled regularly in the autumn between [[Toledo]], [[Valladolid]], Seville, [[Barcelona]] and [[Majorca]]. To deal with important matters of the empire, Charles and Isabella wrote to each other regularly. Sometimes, the Emperor didn't write for months, to the point that the Empress \"scolded\" him in one letter, saying that at least, she would write \"every twenty days.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Life at Court===\nWhen she heard that her husband was about to return, Isabella sent receptions with large parties. However, the time she was alone with her children, [[ladies-in-waiting]], and counselors of the court, she had a simpler life.\n\nIsabella ensured that their children's educations, especially that of her son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], were very completed. She even personally taught them her native language, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\n==Health and Death==\n{{cns|date=August 2018|text=Isabella suffered from [[tertian fever]]s, which became chronic later in her life. She also suffered several times from malaria, causing her health to be very fragile. Due to the very hot weather of Toledo and Seville, she spent the summers in the milder [[Avila, Spain|Avila]] because she suffered several times from illness. She had a total of seven pregnancies, out of which five were successful, and suffered two miscarriages. Her husband's absences caused her great loneliness, which some historians believe further weakened her delicate health.|reason=}} There is also speculation that Isabella may have suffered from consumption and its effects debilited her further. A contemporary described her not long before her death: \"The Empress is the greatest pity in the world; she is so thin as to not resemble a person.\"\n\nIn 1539, Isabella became pregnant for the seventh time, but in the third month of the pregnancy she contracted another fever that caused antenatal complications and gave birth to a stillborn son.

Instead, he instructed their son Philip to accompany his mother's body with [[Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda]]. When Borgia conveyed Isabella's remains and saw the effects of [[decomposition]] on the beautiful empress, he decided to \"never again serve a mortal master\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After his own wife's death in 1541, Borgia retired from court and became a Jesuit priest.\n\nIn the aftermath, Charles locked himself up in a monastery for two months, where he prayed and mourned for his wife alone, but never recovered from Isabella's death; he never remarried and dressed in black for the rest of his life. He died on 21 September 1558, holding in his hand the cross that his wife had been holding when she died.\n\n===Post-mortem Tributes and Reburials===\n[[File:La Gloria (Tiziano).jpg|thumb|right|Titian's ''La Gloria'', one of the several paintings commissioned by Charles V in memory of his wife Isabella]]\nIn memory of Isabella, Charles commissioned several tributes through art and music, beginning in 1540 when he commissioned the Flemish composer [[Thomas Crecquillon]] to compose new music in honour of the Empress. Crecquillon composed his ''Missa Mort m'a priv\u00e9'' as a memorial to Isabella, which expresses the Emperor's grief and great wish for a heavenly reunion with his beloved wife.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.brabantensemble.com/discography/thomas-crecquillon-missa-mort-ma-prive-motets-and-chansons/|title= Thomas Crecquillon: Missa 'Mort m\u2019a priv\u00e9', motets and chansons|last=Ham |first=Martin |date=2006 |website= The Brabant Ensemble| access-date=23 October 2018}}\n</ref> Another musical tribute to Isabella is ''Carole cur defles Isabellam'' that was composed in 1545 by the Franco-Flemish composer [[Nicolas Payen]].\n\nIn 1543, Charles commissioned his favourite painter [[Titian]] to paint posthumous portraits of Isabella by using earlier ones of her as his model. Titian painted several portraits of the Empress, which included his ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal|Portrait of The Empress Isabel of Portugal]]'' and ''[[La Gloria (Titian)|La Gloria]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-glory/66149817-6f88-4e5f-a09a-81f63a84d145|title= The Glory.  1551 \u2013 1554.

This was done in accordance with Charles's last will and testament, in which he left a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he and Isabella would be reburied together side by side, \"half-body under the altar and half under the priest's feet\". They remained in the Royal Chapel while the famous Basilica of the Monastery and the Royal Crypt were still under construction.\n\nIn 1654, after the Basilica and Royal Crypt were finally completed during the reign of their great-grandson [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], the remains of Charles and Isabella were moved into the Royal Pantheon of Kings, which lies directly under the Basilica.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.delacuadra.net/escorial/textos/1997c-a-panteo.pdf |title=A-Panteo.Pdf |date= |accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref> On one side of the Basilica are bronze effigies of Charles and Isabella, with effigies of their daughter [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Maria of Austria]] and Charles's sisters, [[Eleanor of Austria]] and [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Maria of Hungary]], behind them.

Because of its central location between these two cities Ladbergen is well accessible by the ''[[Autobahn]]'' (motorway/freeway) A 1 (Ladbergen junction) and the ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' (federal highway) B 475. The [[Dortmund-Ems Canal]] (canal port Ladbergen) situated on the western municipal border and [[M\u00fcnster Osnabr\u00fcck International Airport]] (FMO) are located a few kilometers from the centre of Ladbergen.\nUnlike the name part of \"bergen\" suggests, Ladbergen offers no mountainous or hilly landscape, but is situated at a relatively uniform level between {{convert|48.1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|55.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} with a mean elevation of {{convert|51.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.\nTwo streams flow through Ladbergen, the [[Ladbergen Aa]] and the [[Ladbergen M\u00fchlenbach]] that both flow eventually into the [[Glane (Ems)|Glane stream]].\n\nThe municipality Ladbergen is subdivided in the village(centre) and the surrounding rural areas H\u00f6lter, Wester and Overbeck.\n\n===Neighboring municipalities and towns===\nLadbergen borders on:\n*[[Tecklenburg]]\n*[[Lengerich (Westfalen)|Lengerich]]\n*[[Lienen]]\n*[[Ostbevern]]\n*[[Greven]]\n*[[Saerbeck]]\n\n==Population==\nWith a population of 6,370 (census of 30 June 2011) Ladbergen is the second smallest independent municipality in the [[Steinfurt (district)|district of Steinfurt]] (just before [[Laer]] with 6,298 inhabitants). 3,221 women and 3,149 men were living in the municipality.\nThe camping facilities offer about 700 more people a second home in Ladbergen.\n\nRegarding religion the largest part of the population is Protestant ([[Lutheranism]]), a smaller part is Roman Catholic.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ladbergen Dorfstrasse 4.JPG|right|thumb|222px|Restaurant in a [[timber framing|half-timbered]] house]]\n[[File:Ladbergen, Zentrum, 1000-Jahr-Stein.jpg|thumb|950 - 1950, 1000 years-stone, Ladbergen.]]\n[[File:Ladbergen, Zentrum, Afrouper.jpg|thumb| Bronze sculpture of a historic ''Afrouper'' (community messenger).

Ladbergen got mentioned first in 950 in a certificate of the Freckenhorst [[monastery]].\n\nIn the year 1149, the municipality was assigned as an independent parish by the [[Diocese of M\u00fcnster]]. In 1170 the parish was taken over by the [[Diocese of Osnabr\u00fcck]].\n\nIn 1246 the ''Ladberger Marktbund'' (Ladbergen Marketfederation) was founded by representatives of the cities [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], [[Minden]] and [[Herford]]. This was a precursor of other forms of cooperation in Westphalia and the [[Hanseatic League]].\n\nAround 1400, the western parts of the community were lost to the Diocese of M\u00fcnster.\nAs a result, the population of Ladbergen until after World War II remained religiously almost exclusively Protestant (Lutheranism).\n\nIn the year 1650 Ladbergen gained political autonomy for the first time. In 1707 Ladbergen with the entire Duchy of [[Tecklenburg]] got incorporated into the Kingdom of [[Prussia]]. After 1816 Ladbergen belonged to the ''Landkreis M\u00fcnster'' and was later assigned to the ''Landkreis Tecklenburg''.\n\nIn 1855 Ladbergen lost its political autonomy, and was administratively unified with the village [[Brochterbeck]]. This situation remained unchanged up to 1907, when Ladbergen was assigned to Tecklenburg.\n\nDuring World War II the vicinity of Ladbergen was heavily bombed.<ref>[http://www.bomberhistory.co.uk/Canal%20raids/Ladeffects.html The Effect on the Local Communities \"When the canal is full then it is time to be careful\"...old Ladbergen saying.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911003108/http://www.bomberhistory.co.uk/Canal%20raids/Ladeffects.html |date=11 September 2011 }}</ref> Allied bombers tried to destroy the Dortmund-Ems Canal [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s near Ladbergen, where the canal passes over the M\u00fchlenbach to render the canal useless for extended periods.[<ref>[http://www.bomberhistory.co.uk/Canal%20raids/Ladbergen%20widening.html The Dortmund-Ems Canal at Ladbergen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911002809/http://www.bomberhistory.co.uk/Canal%20raids/Ladbergen%20widening.html |date=11 September 2011 }}</ref> To defend the canal there were two heavy [[10.5 cm FlaK 38|105 mm]] [[Flak]] locations in Ladbergen, supported by smaller anti-aircraft guns. Batteries of 105&nbsp;mm guns were usually left to defend major cities. This indicates the importance of the canal to the overall German war effort. Besides bombs and downed airplanes shrapnel fell onto Ladbergen during the air raids causing loses in property and lives. The air raids did not result in the destruction of the targeted aqueducts, but [[Tallboy bomb]]s dropped by [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] did breach the canal banks on 23/24 September 1944.<ref name=diary>{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/diary.html |title=Campaign Diary |work=Royal Air Force Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |accessdate=24 May 2007 |publisher=UK Crown |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/diary.html |archivedate= 6 July 2007 }} 1944: [http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/sep44.html September] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314224553/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/sep44.html |date=14 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1949 Ladbergen regained its political autonomy. In January 1975 Ladbergen was transferred from the then dissolved [[Tecklenburg (district)|district of Tecklenburg]] into the newly founded [[Steinfurt (district)|district of Steinfurt]].\n\n===Noticeable facts===\n[[File:Ladberger M\u00fchle.jpg|thumb|A watermill besides the M\u00fchlenbach.]]\n\n* About 37% of the population of the village emigrated during the 19th century. This was the highest emigration rate in Germany during that era.\n* Peasants from Ladbergen often gained extra income by working in the [[Netherlands]] for extended periods.\n* Many families from Ladbergen have family names, which in the recent past only existed in Ladbergen \u2013 such as Gehde, Rahmeier, Schoppenhorst, Wibbeler, Wiethaupt and Wieth\u00f6lter.\n* The predominant spoken language in Ladbergen was up to the 1930s almost exclusively ''Ladbergen Platt'', a variant of the established [[Low German]] dialects. A 2009 survey concluded that just over 700 of the original inhabitants (11% of the population) still can speak this local dialect, though actively speaking the dialect is mostly reserved to the over-70-year-olds.<ref>[http://www.westfaelische-nachrichten.de/lokales/kreis_steinfurt/ladbergen/1020551_Plattdeutsch_auf_der_roten_Liste.html \u201ePlattdeutsch auf der roten Liste\u201c Westf\u00e4lische Nachrichten 9 April 2009 by Erhard Kurlemann {{in lang|de}}]</ref><ref>[http://www.westfaelische-nachrichten.de/lokales/kreis_steinfurt/ladbergen/1021495_aes_alle_Katten_noa_gries_woern.html \"\u00c4s alle Katten noa gries w\u00f6rn\" Westf\u00e4lische Nachrichten 8 April 2009 by Erhard Kurlemann {{in lang|de}}]</ref>\n* Since the founding of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the year 1949, Ladbergen is one of the \"strongholds\" of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] in the [[M\u00fcnsterland]] and throughout Germany.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Ladbergen Biogasanlage.JPG|thumb|Anaerobic digestion plant at the Telgter Damm.]]\n[[File:Ladbergen wind turbines 2.jpg|thumb|REpower MM82 wind turbines near the M\u00fcnsterweg.]]\n[[File:Ladbergen, Buddenkuhle -- 2014 -- 9822.jpg|thumb|Camping facilities at the Buddenkuhle.]]\n\nFor centuries the economy of Ladbergen was based on agriculture. The introduction of [[fertilizer]] in the 20th century enabled the local [[peasant]]s \u2013 who up to that moment had to deal with infertile sandy soil that yielded modest [[harvest]]s \u2013 to escape from poverty. The infrastructural improvements and urbanization of the village after World War II and the [[Wirtschaftswunder|West German ''Wirtschaftswunder'']] created new jobs in trade, industry, transport, tourism and the [[service sector]] and [[commuters]] settled in Ladbergen. These developments diversified and boosted the economic development of Ladbergen. The last decades the municipality itself also profited from the establishment of new successful businesses and companies in Ladbergen and general prosperity amongst its citizens, by a steady increase in local taxes revenues. This enabled the municipality to invest in the local infrastructure, education and (social) services for its citizens.\n\n===Energy supply===\nIn 2005 a wind farm consisting of three [[REpower]] MM82 [[wind turbine]]s was erected on the outskirts of Ladbergen.<ref>[http://www.repower.de/fileadmin/download/produkte/08_09_References_English.pdf REpower References]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Each of these MM82 wind turbines has a {{convert|80.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} hub height and {{convert|82.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} rotor diameter giving a total sweep of {{convert|5281|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} and an average power capacity of 2.050&nbsp;kW.

The post may be said to be a professional one, the mayor being the head of the local government, and requiring, in order to be eligible, a training in administration.\n\nThe most recent election for mayor was conducted on 28 May 2014. Out of two candidates the independent candidate Mr. Udo Decker-K\u00f6nig was reelected as mayor of Ladbergen.<ref>[http://www.ladbergen.de/pics/medien/1_1401266864/2014-bgm_ges.pdf Mayor election Ladbergen]</ref>\n\nAs first ''[[deputy mayor|Stellvertretende B\u00fcrgermeister]]'' (deputy mayor) the town council elected Mr. Hartmut Kotlewski (CDU).

On the [[heath (habitat)|heath]] and [[moorland]] of Ladbergen beekeeping was widespread for centuries. According to a historic certificate honey farmers from Ladbergen had to pay taxes to the monastery Freckenhorst in the year 950.\n\nThe three [[Nymphaea]] or water lilies come from the seal of the Lord of Ladbergen from the year 1324. The water lilies symbol originates from the Duchy [[Lingen]], to which Ladbergen belonged during a medieval period. The leaf shape has its origin in the coat of arms of the Counts of [[Tecklenburg]].\n\n==Sister village==\n*{{flagicon|United States}} [[New Knoxville]], [[Ohio]], United States\nA lot of [[emigrants]] originating from Ladbergen settled down in the area around [[New Knoxville]] in the state of [[Ohio]] in the United States with which Ladbergen established a town partnership. New Knoxville is partly composed of the descendants of the Ladbergen emigrants. The typical ''Ladbergen Platt'' dialect is still spoken by some of the older citizens whose ancestors originated from Ladbergen.<ref name=\"multiref1\">[http://www.ladbergen.de/pics/medien/1_1145358363/ladbergenhistoryA5.pdf Official website of the municipality of Ladbergen \u2013 The history of Ladbergen]</ref>\n\nDue to the interest of American descendants of emigrants from Ladbergen in their family [[genealogy]], more or less reliable private genealogical work was conducted after World War II. As [[Neil Armstrong]], whose [[great-grandfather]] Friedrich Wilhelm K\u00f6tter emigrated from Ladbergen to the United States in 1864, was the first man to walk on the moon in 1969, many citizens of Ladbergen became interested in their American \"relatives\".

The [[Dortmund-Ems Canal]] (canal port Ladbergen) situated on the western municipal border and [[M\u00fcnster Osnabr\u00fcck International Airport]] (FMO) are located a few kilometers from the centre of Ladbergen.\nUnlike the name part of \"bergen\" suggests, Ladbergen offers no mountainous or hilly landscape, but is situated at a relatively uniform level between {{convert|48.1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|55.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} with a mean elevation of {{convert|51.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.\nTwo streams flow through Ladbergen, the [[Ladbergen Aa]] and the [[Ladbergen M\u00fchlenbach]] that both flow eventually into the [[Glane (Ems)|Glane stream]].\n\nThe municipality Ladbergen is subdivided in the village(centre) and the surrounding rural areas H\u00f6lter, Wester and Overbeck.\n\n===Neighboring municipalities and towns===\nLadbergen borders on:\n*[[Tecklenburg]]\n*[[Lengerich (Westfalen)|Lengerich]]\n*[[Lienen]]\n*[[Ostbevern]]\n*[[Greven]]\n*[[Saerbeck]]\n\n==Population==\nWith a population of 6,370 (census of 30 June 2011) Ladbergen is the second smallest independent municipality in the [[Steinfurt (district)|district of Steinfurt]] (just before [[Laer]] with 6,298 inhabitants). 3,221 women and 3,149 men were living in the municipality.\nThe camping facilities offer about 700 more people a second home in Ladbergen.\n\nRegarding religion the largest part of the population is Protestant ([[Lutheranism]]), a smaller part is Roman Catholic.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ladbergen Dorfstrasse 4.JPG|right|thumb|222px|Restaurant in a [[timber framing|half-timbered]] house]]\n[[File:Ladbergen, Zentrum, 1000-Jahr-Stein.jpg|thumb|950 - 1950, 1000 years-stone, Ladbergen.]]\n[[File:Ladbergen, Zentrum, Afrouper.jpg|thumb| Bronze sculpture of a historic ''Afrouper'' (community messenger).

Ladbergen got mentioned first in 950 in a certificate of the Freckenhorst [[monastery]].\n\nIn the year 1149, the municipality was assigned as an independent parish by the [[Diocese of M\u00fcnster]]. In 1170 the parish was taken over by the [[Diocese of Osnabr\u00fcck]].\n\nIn 1246 the ''Ladberger Marktbund'' (Ladbergen Marketfederation) was founded by representatives of the cities [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], [[Minden]] and [[Herford]]. This was a precursor of other forms of cooperation in Westphalia and the [[Hanseatic League]].\n\nAround 1400, the western parts of the community were lost to the Diocese of M\u00fcnster.\nAs a result, the population of Ladbergen until after World War II remained religiously almost exclusively Protestant (Lutheranism).\n\nIn the year 1650 Ladbergen gained political autonomy for the first time. In 1707 Ladbergen with the entire Duchy of [[Tecklenburg]] got incorporated into the Kingdom of [[Prussia]]. After 1816 Ladbergen belonged to the ''Landkreis M\u00fcnster'' and was later assigned to the ''Landkreis Tecklenburg''.\n\nIn 1855 Ladbergen lost its political autonomy, and was administratively unified with the village [[Brochterbeck]]. This situation remained unchanged up to 1907, when Ladbergen was assigned to Tecklenburg.\n\nDuring World War II the vicinity of Ladbergen was heavily bombed.<ref>[http://www.bomberhistory.co.uk/Canal%20raids/Ladeffects.html The Effect on the Local Communities \"When the canal is full then it is time to be careful\"...old Ladbergen saying.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911003108/http://www.bomberhistory.co.uk/Canal%20raids/Ladeffects.html |date=11 September 2011 }}</ref> Allied bombers tried to destroy the Dortmund-Ems Canal [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s near Ladbergen, where the canal passes over the M\u00fchlenbach to render the canal useless for extended periods.[<ref>[http://www.bomberhistory.co.uk/Canal%20raids/Ladbergen%20widening.html The Dortmund-Ems Canal at Ladbergen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911002809/http://www.bomberhistory.co.uk/Canal%20raids/Ladbergen%20widening.html |date=11 September 2011 }}</ref> To defend the canal there were two heavy [[10.5 cm FlaK 38|105 mm]] [[Flak]] locations in Ladbergen, supported by smaller anti-aircraft guns. Batteries of 105&nbsp;mm guns were usually left to defend major cities. This indicates the importance of the canal to the overall German war effort. Besides bombs and downed airplanes shrapnel fell onto Ladbergen during the air raids causing loses in property and lives. The air raids did not result in the destruction of the targeted aqueducts, but [[Tallboy bomb]]s dropped by [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] did breach the canal banks on 23/24 September 1944.<ref name=diary>{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/diary.html |title=Campaign Diary |work=Royal Air Force Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |accessdate=24 May 2007 |publisher=UK Crown |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/diary.html |archivedate= 6 July 2007 }} 1944: [http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/sep44.html September] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314224553/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/sep44.html |date=14 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1949 Ladbergen regained its political autonomy. In January 1975 Ladbergen was transferred from the then dissolved [[Tecklenburg (district)|district of Tecklenburg]] into the newly founded [[Steinfurt (district)|district of Steinfurt]].\n\n===Noticeable facts===\n[[File:Ladberger M\u00fchle.jpg|thumb|A watermill besides the M\u00fchlenbach.]]\n\n* About 37% of the population of the village emigrated during the 19th century. This was the highest emigration rate in Germany during that era.\n* Peasants from Ladbergen often gained extra income by working in the [[Netherlands]] for extended periods.\n* Many families from Ladbergen have family names, which in the recent past only existed in Ladbergen \u2013 such as Gehde, Rahmeier, Schoppenhorst, Wibbeler, Wiethaupt and Wieth\u00f6lter.\n* The predominant spoken language in Ladbergen was up to the 1930s almost exclusively ''Ladbergen Platt'', a variant of the established [[Low German]] dialects. A 2009 survey concluded that just over 700 of the original inhabitants (11% of the population) still can speak this local dialect, though actively speaking the dialect is mostly reserved to the over-70-year-olds.<ref>[http://www.westfaelische-nachrichten.de/lokales/kreis_steinfurt/ladbergen/1020551_Plattdeutsch_auf_der_roten_Liste.html \u201ePlattdeutsch auf der roten Liste\u201c Westf\u00e4lische Nachrichten 9 April 2009 by Erhard Kurlemann {{in lang|de}}]</ref><ref>[http://www.westfaelische-nachrichten.de/lokales/kreis_steinfurt/ladbergen/1021495_aes_alle_Katten_noa_gries_woern.html \"\u00c4s alle Katten noa gries w\u00f6rn\" Westf\u00e4lische Nachrichten 8 April 2009 by Erhard Kurlemann {{in lang|de}}]</ref>\n* Since the founding of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the year 1949, Ladbergen is one of the \"strongholds\" of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] in the [[M\u00fcnsterland]] and throughout Germany.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Ladbergen Biogasanlage.JPG|thumb|Anaerobic digestion plant at the Telgter Damm.]]\n[[File:Ladbergen wind turbines 2.jpg|thumb|REpower MM82 wind turbines near the M\u00fcnsterweg.]]\n[[File:Ladbergen, Buddenkuhle -- 2014 -- 9822.jpg|thumb|Camping facilities at the Buddenkuhle.]]\n\nFor centuries the economy of Ladbergen was based on agriculture. The introduction of [[fertilizer]] in the 20th century enabled the local [[peasant]]s \u2013 who up to that moment had to deal with infertile sandy soil that yielded modest [[harvest]]s \u2013 to escape from poverty. The infrastructural improvements and urbanization of the village after World War II and the [[Wirtschaftswunder|West German ''Wirtschaftswunder'']] created new jobs in trade, industry, transport, tourism and the [[service sector]] and [[commuters]] settled in Ladbergen. These developments diversified and boosted the economic development of Ladbergen. The last decades the municipality itself also profited from the establishment of new successful businesses and companies in Ladbergen and general prosperity amongst its citizens, by a steady increase in local taxes revenues. This enabled the municipality to invest in the local infrastructure, education and (social) services for its citizens.\n\n===Energy supply===\nIn 2005 a wind farm consisting of three [[REpower]] MM82 [[wind turbine]]s was erected on the outskirts of Ladbergen.<ref>[http://www.repower.de/fileadmin/download/produkte/08_09_References_English.pdf REpower References]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Each of these MM82 wind turbines has a {{convert|80.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} hub height and {{convert|82.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} rotor diameter giving a total sweep of {{convert|5281|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} and an average power capacity of 2.050&nbsp;kW.

The mayor is elected for a 5-year term and regular elections are held every five years. The post may be said to be a professional one, the mayor being the head of the local government, and requiring, in order to be eligible, a training in administration.\n\nThe most recent election for mayor was conducted on 28 May 2014. Out of two candidates the independent candidate Mr. Udo Decker-K\u00f6nig was reelected as mayor of Ladbergen.<ref>[http://www.ladbergen.de/pics/medien/1_1401266864/2014-bgm_ges.pdf Mayor election Ladbergen]</ref>\n\nAs first ''[[deputy mayor|Stellvertretende B\u00fcrgermeister]]'' (deputy mayor) the town council elected Mr. Hartmut Kotlewski (CDU).

On the [[heath (habitat)|heath]] and [[moorland]] of Ladbergen beekeeping was widespread for centuries. According to a historic certificate honey farmers from Ladbergen had to pay taxes to the monastery Freckenhorst in the year 950.\n\nThe three [[Nymphaea]] or water lilies come from the seal of the Lord of Ladbergen from the year 1324. The water lilies symbol originates from the Duchy [[Lingen]], to which Ladbergen belonged during a medieval period. The leaf shape has its origin in the coat of arms of the Counts of [[Tecklenburg]].\n\n==Sister village==\n*{{flagicon|United States}} [[New Knoxville]], [[Ohio]], United States\nA lot of [[emigrants]] originating from Ladbergen settled down in the area around [[New Knoxville]] in the state of [[Ohio]] in the United States with which Ladbergen established a town partnership. New Knoxville is partly composed of the descendants of the Ladbergen emigrants. The typical ''Ladbergen Platt'' dialect is still spoken by some of the older citizens whose ancestors originated from Ladbergen.<ref name=\"multiref1\">[http://www.ladbergen.de/pics/medien/1_1145358363/ladbergenhistoryA5.pdf Official website of the municipality of Ladbergen \u2013 The history of Ladbergen]</ref>\n\nDue to the interest of American descendants of emigrants from Ladbergen in their family [[genealogy]], more or less reliable private genealogical work was conducted after World War II. As [[Neil Armstrong]], whose [[great-grandfather]] Friedrich Wilhelm K\u00f6tter emigrated from Ladbergen to the United States in 1864, was the first man to walk on the moon in 1969, many citizens of Ladbergen became interested in their American \"relatives\".
