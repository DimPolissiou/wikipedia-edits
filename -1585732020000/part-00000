On 10 March<ref name=hill/> the French expedition, having taken on water and wood, left Botany Bay, never to be seen again. Phillip and La P\u00e9rouse never met. La P\u00e9rouse is remembered in [[La Perouse, New South Wales|a Sydney suburb]] of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this voyage.\n\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \"passengers\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020292b.htm?hilite=Arthur%3BPhillip Biography \u2013 Arthur Phillip \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography].

This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition led by [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 D'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \"Botany Bay\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\".<ref>David Collins, ''An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales,'' London, Vol.I, 1798, p.502</ref>\n\n===Convicts and free settlers===\nWhen the ''Bellona'' transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS ''Sirius''; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the ''Sirius''), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the ''Juliana'' transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\n\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \"Liberty Plains\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\n\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the [[Irish republicanism|political]] and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting\u2014few of the first-wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\n\n[[File:Poster australia NZ 1788 1911 shepherd 1923.png|thumb|right|A historical map of Australia and New Zealand 1788\u20131911]]\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' [[penal servitude]], or \"for the term of their natural lives\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anne Summers |title=Damned Whores and God's Police |year=1975 |location=[[Ringwood, Victoria|Ringwood]], Victoria |isbn=978-0-14-021832-9 |pages= 270\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] or the [[Parramatta Female Factory]].\n\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Moreton Bay]], for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at [[Norfolk Island]] was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\n\nIn 1789 former convict [[James Ruse]] produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30-acre grant at Rose Hill, near [[Parramatta]], was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Farms|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/agriculture/life/farms/index.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\n\n[[File:Castle hill irish rebellion of 1804 australia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804]]\nIn 1804 the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the [[New South Wales Corps]]. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor [[William Bligh|Bligh]] led by [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]]. Following this, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\n\n* '''13 May 1787''' \u2013 The 11 ships of the [[First Fleet]] leave Portsmouth under the command of Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. Different accounts give varying numbers of passengers but the fleet consisted of at least 1,350 persons of whom 780 were convicts and 570 were free men, women and children and the number included four companies of marines. About 20% of the convicts were women and the oldest convict was 82. About 50% of the convicts had been tried in Middlesex and most of the rest were tried in the county assizes of Devon, Kent and Sussex\n* '''18 January 1788''' \u2013 The First Fleet arrived in [[Botany Bay]] but the landing party was not impressed with the site, and moved the fleet to [[Port Jackson]], landing in [[Sydney Cove]] on 26 January 1788 (now celebrated as [[Australia Day]]).\n* ''' April 1789''' \u2013 an outbreak of smallpox decimates local tribes.\n* '''1790''' \u2013 the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] of convicts arrives in Sydney Cove.\n* '''1791''' \u2013 [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] of convicts arrives\n* '''1793''' \u2013 January: the first free settlers arrive in NSW.\n* '''1793''' \u2013 March\u2013April: visit of the expedition led by [[Alessandro Malaspina]].\n* '''1825''' - May: Founding of [[Brisbane]]\n* '''14 June 1825''' \u2013 the colony of [[Van Diemen's Land]] is established in its own right; its name is officially changed to [[Tasmania]] on 1 January 1856. The first settlement was made at [[Risdon, Tasmania]] on 11 September 1803 when Lt. John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804. Lt.-Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at [[Hobart]] in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people, including 178 convicts. (Collins had previously attempted a settlement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803\u20131853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania. About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts. Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies. The ''Indefatigable'' brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony. By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females. About 1,448 held [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as \"absconded or missing\". In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain-gangs at the penal station at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] which operated from 1830 to 1877. Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen's Land from Sydney and, in later years, from 1841 to 1847, from Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1840, there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen's Land to [[Norfolk Island]] and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''21 January 1827''' \u2013 Western Australia was created when a small British settlement was established at King George's Sound ([[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]) by Major Edmund Lockyer in order to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area. On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed, with [[Captain James Stirling]] as the first Governor. Except for the settlement at King George's Sound, the colony was never really a part of NSW. King George's Sound was handed over in 1831. In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, became the colony's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders. Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony aboard 43 ships between 1850 and 1868. The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region. On 9 January 1868, Australia's last convict ship, the ''Hougoumont'' brought its final cargo of 269 convicts. Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6, 7, 10, 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75% as opposed to 50% for those sent to NSW and Tasmania. About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time.\n* '''1835''' \u2013 the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835, implements the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' upon which British settlement was based. Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no-one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it, it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples (e.g. that signed by [[John Batman]]). Its publication in the Colony means that from then on, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown.<ref>[http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/bourketerra/ Governor Bourke\u2019s 1835 Proclamation of Terra Nullius | Australia's migration history timeline | NSW Migration Heritage Centre].

In 1842 it became a crown colony and on 22 July 1861 its area was extended westwards to its present boundary and more area was taken from New South Wales. South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836 and 1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area. Twenty-four thousand and nine hundred more arrived between 1841 and 1850. Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies. On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia, and being under sentence of transportation, were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land, by the first opportunity.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31749645 |title=Proclamation |newspaper=[[South Australian Register|South Australian Gazette And Colonial Register]] |location=South Australia |date=3 June 1837 |access-date=19 March 2020 |page=1 |via=Trove}}</ref>\n* '''1841''' \u2013 [[New Zealand]] is separated from New South Wales\n* '''1851''' \u2013 [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is separated from New South Wales (formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW). Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s, the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut. David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts. Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804. He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837. The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839. Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826, the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the \"Exiles\" and they arrived between 1844 and 1849. They were sometimes called the \"Pentonvillians\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England. Many ex-convicts and convicts on tickets of leave and conditional pardons also moved to Port Phillip from Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''10 December 1859''' \u2013 [[Queensland]] is [[Separation of Queensland|separated from New South Wales]]. In 1824 the explorer Lt. [[John Oxley]] took a party of 30 convicts and established a penal colony at Redcliffe. Known as the Moreton Bay Settlement, this later moved to the site now called Brisbane. The name Brisbane Town was in use by 1825 and the main inhabitants in the area were the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Station until it was closed in 1839. Around 2,280 convicts were sent to the settlement between 1824 and 1839 and at the end of 1836 the convict population numbered 337. The first free settlers moved to the district in 1838 and others followed in 1840.\n* '''23 December 1862''' \u2013 the area of Queensland is increased.\n* '''1863''' \u2013 control of the [[Northern Territory]] is granted to the Province (later State) of South Australia.

One was [[D'Arcy Wentworth]], whose son, [[William Wentworth|William Charles]], went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]], a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the [[Rum Rebellion]] against the governor, [[William Bligh]].\n\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of [[Lachlan Macquarie]], began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free [[The Crown|Crown]] land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the [[Nineteen Counties]].\n\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class, the [[Squattocracy]]. As a result of opposition from the [[working class|labour]]ing and [[artisan]] classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (first settled in 1803, later renamed [[Tasmania]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\n\nThe [[Swan River Colony|Swan River Settlement]] (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) [[New Zealand]] was part of [[New South Wales]] until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\n\nThe first governments established after 1788 were dictatorial and each colony was governed by a British [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]], appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The [[New South Wales Corps]], which was in charge of [[New South Wales]], became known as the \"Rum Corps\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of [[rum]], which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \"[[Rum Rebellion]]\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.<ref name=\"moadoph.gov.au\"/>\n\nThe oldest legislative body in Australia, the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], was created in 1825 as an appointed body to advise the [[Governor of New South Wales]]. [[William Wentworth]] established the [[Australian Patriotic Association]] (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]] for New South Wales. The reformist [[Attorney General of New South Wales|attorney general]], [[John Plunkett]], sought to apply [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles to governance in the colony, pursuing the establishment of equality before the law, first by extending jury rights to [[emancipist]]s, then by extending legal protections to convicts, assigned servants and [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]. Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the [[Myall Creek massacre]] of Aboriginal people with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark ''Church Act'' of 1836 [[State religion|disestablished]] the [[Church of England]] and established legal equality between [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglicans]], [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholics]], Presbyterians and later Methodists.<ref name=adb>{{cite book | first=T.

European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the ''[[Treaty of Waitangi]]'' was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with the [[Eora]] people of Sydney Cove, nor any of the other Aboriginal peoples in Australia.\n\nAccording to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], in Australia during the colonial period:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation.<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''[[A Very Short History of the World]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-14-300559-9}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been [[History wars|highly controversial]]. According to Australian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \"invasion\" and \"warfare\" to describe their presence and relations with Aboriginal Australians. In his book ''[[The Other Side of the Frontier]]'',<ref>Reynolds, Henry, ''The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal resistance to the European invasion of Australia'', 1981, {{ISBN|0-86840-892-1}}</ref> Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of [[guerrilla warfare]], beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\n\n[[File:Yagan Statue 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Yagan]] on [[Heirisson Island]]]]\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of the local Aboriginal people:\n\n<blockquote>While they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.<ref>quoted in {{harvp|Reynolds|1999|p=165}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1847, [[Western Australia]]n barrister E.W. Landor stated: \"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as [[Julius Caesar]] did when he [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|took possession of Britain]].\"<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=163}}</ref> In most cases, Reynolds says, Aboriginal people initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the ''Launceston Advertiser'' in 1831, a settler wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies\u2014as invaders\u2014as oppressors and persecutors\u2014they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=148}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aboriginal people determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of ''[[The Queenslander]]'' wrote:\n\n<blockquote>During the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the myth of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.<ref>{{harvp|Reynolds|1999|loc=Chapter 9: \"The Killing Times\", pp. 117\u2013133}}</ref> Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the [[Pinjarra massacre]], the [[Myall Creek massacre]], and the [[Rufus River massacre]].\n\nFamous Aboriginal men who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Yagan]], and many others went unrecorded.

La P\u00e9rouse is remembered in [[La Perouse, New South Wales|a Sydney suburb]] of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this voyage.\n\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \"passengers\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020292b.htm?hilite=Arthur%3BPhillip Biography \u2013 Arthur Phillip \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography].

This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition led by [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 D'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \"Botany Bay\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\".<ref>David Collins, ''An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales,'' London, Vol.I, 1798, p.502</ref>\n\n===Convicts and free settlers===\nWhen the ''Bellona'' transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS ''Sirius''; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the ''Sirius''), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the ''Juliana'' transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\n\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \"Liberty Plains\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\n\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the [[Irish republicanism|political]] and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting\u2014few of the first-wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\n\n[[File:Poster australia NZ 1788 1911 shepherd 1923.png|thumb|right|A historical map of Australia and New Zealand 1788\u20131911]]\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' [[penal servitude]], or \"for the term of their natural lives\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anne Summers |title=Damned Whores and God's Police |year=1975 |location=[[Ringwood, Victoria|Ringwood]], Victoria |isbn=978-0-14-021832-9 |pages= 270\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] or the [[Parramatta Female Factory]].\n\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Moreton Bay]], for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at [[Norfolk Island]] was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\n\nIn 1789 former convict [[James Ruse]] produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30-acre grant at Rose Hill, near [[Parramatta]], was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Farms|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/agriculture/life/farms/index.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\n\n[[File:Castle hill irish rebellion of 1804 australia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804]]\nIn 1804 the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the [[New South Wales Corps]]. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor [[William Bligh|Bligh]] led by [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]]. Following this, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\n\n* '''13 May 1787''' \u2013 The 11 ships of the [[First Fleet]] leave Portsmouth under the command of Captain [[Arthur Phillip]].

The first settlement was made at [[Risdon, Tasmania]] on 11 September 1803 when Lt. John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804. Lt.-Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at [[Hobart]] in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people, including 178 convicts. (Collins had previously attempted a settlement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803\u20131853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania. About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts. Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies. The ''Indefatigable'' brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony. By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females. About 1,448 held [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as \"absconded or missing\". In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain-gangs at the penal station at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] which operated from 1830 to 1877. Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen's Land from Sydney and, in later years, from 1841 to 1847, from Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1840, there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen's Land to [[Norfolk Island]] and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''21 January 1827''' \u2013 Western Australia was created when a small British settlement was established at King George's Sound ([[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]) by Major Edmund Lockyer in order to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area. On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed, with [[Captain James Stirling]] as the first Governor. Except for the settlement at King George's Sound, the colony was never really a part of NSW. King George's Sound was handed over in 1831. In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, became the colony's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders. Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony aboard 43 ships between 1850 and 1868. The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region. On 9 January 1868, Australia's last convict ship, the ''Hougoumont'' brought its final cargo of 269 convicts. Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6, 7, 10, 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75% as opposed to 50% for those sent to NSW and Tasmania. About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time.\n* '''1835''' \u2013 the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835, implements the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' upon which British settlement was based. Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no-one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it, it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples (e.g. that signed by [[John Batman]]). Its publication in the Colony means that from then on, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown.<ref>[http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/bourketerra/ Governor Bourke\u2019s 1835 Proclamation of Terra Nullius | Australia's migration history timeline | NSW Migration Heritage Centre].

South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836 and 1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area. Twenty-four thousand and nine hundred more arrived between 1841 and 1850. Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies. On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia, and being under sentence of transportation, were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land, by the first opportunity.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31749645 |title=Proclamation |newspaper=[[South Australian Register|South Australian Gazette And Colonial Register]] |location=South Australia |date=3 June 1837 |access-date=19 March 2020 |page=1 |via=Trove}}</ref>\n* '''1841''' \u2013 [[New Zealand]] is separated from New South Wales\n* '''1851''' \u2013 [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is separated from New South Wales (formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW). Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s, the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut. David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts. Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804. He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837. The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839. Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826, the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the \"Exiles\" and they arrived between 1844 and 1849. They were sometimes called the \"Pentonvillians\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England.

The name Brisbane Town was in use by 1825 and the main inhabitants in the area were the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Station until it was closed in 1839. Around 2,280 convicts were sent to the settlement between 1824 and 1839 and at the end of 1836 the convict population numbered 337.

One was [[D'Arcy Wentworth]], whose son, [[William Wentworth|William Charles]], went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]], a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the [[Rum Rebellion]] against the governor, [[William Bligh]].\n\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of [[Lachlan Macquarie]], began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free [[The Crown|Crown]] land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the [[Nineteen Counties]].\n\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class, the [[Squattocracy]]. As a result of opposition from the [[working class|labour]]ing and [[artisan]] classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (first settled in 1803, later renamed [[Tasmania]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\n\nThe [[Swan River Colony|Swan River Settlement]] (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) [[New Zealand]] was part of [[New South Wales]] until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\n\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony was governed by a British [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]], appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The [[New South Wales Corps]], which was in charge of [[New South Wales]], became known as the \"Rum Corps\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of [[rum]], which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \"[[Rum Rebellion]]\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists.

Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the [[Myall Creek massacre]] of Aboriginal people with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark ''Church Act'' of 1836 [[State religion|disestablished]] the [[Church of England]] and established legal equality between [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglicans]], [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholics]], Presbyterians and later Methodists.<ref name=adb>{{cite book | first=T.

European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the ''[[Treaty of Waitangi]]'' was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with the [[Eora]] people of Sydney Cove, nor any of the other Aboriginal peoples in Australia.\n\nAccording to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], in Australia during the colonial period:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation.<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''[[A Very Short History of the World]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-14-300559-9}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been [[History wars|highly controversial]]. According to Australian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \"invasion\" and \"warfare\" to describe their presence and relations with Aboriginal Australians. In his book ''[[The Other Side of the Frontier]]'',<ref>Reynolds, Henry, ''The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal resistance to the European invasion of Australia'', 1981, {{ISBN|0-86840-892-1}}</ref> Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of [[guerrilla warfare]], beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\n\n[[File:Yagan Statue 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Yagan]] on [[Heirisson Island]]]]\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of the local Aboriginal people:\n\n<blockquote>While they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.<ref>quoted in {{harvp|Reynolds|1999|p=165}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1847, [[Western Australia]]n barrister E.W. Landor stated: \"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as [[Julius Caesar]] did when he [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|took possession of Britain]].\"<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=163}}</ref> In most cases, Reynolds says, Aboriginal people initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the ''Launceston Advertiser'' in 1831, a settler wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies\u2014as invaders\u2014as oppressors and persecutors\u2014they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=148}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aboriginal people determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of ''[[The Queenslander]]'' wrote:\n\n<blockquote>During the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the myth of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.<ref>{{harvp|Reynolds|1999|loc=Chapter 9: \"The Killing Times\", pp. 117\u2013133}}</ref> Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the [[Pinjarra massacre]], the [[Myall Creek massacre]], and the [[Rufus River massacre]].\n\nFamous Aboriginal men who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Yagan]], and many others went unrecorded. In [[Tasmania]], the \"[[Black War]]\" was fought in the first half of the nineteenth century.\n\n== Representations in literature and film ==\n* [[Marcus Clarke]]'s 1874 novel, ''[[For the Term of his Natural Life]]'', and the 1983 television adaptation of the novel.\n* [[Eleanor Dark]]'s 1947 ''Timeless Land'' trilogy, which spans the colonisation from 1788\u20131811.

The character is particularly associated with the [[X-Men]] family of comics. His nemesis is the X-Men's leader, [[Professor X]], and he also figures into the backstory of the X-Man [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. As originally introduced, Farouk was a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|human mutant]] from [[Egypt]] who used  his vast [[telepathy|telepathic abilities]] for evil, taking the alias Shadow King. Later writers established Farouk as only the modern incarnation of an ancient evil entity that has been around since the dawn of humanity, who became one with Farouk when he grew older.<ref name=\"Shadow-King-Connects-to-X-Men\">{{cite news|last1=Schedeen|first1=Jesse|title=Legion: How the Shadow King Connects to the X-Men|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/03/legion-how-the-shadow-kingprofessor-xavier-rivalry-compares-to-the-x-men-comics|accessdate=4 April 2018|work=IGN|date=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe character has appeared in various adaptations of ''X-Men'' stories, including ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]''. He made his live-action debut in the television series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', portrayed by [[Aubrey Plaza]] and [[Navid Negahban]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}\nCreated by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrator/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character the Shadow King first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #117 (January 1979) as the telepathic [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Amahl Farouk.\n\n''X-Treme X-Men'' and ''X-Men: True Friends'' reveal the Shadow King to be an entity of the [[astral plane]] which has existed since the dawn of humanity, an ethereal demon preferring to enslave the bodies of [[Telepathy|telepaths]] and [[psychic]]s and use their capabilities to enslave others.  As a side effect of its greed, hedonism and lack of self-control, the Shadow King's long-term telepathic hosts are often morbidly obese.<ref name=\"Shadow-King-Connects-to-X-Men\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Fictional character biography}}Fictional character biography==\nThe Shadow King's origins are unclear. All that is known is that he was living in Morocco until the 1800s before taking Farouk as a host. He claims to be a [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiversal]] manifestation of the dark side of the human consciousnesses, spawned by the first nightmare, and has since been feeding on the shadows in their souls, transferring from host to host since the dawn of humanity.<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #9</ref>\n\nFor many years, the Shadow King's primary human manifestation was Amahl Farouk. When Amahl Farouk's powers developed he psychically controlled those around him, and merged with the Shadow King. As Farouk, the Shadow King originally confronted [[Professor Xavier|Professor X]] (inspiring him to form the [[X-Men]]).\n\n===As Amahl Farouk in the 1930s===\nThe Shadow King was known as Amahl Farouk in 1931, working for two of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s special agents ([[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]] and [[Geist (Marvel Comics)|Geist]]). Von Strucker and Geist planned to dethrone [[King Edward VIII|King Edward]] of England and replace him with a [[Fascsim|fascist]] ruler sympathetic to Hitler. When Farouk conducted a mystical ceremony, he accidentally brought back [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] host [[Rachel Summers]] and her teammate [[Shadowcat]] (also known as Kitty Pryde). Von Strucker began to doubt Farouk's abilities. The Shadow King quickly possessed Rachel Summers and, as Shadowcat escaped, allied herself with Alasdhair Kinross. Farouk kidnapped the heir to the throne, [[Queen Elizabeth II|Lilibet]], and fled to Edinburgh. When Shadowcat tried to reach Summers telepathically, she found Farouk in control. Pryde surprised Farouk by calling him \"Shadow King\", enabling her to escape. Farouk took control of Kinross and tried to kill them both, but Pryde used her phasing powers to disrupt Kinross's nervous system and knock him out.  \n \nAlthough Farouk was going to sacrifice Kinross to demons in return for a spell which would annihilate the English monarchy, he was interrupted by Kitty and his crystal knife shattered. The demons entered Farouk's body, overpowering him. He began dispersing energy, killing all the Nazi soldiers; von Strucker accused him of treason and tried to shoot him. Farouk transformed into the Shadow King and tried to force Pryde and Kinross to fight, but they were saved by a young [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]]. Phoenix unleashed her power on Farouk, but she was subdued and possessed. Lilibet escaped, fleeing to [[Holyrood House]]. Farouk possessed the house's servants and sent them and Phoenix in pursuit. Logan ambushed Farouk, von Strucker and Geist, but Farouk had Summers and the servants attack him. Farouk then possessed Pryde and Lilibet. \n \nPryde began talking about the future and the fall of Hitler; Lilibet attacked Farouk, disabling him enough for Pryde to disrupt his nervous system (stunning them both and giving Summers time to regain control of herself). Farouk recovered and tried to retake his prisoners, but Phoenix fought on the astral plane. Phoenix was going to kill him when Pryde struck them with the Sword of Scones, causing them to return to their bodies; Farouk's body was supposedly destroyed by an energy blast from the sword but later when questioned by Rachel if they had killed Farouk, Pryde reveals that they had for the moment only weakened him.<ref>''X-Men: True Friends'' #01-03</ref>\n\n===Confrontation with Charles Xavier===\nIn 1971, Farouk returned and met [[V-Battalion]] leader [[Citizen V#J.J. Watkins|James Watkins Jr.]] Watkins offered him V-Battalion support if Farouk could obtain information about the Everlasting. Farouk gave Watkins the name of Marduk.<ref>''Citizen V and the V-Battalion Everlasting'' #1</ref>\n\nFarouk became a crime lord in [[Egypt]], controlling [[Cairo]]'s Thieves Quarter (where a young [[Professor X|Charles Xavier's]] [[Pickpocketing|pocket was picked]] by a child, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]]). After Xavier stopped her and retrieved his wallet, he was struck by a bolt of [[Psionics|psionic]] energy. When he recovered, he discovered that the source of the attack was a nearby tavern (where he met Farouk). Sitting at separate tables, they conversed telepathically. Farouk told Xavier that he sensed another telepath nearby, and the attack was a warning to stay clear of the area. \n \nHe unsuccessfully tried to persuade Xavier to join him in his criminal activities; Xavier believed that people with such gifts should use them to better the world. They assumed astral form, and Xavier defeated Farouk on the astral plane with a fatal psionic attack. Farouk was Xavier's first encounter with an evil mutant, which led to the formation of the X-Men. His psyche still on the Astral plane, Farouk awaited another chance to fight Xavier (whom he now feared).<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 01 #117</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|The New Mutants}}New Mutants===\nThe Shadow King became aware of a young mutant, [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], a member of Xavier's [[New Mutants]] with the psychic ability to possess other beings. In one of the team's earliest missions, Karma was apparently killed in an explosion at the [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper's]] hideout. However, the Shadow King used Karma's powers against her to possess her.\n\nAs Karma, the Shadow King rebuilt his worldwide empire while indulging his gluttony through her body. He used her to control the Gladiators, a group of mutants, by using a holographic image of leader Alexander Flynn.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #30</ref>\n\nThe Shadow King used the Gladiators to abduct [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], forcing them to fight each other until teammates [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Shadowcat]], [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]], and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] tried to rescue them. In their battle to escape the Gladiators, Cannonball and Shadowcat recognized their obese antagonist as Karma (not realizing that she was controlled by the Shadow King).<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #31</ref>\n\nThe team followed Karma to [[Madripoor]], where they were subjected to Karma's [[mind control]] (augmented by the Shadow King). The remaining New Mutants and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] fought their teammates in Cairo, where Karma took control of Storm and [[Moonstar (comics)|Mirage]]. Magik, realizing that Karma was possessed by the Shadow King, released her teammates from Karma's control and Karma from the Shadow King.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #32</ref><ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #33</ref> After losing his host, the Shadow King transferred to [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]]; Karma entered the astral plane, apparently destroying his astral form.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #34</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|The Muir Island Saga}}Muir Island saga===\nThe Shadow King resurfaced many years later in the body of deceased FBI agent Jacob Reisz when [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] had been sent back to childhood by the Nanny and woke up with amnesia. [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] used meditation to enter the astral plane, discovering that [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] was still alive but at the cost of his [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] arm. When the Shadow King tried to claim the child, he was questioned about his motives, at which point he killed a man and framed Storm. On [[Muir Island]], the telepath [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] used [[Cerebro]] to look for Storm and the other X-Men when the Shadow King attacked and possessed him; he also controlled [[Moira MacTaggert]] and Valerie Cooper, after which he sent [[Valerie Cooper]] to kill [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. \n \nThe Shadow King set a trap to capture Storm. Her youth gave her less control of her mutant powers, and when he tried to possess her mind she involuntarily hit him with a lightning bolt, but he soon found her with [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. They worked together to fight him, escaping with the Shadow King's hounds in pursuit. Mystique defeated Valerie Cooper and impersonated her, appearing on television to report Mystique's death. Part of [[Carol Danvers]] separated from [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and traveled to [[Muir Island]], where she was forced to fight Legion and Moira MacTaggert, when she emerged from the Siege Perilous in the X-Men's former Australian hideout. Although she defeated them, she was possessed by the Shadow King. He compelled her to go to the [[Savage Land]] to find Rogue, but she was defeated on arrival by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #269</ref> The Shadow King, with his ambitious schemes, was afraid of being identified by other telepaths. He needed a nexus between the astral and psionic planes to generate a disturbance which would affect other telepaths. [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris']] powers had been recently altered by [[Zaladane]], and he chose Polaris as his nexus.\n\n[[Jean Grey]] tried to access the astral plane with Cerebro, but the Shadow King overrode Cerebro's defenses and noticed that Jean had lost her telepathic powers and was helpless. He tried to turn her into his Shadow Queen, but [[Psylocke]] unaware of who he was, threatened him with her psi-blade but ended using it on Jean instead, returning her to the physical world; however, they could not remember the details of the encounter and his identity was not yet compromised.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #273</ref> His control over Muir Island was only uncovered when Professor X probed Colossus' mind after the latter tried to kill him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #279</ref>\n\nThe X-Men sent a task force which included [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] to remove his influence. The Shadow King sent his slaves to defend the island, and they defeated the invaders. Xavier understood that he needed a human host and a nexus to continue his exploits, and planned to cut both the links. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] revealed herself and shot Jacob Reisz in the head, destroying his brain and killing the Shadow King's human host. Due to shock and the removal of the Shadow King's host, [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] became unstable. [[X-Factor (comics)#X-Factor|X-Factor]] discovered that his nexus was Polaris, but the Shadow King took possession of Legion. He ordered the slaves to hide underground because he was going to use Legion's power to destroy the surface of Muir Island. Jean Grey's telekinesis protected X-Factor and the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #280</ref>\n\nXavier then used Jean as a psi-anchor to fight the Shadow King in the astral plane, but he was defeated. [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] joined [[Jean Grey|Jean]] in the astral plane to help Xavier, unaware of Legion's body nearby. Although they gave Xavier willpower and energy, Legion destroyed their bodies and Xavier returns to his former paraplegic state. Forge uses Psylocke's psi-blade on Polaris, breaking the Shadow King's link to the nexus, after which his energy dissipated overcoming the X-Men. Xavier and Jean tried to absorb whatever they could and shield the others. Xavier offered the Shadow King a chance to redeem himself, but he opted for the void and Legion was left in a coma.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #253-280</ref>\n\n===Psi-War===\nAfter the Onslaught incident in which Charles Xavier lost his powers, the Shadow King could return to the physical world since the psionic plane had lost its guardian. Posing as \"Ananasi\", the Shadow King took over the [[Africa]]n tribe who worshiped Storm. After attacking one of her relatives, Psylocke took Storm to the astral plane to fight \"Ananasi\" only to find the villagers\u2019 minds set up in a distinct pattern. Before they can discern the reasoning, \"Ananasi\" attacks Psylocke and brings up her past failures and how she was always considered a redundant Jean Grey-wannabe. Ainet finds Storm and tells her the truth, but \"Ananasi\" buries Storm under bones of her dead friends before she can tell Betsy the truth. Psylocke falls into \"Ananasi\"\u2019s trap and accidentally hits one of the villagers with her psi-blade. This caused a chain reaction that cripples the entire psionic plan itself, damaging the collective subconscious of every being on Earth (the basis of the psi-plane) as well as all psi-sensitive in the corporeal world. Humans experienced ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'', nightmares, migraines or nosebleeds, and those born with psionic, telepathic or intuitive abilities were maimed; [[Jean Grey|Jean]] and [[Nate Grey]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Emma Frost]], [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and Bianca LaNiege were devastated. [[Madelyne Pryor|\"Maddie\"]] Pryor (Nate Grey's psionic construct from Madelyne Pryor's psionic remnants) was obliterated, and [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] and [[Spider-Man]] were also affected while Psylocke is left as a discombobulated mess, as \"Ananasi\" reveals himself to be the Shadow King, now free of any opposition on the Psionic Plane.<ref>''X-Men'' vol.02 #77</ref> With the world's telepaths crippled, the Shadow King ascends to dominance and, one by one, begins to corrupt mankind. He explains to Psylocke that although he was defeated and thought dead by Charles Xavier at Muir Island, as long as one dark thought exists in [[Human|man]], he can live. He went into hibernation, for the lack of a better word. He eventually bids her farewell forever as he teleports away and Psylocke turns to stone and then falls apart. Yet the [[Crimson Dawn]] saves Psylocke once again and resurrects her, this time with an all black psi-form and the ability to command the shadows of the Psionic Plane, which allow her to go undetected by the Shadow King. She eventually confronts the Shadow King and pretends to be tempted by his offer to become the Shadow Queen to distract him while Storm freed the other X-Men. However Farouk saw through the ruse; Psylocke sent the X-Men to the physical world and takes the fight directly to the Shadow King, who stretches his powers to the maximum to infect every mind on Earth. Psylocke is intoxicated by the power, but keeps her focus and discovers that the Shadow King has left his nexus, the soul of every person on the Psionic Plane, exposed as his body unravels to reach every mind. Psylocke uses her shadows to contain the nexus and the Shadow King is trapped, but only as long as Psylocke focuses her telepathy on him, which means she can never use her powers again or else he will be set free. Psylocke leaves the Psionic Plane for the last time and reveals what happened to Storm.<ref>''X-Men'' vol.02 #78</ref>\n\nSometime later the Shadow King reached Psylocke's mind when she's forced to use Cerebro to cleansed Logan of the Death persona with a little push from each of Logan's closest friends, but Archangel experienced a metamorphosis of his own from his close contact to Apocalypse's handiwork.<ref>''Wolverine (2nd series)'' #146</ref> The Shadow King eventually managed to convince Betsy to release him in order to help Warren but before she reaches him, Warren himself mysteriously appears on her mind and stop her from setting him free, sending the Shadow King back to his prison when Betsy disconnected herself from Cerebro.<ref>''Wolverine (2nd series)'' #147</ref>\n\n===Freedom===\nThe Shadow King was eventually released from his prison when Psylocke perished in combat with the mutant hunter, Vargas. Once again free, he possessed the Reavers and attempted to attack the X-Men. However, Rogue used her acquired memories as well as Sage's computer like mind and attacked the Shadow King, binding his core as Psylocke had done.<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]] [[Annual publication|Annual]] 2001''</ref>\n\n===New Excalibur===\nDue to the events of House of M, the Shadow King was released from his prison and was able to escape to an alternate reality, Earth-6141.<ref>''X-Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files''</ref> Once there, he possessed their version of Professor X and then corrupted the original X-Men (whom he called the [[Shadow-X|Dark X-Men]]). He maintained constant telepathic contact and control over them and forced them to kill all the heroes of their world. The Scarlet Witch's Decimation Wave enabled the Shadow King to bring himself and his team to [[Earth-616]] in order to gain revenge on those who had crossed him. He tried to kill [[Captain Britain]] with the controlled [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005\u20132007)|New Excalibur]], but was again defeated by Psylocke (who was revived by her brother, [[Jamie Braddock]]).<ref>''New Excalibur'' #08</ref> The Dark X-Men tried to free Xavier from his prison with the help of [[Lionheart (comics)|Lionheart]].<ref>''New Excalibur'' #19</ref> Lionheart sealed the Shadow King in the Dark Xavier's body, releasing the Shadow-X from his control and killed Dark Xavier therefore sending the Shadow King back to the Astral plane.<ref>''New Excalibur #19</ref>\n\n===X-Men: Worlds Apart===\nThe Shadow King reappeared in [[Wakanda]], where he killed a Wakandan priest and framed former New X-Men member [[Gentle (comics)|Gentle]]. He then controlled [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to confront his longtime enemy (and T'Challa's wife), Storm. The Shadow King intended to break Storm psychologically, forcing her to choose between the X-Men and her husband. He forced [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to attack [[Emma Frost]] and the rest of the X-Men in California and forced the Black Panther to wreak havoc in Africa. While Storm raced to save the Black Panther and the X-Men, she recognized a third option: to take down the one responsible for making her choose. Storm defeated the Black Panther and flew with Gentle to San Francisco, taking down Gentle and the rest of the active X-Men (controlled by the Shadow King). She struck Cyclops (the Shadow King's host) with a bolt of lightning, stopping his heart and forcing the Shadow King to possess Storm. This was a trap; when he entered Storm's mind, the Shadow King found the panther god Bast waiting for him. Storm revealed that she allowed the Wakanda panther god to hide in her mind to avenge the Shadow King for violating T'Challa's mind. Bast essentially and literally devoured the Shadow King's astral form. Farouk's plan to cut Storm off from her relationships instead strengthened them.<ref>''X-Men: Worlds Apart'' #1-4</ref>\n\n===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===\nThe Shadow King's nexus survived however and when he recuperated he took over a military base's nuclear facility to use its missiles, aiming them at [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]] and New York. The X-Force headed to the military base after losing contact with Deadpool (who was investigating the psychic emanations felt by Betsy), learning that the Shadow King controlled the base.\n\nHe told Psylocke that her mind is an open book to him, and releases Archangel from his psychic prison in Warren's memory in revenge; Archangel cuts off the Shadow King's \"head\", erasing Betsy's memory and enabling her to kill the man who was under the Shadow King's influence.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #8</ref> The Shadow King gave a reporter photographs of Warren killing the military, forcing the squad to apprehend their teammate and seek help from [[Dark Beast]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #10</ref> As Farouk, the Shadow King appeared as a member of [[Daken]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] (consisting of [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], Skinless Man, the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] from [[Age of Apocalypse|Earth-295]], and the [[Omega Red|Omega Clan]]) in a plot to attack the [[X-Force]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #27</ref>\n\nHe created an illusion of the Professor and Angel to catch Psylocke off-guard, expressing disappointment at the ease of defeating the warrior who caged him. Farouk was with the Brotherhood as they watched the apparent death of the X-Force. He, Creed and Daken showed Evan that his life was a computer-generated illusion and he was a clone of Apocalypse. The Brotherhood unsuccessfully planned to compel Evan to put on Apocalypse armor, make the Shadow King control him and destroy Jean Grey's school.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #34</ref> Psylocke locked the Shadow King in Omega White's body and entrusted it to her brother, Captain Britain.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #35</ref>\n\nApparently Brian or someone at his command had sealed the Shadow King's host body in a tomb in the [[Gobi Desert]] where it was eventually found in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] erroneously trapped inside Omega Black's body by the Crimson Pirates and unwittingly released by their telepath, Bloody Bess. He possessed the Pirates except for Bess, who appealed to [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] for help. Nightcrawler and Bess fought the Pirates and the X-Men, who were controlled by the Shadow King. He was defeated when Bess and Psylocke threw off his mind control and sent Nightcrawler against him armed with Psylocke's psi-blade, which stunned him long enough to be interred again in Omega Black's body.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #8-#10</ref>\n\n===Psi-War II===\nThe Shadow King has since been revealed to be imprisoned in the Astral Plane, but still trying to force his way out to the physical world. He began targeting psychics to build a web in order to escape the Astral Plane and the first one was Psylocke, who fell prey to him and would have released him if not for the intervention of Rogue, Old Man Logan, Warren, Bishop, Gambit and Fantomex. Knowing now that others psychics can fall prey too, Psylocke sends to the Astral Plane her teammates in order to defeat the Shadow King, unaware that he had changed, now half-human half-spider and is waiting for them. He also reveals that he has imprisoned in his realm the astral form of Professor Xavier.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #01</ref>\n\nAs they arrive, they quickly fall into the Shadow King's illusions and if they don't break it their bodies and souls will fall under his control. Old Man Logan suddenly remembers everything and helps the other X-Men realize that the Shadow King is affecting their memories. As the room they are in transforms, they see three doors in front of them. Logan mentions that while the Shadow King is controlling things there are two minds involved in whatever they are in, which is how he figured out the play was fake.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #02</ref> In the battle's final moments, Shadow King spread a psychic infection on London before the X-Men ultimately defeated him with Fantomex donating his body to Professor X's astral form while his mind remained in the Astral Plane.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #06</ref><ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #07</ref> Professor Xavier now using the alias of X, controlled the psychic infection which was soon afterwards revealed to be actually Proteus which X unwittingly reconstituted back. X then convinced Psylocke to form a psychic network and draw its power to push back Proteus' influence, however the Shadow King had planted a portion of himself in Xavier's mind and took advantage of this strategy and accessed the network to escape from the Astral Plane through X's body.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #11</ref> After the Shadow King defeated the X-Men, X managed to recover and worked together with Psylocke to create a deeper psychic network to defeated him once and for all. X erased the memories of all of the X-Men involved in his return save for Psylocke so she could watch over him in case the Shadow King wasn't truly gone from his mind.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #12</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Powers and abilities}}Powers and abilities==\nThe Shadow King was originally presented as a telepathic mutant second only to Professor X. He can possess other beings while on the astral plane and control them.\n\nThe Shadow King's nature as an astral entity, preying on the bodies of powerful psychics and using them to enslave others, was later revealed. In its native form, it can only be harmed psychically or by magic weapons and has demonstrated the ability to live for millennia. Its powers when possessing a body are limited to the body's capabilities.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=={{anchor|''Excalibur''|Mutant X}}Other versions==\nIn an alternate universe, the Shadow King conquered the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #21-22</ref> In the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' dimension, he merged with [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Mutant X|Professor Xavier]] to form an evil being.\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, the Shadow King story is essentially unchanged. He assumes the guise of crime lord Amahl Farouk and encounters Charles Xavier; they wage a psychic battle on the astral plane which kills Farouk's body, forcing his mind to move there. When Xavier died, the Shadow King became an agent of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and appeared as a cloudy face in a bottle in his sanctum.<ref name=\"Alpha\">''X-Men'' Alpha</ref><ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #05</ref> Apocalypse used him to hunt down resisting mutants with powerful psionic powers, and train those that do agree to come aboard.<ref name=\"Alpha\"/>\n\nThe Shadow King was the first to sense the presence of Nate Grey, forcing Apocalypse to send Domino and her Bounty Hunters to capture or kill him.<ref>''X-Man'' #1</ref> When Angel's assistant Karma was captured by Apocalypse's servants, the Shadow King psychically tortured her into revealing the location of Magneto's X-Men.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' #2</ref> He later attempted to read the mind of Bishop, but Bishop's memory of the original reality (Earth-616) was enough to expel the Shadow King from his mind.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' #3</ref> Finally, the Shadow King followed [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] to the sanctuary of [[Savage Land|Avalon]] by hiding in the mind of Dead Man Wade. There he took control of the minds of the many of Avalon's mutant and human refugees, causing great carnage. Nightcrawler, with the assistance of the psychic and Shadow King's former student [[Emma Steed|Damask]], the time-stopping [[Switchback (comics)|Switchback]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], was able to physically teleport into the astral plane and defeat the Shadow King. The casualties caused by the Shadow King's attack were enough to convince Destiny to accompany Nightcrawler and the X-Men on a mission to Apocalypse's stronghold;<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3-4</ref> Following his defeat on Avalon, the Shadow King was next seen reporting to Apocalypse about Domino's failure to capture Nate Grey<ref>''X-Man'' #4</ref> and inform Apocalypse about the destruction of the Southwest Kingdom by the Eurasian High Council's radioactive bombs.<ref>''X-Men'' Omega</ref>\n\nAfter Weapon X betrayed the X-Men and become the heir of Apocalypse, the Shadow King became his agent and chief telepath, though there are some hierarchy issues between him and Weapon X.\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' series, Amahl Farouk the Shadow King appeared as [[Alternative versions of Storm#Ultimate Storm|Storm]]'s lover and the leader of the group of thieves to which she and [[Lady Deathstrike#Ultimate Marvel|Lady Deathstrike]] belonged.<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men #81\">''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #81</ref> Storm sent him into a coma after accidentally electrocuting him.<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men #81\"/> His mind went to another dimension, where he encountered the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] and [[Sleepwalker (comics)|others]] and became the Shadow King.<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men #89\">''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #89</ref> After returning in the present-day, he subtly manipulated Storm's dreams, causing Ororo to write down her inflicted visions in an online play called \"The Shadow King\". Soon, Farouk took direct action, dragging Ororo into the astral plane after a tiring battle and confronting her about her past. Once he revealed the circumstances of his transformation into the Shadow King, he attacked the X-Men with his Brood army; however, Storm's willingness to let go of the past allowed her to once again attack Farouk, but intentionally, and his form disappeared from the plane, implying that he had died in the physical realm. His attack on the X-Men with the Brood was also revealed to be a ruse on Farouk's part.<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men #89\"/>\n\n===X-Men '92===\nIn Marvel's 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the [[X-Men (TV series)|1992 X-Men Animated Series]] was adapted into a limited series where this reality was made into the [[Battleworld]] domain of Westchester. In the series, [[Cassandra Nova]] runs a rehabilitation center for former villains, but is secretly possessed by the Shadow King. He planned on killing the Battlezone's baron, [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], but is stopped when X-Force rescues the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men '92'' #6</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Television|Video games}}In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live action====\n[[File:Aubrey Plaza & Navid Negahban (46609750835).jpg|thumb|right|[[Aubrey Plaza]] and [[Navid Negahban]] play Amahl Farouk/Shadow King in ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]''.]]\n* Amahl Farouk/Shadow King appears as the main antagonist in the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] TV series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', portrayed primarily by [[Aubrey Plaza]] in the first season (in the form of [[Legion (TV series)#Lenny Busker|Lenny Busker]]) and [[Navid Negahban]] in the second and third seasons (in his original likeness). Prior to the revelation of the character's identity, he was referred to by [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]] as \"the Devil with the Yellow Eyes\" (portrayed by Quinton Boisclair). The Shadow King takes several forms over the course of the series other than his real form, including the aforementioned \"Devil\" form of an obese man with thin, long limbs, Haller's childhood dog King, the \"Angry Boy\" (portrayed by [[Devyn Dalton]]) who is a manifestation of the title character from the children's book ''The World's Angriest Boy in the World'', Haller's friend in the Clockworks Institute - Busker, and a friend from his youth named Benny (portrayed by [[Kirby Morrow]]). Originally a mutant enemy of [[Professor X|David's father]], the Shadow King's consciousness escaped his death and latched on to David as a kind of psychic parasite, using David's mutant abilities to grow stronger. His presence influenced David's mental instability and the way he perceives reality. In the second season, Farouk assumes his true appearance during his quest to find his original body,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2018/01/05/legion-season-2-cast-navid-negahban-ahmal-farouk-shadow-king/ |title=Legion Adds Homeland Alum Navid Negahban in Season 2 Villain Recast |publisher=TVLine |first=Dave |last=Nemetz |date=January 5, 2018 |accessdate=January 5, 2018}}</ref> which resembles that of his comics counterpart, being of Middle-Eastern appearance, sporting three-piece suits and the signature circular sunglasses, though lacks the fez (instead having a semi-balding head of hair) and isn't morbidly obese (unlike his appearance as \"the Devil with Yellow Eyes\").\n\n====Animation====\n*Shadow King appears in two episodes of ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' (1992\u201397), voiced by [[Maurice Dean Wint]]. In flashbacks he is the first evil mutant faced by a younger Charles Xavier, who banished his spirit to the astral plane. Farouk is depicted as an athletic, middle-aged bearded man instead of his bald, obese appearance in the comics.\n*Shadow King appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode, \"Overflow\", voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. In a flashback, Farouk takes in Ororo to steal for him until Professor X defeats him. He possesses Storm, forcing her to see Africa burning; she tries to extinguish the fire, unaware that she is the one destroying it.

The character is particularly associated with the [[X-Men]] family of comics. His nemesis is the X-Men's leader, [[Professor X]], and he also figures into the backstory of the X-Man [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. As originally introduced, Farouk was a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|human mutant]] from [[Egypt]] who used  his vast [[telepathy|telepathic abilities]] for evil, taking the alias Shadow King. Later writers established Farouk as only the modern incarnation of an ancient evil entity that has been around since the dawn of humanity, who became one with Farouk when he grew older.<ref name=\"Shadow-King-Connects-to-X-Men\">{{cite news|last1=Schedeen|first1=Jesse|title=Legion: How the Shadow King Connects to the X-Men|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/03/legion-how-the-shadow-kingprofessor-xavier-rivalry-compares-to-the-x-men-comics|accessdate=4 April 2018|work=IGN|date=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe character has appeared in various adaptations of ''X-Men'' stories, including ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]''.

As a side effect of its greed, hedonism and lack of self-control, the Shadow King's long-term telepathic hosts are often morbidly obese.<ref name=\"Shadow-King-Connects-to-X-Men\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Fictional character biography}}Fictional character biography==\nThe Shadow King's origins are unclear. All that is known is that he was living in Morocco until the 1800s before taking Farouk as a host. He claims to be a [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiversal]] manifestation of the dark side of the human consciousnesses, spawned by the first nightmare, and has since been feeding on the shadows in their souls, transferring from host to host since the dawn of humanity.<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #9</ref>\n\nFor many years, the Shadow King's primary human manifestation was Amahl Farouk. When Amahl Farouk's powers developed he psychically controlled those around him, and merged with the Shadow King. As Farouk, the Shadow King originally confronted [[Professor Xavier|Professor X]] (inspiring him to form the [[X-Men]]).\n\n===As Amahl Farouk in the 1930s===\nThe Shadow King was known as Amahl Farouk in 1931, working for two of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s special agents ([[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]] and [[Geist (Marvel Comics)|Geist]]). Von Strucker and Geist planned to dethrone [[King Edward VIII|King Edward]] of England and replace him with a [[Fascsim|fascist]] ruler sympathetic to Hitler. When Farouk conducted a mystical ceremony, he accidentally brought back [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] host [[Rachel Summers]] and her teammate [[Shadowcat]] (also known as Kitty Pryde). Von Strucker began to doubt Farouk's abilities. The Shadow King quickly possessed Rachel Summers and, as Shadowcat escaped, allied herself with Alasdhair Kinross. Farouk kidnapped the heir to the throne, [[Queen Elizabeth II|Lilibet]], and fled to Edinburgh. When Shadowcat tried to reach Summers telepathically, she found Farouk in control. Pryde surprised Farouk by calling him \"Shadow King\", enabling her to escape. Farouk took control of Kinross and tried to kill them both, but Pryde used her phasing powers to disrupt Kinross's nervous system and knock him out.  \n \nAlthough Farouk was going to sacrifice Kinross to demons in return for a spell which would annihilate the English monarchy, he was interrupted by Kitty and his crystal knife shattered. The demons entered Farouk's body, overpowering him. He began dispersing energy, killing all the Nazi soldiers; von Strucker accused him of treason and tried to shoot him. Farouk transformed into the Shadow King and tried to force Pryde and Kinross to fight, but they were saved by a young [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]]. Phoenix unleashed her power on Farouk, but she was subdued and possessed. Lilibet escaped, fleeing to [[Holyrood House]]. Farouk possessed the house's servants and sent them and Phoenix in pursuit. Logan ambushed Farouk, von Strucker and Geist, but Farouk had Summers and the servants attack him. Farouk then possessed Pryde and Lilibet. \n \nPryde began talking about the future and the fall of Hitler; Lilibet attacked Farouk, disabling him enough for Pryde to disrupt his nervous system (stunning them both and giving Summers time to regain control of herself). Farouk recovered and tried to retake his prisoners, but Phoenix fought on the astral plane. Phoenix was going to kill him when Pryde struck them with the Sword of Scones, causing them to return to their bodies; Farouk's body was supposedly destroyed by an energy blast from the sword but later when questioned by Rachel if they had killed Farouk, Pryde reveals that they had for the moment only weakened him.<ref>''X-Men: True Friends'' #01-03</ref>\n\n===Confrontation with Charles Xavier===\nIn 1971, Farouk returned and met [[V-Battalion]] leader [[Citizen V#J.J. Watkins|James Watkins Jr.]] Watkins offered him V-Battalion support if Farouk could obtain information about the Everlasting. Farouk gave Watkins the name of Marduk.<ref>''Citizen V and the V-Battalion Everlasting'' #1</ref>\n\nFarouk became a crime lord in [[Egypt]], controlling [[Cairo]]'s Thieves Quarter (where a young [[Professor X|Charles Xavier's]] [[Pickpocketing|pocket was picked]] by a child, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]]). After Xavier stopped her and retrieved his wallet, he was struck by a bolt of [[Psionics|psionic]] energy. When he recovered, he discovered that the source of the attack was a nearby tavern (where he met Farouk). Sitting at separate tables, they conversed telepathically. Farouk told Xavier that he sensed another telepath nearby, and the attack was a warning to stay clear of the area. \n \nHe unsuccessfully tried to persuade Xavier to join him in his criminal activities; Xavier believed that people with such gifts should use them to better the world. They assumed astral form, and Xavier defeated Farouk on the astral plane with a fatal psionic attack. Farouk was Xavier's first encounter with an evil mutant, which led to the formation of the X-Men. His psyche still on the Astral plane, Farouk awaited another chance to fight Xavier (whom he now feared).<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 01 #117</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|The New Mutants}}New Mutants===\nThe Shadow King became aware of a young mutant, [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], a member of Xavier's [[New Mutants]] with the psychic ability to possess other beings. In one of the team's earliest missions, Karma was apparently killed in an explosion at the [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper's]] hideout. However, the Shadow King used Karma's powers against her to possess her.\n\nAs Karma, the Shadow King rebuilt his worldwide empire while indulging his gluttony through her body. He used her to control the Gladiators, a group of mutants, by using a holographic image of leader Alexander Flynn.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #30</ref>\n\nThe Shadow King used the Gladiators to abduct [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], forcing them to fight each other until teammates [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Shadowcat]], [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]], and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] tried to rescue them. In their battle to escape the Gladiators, Cannonball and Shadowcat recognized their obese antagonist as Karma (not realizing that she was controlled by the Shadow King).<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #31</ref>\n\nThe team followed Karma to [[Madripoor]], where they were subjected to Karma's [[mind control]] (augmented by the Shadow King). The remaining New Mutants and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] fought their teammates in Cairo, where Karma took control of Storm and [[Moonstar (comics)|Mirage]]. Magik, realizing that Karma was possessed by the Shadow King, released her teammates from Karma's control and Karma from the Shadow King.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #32</ref><ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #33</ref> After losing his host, the Shadow King transferred to [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]]; Karma entered the astral plane, apparently destroying his astral form.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 01 #34</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|The Muir Island Saga}}Muir Island saga===\nThe Shadow King resurfaced many years later in the body of deceased FBI agent Jacob Reisz when [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] had been sent back to childhood by the Nanny and woke up with amnesia. [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] used meditation to enter the astral plane, discovering that [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] was still alive but at the cost of his [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] arm. When the Shadow King tried to claim the child, he was questioned about his motives, at which point he killed a man and framed Storm. On [[Muir Island]], the telepath [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] used [[Cerebro]] to look for Storm and the other X-Men when the Shadow King attacked and possessed him; he also controlled [[Moira MacTaggert]] and Valerie Cooper, after which he sent [[Valerie Cooper]] to kill [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. \n \nThe Shadow King set a trap to capture Storm. Her youth gave her less control of her mutant powers, and when he tried to possess her mind she involuntarily hit him with a lightning bolt, but he soon found her with [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. They worked together to fight him, escaping with the Shadow King's hounds in pursuit. Mystique defeated Valerie Cooper and impersonated her, appearing on television to report Mystique's death. Part of [[Carol Danvers]] separated from [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and traveled to [[Muir Island]], where she was forced to fight Legion and Moira MacTaggert, when she emerged from the Siege Perilous in the X-Men's former Australian hideout. Although she defeated them, she was possessed by the Shadow King. He compelled her to go to the [[Savage Land]] to find Rogue, but she was defeated on arrival by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #269</ref> The Shadow King, with his ambitious schemes, was afraid of being identified by other telepaths. He needed a nexus between the astral and psionic planes to generate a disturbance which would affect other telepaths. [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris']] powers had been recently altered by [[Zaladane]], and he chose Polaris as his nexus.\n\n[[Jean Grey]] tried to access the astral plane with Cerebro, but the Shadow King overrode Cerebro's defenses and noticed that Jean had lost her telepathic powers and was helpless. He tried to turn her into his Shadow Queen, but [[Psylocke]] unaware of who he was, threatened him with her psi-blade but ended using it on Jean instead, returning her to the physical world; however, they could not remember the details of the encounter and his identity was not yet compromised.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #273</ref> His control over Muir Island was only uncovered when Professor X probed Colossus' mind after the latter tried to kill him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #279</ref>\n\nThe X-Men sent a task force which included [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] to remove his influence. The Shadow King sent his slaves to defend the island, and they defeated the invaders. Xavier understood that he needed a human host and a nexus to continue his exploits, and planned to cut both the links. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] revealed herself and shot Jacob Reisz in the head, destroying his brain and killing the Shadow King's human host. Due to shock and the removal of the Shadow King's host, [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] became unstable. [[X-Factor (comics)#X-Factor|X-Factor]] discovered that his nexus was Polaris, but the Shadow King took possession of Legion. He ordered the slaves to hide underground because he was going to use Legion's power to destroy the surface of Muir Island. Jean Grey's telekinesis protected X-Factor and the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #280</ref>\n\nXavier then used Jean as a psi-anchor to fight the Shadow King in the astral plane, but he was defeated. [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] joined [[Jean Grey|Jean]] in the astral plane to help Xavier, unaware of Legion's body nearby. Although they gave Xavier willpower and energy, Legion destroyed their bodies and Xavier returns to his former paraplegic state. Forge uses Psylocke's psi-blade on Polaris, breaking the Shadow King's link to the nexus, after which his energy dissipated overcoming the X-Men. Xavier and Jean tried to absorb whatever they could and shield the others. Xavier offered the Shadow King a chance to redeem himself, but he opted for the void and Legion was left in a coma.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #253-280</ref>\n\n===Psi-War===\nAfter the Onslaught incident in which Charles Xavier lost his powers, the Shadow King could return to the physical world since the psionic plane had lost its guardian. Posing as \"Ananasi\", the Shadow King took over the [[Africa]]n tribe who worshiped Storm. After attacking one of her relatives, Psylocke took Storm to the astral plane to fight \"Ananasi\" only to find the villagers\u2019 minds set up in a distinct pattern. Before they can discern the reasoning, \"Ananasi\" attacks Psylocke and brings up her past failures and how she was always considered a redundant Jean Grey-wannabe. Ainet finds Storm and tells her the truth, but \"Ananasi\" buries Storm under bones of her dead friends before she can tell Betsy the truth. Psylocke falls into \"Ananasi\"\u2019s trap and accidentally hits one of the villagers with her psi-blade. This caused a chain reaction that cripples the entire psionic plan itself, damaging the collective subconscious of every being on Earth (the basis of the psi-plane) as well as all psi-sensitive in the corporeal world. Humans experienced ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'', nightmares, migraines or nosebleeds, and those born with psionic, telepathic or intuitive abilities were maimed; [[Jean Grey|Jean]] and [[Nate Grey]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Emma Frost]], [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and Bianca LaNiege were devastated. [[Madelyne Pryor|\"Maddie\"]] Pryor (Nate Grey's psionic construct from Madelyne Pryor's psionic remnants) was obliterated, and [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] and [[Spider-Man]] were also affected while Psylocke is left as a discombobulated mess, as \"Ananasi\" reveals himself to be the Shadow King, now free of any opposition on the Psionic Plane.<ref>''X-Men'' vol.02 #77</ref> With the world\u2019s telepaths crippled, the Shadow King ascends to dominance and, one by one, begins to corrupt mankind. He explains to Psylocke that although he was defeated and thought dead by Charles Xavier at Muir Island, as long as one dark thought exists in [[Human|man]], he can live. He went into hibernation, for the lack of a better word. He eventually bids her farewell forever as he teleports away and Psylocke turns to stone and then falls apart. Yet the [[Crimson Dawn]] saves Psylocke once again and resurrects her, this time with an all black psi-form and the ability to command the shadows of the Psionic Plane, which allow her to go undetected by the Shadow King. She eventually confronts the Shadow King and pretends to be tempted by his offer to become the Shadow Queen to distract him while Storm freed the other X-Men. However Farouk saw through the ruse; Psylocke sent the X-Men to the physical world and takes the fight directly to the Shadow King, who stretches his powers to the maximum to infect every mind on Earth. Psylocke is intoxicated by the power, but keeps her focus and discovers that the Shadow King has left his nexus, the soul of every person on the Psionic Plane, exposed as his body unravels to reach every mind. Psylocke uses her shadows to contain the nexus and the Shadow King is trapped, but only as long as Psylocke focuses her telepathy on him, which means she can never use her powers again or else he will be set free. Psylocke leaves the Psionic Plane for the last time and reveals what happened to Storm.<ref>''X-Men'' vol.02 #78</ref>\n\nSometime later the Shadow King reached Psylocke's mind when she's forced to use Cerebro to cleansed Logan of the Death persona with a little push from each of Logan's closest friends, but Archangel experienced a metamorphosis of his own from his close contact to Apocalypse's handiwork.<ref>''Wolverine (2nd series)'' #146</ref> The Shadow King eventually managed to convince Betsy to release him in order to help Warren but before she reaches him, Warren himself mysteriously appears on her mind and stop her from setting him free, sending the Shadow King back to his prison when Betsy disconnected herself from Cerebro.<ref>''Wolverine (2nd series)'' #147</ref>\n\n===Freedom===\nThe Shadow King was eventually released from his prison when Psylocke perished in combat with the mutant hunter, Vargas. Once again free, he possessed the Reavers and attempted to attack the X-Men. However, Rogue used her acquired memories as well as Sage's computer like mind and attacked the Shadow King, binding his core as Psylocke had done.<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]] [[Annual publication|Annual]] 2001''</ref>\n\n===New Excalibur===\nDue to the events of House of M, the Shadow King was released from his prison and was able to escape to an alternate reality, Earth-6141.<ref>''X-Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files''</ref> Once there, he possessed their version of Professor X and then corrupted the original X-Men (whom he called the [[Shadow-X|Dark X-Men]]). He maintained constant telepathic contact and control over them and forced them to kill all the heroes of their world. The Scarlet Witch's Decimation Wave enabled the Shadow King to bring himself and his team to [[Earth-616]] in order to gain revenge on those who had crossed him. He tried to kill [[Captain Britain]] with the controlled [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005\u20132007)|New Excalibur]], but was again defeated by Psylocke (who was revived by her brother, [[Jamie Braddock]]).<ref>''New Excalibur'' #08</ref> The Dark X-Men tried to free Xavier from his prison with the help of [[Lionheart (comics)|Lionheart]].<ref>''New Excalibur'' #19</ref> Lionheart sealed the Shadow King in the Dark Xavier's body, releasing the Shadow-X from his control and killed Dark Xavier therefore sending the Shadow King back to the Astral plane.<ref>''New Excalibur #19</ref>\n\n===X-Men: Worlds Apart===\nThe Shadow King reappeared in [[Wakanda]], where he killed a Wakandan priest and framed former New X-Men member [[Gentle (comics)|Gentle]]. He then controlled [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to confront his longtime enemy (and T'Challa's wife), Storm. The Shadow King intended to break Storm psychologically, forcing her to choose between the X-Men and her husband. He forced [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to attack [[Emma Frost]] and the rest of the X-Men in California and forced the Black Panther to wreak havoc in Africa. While Storm raced to save the Black Panther and the X-Men, she recognized a third option: to take down the one responsible for making her choose. Storm defeated the Black Panther and flew with Gentle to San Francisco, taking down Gentle and the rest of the active X-Men (controlled by the Shadow King). She struck Cyclops (the Shadow King's host) with a bolt of lightning, stopping his heart and forcing the Shadow King to possess Storm. This was a trap; when he entered Storm's mind, the Shadow King found the panther god Bast waiting for him. Storm revealed that she allowed the Wakanda panther god to hide in her mind to avenge the Shadow King for violating T'Challa's mind. Bast essentially and literally devoured the Shadow King's astral form. Farouk's plan to cut Storm off from her relationships instead strengthened them.<ref>''X-Men: Worlds Apart'' #1-4</ref>\n\n===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===\nThe Shadow King's nexus survived however and when he recuperated he took over a military base's nuclear facility to use its missiles, aiming them at [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]] and New York. The X-Force headed to the military base after losing contact with Deadpool (who was investigating the psychic emanations felt by Betsy), learning that the Shadow King controlled the base.\n\nHe told Psylocke that her mind is an open book to him, and releases Archangel from his psychic prison in Warren's memory in revenge; Archangel cuts off the Shadow King's \"head\", erasing Betsy's memory and enabling her to kill the man who was under the Shadow King's influence.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #8</ref> The Shadow King gave a reporter photographs of Warren killing the military, forcing the squad to apprehend their teammate and seek help from [[Dark Beast]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #10</ref> As Farouk, the Shadow King appeared as a member of [[Daken]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] (consisting of [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], Skinless Man, the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] from [[Age of Apocalypse|Earth-295]], and the [[Omega Red|Omega Clan]]) in a plot to attack the [[X-Force]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #27</ref>\n\nHe created an illusion of the Professor and Angel to catch Psylocke off-guard, expressing disappointment at the ease of defeating the warrior who caged him. Farouk was with the Brotherhood as they watched the apparent death of the X-Force. He, Creed and Daken showed Evan that his life was a computer-generated illusion and he was a clone of Apocalypse. The Brotherhood unsuccessfully planned to compel Evan to put on Apocalypse armor, make the Shadow King control him and destroy Jean Grey's school.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #34</ref> Psylocke locked the Shadow King in Omega White's body and entrusted it to her brother, Captain Britain.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #35</ref>\n\nApparently Brian or someone at his command had sealed the Shadow King's host body in a tomb in the [[Gobi Desert]] where it was eventually found in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] erroneously trapped inside Omega Black's body by the Crimson Pirates and unwittingly released by their telepath, Bloody Bess. He possessed the Pirates except for Bess, who appealed to [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] for help. Nightcrawler and Bess fought the Pirates and the X-Men, who were controlled by the Shadow King. He was defeated when Bess and Psylocke threw off his mind control and sent Nightcrawler against him armed with Psylocke's psi-blade, which stunned him long enough to be interred again in Omega Black's body.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #8-#10</ref>\n\n===Psi-War II===\nThe Shadow King has since been revealed to be imprisoned in the Astral Plane, but still trying to force his way out to the physical world. He began targeting psychics to build a web in order to escape the Astral Plane and the first one was Psylocke, who fell prey to him and would have released him if not for the intervention of Rogue, Old Man Logan, Warren, Bishop, Gambit and Fantomex. Knowing now that others psychics can fall prey too, Psylocke sends to the Astral Plane her teammates in order to defeat the Shadow King, unaware that he had changed, now half-human half-spider and is waiting for them. He also reveals that he has imprisoned in his realm the astral form of Professor Xavier.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #01</ref>\n\nAs they arrive, they quickly fall into the Shadow King's illusions and if they don\u2019t break it their bodies and souls will fall under his control. Old Man Logan suddenly remembers everything and helps the other X-Men realize that the Shadow King is affecting their memories. As the room they are in transforms, they see three doors in front of them. Logan mentions that while the Shadow King is controlling things there are two minds involved in whatever they are in, which is how he figured out the play was fake.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #02</ref> In the battle's final moments, Shadow King spread a psychic infection on London before the X-Men ultimately defeated him with Fantomex donating his body to Professor X's astral form while his mind remained in the Astral Plane.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #06</ref><ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #07</ref> Professor Xavier now using the alias of X, controlled the psychic infection which was soon afterwards revealed to be actually Proteus which X unwittingly reconstituted back. X then convinced Psylocke to form a psychic network and draw its power to push back Proteus' influence, however the Shadow King had planted a portion of himself in Xavier's mind and took advantage of this strategy and accessed the network to escape from the Astral Plane through X's body.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #11</ref> After the Shadow King defeated the X-Men, X managed to recover and worked together with Psylocke to create a deeper psychic network to defeated him once and for all. X erased the memories of all of the X-Men involved in his return save for Psylocke so she could watch over him in case the Shadow King wasn't truly gone from his mind.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 4) #12</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Powers and abilities}}Powers and abilities==\nThe Shadow King was originally presented as a telepathic mutant second only to Professor X. He can possess other beings while on the astral plane and control them.\n\nThe Shadow King's nature as an astral entity, preying on the bodies of powerful psychics and using them to enslave others, was later revealed. In its native form, it can only be harmed psychically or by magic weapons and has demonstrated the ability to live for millennia. Its powers when possessing a body are limited to the body's capabilities.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=={{anchor|''Excalibur''|Mutant X}}Other versions==\nIn an alternate universe, the Shadow King conquered the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #21-22</ref> In the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' dimension, he merged with [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Mutant X|Professor Xavier]] to form an evil being.\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, the Shadow King story is essentially unchanged. He assumes the guise of crime lord Amahl Farouk and encounters Charles Xavier; they wage a psychic battle on the astral plane which kills Farouk's body, forcing his mind to move there. When Xavier died, the Shadow King became an agent of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and appeared as a cloudy face in a bottle in his sanctum.<ref name=\"Alpha\">''X-Men'' Alpha</ref><ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #05</ref> Apocalypse used him to hunt down resisting mutants with powerful psionic powers, and train those that do agree to come aboard.<ref name=\"Alpha\"/>\n\nThe Shadow King was the first to sense the presence of Nate Grey, forcing Apocalypse to send Domino and her Bounty Hunters to capture or kill him.<ref>''X-Man'' #1</ref> When Angel's assistant Karma was captured by Apocalypse's servants, the Shadow King psychically tortured her into revealing the location of Magneto's X-Men.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' #2</ref> He later attempted to read the mind of Bishop, but Bishop's memory of the original reality (Earth-616) was enough to expel the Shadow King from his mind.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' #3</ref> Finally, the Shadow King followed [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] to the sanctuary of [[Savage Land|Avalon]] by hiding in the mind of Dead Man Wade. There he took control of the minds of the many of Avalon's mutant and human refugees, causing great carnage. Nightcrawler, with the assistance of the psychic and Shadow King's former student [[Emma Steed|Damask]], the time-stopping [[Switchback (comics)|Switchback]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], was able to physically teleport into the astral plane and defeat the Shadow King. The casualties caused by the Shadow King's attack were enough to convince Destiny to accompany Nightcrawler and the X-Men on a mission to Apocalypse's stronghold;<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3-4</ref> Following his defeat on Avalon, the Shadow King was next seen reporting to Apocalypse about Domino's failure to capture Nate Grey<ref>''X-Man'' #4</ref> and inform Apocalypse about the destruction of the Southwest Kingdom by the Eurasian High Council's radioactive bombs.<ref>''X-Men'' Omega</ref>\n\nAfter Weapon X betrayed the X-Men and become the heir of Apocalypse, the Shadow King became his agent and chief telepath, though there are some hierarchy issues between him and Weapon X.\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' series, Amahl Farouk the Shadow King appeared as [[Alternative versions of Storm#Ultimate Storm|Storm]]'s lover and the leader of the group of thieves to which she and [[Lady Deathstrike#Ultimate Marvel|Lady Deathstrike]] belonged.<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men #81\">''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #81</ref> Storm sent him into a coma after accidentally electrocuting him.<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men #81\"/> His mind went to another dimension, where he encountered the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] and [[Sleepwalker (comics)|others]] and became the Shadow King.<ref>''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #89</ref> After returning in the present-day, he subtly manipulated Storm's dreams, causing Ororo to write down her inflicted visions in an online play called \"The Shadow King\". Soon, Farouk took direct action, dragging Ororo into the astral plane after a tiring battle and confronting her about her past. Once he revealed the circumstances of his transformation into the Shadow King, he attacked the X-Men with his Brood army; however, Storm's willingness to let go of the past allowed her to once again attack Farouk, but intentionally, and his form disappeared from the plane, implying that he had died in the physical realm. His attack on the X-Men with the Brood was also revealed to be a ruse on Farouk's part.<ref>''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #89</ref>\n\n===X-Men '92===\nIn Marvel's 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the [[X-Men (TV series)|1992 X-Men Animated Series]] was adapted into a limited series where this reality was made into the [[Battleworld]] domain of Westchester. In the series, [[Cassandra Nova]] runs a rehabilitation center for former villains, but is secretly possessed by the Shadow King. He planned on killing the Battlezone's baron, [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], but is stopped when X-Force rescues the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men '92'' #6</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Television|Video games}}In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live action====\n[[File:Aubrey Plaza & Navid Negahban (46609750835).jpg|thumb|right|[[Aubrey Plaza]] and [[Navid Negahban]] play Amahl Farouk/Shadow King in ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]''.]]\n* Amahl Farouk/Shadow King appears as the main antagonist in the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] TV series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', portrayed primarily by [[Aubrey Plaza]] in the first season (in the form of [[Legion (TV series)#Lenny Busker|Lenny Busker]]) and [[Navid Negahban]] in the second and third seasons (in his original likeness). Prior to the revelation of the character's identity, he was referred to by [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]] as \"the Devil with the Yellow Eyes\" (portrayed by Quinton Boisclair). The Shadow King takes several forms over the course of the series other than his real form, including the aforementioned \"Devil\" form of an obese man with thin, long limbs, Haller's childhood dog King, the \"Angry Boy\" (portrayed by [[Devyn Dalton]]) who is a manifestation of the title character from the children's book ''The World's Angriest Boy in the World'', Haller's friend in the Clockworks Institute - Busker, and a friend from his youth named Benny (portrayed by [[Kirby Morrow]]). Originally a mutant enemy of [[Professor X|David's father]], the Shadow King's consciousness escaped his death and latched on to David as a kind of psychic parasite, using David's mutant abilities to grow stronger. His presence influenced David's mental instability and the way he perceives reality. In the second season, Farouk assumes his true appearence during his quest to find his original body,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2018/01/05/legion-season-2-cast-navid-negahban-ahmal-farouk-shadow-king/ |title=Legion Adds Homeland Alum Navid Negahban in Season 2 Villain Recast |publisher=TVLine |first=Dave |last=Nemetz |date=January 5, 2018 |accessdate=January 5, 2018}}</ref> which resembles that of his comics counterpart, being of Middle-Eastern appearance, sporting three-piece suits and the signature circular sunglasses, though lacks the fez (instead having a semi-balding head of hair) and isn't morbidly obese (unlike his appearance as \"the Devil with Yellow Eyes\").\n\n====Animation====\n*Shadow King appears in two episodes of ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' (1992\u201397), voiced by [[Maurice Dean Wint]]. In flashbacks he is the first evil mutant faced by a younger Charles Xavier, who banished his spirit to the astral plane. Farouk is depicted as an athletic, middle-aged bearded man instead of his bald, obese appearance in the comics.\n*Shadow King appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode, \"Overflow\", voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. In a flashback, Farouk takes in Ororo to steal for him until Professor X defeats him. He possesses Storm, forcing her to see Africa burning; she tries to extinguish the fire, unaware that she is the one destroying it. The X-Men try to stop the Shadow King; [[Emma Frost]] fights him on the astral plane, apparently destroying him with a telepathic sword.\n\n===Video games===\n*Shadow King is one of three primary villains in the video game ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]].<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web|title=Shadow King Voice - X-Men franchise <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/X-Men/Shadow-King/|website=behindthevoiceactors.com|date=December 19, 2019|postscript=.

Her growing popularity has since relied heavily on community coffeehouses, [[public radio]], and an extensive fan base on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nWilliams recorded her first full album, ''[[The Honesty Room]],'' under her own label, Burning Field Music.  Guest artists included [[the Nields|Nerissa and Katryna Nields]], Max Cohen and [[Gideon Freudmann]].  The album was briefly distributed by Chicago-based [[Waterbug Records]]. Williams soon secured a licensing-and-distribution deal for Burning Field with Razor and Tie, and in 1995 reissued the album on that label, with two re-recorded bonus tracks. The record went on to become one  of the top-selling independent folk albums of the year.   1996's ''[[Mortal City]]'', also licensed and distributed with Razor and Tie, received substantial notice, partially due to the fact that it coincided with her tour with Baez.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  The album again featured guest appearances by the Nields sisters and Freudmann, as well as noted folk artists [[John Prine]], [[Cliff Eberhardt]] and [[Lucy Kaplansky]].  With that success, Razor & Tie re-released ''The Honesty Room''.  By the time of her third release, ''[[End of The Summer]]'' (1997), Williams's career had gathered substantial momentum, and the album did remarkably well{{Specify|date=April 2009}}, given its genre and independent label status.\n\nIn 1998, Williams, [[Richard Shindell]] and [[Lucy Kaplansky]] formed the  group [[Cry Cry Cry (band)|Cry Cry Cry]] as a way to pay homage to some of their favorite folk artists.

She doesn't force herself to write, which is an approach she learned in college when she decided that whatever she could do at any given time was enough. She prides herself on having songs that all came from some kind of inspiration.\n\nWilliams wants her music to be an \"efficient career,\" something she can do her entire life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  She strives to accomplish this by \"continuously court[ing] your [[muse]]; to keep writing stuff that feels risky about things you believe in, that you're really feeling.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n==Songs==\n[[File:Dar Williams July 2008a.jpg|alt=|thumb|Williams onstage in 2008]]\nRecurrent themes in Williams's songs include [[religion]], [[adolescence]], [[gender]] issues, [[anti-commercialism]], misunderstood relationships, [[Grief|loss]], [[humor]], and geography.\n\nWilliams' early work spoke clearly of her upbringing in 1970s and 80s [[suburbia]] \u2013 of [[Social alienation|alienation]], and the [[hypocrisy]] evident in the [[Post-World War II baby boom|post-WWII]] [[middle class]]. On the track \"Anthem\" on her early tape ''[[All My Heroes Are Dead]]'', she sang, \"I know there's blood in the pavement and we've turned the fields to sand.\"\n\nWilliams' songs often address gender typing, [[gender roles|roles]], and inequities.  \"You're Aging Well\" on ''[[The Honesty Room]]'' discusses adolescent body image, [[ageism]] and [[self-loathing]] in detail.  The song ends with the singer finding an unnamed female mentor &mdash; \"the woman of voices\" &mdash; who points her toward a more enlightened and mature point of view.

Throughout the song, the family members begin to discover their differences need not estrange them from one another.\n\nIn an interview in 2007 on the Food Is Not Love [[podcast]], she said that the song \"February\" from ''Mortal City'' is one of her songs that she likes best.

She doesn't force herself to write, which is an approach she learned in college when she decided that whatever she could do at any given time was enough. She prides herself on having songs that all came from some kind of inspiration.\n\nWilliams wants her music to be an \"efficient career,\" something she can do her entire life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  She strives to accomplish this by \"continuously court[ing] your [[muse]]; to keep writing stuff that feels risky about things you believe in, that you're really feeling.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n==Songs==\n[[File:Dar Williams July 2008a.jpg|alt=|thumb|Williams onstage in 2008]]\nRecurrent themes in Williams's songs include [[religion]], [[adolescence]], [[gender]] issues, [[anti-commercialism]], misunderstood relationships, [[Grief|loss]], [[humor]], and geography.\n\nWilliams' early work spoke clearly of her upbringing in 1970s and 80s [[suburbia]] \u2013 of [[Social alienation|alienation]], and the [[hypocrisy]] evident in the [[Post-World War II baby boom|post-WWII]] [[middle class]]. On the track \"Anthem\" on her early tape ''[[All My Heroes Are Dead]]'', she sang, \"I know there's blood in the pavement and we've turned the fields to sand.\"\n\nWilliams' songs often address gender typing, [[gender roles|roles]], and inequities.  \"You're Aging Well\" on ''[[The Honesty Room]]'' discusses adolescent body image, [[ageism]] and [[self-loathing]] in detail.  The song ends with the singer finding an unnamed female mentor &mdash; \"the woman of voices\" &mdash; who points her toward a more enlightened and mature point of view.

Throughout the song, the family members begin to discover their differences need not estrange them from one another.\n\nIn an interview in 2007 on the Food Is Not Love [[podcast]], she said that the song \"February\" from ''Mortal City'' is one of her songs that she likes best.

Rebalancing the job market in the private sector will also prove to be a challenge since it is currently majority staffed by expatriates. One of the difficulties is that the private sector has lower paying salaries and expats are easier to hire and fire. Currently twice as many Saudi nationals work in the public sector than in the private sector. The challenge lies in getting a larger portion of the nationals to accept lower paying jobs that could require higher working hours than that of the public sector. Another aspect to be considered is moving the private sector away from the business activities that require very low-cost labor.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2017-07-20-vision-2030-saudi-kinninmont.pdf |title=Vision 2030 and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Social Contract Austerity and Transformation |last= |first= |date= |website=Chathamhouse|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hilal Khashan from the American conservative think tank [[Middle East Forum]], to have the 2030 plan succeed ignoring the relationship between economic and political development is no longer a viable option, the developments required to increase the GDP as planned will encourage the breakage of the tribal system taking place.

Rebalancing the job market in the private sector will also prove to be a challenge since it is currently majority staffed by expatriates. One of the difficulties is that the private sector has lower paying salaries and expats are easier to hire and fire. Currently twice as many Saudi nationals work in the public sector than in the private sector. The challenge lies in getting a larger portion of the nationals to accept lower paying jobs that could require higher working hours than that of the public sector. Another aspect to be considered is moving the private sector away from the business activities that require very low-cost labor.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2017-07-20-vision-2030-saudi-kinninmont.pdf |title=Vision 2030 and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Social Contract Austerity and Transformation |last= |first= |date= |website=Chathamhouse|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hilal Khashan from the American conservative think tank [[Middle East Forum]], to have the 2030 plan succeed ignoring the relationship between economic and political development is no longer a viable option, the developments required to increase the GDP as planned will encourage the breakage of the tribal system taking place.

Second. they must distribute this water to the field of the beneficiary farmers by means of a suitable and proper distribution.\nSo that in Lift Irrigation system, the gravity flow of water by [[canal]]s or [[river]] is not available or used.\n\n==Distribution==\nOf these two issues, distribution is the most complex, for several reasons.  First, whereas the system for collecting water at the main delivery chamber makes use of pumps, the distribution system is typically completely gravity-based, and have to be designed solely on the basis of the available [[hydraulic head]].  In addition, the area to be irrigated is scattered and has varying [[topography]], and each farm is of a different size, so it can be a challenge to design a gravity-based system that allots each farmer a fair amount of water.  Several mechanisms have been developed to meet these challenges.\n\nIn the most prevalent system, the area under irrigation is divided into different blocks according to topography determined by contour plan.  The water requirement for each block is determined, and pipe lines are designed for these blocks depending on the available head and required discharge.  Field delivery chambers are then constructed on the distribution pipe lines, and valves are fitted to control the flow of the pipe lines, with flow from the main delivery chamber controlled by these valves.  In this system, lines for lower fields have more discharge, because the force of gravity is greater, so water distribution can be unequal.\n\nIn other systems, the area is divided into three or four equal parts, and each part is given the entire discharge for one day.

So as to bring higher level area under irrigation L.I.S. are taken up. The 8% of Maharashtra irrigation is occupied by lift irrigation.\n\n==Advantages of Lift Irrigation==\n#Lift irrigation made irrigation possible at higher level.\n#Land acquisition problem in L.I.S. is less.\n#Water losses are low.\n#Man power is less used.\n\n==Requirements of Lift Irrigation System (LIS)==\n:''Water Source''-Suitable and constant water source should be available for whole year at the site of LIS. Water can be made available through Dams, [[Weir]], River canal etc.\n:''Lifting Medium''-To lift water to the desired location, lifting medium i.e. pumps are required. Depending upon the Duty point head, discharge the different types of pumps are selected.\n:''Conveying Medium''-Rising main may be of [[steel]], [[concrete]] or any other suitable material.\n\n==Lift Irrigation Scheme in Telangana==\nIn India, the [[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]] reports that there are 1401 lift irrigation schemes financed by them.  These schemes irrigate 22000 hectares of land, and have a total financial outlay of Rs. 6462.5 million. However, as many as 573 of these schemes are defunct, mainly due to poor distribution of water. Other schemes have been financed by the [[Government of India|government]], sugar factories, or individual farmers. \n\nWater shortage is a huge predicament for a country like India which still relies on [[monsoon]] rains for much of its agricultural practices. As weather patterns become increasingly uncertain with time, most likely due to [[global warming]], being prepared to cope with water shortages in the future is essential. Rural communities as well as huge population which are greatly affected by [[water scarcity]] are the people living in drought-prone areas or in semi-arid up-lands. Much of these disadvantaged areas are also inhibited by tribal villages in many parts of India and are also backward in agricultural practices. These tribal villages are mainly self-sustained in their living habits and rely heavily on the paddy crops for endurance. It is becoming progressively more intricate to maintain tribal lifestyle due to uncertain weather patterns resulting in dwindling of agricultural production over time and all the more increasing the burden on state to raise their standard of living in terms of [[food security]], education, and health care. It is also seen, when time gets tough, villagers generally tend to migrate on a seasonal basis to seek other means of livelihood. Such seasonal migration of entire village population also affects their settled life hampering their children\u2019s education as well as their access to other developmental support coming from state.\n\nIt is consequently important to help their agriculture instead in order to reduce the incidence of [[Human migration|migration]] in such areas. This can only be achieved by ensuring there is sufficient crop to feed villagers and to sell at market to allow income generation. Irrigation is the essential input to the soil for any vegetation to grow. It is used to lend a hand in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and potentials of vegetation by restoring humidity / [[humus]] in depleted soils of dry areas and during periods of insufficient rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include shielding plants against frost, suppressing weed and wild vegetation in grain fields and helping in preventing [[soil erosion]]. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed agriculture, or if it falls in semi-arid regions, it is called dry land farming. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the natural or artificial removal of surface and subsurface water from a given area. Various types of [[irrigation]] techniques differ in how the water obtained from the source, and is distributed within the field. In general, the aim is to supply water homogeneously to the entire field, so that each land patch has enough amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little. Irrigation Schemes primarily comprises canal irrigation and lift irrigation schemes. In such schemes, the most important and yet the most neglected part is the local ownership and institutions of farmers taking operative and m responsibilities.\n\n==Participatory Irrigation Management==\nThe main purpose of the irrigation reform programme in [[Andhra Pradesh]] is to improve the sustainability and productivity of irrigation through sharing irrigation management responsibility with the farmers organized as Water Users Associations. Towards this the State government enacted the Andhra Pradesh Farmers Management of Irrigation System Act in 1997. Presently, water users\u2019 organizations under the APFMIS Act is constituted at three different levels in major irrigation projects - [[Water user associations|Water Users Associations]] (WUAs) at the minor canal level, Distributor Committees (DCs) at the distributor canal level and Project Committee (PCs) at the main canal level. In medium irrigation project they are constituted at two levels \u2013 WUA at the minor canal level and PC at the main canal level. In minor irrigation tanks only a WUA is constituted covering the whole tank command. A total of 10,748 WUAs have been constituted \u2013 2261 in major irrigation projects, 410 in medium irrigation projects and 8077 in minor irrigation tanks.\n\nThe water users\u2019 organizations undertake the responsibilities of seasonal crop planning and irrigation water regulation, O&M works on canal system and assist in tax collection. To facilitate the functioning of the water users\u2019 organizations the State government re-ploughs 100% of the irrigation water tax collected from them.

Second. they must distribute this water to the field of the beneficiary farmers by means of a suitable and proper distribution.\nSo that in Lift Irrigation system, the gravity flow of water by [[canal]]s or [[river]] is not available or used.\n\n==Distribution==\nOf these two issues, distribution is the most complex, for several reasons.  First, whereas the system for collecting water at the main delivery chamber makes use of pumps, the distribution system is typically completely gravity-based, and have to be designed solely on the basis of the available [[hydraulic head]].  In addition, the area to be irrigated is scattered and has varying [[topography]], and each farm is of a different size, so it can be a challenge to design a gravity-based system that allots each farmer a fair amount of water.  Several mechanisms have been developed to meet these challenges.\n\nIn the most prevalent system, the area under irrigation is divided into different blocks according to topography determined by contour plan.  The water requirement for each block is determined, and pipe lines are designed for these blocks depending on the available head and required discharge.  Field delivery chambers are then constructed on the distribution pipe lines, and valves are fitted to control the flow of the pipe lines, with flow from the main delivery chamber controlled by these valves.  In this system, lines for lower fields have more discharge, because the force of gravity is greater, so water distribution can be unequal.\n\nIn other systems, the area is divided into three or four equal parts, and each part is given the entire discharge for one day. This means each part gets rotation of the full design discharge on the fourth or fifth day.  Again, however, water distribution can be unequal, and alternate methods of distribution have been proposed to deal with this problem.\n\n== List of lift irrigation schemes with Equal and Proportionate Distribution ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He immediately resumes charge of his old gang and soon confronts Loganathan, a [[drug smuggling|drug smuggler]]. Loga insults Kumudha, saying that she would have been sold into prostitution had she been alive. In retaliation, Kabali rams his car into Loga, killing him; however, the incident makes him believe that his wife may be still alive. Later, Kabali survives an assassination attempt by Tamizh Kumaran alias Kumaran, whose father Tamilmaaran was killed by Kabali when Kumaran was a young boy. The next day, at a function organised by the Free Life Foundation School, a school started by Kabali's friend Ameer to reform youngsters involved in criminal activities, Kabali talks about his past.\n\nKabali was the protege of Tamilmaaran's father Tamilnesan, a don who fought for the rights of [[Tamil Malaysians]]. Tamilnesan was killed by Veerasekaran, a member of his gang who disliked his rules such as not involving in illegal activities like drug smuggling and prostitution. Following Tamilnesan's death, Kabali took charge of Tamilnesan's gang. Veera manipulated Tamilmaaran by telling him that he, being Tamilnesan's son, should lead the gang and not Kabali. Tamilmaaran invited Kabali and a pregnant Kumudha for a temple function. However, this was revealed to be a trap as Veera and his men confronted Kabali and Kumudha at the function. In the ensuing scuffle, Kabali was brutally attacked while Kumudha was shot and seemingly killed. Kabali then killed Tamilmaaran for his betrayal in front of a young Kumaran and was soon arrested on a false charge of instigating the massacre.\n\nKumaran, after hearing Kabali's speech, realises his mistake and apologises to him. He tells him that Velu, one of Veera's henchmen who was present at the temple massacre, is aware of what happened to Kumudha. Kabali then leaves for [[Thailand]], where Velu is residing. On confronting Velu, he learns that his daughter is still alive. At this juncture, Kabali is confronted by Yogi, a [[contract killing|contract killer]] hired by Veera and his boss Tony Lee, who heads the rival Gang 43 in Kuala Lumpur, to eliminate Kabali. Yogi instead kills the men who had come with her and reveals herself to Kabali as his daughter, who had been raised by Velu. She also tells him that Kumudha is still alive and is living with a French family in [[Pondicherry|Puducherry]]. Kabali and Yogi then leave for Puducherry, where, after several days of searching, they reunite with Kumudha and spend a few days with her there. While in Puducherry, Kabali and his family are attacked by men sent by Tony. However, Kabali and Yogi fight them off and escape safely with Kumudha.\n\nKabali and his family soon return to Kuala Lumpur, where he is told that Ameer has been severely injured in a car accident set up by Tony; his henchman Jeeva was brutally chopped to pieces by Tony after refusing to join Gang 43; and Gang 43 had destroyed the Free Life Foundation School and started to control the Kuala Lumpur underworld, eliminating any gang who dared to oppose them. On hearing all this, Kabali decides to finish Veera and Tony. He and his family attend the 100th birthday party for a respected Malaysian don Ang Lee, who had invited all gangs, including Gang 43. At the party, Kabali starts a shootout with the help of Kumaran, which ends with him killing Veera and Tony.\n\nSome months later, Kabali, Kumudha, Kumaran, and Yogi attend a function organised by the Free Life Foundation. One of the Free Life alumni, a youngster named Tiger, who is known to be aggressive and reckless, walks up to Kabali, with scenes showing him speaking to the police prior to the function. The screen cuts to black, and the sound of a gun clicking and a gunshot afterwards is heard.<!--do ''not'' write that the film ends ambiguously as it may show POV-->\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Kabaliswaran (Kabali), the head of Malaysian Gangster group '00'.\n* [[Radhika Apte]] as Kumudhavalli Kabaliswaran, Kabali's wife\n* [[Sai Dhanshika]] as Yogitha Kabaleeswaran, Kabali's daughter who is a contract killer in Thailand.\n* [[Winston Chao]] as Tony Lee, industrialist, businessman and a head of Malaysian Gangster group '43'.\n* [[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]] as Veerasekaran, the second head of '43'\n* [[Attakathi Dinesh|Dinesh]] as Jeeva, Kabali's gang member.\n* [[Kalaiyarasan]] as Thamizh Kumaran (Kumaran), Tamizh Nesan's grandson and Tamizh Maran's son.

He immediately resumes charge of his old gang and soon confronts Loganathan, a [[drug smuggling|drug smuggler]]. Loga insults Kumudha, saying that she would have been sold into prostitution had she been alive. In retaliation, Kabali rams his car into Loga, killing him; however, the incident makes him believe that his wife may be still alive. Later, Kabali survives an assassination attempt by Tamizh Kumaran alias Kumaran, whose father Tamilmaaran was killed by Kabali when Kumaran was a young boy. The next day, at a function organised by the Free Life Foundation School, a school started by Kabali's friend Ameer to reform youngsters involved in criminal activities, Kabali talks about his past.\n\nKabali was the protege of Tamilmaaran's father Tamilnesan, a don who fought for the rights of [[Tamil Malaysians]]. Tamilnesan was killed by Veerasekaran, a member of his gang who disliked his rules such as not involving in illegal activities like drug smuggling and prostitution. Following Tamilnesan's death, Kabali took charge of Tamilnesan's gang. Veera manipulated Tamilmaaran by telling him that he, being Tamilnesan's son, should lead the gang and not Kabali. Tamilmaaran invited Kabali and a pregnant Kumudha for a temple function. However, this was revealed to be a trap as Veera and his men confronted Kabali and Kumudha at the function. In the ensuing scuffle, Kabali was brutally attacked while Kumudha was shot and seemingly killed. Kabali then killed Tamilmaaran for his betrayal in front of a young Kumaran and was soon arrested on a false charge of instigating the massacre.\n\nKumaran, after hearing Kabali's speech, realises his mistake and apologises to him. He tells him that Velu, one of Veera's henchmen who was present at the temple massacre, is aware of what happened to Kumudha. Kabali then leaves for [[Thailand]], where Velu is residing. On confronting Velu, he learns that his daughter is still alive. At this juncture, Kabali is confronted by Yogi, a [[contract killing|contract killer]] hired by Veera and his boss Tony Lee, who heads the rival Gang 43 in Kuala Lumpur, to eliminate Kabali. Yogi instead kills the men who had come with her and reveals herself to Kabali as his daughter, who had been raised by Velu. She also tells him that Kumudha is still alive and is living with a French family in [[Pondicherry|Puducherry]]. Kabali and Yogi then leave for Puducherry, where, after several days of searching, they reunite with Kumudha and spend a few days with her there. While in Puducherry, Kabali and his family are attacked by men sent by Tony. However, Kabali and Yogi fight them off and escape safely with Kumudha.\n\nKabali and his family soon return to Kuala Lumpur, where he is told that Ameer has been severely injured in a car accident set up by Tony; his henchman Jeeva was brutally chopped to pieces by Tony after refusing to join Gang 43; and Gang 43 had destroyed the Free Life Foundation School and started to control the Kuala Lumpur underworld, eliminating any gang who dared to oppose them. On hearing all this, Kabali decides to finish Veera and Tony. He and his family attend the 100th birthday party for a respected Malaysian don Ang Lee, who had invited all gangs, including Gang 43. At the party, Kabali starts a shootout with the help of Kumaran, which ends with him killing Veera and Tony.\n\nSome months later, Kabali, Kumudha, Kumaran, and Yogi attend a function organised by the Free Life Foundation. One of the Free Life alumni, a youngster named Tiger, who is known to be aggressive and reckless, walks up to Kabali, with scenes showing him speaking to the police prior to the function. The screen cuts to black, and the sound of a gun clicking and a gunshot afterwards is heard.<!--do ''not'' write that the film ends ambiguously as it may show POV-->\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Kabaliswaran (Kabali), the head of Malaysian Gangster group '00'.\n* [[Radhika Apte]] as Kumudhavalli Kabaliswaran, Kabali's wife\n* [[Sai Dhanshika]] as Yogitha Kabaleeswaran, Kabali's daughter who is a contract killer in Thailand.\n* [[Winston Chao]] as Tony Lee, industrialist, businessman and a head of Malaysian Gangster group '43'.\n* [[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]] as Veerasekaran, the second head of '43'\n* [[Attakathi Dinesh|Dinesh]] as Jeeva, Kabali's gang member.\n* [[Kalaiyarasan]] as Thamizh Kumaran (Kumaran), Tamizh Nesan's grandson and Tamizh Maran's son.

(later '''NeXT Computer, Inc.''' and '''NeXT Software, Inc.''') was an American [[computer]] and [[software]] company founded in 1985 by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Its name was usually pronounced as \"'''Next'''\". Based in [[Redwood City, California]], the company developed and manufactured a series of [[computer workstation]]s intended for the [[higher education]] and business markets. NeXT was founded by Jobs after he was forced out of Apple, along with several co-workers NeXT introduced the first [[NeXT Computer]] in 1988, and the smaller [[NeXTstation]] in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their innovative [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[NeXTSTEP]] [[operating system]] and [[development environment]] ([[Interface Builder]]) were highly influential.  \n\nThe first major outside investment was from [[Ross Perot]], who invested after seeing a segment about NeXT on a 1986 [[PBS]] documentary titled ''Entrepreneurs''.<ref name=\"RP iPhone\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90374043/how-ross-perot-helped-bring-us-the-iphone|title=How Ross Perot befriended Steve Jobs and helped bring us the iPhone|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=2019-07-09|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> In 1987, he invested $20 million in exchange for 16 percent of NeXT's stock and subsequently joined the board of directors in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/134 134]}}</ref>\n\nNeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a [[Application programming interface|programming environment]] standard called [[OpenStep]]. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing [[OpenStep#OPENSTEP for Mach|OPENSTEP for Mach]], its own OpenStep implementation, for several [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs). NeXT also developed [[WebObjects]], one of the first enterprise [[Web framework|web application frameworks]]. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a [[Web server]] based on [[Dynamic web page|dynamic page generation]] rather than on [[static content]].\n\nApple purchased NeXT in 1997 for $429 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|429|1997}} million in {{Inflation-year|USD}}) and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock.

The new range included a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the [[NeXTcube]], and the [[NeXTstation]], nicknamed \"the slab\" for its form-factor of a low-rise box. Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff did not use the nickname \"[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]\", so that the NeXT machines would not be compared to competing Sun workstations which already had that nickname. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive but 2.88 MB floppy disks were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the [[CD-ROM]] drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and on the [[NeXTdimension]] [[Video card|graphics processor]] hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new [[Motorola 68040]] processor.\n\nIn 1992, NeXT launched \"Turbo\" variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation with a 33 MHz 68040 processor and maximum RAM capacity increased to 128 MB. NeXT sold 20,000 computers in 1992, and NeXT counted upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales. This is a small number compared with competitors, but the company reported sales of $140 million for the year which encouraged Canon to invest a further $30 million to keep the company afloat.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/200 200]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width=25% | align=right | text=In its existence, Next has sold a total of 50,000 copies of Nextstep, says Jobs.

Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a \"community\" with \"members\" instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid {{US$|75000|1986}} and those who joined afterward were paid {{US$|50000|1986}}. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever took advantage of the privilege. NeXT's [[health insurance]] plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}} The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time because instead of being delivered twice a month in arrears at the end of the pay period, it was delivered once a month in advance.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|289}}\n\nJobs found office space in [[Palo Alto, California]] on 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass and concrete building which featured a staircase designed by architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major [[wikt:component|components]] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.<ref name=\"AppleConfidential\">{{Cite book | first=Owen W. | last=Linzmayer | title=Apple Confidential 2.0 | publisher=No Starch Press | year=2004 |isbn=1-59327-010-0}}</ref>{{rp|323}}\n\nAs NeXT expanded, more office space was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a \"floating\" staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, although furnishings became luxurious, with $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas, and [[Ansel Adams]] prints.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}}\n\nNeXT's first campus in Palo Alto was subsequently occupied by [[SAP SE|SAP AG]].

(later '''NeXT Computer, Inc.''' and '''NeXT Software, Inc.''') was an American [[computer]] and [[software]] company founded in 1985 by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Its name was usually pronounced as \"'''Next'''\". Based in [[Redwood City, California]], the company developed and manufactured a series of [[computer workstation]]s intended for the [[higher education]] and business markets. NeXT was founded by Jobs after he was forced out of Apple, along with several co-workers NeXT introduced the first [[NeXT Computer]] in 1988, and the smaller [[NeXTstation]] in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their innovative [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[NeXTSTEP]] [[operating system]] and [[development environment]] ([[Interface Builder]]) were highly influential.  \n\nThe first major outside investment was from [[Ross Perot]], who invested after seeing a segment about NeXT on a 1986 [[PBS]] documentary titled ''Entrepreneurs''.<ref name=\"RP iPhone\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90374043/how-ross-perot-helped-bring-us-the-iphone|title=How Ross Perot befriended Steve Jobs and helped bring us the iPhone|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=2019-07-09|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> In 1987, he invested $20 million in exchange for 16 percent of NeXT's stock and subsequently joined the board of directors in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/134 134]}}</ref>\n\nNeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a [[Application programming interface|programming environment]] standard called [[OpenStep]]. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing [[OpenStep#OPENSTEP for Mach|OPENSTEP for Mach]], its own OpenStep implementation, for several [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs). NeXT also developed [[WebObjects]], one of the first enterprise [[Web framework|web application frameworks]]. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a [[Web server]] based on [[Dynamic web page|dynamic page generation]] rather than on [[static content]].\n\nApple purchased NeXT in 1997 for $400 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. The merger converted Steve Jobs from Chairman and CEO of NeXT to an advisory role at Apple, the company he had co-founded in 1976;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-acquires-next-jobs/|title=Apple acquires Next, Jobs|last=Kawamoto|first=Dawn|date=|website=CNET|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200315025703/https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-acquires-next-jobs/|archive-date=15 Mar 2020|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> and it promised to port NeXT's operating system to Macintosh hardware, combine it with the legacy application layer of [[Mac OS]], and yield [[OS X]].{{primary source inline|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Apple Computer, Inc.

The new range included a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the [[NeXTcube]], and the [[NeXTstation]], nicknamed \"the slab\" for its form-factor of a low-rise box. Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff did not use the nickname \"[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]\", so that the NeXT machines would not be compared to competing Sun workstations which already had that nickname. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive but 2.88 MB floppy disks were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the [[CD-ROM]] drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and on the [[NeXTdimension]] [[Video card|graphics processor]] hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new [[Motorola 68040]] processor.\n\nIn 1992, NeXT launched \"Turbo\" variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation with a 33 MHz 68040 processor and maximum RAM capacity increased to 128 MB. NeXT sold 20,000 computers in 1992, and NeXT counted upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales. This is a small number compared with competitors, but the company reported sales of $140 million for the year which encouraged Canon to invest a further $30 million to keep the company afloat.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/200 200]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width=25% | align=right | text=In its existence, Next has sold a total of 50,000 copies of Nextstep, says Jobs.

Over the next five years the NeXTSTEP operating system was ported to the [[PowerPC]] architecture. At the same time, an Intel port and OpenStep Enterprise toolkit for Windows were both produced. The operating system was code named [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]],<ref>{{Cite web | date=August 6, 1997 | title=What's NeXT? | work=MacObserver | first=Arlen | last=Britton | url=http://www.macobserver.com/columns/whatsnext/articles/080697.shtml | accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}</ref> while the toolkit for development on all platforms was called \"Yellow Box\".

The OpenStep developer toolkit was renamed [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]. Rhapsody's Blue Box was renamed [[Classic Environment]] and changed to run applications full-screen without requiring a separate window. Apple included an updated version of the original Macintosh toolbox, called [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]], that gave existing Mac applications access to the environment without the constraints of Blue Box.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Sellers\n| first = Dennis\n| title = OS X III: finally, a first-class OS\n| work = Computer User\n| page = 66\n| date = November 2000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news\n| title = Mac OS X Takes Macintosh to New Level\n| work = [[eWeek]]\n| date = July 15, 2002}}</ref> Some of NeXTSTEP's interface features were used in Mac OS X, including the [[Taskbar|Dock]], the [[Services menu]], the [[Finder (software)|Finder]]'s \"[[Miller columns|Column]]\" view, and the [[Cocoa text system]].\n\nNeXTSTEP's processor-independent capabilities were retained in Mac OS X, leading to both PowerPC and Intel x86 versions (although only PowerPC versions were publicly available before 2006). Apple moved to Intel processors by August 2006.<ref>{{Cite press release | title=Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006 | url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html | publisher=Apple Computer|date=June 6, 2005 | accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Corporate culture and community==\nJobs created a different corporate culture at NeXT in terms of facilities, salaries, and benefits. Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a \"community\" with \"members\" instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid {{US$|75000|1986}} and those who joined afterward were paid {{US$|50000|1986}}. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever took advantage of the privilege. NeXT's [[health insurance]] plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}} The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time because instead of being delivered twice a month in arrears at the end of the pay period, it was delivered once a month in advance.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|289}}\n\nJobs found office space in [[Palo Alto, California]] on 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass and concrete building which featured a staircase designed by architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major [[wikt:component|components]] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.<ref name=\"AppleConfidential\">{{Cite book | first=Owen W. | last=Linzmayer | title=Apple Confidential 2.0 | publisher=No Starch Press | year=2004 |isbn=1-59327-010-0}}</ref>{{rp|323}}\n\nAs NeXT expanded, more office space was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a \"floating\" staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, although furnishings became luxurious, with $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas, and [[Ansel Adams]] prints.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}}\n\nNeXT's first campus in Palo Alto was subsequently occupied by [[SAP SE|SAP AG]]. Its second campus in Redwood City was occupied by ApniCure and [[OncoMed|OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.]]<ref>{{Cite news | title=The NeXT big thing: OncoMed finds a home | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/10/29/focus6.html?page=all | publisher=American City Business Journals|date=October 28, 2007 | accessdate=June 11, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe first issue of ''NeXTWORLD'' magazine was printed in 1991. It was published in [[San Francisco]] by Integrated Media and edited by Michael Miley and later Dan Ruby. It was the only mainstream periodical to discuss NeXT computers, the operating system, and NeXT software. The publication was discontinued in 1994 after only four volumes.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Serial Archive Listings for NeXTWORLD | website=The Online Books Page | url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=nextworld| accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}</ref> A ''NeXTWORLD Expo'' followed as a developer [[Convention (meeting)|conference]], held in 1991 and 1992 at the San Francisco Civic Center and in 1993 and 1994 at the [[Moscone Center]] in San Francisco, with Steve Jobs as the keynote speaker.<ref>{{Cite news | title=NeXT makes play for corporate market | work=PC Week | author=NextStep users seek safety in big numbers | date=January 27, 1992}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThough not very profitable, the company had a wide-ranging impact on the computer industry. [[Object-oriented programming]] and [[graphical user interface]]s became more common after the 1988 release of the NeXTcube and NeXTSTEP. The technologically successful platform was often held as the trendsetter when other companies started to emulate the success of NeXT's object-oriented system.<ref>{{Cite news | author=Smith, Carrie | title=NeXT means business now. | work=Wall Street & Technology | date=May 1994 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}</ref>\n\nWidely seen as a response to NeXT, Microsoft announced the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo project]] in 1991; the Cairo specification included similar object-oriented user interface features for a coming consumer version of Windows NT. Although Cairo was ultimately abandoned, some elements were integrated into other projects. By 1994, Microsoft and NeXT were collaborating on a Windows NT port of OpenStep which was never released.<ref>{{Cite news | author=Smith, Carrie | title=NeXT, Microsoft tackle objects: NT to gain OpenStep port. | work=PC Week | date=November 7, 1994 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}</ref>\n\nBy 1993, [[Taligent]] was considered by the press to be a competitor in objects and operating systems even without any product release, with NeXT being a main point of comparison. For the first few years, Taligent's theoretical newness was often compared to NeXT's older but mature and commercially established platform,<ref name=\"Unixworld April 1993\"/><ref name=\"NeXTWORLD Feb 1994\">{{Cite interview | magazine=NeXTWORLD | date=February 1994 | page=23-24 | first=Bud | last=Tribble | interviewer=NeXTWORLD | title=Bud Tribble Explains It All | url=https://archive.org/details/nextworld-1994/ | accessdate=February 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Semich\n| first =J.
