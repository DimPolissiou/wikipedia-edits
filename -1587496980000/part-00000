It first aired on 17 February 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in a recognisable, near-future London beset by terrorism and [[illegal immigration]], ''The Last Enemy'' features the introduction of \"TIA\" ([[Total Information Awareness]]), a centralised [[database]] that can be used to track and monitor anybody, effectively by putting all available government and corporate&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. credit card and bank activity, phone use, internet use, purchases, rentals, etc.&nbsp;\u2013 information in one place.\n\nThe story deals with a political cover-up centred on a sanctioned but secret medical experiment run amok with key members of the government trying desperately to hide all evidence of their experimental batch of vaccine that seems to be causing a deadly [[virus]]. The complex story unspools to reveal the moral, social and privacy concerns of this hypothetical TIA system in a post-[[7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7]] world, including such control mechanisms familiar to both real life and science fiction as retinal scans, fingerprint identification and ubiquitous camera and cellphone surveillance footage.\n\nThe story is told through the eyes of a mathematical genius, Stephen Ezard, who is portrayed as a recluse showing some signs of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. But the shy genius overcomes his own inhibitions to burrow into a highly compromised British government using his brilliance and their TIA system only to find himself ultimately trapped by the people he most trusts, and to learn he is a pawn in manipulative Security State machinations which take the people he most loves from him and compromise him forever.\n\n==Viewing figures==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n|-\n!

It first aired on 17 February 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in a recognisable, near-future London beset by terrorism and [[illegal immigration]], ''The Last Enemy'' features the introduction of \"TIA\" ([[Total Information Awareness]]), a centralised [[database]] that can be used to track and monitor anybody, effectively by putting all available government and corporate&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. credit card and bank activity, phone use, internet use, purchases, rentals, etc.&nbsp;\u2013 information in one place.\n\nThe story deals with a political cover-up centred on a sanctioned but secret medical experiment run amok with key members of the government trying desperately to hide all evidence of their experimental batch of vaccine that seems to be causing a deadly [[virus]]. The complex story unspools to reveal the moral, social and privacy concerns of this hypothetical TIA system in a post-[[7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7]] world, including such control mechanisms familiar to both real life and science fiction as retinal scans, fingerprint identification and ubiquitous camera and cellphone surveillance footage.\n\nThe story is told through the eyes of a mathematical genius, Stephen Ezard, who is portrayed as a recluse showing some signs of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. But the shy genius overcomes his own inhibitions to burrow into a highly compromised British government using his brilliance and their TIA system only to find himself ultimately trapped by the people he most trusts, and to learn he is a pawn in manipulative Security State machinations which take the people he most loves from him and compromise him forever.\n\n==Viewing figures==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n|-\n!

The South African Football Association is the second Football Association in South Africa to be named the ''South African Football Association'' and it is also the second football association in South Africa to affiliate to FIFA. The present day South African Football Association, unlike its predecessor allows for a mixed-race national team.\n\nSAFA was admitted to FIFA in 1992 and its senior team has since represented South Africa at the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=\"iol-2009-11-25\">{{cite web|last=Auf der Heyde|first=Peter|title=South Africa in international football|url=http://www.iol.co.za/sport/special-features/world-cup-2010/south-africa-in-international-football-1.610169|work=Independent Online|location=South Africa|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=25 November 2009}}</ref> During SAFA's time as the FIFA-affiliated football organisation, South Africa has also hosted several editions of the [[COSAFA Cup]], the [[1996 Africa Cup of Nations]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nThe South African Football Association is responsible for the administration of the South African national football teams (both men's and women's), and the [[SAFA Second Division|third tier]] and below of the South African Football league system. The [[Premier Soccer League]] administrates the top two divisions and several cup competitions.\n\n==History==\n\n===South African Football Association (1892)===\n\nThe founding of the first football associations in South Africa were influenced by arrival of many British soldiers to South Africa. The original South African Football Association was a white only organization established in 1892.  The South African Football Association was the first national governing body on the continent and affiliated to FIFA in 1910.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\">{{cite book|last=Alegi|first=Peter|title=African soccerscapes : how a continent changed the world's game|year=2010|publisher=Hurst|location=London|isbn=9781849040389|edition=1. publ.}}</ref> The SAFA of 1892 was the first association on the African continent to become affiliated to FIFA. SAFA withdrew from FIFA in 1924 and later regained full membership in 1952.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nIn 1932, the South African African Football Association (SAAFA) was formed and a year later the South African Bantu Football Association (SABFA) and the South African Coloured Football Association (SACFA) followed suit. In September 1951, the three merged to form the anti-apartheid South African Soccer Federation (SASF).<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/football-south-africa-timeline-1862-2012|publisher=sahistory.org.za|accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref> The South African Football Association struggled for the right to represent South African in world football (FIFA) against South African Soccer Federation (SASF) SASF claimed it was the legitimate representative of South Africa considering three-fourths of football players were registered within SASF.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alegi |first1=Peter |title=Soccerscapes |date=2010 |publisher=Ohio University Press |isbn=978-0-89680-278-0 |pages=51 |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSAFA were expected to play in the newly formed [[Confederation of African Football]]'s [[1957 Africa Cup of Nations]], however they did not. The minutes of the meetings between SAFA and their counterparts from Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan were lost to fire and so the official reason for their non-appearance is unknown.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/> Fred Fell, SAFA's representative at FIFA said that SAFA withdrew because of the conflict at the [[Suez Crisis|Suez Canal]]. There were also rumours that they were expelled from the initial competition due to their favourable stance on apartheid.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nIn November 1954, the SASF attempted to join FIFA. In May 1955, FIFA concluded that SAFA does not have \"the standing of a real national association\" because it did not control all clubs, there were more clubs and players with SASF than SAFA. SASF's application was rejected because there were no white players. In 1956, FIFA chose to accept SAFA's stance that segregation was a \"tradition and custom\" in South Africa.\n\nThe South African Football Association were renamed to the ''Football Association of South Africa (FASA)'' in 1957. The newly renamed association also removed a clause from its constitution excluding non-whites. In his book ''African Soccerscapes'', Professor Peter Alegi says this was to \"create the perception of substantive change while maintaining the status quo\".<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nIn 1959, the SASF successfully managed to have a FIFA sanctioned game between Brazilian club Portuguesa Santista and white South Africa cancelled, as the Brazilian club had agreed to withdraw its black players from the game. The SASF had complained to the Brazilian consul in Cape Town, the Brazilian government prevented the club from taking part.\n\nAt FIFA's 1960 Congress in Rome,an anti racism resolution was adopted that demanded the Football Association of South Africa (FASA) integrate football within a year or they would be expelled from FIFA. There were calls from the Soviet bloc and Asia for the South African Soccer Federation (SASF) to become a member of FIFA in place of FASA. The calls were rejected as FIFA's own statutes stated that \"a National Association must be open to all who practice football in that country whether amateur, 'non-amateur', or professional and without any racial, religious, political discrimination\". FASA as well as South Africa were also expelled for the Confederation Africaine de Football for discrimination.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nIn September 1961, FASA were suspended from FIFA because of their pro-apartheid stance and refusal to field non-white players. This was the first time a major organization had expelled the administration of South Africa. Also, in 1961 the white-South Africa sympathiser [[Stanley Rous]] was elected as FIFA President. Rous and United States citizen Joseph Maguire would later visit white South African officials for two weeks. Rous reported to FIFA that there was no wilful discrimination within FASA and on the basis of his report, FASA were allowed back into FIFA in September 1963.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nAt the Tokyo Congress, the [[Confederation of African Football]] members were lobbying for the expulsion of the FASA unless its \"obnoxious apartheid policy [was] totally eliminated\". They had retained the support of Soviet and Asian National Associations and held meetings with South African Soccer Federation in Durban and the ''South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee'' in London. CAF had already expelled South Africa from its own membership. The request for expulsion from FIFA was downgraded to suspension and it was passed by a majority of associations at the 1964 FIFA Congress.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nFollowing the suspension, South Africa were also not allowed to take part in the 1964 and 1968 Olympics and were expelled from the Olympic movement in 1970. During this time Rous had been lobbying to have South Africa re-instated into FIFA and the Olympics. In 1973, Brazilian FIFA President candidate [[Joao Havelange]] withdrew Brazil from the 1973 [[South African Games]] to curry favour with the anti-apartheid national associations and went to beat Rous in the FIFA Presidential Election. At the FIFA Congress on 16 July 1976 in Montreal, FASA were formally suspended from FIFA. Members of FIFA had voted to exclude South Africa 78 votes to 9.<ref>{{cite book|last=Koonyaditse|first=Oshebeng Alpheus|title=The politics of South African football|year=2010|publisher=African Perspectives|location=Grant Park, South Africa|isbn=978-0981439822|pages=30}}</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 1991 many opposing football associations came together in a \"unity\" process that eventually formed a non-racial South African Football Association. In January 1992, the Confederation Africaine de Football also reinstated South Africa into their football organization.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alegi |first1=Peter |title=Soccerscapes |date=August 2010 |publisher=Ohio University Press |isbn=978-0-89680-278-0 |page=127 |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== South African Football Association (1991) ===\n\nThe new South African Football Association was founded on 23 March 1991, the culmination of a long unity process that was to rid the sport in South Africa of all its past racial division.\n\nA delegation of the SAFA received a standing ovation at the congress of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) in [[Dakar, Senegal]] a month later, where South Africa were accorded observer status. South Africa's membership of the world governing body [[FIFA]] was confirmed at their congress in [[Zurich]] in June 1992.\n \nMembership of CAF followed automatically and South Africa was back on the world stage, and were awarded the right to host the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.\n \nWithin a month the country hosted their first international match as World Cup quarterfinalists [[Cameroon]] came to play in three matches to celebrate the unity process. In September 1992, South Africa played its first junior international against [[Botswana]] at under-16 level in Lenasia and to date the country has entered a team in each of FIFA's and CAF's competitions, from under-17 to national team level, and also for the women's team.\n \nIn the short space of six years, SAFA has achieved remarkable success with qualification for the World Cup finals in France in 1998, the title of African champions at the [[1996 African Nations Cup]] finals, which the country hosted, and the runners-up berth in [[Burkina Faso]] two years later.\n\nAt under-20 level, South Africa were runners-up at the [[1997 African Youth Championship]] in Morocco and qualified to play at the [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship]] in Malaysia.\n \nAt club level, [[Orlando Pirates]] won the prestigious [[CAF Champions League|African Champions Cup]] in 1995, the first club from the southern African region to take the title in more than 30 years of competition. Pirates were playing in the event for the first time and won the title away from home in the [[Ivory Coast]] to further amplify the magnificence of the victory.\n \nBehind the scenes, SAFA has worked long and hard to provide the structures to take football to all levels of the South African community. There are now national age-group competitions from under-12 level up, qualified coaches working around the country and nine provincial affiliates, who are further divided into 52 regions.\n\n==National Executive==\n* President: [[Danny Jordaan]]\n* Vice-President: [[Lucas Nhlapo]]\n* Vice-President: [[Elvis Shishana]] \n* Vice-President: [[Irvin Khoza]]<ref name=\"safa.net\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.safa.net/index.php?page=committee1|title=SAFA.net - South African Football Association|website=www.safa.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref>\n* Secretary General: [[Dennis Mumble]]\n\n==National teams==\n*[[South Africa national under-12 football team|Under-12 (Tsetse-flies)]]\n*[[South Africa national under-15 football team|Under-15 (Flying Birds)]] \n*[[South Africa national under-17 football team|Under-17 (Amajimbos)]]\n*[[South Africa national under-20 football team|Under-20 (Amajita)]]\n*[[South Africa national under-23 football team|Under-23 (Amaglug-glug)]]\n*[[South Africa national football team|Senior National Team (Bafana Bafana)]]\n*[[Under-17 Women]]\n*[[Under-20 Women]]\n*[[Under-23 Women]]\n*[[South Africa women's national football team|Senior Women's National Team (Banyana Banyana)]]\n\n==Regions==\n'''SAFA's 9 Provinces''' and 52 '''Regions'''\n*'''[[SAFA Eastern Cape]]''' (Regions: ''Alfred Nzo, Amathole, Cacadu, Chris Hani, Nelson Mandela Bay, OR Tambo, Ukhahlamba'')\n*'''[[SAFA Free State]]''' (Regions: ''Fezile Dabi, Lejweleputswa, Motheo, Thabo Mofutsanyana, Xhariep'')\n*'''[[SAFA Gauteng]]''' (Regions: ''Ekurhuleni, Johannesburg, Metsweding, Sedibeng, Tshwane, West Rand'')\n*'''[[SAFA KwaZulu-Natal]]''' (Regions: ''Amajuba, Ethekwini, iLembe, Sisonke, Ugu, Umgungundlovu, Umkhanyakude, Umzinyathi, Uthukela, Uthungulu, Zululand'')\n*'''[[SAFA Mpumalanga]]''' (Regions: ''Ehlanzeni, Gert Sibande, Nkangala'')\n*'''[[SAFA Northern Cape]]''' (Regions: ''Frances Baard, Kgalagadi, Namakwa, Pixley-Ka-Seme, Siyanda'')\n*'''[[SAFA Limpopo]]''' (Regions: ''Capricorn, Mopani, Sekhukhune, Vhembe, Waterberg'')\n*'''[[SAFA North-West]]''' (Regions: ''Bojanala, Bophirima, Central, Southern'')\n*'''[[SAFA Western Cape]]''' (Regions: ''Boland, Cape Town, Central Karoo, Eden, Overberg, West Coast'')\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.safa.net SAFA]\n*[https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=rsa/index.html   South Africa] at FIFA site\n*[http://www.cafonline.com/association/south-africa  South Africa] at Confederation of African Football (CAF)\n\n{{Football in South Africa}}\n{{International football}}\n{{National Members of the Confederation of African Football}}\n{{Sports governing bodies in South Africa}}\n\n[[Category:National members of the Confederation of African Football|South Africa]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Johannesburg]]\n[[Category:Soccer in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Sports governing bodies in South Africa|Foot]]\n[[Category:1991 establishments in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Sports organizations established in 1991]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=May 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Infobox football association\n| Logo                    = SAFA logo.svg\n| Badge_size               = 200px\n| Founded               = {{plainlist|\n*1892 (original)\n*1991  }}\n| Headquarters          = [[Johannesburg]]\n| FIFA affiliation      = 1992\n| Region                = [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] \n| Region affiliation    = 1992\n| Subregion             = [[COSAFA]]\n| Subregion affiliation = 1997\n| President             = [[Danny Jordaan]]\n| Website               = {{URL|www.safa.net}}\n}}\n\nThe '''South African Football Association''' or '''SAFA''' is the national administrative [[sports governing body|governing body]] that controls the sport of [[association football|football]] in the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]] (RSA) and is a member of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF).

The present day South African Football Association, unlike its predecessor allows for a mixed-race national team.\n\nSAFA was admitted to FIFA in 1992 and its senior team has since represented South Africa at the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=\"iol-2009-11-25\">{{cite web|last=Auf der Heyde|first=Peter|title=South Africa in international football|url=http://www.iol.co.za/sport/special-features/world-cup-2010/south-africa-in-international-football-1.610169|work=Independent Online|location=South Africa|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=25 November 2009}}</ref> During SAFA's time as the FIFA-affiliated football organisation, South Africa has also hosted several editions of the [[COSAFA Cup]], the [[1996 Africa Cup of Nations]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nThe South African Football Association is responsible for the administration of the South African national football teams (both men's and women's), and the [[SAFA Second Division|third tier]] and below of the South African Football league system. The [[Premier Soccer League]] administrates the top two divisions and several cup competitions.\n\n==History==\n\n===South African Football Association (1892)===\n\nThe founding of the first football associations in South Africa were influenced by arrival of many British soliders to South Africa. The original South African Football Association was a white only organization established in 1892.  The South african Football Association was the first national governing body on the continent and affiliated to FIFA in 1910.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\">{{cite book|last=Alegi|first=Peter|title=African soccerscapes : how a continent changed the world's game|year=2010|publisher=Hurst|location=London|isbn=9781849040389|edition=1. publ.}}</ref> The SAFA of 1892 was the first association on the African continent to become affiliated to FIFA. SAFA withdrew from FIFA in 1924 and later regained full membership in 1952.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nIn 1932, the South African African Football Association (SAAFA) was formed and a year later the South African Bantu Football Association (SABFA) and the South African Coloured Football Association (SACFA) followed suit. In September 1951, the three merged to form the anti-apartheid South African Soccer Federation (SASF).<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/football-south-africa-timeline-1862-2012|publisher=sahistory.org.za|accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref> The South African Football Association struggled for the right to represent South African in world football (FIFA) against South African Soccer Federation (SASF) SASF claimed it was the legitimate representative of South Africa considering three-fourths of football players were registered within SASF.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alegi |first1=Peter |title=Soccerscapes |date=2010 |publisher=Ohio University Press |isbn=978-0-89680-278-0 |pages=51 |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>   \n\nSAFA were expected to play in the newly formed [[Confederation of African Football]]'s [[1957 Africa Cup of Nations]], however they did not. The minutes of the meetings between SAFA and their counterparts from Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan were lost to fire and so the official reason for their non-appearance is unknown.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/> Fred Fell, SAFA's representative at FIFA said that SAFA withdrew because of the conflict at the [[Suez Crisis|Suez Canal]]. There were also rumours that they were expelled from the initial competition due to their favourable stance on apartheid.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nIn November 1954, the SASF attempted to join FIFA. In May 1955, FIFA concluded that SAFA does not have \"the standing of a real national association\" because it did not control all clubs, there were more clubs and players with SASF than SAFA. SASF's application was rejected because there were no white players. In 1956, FIFA chose to accept SAFA's stance that segregation was a \"tradition and custom\" in South Africa.\n\nThe South African Football Association were renamed to the ''Football Association of South Africa (FASA)'' in 1957. The newly renamed association also removed a clause from its constitution excluding non-whites. In his book ''African Soccerscapes'', Professor Peter Alegi says this was to \"create the perception of substantive change while maintaining the status quo\".<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nIn 1959, the SASF successfully managed to have a FIFA sanctioned game between Brazilian club Portuguesa Santista and white South Africa cancelled, as the Brazilian club had agreed to withdraw its black players from the game. The SASF had complained to the Brazilian consul in Cape Town, the Brazilian government prevented the club from taking part.\n\nAt FIFA's 1960 Congress in Rome,an anti racism resolution was adopted that demanded the Football Association of South Africa (FASA) integrate football within a year or they would be expelled from FIFA. There were calls from the Soviet bloc and Asia for the South African Soccer Federation (SASF) to become a member of FIFA in place of FASA. The calls were rejected as FIFA's own statutes stated that \"a National Association must be open to all who practice football in that country whether amateur, 'non-amateur', or professional and without any racial, religious, political discrimination\". FASA as well as South Africa were also expelled for the Confederation Africaine de Football for discrimination. <ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nIn September 1961, FASA were suspended from FIFA because of their pro-apartheid stance and refusal to field non-white players. This was the first time a major organization had expelled the administration of South Africa. Also, in 1961 the white-South Africa sympathiser [[Stanley Rous]] was elected as FIFA President. Rous and United States citizen Joseph Maguire would later visit white South African officials for two weeks. Rous reported to FIFA that there was no wilful discrimination within FASA and on the basis of his report, FASA were allowed back into FIFA in September 1963.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nAt the Tokyo Congress, the [[Confederation of African Football]] members were lobbying for the expulsion of the FASA unless its \"obnoxious apartheid policy [was] totally eliminated\". They had retained the support of Soviet and Asian National Associations and held meetings with South African Soccer Federation in Durban and the ''South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee'' in London. CAF had already expelled South Africa from its own membership. The request for expulsion from FIFA was downgraded to suspension and it was passed by a majority of associations at the 1964 FIFA Congress.<ref name=\"soccerscapes\"/>\n\nFollowing the suspension, South Africa were also not allowed to take part in the 1964 and 1968 Olympics and were expelled from the Olympic movement in 1970. During this time Rous had been lobbying to have South Africa re-instated into FIFA and the Olympics. In 1973, Brazilian FIFA President candidate [[Joao Havelange]] withdrew Brazil from the 1973 [[South African Games]] to curry favour with the anti-apartheid national associations and went to beat Rous in the FIFA Presidential Election. At the FIFA Congress on 16 July 1976 in Montreal, FASA were formally suspended from FIFA. Members of FIFA had voted to exclude South Africa 78 votes to 9.<ref>{{cite book|last=Koonyaditse|first=Oshebeng Alpheus|title=The politics of South African football|year=2010|publisher=African Perspectives|location=Grant Park, South Africa|isbn=978-0981439822|pages=30}}</ref>\n\nDecember 8th 1991 many opposing football associations came together in a \"unity\" process that eventually formed a non-racial South African Football Association. In January of 1992 the Confederation Africaine de Football also reinstated South Africa into their football organization.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alegi |first1=Peter |title=Soccerscapes |date=August 2010 |publisher=Ohio University Press |isbn=978-0-89680-278-0 |page=127 |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== South African Football Association (1991) ===\n\nThe new South African Football Association was founded on 23 March 1991, the culmination of a long unity process that was to rid the sport in South Africa of all its past racial division.\n\nA delegation of the SAFA received a standing ovation at the congress of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) in [[Dakar, Senegal]] a month later, where South Africa were accorded observer status. South Africa's membership of the world governing body [[FIFA]] was confirmed at their congress in [[Zurich]] in June 1992.\n \nMembership of CAF followed automatically and South Africa was back on the world stage, and were awarded the right to host the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.\n \nWithin a month the country hosted their first international match as World Cup quarterfinalists [[Cameroon]] came to play in three matches to celebrate the unity process. In September 1992, South Africa played its first junior international against [[Botswana]] at under-16 level in Lenasia and to date the country has entered a team in each of FIFA's and CAF's competitions, from under-17 to national team level, and also for the women's team.\n \nIn the short space of six years, SAFA has achieved remarkable success with qualification for the World Cup finals in France in 1998, the title of African champions at the [[1996 African Nations Cup]] finals, which the country hosted, and the runners-up berth in [[Burkina Faso]] two years later.\n\nAt under-20 level, South Africa were runners-up at the [[1997 African Youth Championship]] in Morocco and qualified to play at the [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship]] in Malaysia.\n \nAt club level, [[Orlando Pirates]] won the prestigious [[CAF Champions League|African Champions Cup]] in 1995, the first club from the southern African region to take the title in more than 30 years of competition. Pirates were playing in the event for the first time and won the title away from home in the [[Ivory Coast]] to further amplify the magnificence of the victory.\n \nBehind the scenes, SAFA has worked long and hard to provide the structures to take football to all levels of the South African community. There are now national age-group competitions from under-12 level up, qualified coaches working around the country and nine provincial affiliates, who are further divided into 52 regions.\n\n==National Executive==\n* President: [[Danny Jordaan]]\n* Vice-President: [[Lucas Nhlapo]]\n* Vice-President: [[Elvis Shishana]] \n* Vice-President: [[Irvin Khoza]]<ref name=\"safa.net\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.safa.net/index.php?page=committee1|title=SAFA.net - South African Football Association|website=www.safa.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref>\n* Secretary General: [[Dennis Mumble]]\n\n==National teams==\n*[[South Africa national under-12 football team|Under-12 (Tsetse-flies)]]\n*[[South Africa national under-15 football team|Under-15 (Flying Birds)]] \n*[[South Africa national under-17 football team|Under-17 (Amajimbos)]]\n*[[South Africa national under-20 football team|Under-20 (Amajita)]]\n*[[South Africa national under-23 football team|Under-23 (Amaglug-glug)]]\n*[[South Africa national football team|Senior National Team (Bafana Bafana)]]\n*[[Under-17 Women]]\n*[[Under-20 Women]]\n*[[Under-23 Women]]\n*[[South Africa women's national football team|Senior Women's National Team (Banyana Banyana)]]\n\n==Regions==\n'''SAFA's 9 Provinces''' and 52 '''Regions'''\n*'''[[SAFA Eastern Cape]]''' (Regions: ''Alfred Nzo, Amathole, Cacadu, Chris Hani, Nelson Mandela Bay, OR Tambo, Ukhahlamba'')\n*'''[[SAFA Free State]]''' (Regions: ''Fezile Dabi, Lejweleputswa, Motheo, Thabo Mofutsanyana, Xhariep'')\n*'''[[SAFA Gauteng]]''' (Regions: ''Ekurhuleni, Johannesburg, Metsweding, Sedibeng, Tshwane, West Rand'')\n*'''[[SAFA KwaZulu-Natal]]''' (Regions: ''Amajuba, Ethekwini, iLembe, Sisonke, Ugu, Umgungundlovu, Umkhanyakude, Umzinyathi, Uthukela, Uthungulu, Zululand'')\n*'''[[SAFA Mpumalanga]]''' (Regions: ''Ehlanzeni, Gert Sibande, Nkangala'')\n*'''[[SAFA Northern Cape]]''' (Regions: ''Frances Baard, Kgalagadi, Namakwa, Pixley-Ka-Seme, Siyanda'')\n*'''[[SAFA Limpopo]]''' (Regions: ''Capricorn, Mopani, Sekhukhune, Vhembe, Waterberg'')\n*'''[[SAFA North-West]]''' (Regions: ''Bojanala, Bophirima, Central, Southern'')\n*'''[[SAFA Western Cape]]''' (Regions: ''Boland, Cape Town, Central Karoo, Eden, Overberg, West Coast'')\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.safa.net SAFA]\n*[https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=rsa/index.html   South Africa] at FIFA site\n*[http://www.cafonline.com/association/south-africa  South Africa] at Confederation of African Football (CAF)\n\n{{Football in South Africa}}\n{{International football}}\n{{National Members of the Confederation of African Football}}\n{{Sports governing bodies in South Africa}}\n\n[[Category:National members of the Confederation of African Football|South Africa]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Johannesburg]]\n[[Category:Soccer in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Sports governing bodies in South Africa|Foot]]\n[[Category:1991 establishments in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Sports organizations established in 1991]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSouth African Football Association (1892):clean up, replaced: solider \u2192  soldier,typo(s) fixed: african \u2192 African", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Football_Association"}
