The kingdom of the [[Ganda people]], Buganda is the largest of the traditional kingdoms in present-day Uganda, comprising all of Uganda's [[Districts of Uganda|Central Region]], including the Ugandan capital [[Kampala]]. The 6 million ''Baganda'' (singular ''Muganda''; often referred to simply by the root word and adjective, Ganda) make up the largest Ugandan ethnic group, representing approximately 16.9% of [[Demographics of Uganda|Uganda's population]].<ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ug.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nBuganda has a [[History of Buganda|long and extensive history]]. Unified in the 14th century under the first king [[Kato Kintu]], the founder of Buganda's Kintu Dynasty, Buganda grew to become one of the largest and most powerful states in [[East Africa]] during the eighteenth and 19th centuries. Before the 12th century, the present day Buganda region was known as Muwaawa, which means a sparsely populated place. During the [[Scramble for Africa]], and following unsuccessful attempts to retain its independence against [[British Empire|British imperialism]], Buganda became the centre of the [[Uganda Protectorate]] in 1894; the name Uganda, the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term for Buganda, was adopted by British officials. Under British rule, many Baganda acquired status as colonial administrators, and Buganda became a major producer of [[cotton]] and [[coffee]].\n\nFollowing [[Uganda's independence]] in 1962, the kingdom was abolished by Uganda's first Prime Minister [[Milton Obote]] in 1966. Following years of disturbance under Obote and dictator [[Idi Amin]], as well as several years of internal divisions among Uganda's ruling [[National Resistance Movement]] under [[Yoweri Museveni]], the [[President of Uganda]] since 1986, the kingdom was officially restored in 1993. Buganda is now a [[monarchy]] with a large degree of autonomy from the Ugandan state, although tensions between the kingdom and the Ugandan government continue to be a defining feature of [[Politics of Uganda|Ugandan politics]].\n\nSince the restoration of the kingdom in 1993, the king of Buganda, known as the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], has been [[Muwenda Mutebi II of Buganda|Muwenda Mutebi II]]. He is recognised as the 36th Kabaka of Buganda. The current queen, known as the [[Nnabagereka of Buganda|Nnabagereka]], is [[Queen Sylvia of Buganda|Queen Sylvia Nagginda]].\n\n==Location==\nBuganda's boundaries are marked by [[Lake Victoria]] to the south, the [[Victoria Nile|River Nile]] to the east, [[Lake Kyoga]] to the north and [[River Kafu]] to the northwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buganda.com/buga1900.htm|title=Uganda Agreement, 1900|website=www.buganda.com|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\nThe [[Luganda|Luganda language]] is widely spoken in Uganda and is the most popular language in Uganda along with English.<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/>\n\nIn literature and common discourse, Buganda is often referred to as Central Uganda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/5/1/0/5/p151059_index.html|title=Buganda Often called \"Central Uganda\"|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and environment==\nGanda villages, sometimes as large as forty to fifty homes, were generally located on hillsides, leaving hilltops and [[swamp|swampy lowlands]] uninhabited, to be used for crops or pastures. Early Ganda villages surrounded the home of a chief or headman, which provided a common meeting ground for members of the village. The chief collected tribute from his subjects, provided tribute to the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], who was the ruler of the kingdom, distributed resources among his subjects, maintained order, and reinforced social solidarity through his decision-making skills. During the late 19th century, Ganda villages became more dispersed as the role of the chiefs diminished in response to political turmoil, population migration, and occasional popular revolts.\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Kabaka Palace in Kampala.jpg|thumb|Kabaka Palace in Kampala]]\n\nBuganda is a [[constitutional monarchy]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.buganda.or.ug/index.php/our-history/kingdom-structure/katikkiro|title=Katikkiro|last=|first=|date=|website=www.buganda.or.ug|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 April 2018}}</ref> The current Head of State is the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], [[Muwenda Mutebi II of Buganda|Muwenda Mutebi II]] who has reigned since the restoration of the kingdom in 1993.

In contrast with many other [[East Africa]]n economic systems, [[cattle]] played only a minor role. Many Baganda hired laborers from outside Buganda to herd the Baganda's cattle, for those who owned livestock. [[Banana]]s were the most important staple food, providing the economic base for the region's dense population growth. This crop does not require shifting cultivation or bush fallowing to maintain soil fertility, and as a result, Ganda villages were quite permanent. Women did most of the agricultural work, while men often engaged in commerce and [[politics]] (and in precolonial times, [[war]]fare).

Buganda is now a [[monarchy]] with a large degree of autonomy from the Ugandan state, although tensions between the kingdom and the Ugandan government continue to be a defining feature of [[Politics of Uganda|Ugandan politics]].\n\nSince the restoration of the kingdom in 1993, the king of Buganda, known as the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], has been [[Muwenda Mutebi II of Buganda|Muwenda Mutebi II]]. He is recognised as the 36th Kabaka of Buganda. The current queen, known as the [[Nnabagereka of Buganda|Nnabagereka]], is [[Queen Sylvia of Buganda|Queen Sylvia Nagginda]].\n\n==Location==\nBuganda's boundaries are marked by [[Lake Victoria]] to the south, the [[Victoria Nile|River Nile]] to the east, [[Lake Kyoga]] to the north and [[River Kafu]] to the northwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buganda.com/buga1900.htm|title=Uganda Agreement, 1900|website=www.buganda.com|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\nThe [[Luganda|Luganda language]] is widely spoken in Uganda and is the most popular language in Uganda along with English.<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/>\n\nIn literature and common discourse, Buganda is often referred to as Central Uganda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/5/1/0/5/p151059_index.html|title=Buganda Often called \"Central Uganda\"|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and environment==\nGanda villages, sometimes as large as forty to fifty homes, were generally located on hillsides, leaving hilltops and [[swamp|swampy lowlands]] uninhabited, to be used for crops or pastures. Early Ganda villages surrounded the home of a chief or headman, which provided a common meeting ground for members of the village. The chief collected tribute from his subjects, provided tribute to the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], who was the ruler of the kingdom, distributed resources among his subjects, maintained order, and reinforced social solidarity through his decision-making skills. During the late 19th century, Ganda villages became more dispersed as the role of the chiefs diminished in response to political turmoil, population migration, and occasional popular revolts.\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Kabaka Palace in Kampala.jpg|thumb|Kabaka Palace in Kampala]]\n\nBuganda is a [[constitutional monarchy]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.buganda.or.ug/index.php/our-history/kingdom-structure/katikkiro|title=Katikkiro|last=|first=|date=|website=www.buganda.or.ug|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 April 2018}}</ref> The current Head of State is the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], [[Muwenda Mutebi II of Buganda|Muwenda Mutebi II]] who has reigned since the restoration of the kingdom in 1993.

In contrast with many other [[East Africa]]n economic systems, [[cattle]] played only a minor role. Many Baganda hired laborers from outside Buganda to herd the Baganda's cattle, for those who owned livestock. [[Banana]]s were the most important staple food, providing the economic base for the region's dense population growth. This crop does not require shifting cultivation or bush fallowing to maintain soil fertility, and as a result, Ganda villages were quite permanent. Women did most of the agricultural work, while men often engaged in commerce and [[politics]] (and in precolonial times, [[war]]fare).

Some crew members represent new alien races, including [[Deanna Troi]], a half-[[Betazoid]] counselor played by [[Marina Sirtis]].

Unlike the other ''Star Trek'' series, ''DS9'' takes place primarily on a [[space station]] rather than aboard a starship.\n\nThe series begins after the brutal [[Cardassian]] occupation of the planet Bajor. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian-built space station, [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]], near Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the series discover a uniquely stable [[wormhole]] that provides immediate access to the distant [[List of Star Trek regions of space#Galactic Quadrants|Gamma Quadrant]] making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy.<ref name=\"Emissary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/emissary-part-i|title=Emissary, Part I {{!}} Star Trek|website=www.startrek.com|access-date=2006-08-21}}</ref> The series chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander (later Captain) [[Benjamin Sisko]], played by [[Avery Brooks]], and Major (later Colonel) [[Kira Nerys]], played by [[Nana Visitor]].

Like ''Deep Space Nine'', early seasons of ''Voyager'' feature more conflict between its crew members than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arises from friction between \"by-the-book\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager. Eventually, though, they settle their differences, after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of ''The Original Series''. Isolated from its home, the starship ''Voyager'' faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in other series based in the Alpha Quadrant. Later seasons brought in an influx of characters and cultures from prior series, such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], the [[Ferengi]], [[Romulan]]s, [[Klingon]]s, [[Cardassian]]s and cast members of ''The Next Generation''.\n\n===''Enterprise'' (2001\u20132005)===\n[[File:Scott Bakula by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scott Bakula]] played Captain Jonathan Archer, the lead character in ''Enterprise''.]]\n{{Main|Star Trek: Enterprise}}\n'''''Star Trek: Enterprise''''', originally titled '''''Enterprise''''', is a prequel to the original ''Star Trek'' series.

The series originally did not include \"''Star Trek''\" in its name and logo, adding it later on in the series' run.\n\nDuring the series' first two seasons, ''Enterprise'' featured self-contained episodes, like ''The Original Series'', ''The Next Generation'' and ''Voyager''. The entire [[Star Trek: Enterprise (season 3)|third season]] consisted of one arc related to the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]], and had a darker tone and serialized nature similar to that of ''Deep Space Nine''. The fourth and final season consisted of several mini-arcs composed of two to three episodes. The final season showed the origins of some elements of previous series, and resolved some of their continuity problems. Ratings for ''Enterprise'' started strong but declined rapidly. Although critics received the fourth season well, both fans and the cast criticized the [[These Are the Voyages...#Reception|series finale]], partly because of the episode's focus on the guest appearance of cast members of ''The Next Generation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|title=Star Trek: Enterprise Series Finale {{!}} Movie and TV Reviews {{!}} SCI FI Weekly|last=Lee|first=Patrick|date=2005-05-14|website=www.scifi.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101153926/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|archivedate=2007-01-01|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://trekweb.com/stories.php?aid=43a43f1175dcc&topBrowse=all|title=TrekWeb.com -

When Columbia's ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' had a huge opening in late December 1977, Paramount was convinced that science fiction films other than ''Star Wars'' could do well at the box office, and production of ''Phase II'' was cancelled in favor of making a ''Star Trek'' film.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

The film introduced an upgrade to the technology and starship designs, making for a dramatic visual departure from the original series. Many of the set elements created for ''Phase II'' were adapted and enhanced for use in the first feature films. It received mixed reviews from critics; while it grossed $139 million the price tag had climbed to about $45 million due to costly effects work and delays.\n\n====''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' (1982)====\n{{Main|Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan}}\n[[Khan Noonien Singh]] ([[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]), whom Kirk thwarted in his attempt to seize control of the ''Enterprise'' fifteen years earlier (\"[[Space Seed]]\"), seeks his revenge on the Admiral and lays a cunning and sinister trap.\n\n''The Motion Picture''{{'}}s gross was considered disappointing, but it was enough for Paramount to back a sequel with a reduced budget. After Roddenberry pitched a film in which the crew of the ''Enterprise'' goes back in time to ensure the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], he was \"kicked upstairs\" to a ceremonial role while Paramount brought in television producer [[Harve Bennett]] to craft a better\u2014and cheaper\u2014film than the first.<ref name=\"rioux-240\">Rioux, 240.</ref> After watching all the television episodes, Bennett decided that the character [[Khan Noonien Singh]] was the perfect villain for the new film.

(Subsequent ''Star Trek'' films tended to have shorter television versions). Especially notable in ''The Wrath of Khan'' is the footage establishing that a young crew member who acts courageously and dies during an attack on the ''Enterprise'' is Scotty's nephew.\n\n====''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' (1984)====\n{{Main|Star Trek III: The Search for Spock}}\nThe plot picks up shortly after the conclusion of the previous film. When McCoy begins acting irrationally, Kirk learns that Spock, in his final moments, transferred his ''[[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Katra|katra]]'', his living spirit, to the doctor. To save McCoy from emotional ruin, Kirk and crew steal the ''Enterprise'' and violate the quarantine of the Genesis Planet to retrieve Spock, his body regenerated by the rapidly dying planet itself, in the hope that body and soul can be rejoined. However, bent on obtaining the secret of Genesis for themselves, a renegade Klingon ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) and his crew interfere, with deadly consequences.\n\nMeyer declined to return for the next film, so directing duties were given to cast member [[Leonard Nimoy]]. Paramount gave Bennett the green light to write ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|Star Trek III]]'' the day after ''The Wrath of Khan'' opened.<ref name=\"rioux-251\">Rioux, 251.</ref> The producer penned a resurrection story for Spock that built on threads from the previous film and the original series episode \"[[Amok Time]]\".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986)====\n{{Main|Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home}}\nWhile returning to stand court-martial for their actions in rescuing Spock, Kirk and crew learn that Earth is under siege by a giant probe that is transmitting a destructive signal, attempting to communicate with the now-extinct species of [[humpback whale]]s. To save the planet, the crew must time-travel back to the late 20th century to obtain a mating pair of these whales, and a marine biologist ([[Catherine Hicks]]) to care for them.\n\nNimoy returned as director for this film. Nimoy and Bennett wanted a film with a lighter tone that did not have a classic antagonist. They decided on a [[time travel]] story with the ''Enterprise'' crew returning to their past to retrieve something to save their present\u2014eventually, humpback whales. After having been dissatisfied with the script written by [[Daniel Petrie Jr.]], Paramount hired Meyer to rewrite the screenplay with Bennett's help. Meyer drew upon his own time travel story ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'' for elements of the screenplay.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Star [[William Shatner]] was promised his turn as director for ''Star Trek V'', and Nicholas Meyer returned as director/co-writer for ''Star Trek VI''.\n\n====''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' (1989)====\n{{Main|Star Trek V: The Final Frontier}}\nSpock's half-brother ([[Laurence Luckinbill]]) believes he is summoned by [[God]], and hijacks the brand-new (and problem-ridden) [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|''Enterprise''-A]] to take it through the Great Barrier, at the center of the [[Milky Way]], beyond which he believes his maker waits for him. Meanwhile, a young and arrogant Klingon captain (Todd Bryant), seeking glory in what he views as an opportunity to avenge his people of the deaths of their crewmen on Genesis, sets his sights on Kirk.\n\nThis is the only film in the franchise directed by William Shatner.\n\n====''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991)====\n{{Main|Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country}}\nWhen [[Klingon#Homeworld|Qo'noS]]' moon Praxis (the Klingon Empire's chief energy source) is devastated by an explosion, caused by over-mining, the catastrophe also contaminating Qo'noS' atmosphere, the Klingons make peace overtures to the Federation. While on the way to Earth for a peace summit, the Klingon Chancellor ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]) is assassinated by ''Enterprise'' crewmen, and Kirk is held accountable by the Chancellor's Chief of Staff ([[Christopher Plummer]]). Spock attempts to prove Kirk's innocence, but in doing so, uncovers a massive conspiracy against the peace process with participants from both sides.\n\nThis film is a sendoff to the original series cast. One ''Next Generation'' cast member, [[Michael Dorn]], appears as the grandfather of the character he plays on the later television series, [[Worf]]. It is the second and last ''Star Trek'' film directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]] and last screenplay co-authored by Leonard Nimoy.\n\n===''The Next Generation'' films===\nBoth the sixth and seventh films acted as transitions between the films featuring the original cast and those with the ''Next Generation'' cast, with the sixth focusing on the original cast and [[Star Trek Generations|the seventh]] focusing on the ''TNG'' cast. The ''Next Generation'' cast made four films over a period of eight years, with the last two performing only moderately well (''Insurrection'') and disappointingly (''Nemesis'') at the box office.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

The ''Enterprise'', its interior, and the original uniforms were redesigned.\n\nThis revival of the franchise is often considered to be, and referred to as, a \"reboot\", but it is technically a continuation of the franchise (Nimoy reprises his role of Spock from the previous films) that establishes an alternate reality from the previous films. This route was taken, over a [[reboot (fiction)|traditional reboot]], to free the new films from the restrictions of established continuity without completely discarding it, which the writers felt would have been \"disrespectful\". This new reality was informally referred to by several names, including the \"Abramsverse\", \"JJ Trek\" and \"NuTrek\", before it was named the \"Kelvin Timeline\" (versus the \"Prime Timeline\" of the original series and films) by [[Michael Okuda|Michael]] and [[Denise Okuda]] for use in official ''Star Trek'' reference guides and encyclopedias. The name Kelvin comes from the USS ''Kelvin'', a starship involved in the event that creates the new reality in ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009).

Like ''The Next Generation'', ''Deep Space Nine'' aired in syndication in the United States and Canada. Unlike the other ''Star Trek'' series, ''DS9'' takes place primarily on a [[space station]] rather than aboard a starship.\n\nThe series begins after the brutal [[Cardassian]] occupation of the planet Bajor. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian-built space station, [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]], near Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the series discover a uniquely stable [[wormhole]] that provides immediate access to the distant [[List of Star Trek regions of space#Galactic Quadrants|Gamma Quadrant]] making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy.<ref name=\"Emissary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/emissary-part-i|title=Emissary, Part I {{!}} Star Trek|website=www.startrek.com|access-date=2006-08-21}}</ref> The series chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander (later Captain) [[Benjamin Sisko]], played by [[Avery Brooks]], and Major (later Colonel) [[Kira Nerys]], played by [[Nana Visitor]].

Like ''Deep Space Nine'', early seasons of ''Voyager'' feature more conflict between its crew members than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arises from friction between \"by-the-book\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager. Eventually, though, they settle their differences, after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of ''The Original Series''. Isolated from its home, the starship ''Voyager'' faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in other series based in the Alpha Quadrant. Later seasons brought in an influx of characters and cultures from prior series, such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], the [[Ferengi]], [[Romulan]]s, [[Klingon]]s, [[Cardassian]]s and cast members of ''The Next Generation''.\n\n===''Enterprise'' (2001\u20132005)===\n[[File:Scott Bakula by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scott Bakula]] played Captain Jonathan Archer, the lead character in ''Enterprise''.]]\n{{Main|Star Trek: Enterprise}}\n'''''Star Trek: Enterprise''''', originally titled '''''Enterprise''''', is a prequel to the original ''Star Trek'' series.

The series originally did not include \"''Star Trek''\" in its name and logo, adding it later on in the series' run.\n\nDuring the series' first two seasons, ''Enterprise'' featured self-contained episodes, like ''The Original Series'', ''The Next Generation'' and ''Voyager''. The entire [[Star Trek: Enterprise (season 3)|third season]] consisted of one arc related to the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]], and had a darker tone and serialized nature similar to that of ''Deep Space Nine''. The fourth and final season consisted of several mini-arcs composed of two to three episodes. The final season showed the origins of some elements of previous series, and resolved some of their continuity problems. Ratings for ''Enterprise'' started strong but declined rapidly. Although critics received the fourth season well, both fans and the cast criticized the [[These Are the Voyages...#Reception|series finale]], partly because of the episode's focus on the guest appearance of cast members of ''The Next Generation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|title=Star Trek: Enterprise Series Finale {{!}} Movie and TV Reviews {{!}} SCI FI Weekly|last=Lee|first=Patrick|date=2005-05-14|website=www.scifi.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101153926/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|archivedate=2007-01-01|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://trekweb.com/stories.php?aid=43a43f1175dcc&topBrowse=all|title=TrekWeb.com -

Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series, ''[[Star Trek: Phase II|Phase II]]''. The massive worldwide box office success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in mid-1977 sent Hollywood studios to their vaults in search of similar sci-fi properties that could be adapted or re-launched to the big screen. When Columbia's ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' had a huge opening in late December 1977, Paramount was convinced that science fiction films other than ''Star Wars'' could do well at the box office, and production of ''Phase II'' was cancelled in favor of making a ''Star Trek'' film.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

The film introduced an upgrade to the technology and starship designs, making for a dramatic visual departure from the original series. Many of the set elements created for ''Phase II'' were adapted and enhanced for use in the first feature films. It received mixed reviews from critics; while it grossed $139 million the price tag had climbed to about $45 million due to costly effects work and delays.\n\n====''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' (1982)====\n{{Main|Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan}}\n[[Khan Noonien Singh]] ([[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]), whom Kirk thwarted in his attempt to seize control of the ''Enterprise'' fifteen years earlier (\"[[Space Seed]]\"), seeks his revenge on the Admiral and lays a cunning and sinister trap.\n\n''The Motion Picture''{{'}}s gross was considered disappointing, but it was enough for Paramount to back a sequel with a reduced budget.

(Subsequent ''Star Trek'' films tended to have shorter television versions). Especially notable in ''The Wrath of Khan'' is the footage establishing that a young crew member who acts courageously and dies during an attack on the ''Enterprise'' is Scotty's nephew.\n\n====''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' (1984)====\n{{Main|Star Trek III: The Search for Spock}}\nThe plot picks up shortly after the conclusion of the previous film. When McCoy begins acting irrationally, Kirk learns that Spock, in his final moments, transferred his ''[[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Katra|katra]]'', his living spirit, to the doctor. To save McCoy from emotional ruin, Kirk and crew steal the ''Enterprise'' and violate the quarantine of the Genesis Planet to retrieve Spock, his body regenerated by the rapidly dying planet itself, in the hope that body and soul can be rejoined. However, bent on obtaining the secret of Genesis for themselves, a renegade Klingon ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) and his crew interfere, with deadly consequences.\n\nMeyer declined to return for the next film, so directing duties were given to cast member [[Leonard Nimoy]]. Paramount gave Bennett the green light to write ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|Star Trek III]]'' the day after ''The Wrath of Khan'' opened.<ref name=\"rioux-251\">Rioux, 251.</ref> The producer penned a resurrection story for Spock that built on threads from the previous film and the original series episode \"[[Amok Time]]\".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986)====\n{{Main|Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home}}\nWhile returning to stand court-martial for their actions in rescuing Spock, Kirk and crew learn that Earth is under siege by a giant probe that is transmitting a destructive signal, attempting to communicate with the now-extinct species of [[humpback whale]]s. To save the planet, the crew must time-travel back to the late 20th century to obtain a mating pair of these whales, and a marine biologist ([[Catherine Hicks]]) to care for them.\n\nNimoy returned as director for this film. Nimoy and Bennett wanted a film with a lighter tone that did not have a classic antagonist. They decided on a [[time travel]] story with the ''Enterprise'' crew returning to their past to retrieve something to save their present\u2014eventually, humpback whales. After having been dissatisfied with the script written by [[Daniel Petrie Jr.]], Paramount hired Meyer to rewrite the screenplay with Bennett's help. Meyer drew upon his own time travel story ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'' for elements of the screenplay.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Star [[William Shatner]] was promised his turn as director for ''Star Trek V'', and Nicholas Meyer returned as director/co-writer for ''Star Trek VI''.\n\n====''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' (1989)====\n{{Main|Star Trek V: The Final Frontier}}\nSpock's half-brother ([[Laurence Luckinbill]]) believes he is summoned by [[God]], and hijacks the brand-new (and problem-ridden) [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|''Enterprise''-A]] to take it through the Great Barrier, at the center of the [[Milky Way]], beyond which he believes his maker waits for him. Meanwhile, a young and arrogant Klingon captain (Todd Bryant), seeking glory in what he views as an opportunity to avenge his people of the deaths of their crewmen on Genesis, sets his sights on Kirk.\n\nThis is the only film in the franchise directed by William Shatner.\n\n====''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991)====\n{{Main|Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country}}\nWhen [[Klingon#Homeworld|Qo'noS]]' moon Praxis (the Klingon Empire's chief energy source) is devastated by an explosion, caused by over-mining, the catastrophe also contaminating Qo'noS' atmosphere, the Klingons make peace overtures to the Federation. While on the way to Earth for a peace summit, the Klingon Chancellor ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]) is assassinated by ''Enterprise'' crewmen, and Kirk is held accountable by the Chancellor's Chief of Staff ([[Christopher Plummer]]). Spock attempts to prove Kirk's innocence, but in doing so, uncovers a massive conspiracy against the peace process with participants from both sides.\n\nThis film is a sendoff to the original series cast. One ''Next Generation'' cast member, [[Michael Dorn]], appears as the grandfather of the character he plays on the later television series, [[Worf]]. It is the second and last ''Star Trek'' film directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]] and last screenplay co-authored by Leonard Nimoy.\n\n===''The Next Generation'' films===\nBoth the sixth and seventh films acted as transitions between the films featuring the original cast and those with the ''Next Generation'' cast, with the sixth focusing on the original cast and [[Star Trek Generations|the seventh]] focusing on the ''TNG'' cast. The ''Next Generation'' cast made four films over a period of eight years, with the last two performing only moderately well (''Insurrection'') and disappointingly (''Nemesis'') at the box office.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

This film also included original crew members Scotty ([[James Doohan]]) and Chekov ([[Walter Koenig]]).\n\nFollowing seven seasons of ''The Next Generation'', the next ''Star Trek'' film was the first to feature the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]], along with a long prologue sequence featuring three cast members of the original series and the only appearance of the ''Enterprise-B''.\n\n====''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996)====\n{{Main|Star Trek: First Contact}}\nAfter a failed attempt to assault Earth, the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] attempt to prevent First Contact between Humans and Vulcans by interfering with [[Zefram Cochrane]]'s ([[James Cromwell]]) warp test in the past.

However, the admiral himself is a pawn in his alien partner's ([[F. Murray Abraham]]) mission of vengeance.\n\n''Insurrection'' brought in ''Deep Space Nine'' writer Michael Piller instead of Ronald D.

The ''Enterprise'', its interior, and the original uniforms were redesigned.\n\nThis revival of the franchise is often considered to be, and referred to as, a \"reboot\", but it is technically a continuation of the franchise (Nimoy reprises his role of Spock from the previous films) that establishes an alternate reality from the previous films. This route was taken, over a [[reboot (fiction)|traditional reboot]], to free the new films from the restrictions of established continuity without completely discarding it, which the writers felt would have been \"disrespectful\". This new reality was informally referred to by several names, including the \"Abramsverse\", \"JJ Trek\" and \"NuTrek\", before it was named the \"Kelvin Timeline\" (versus the \"Prime Timeline\" of the original series and films) by [[Michael Okuda|Michael]] and [[Denise Okuda]] for use in official ''Star Trek'' reference guides and encyclopedias. The name Kelvin comes from the USS ''Kelvin'', a starship involved in the event that creates the new reality in ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009). Abrams named the starship after his grandfather Henry Kelvin, whom he also pays tribute to in ''Into Darkness'' with the Kelvin Memorial Archive.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|title=\"The Kelvin Timeline\"- Official Name for the New Star Trek Universe|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/popculture/the-kelvin-timeline-official-name-for-the-new-star-trek-universe/vp-AAhGc7S|publisher=MSN|accessdate=July 24, 2016|date=June 27, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819105802/https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/popculture/the-kelvin-timeline-official-name-for-the-new-star-trek-universe/vp-AAhGc7S|archivedate=August 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=TrekCore|title=STAR TREK Alternate Universe Finally Gets Official Name {{!}} TrekCore Blog|url=http://trekcore.com/blog/2016/06/star-trek-alternate-universe-finally-gets-official-name/|website=trekcore.com|accessdate=July 24, 2016|date=June 26, 2016}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

Piloting a one-man vessel, Spock ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) attempts to contain the supernova by generating an artificial black hole, but is assaulted by a Romulan mining vessel captained by Nero ([[Eric Bana]]), who is bent on vengeance for Spock's failure to save Romulus; both vessels are pulled into the black hole and sent back in time to the 23rd century. Nero then captures Spock and uses the black-hole technology to destroy Vulcan. Spock's present-day younger self ([[Zachary Quinto]]), who is a Starfleet Academy instructor, and a volatile and arrogant cadet named James Kirk ([[Chris Pine]]) must then set aside their current differences, and join forces to prevent Nero from consigning Earth and the rest of the Federation worlds to similar fates.\n\nThis film acts as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] to the existing franchise by taking place in an \"alternate reality\" using the plot device of time travel to depict an altered timeline (known as the ''[[Star Trek canon#\"Reboot\" films|Kelvin Timeline]]'', after the ship destroyed in the opening scene),<ref name=\"auto1\"/> featuring younger versions of the original series' cast. It is the first production to feature an entirely different cast of actors playing roles previously established by other actors, with the exception of an aged Spock played by [[Leonard Nimoy]]. It was directed by [[J. J. Abrams]] (who produced it with [[Damon Lindelof]]) and written by [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]]. According to Lindelof, this production was designed to attract a wider audience.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://trekmovie.com/2008/03/01/exclusive-interview-damon-lindelof-on-new-release-date-and-trek-appealing-to-wider-audience/ |title=Exclusive Interview: Damon Lindelof On New Release Date and Trek Appealing To Wider Audience |publisher=TrekMovie.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> It received positive reviews<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_trek_11/ | title=Star Trek | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=September 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/star-trek | title=Star Trek (2009): Reviews | website=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=September 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/browse/movies/score/metascore/year?sort=desc&view=condensed&year_selected=2009|title=Movie Releases by Score (2009) |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref> and a [[Star Trek (film)#Accolades|number of awards]], including the film franchise's only [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], for \"[[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling#2000s|makeup and hairstyling]]\".

The crew of the ''Enterprise'' attempt to bring him to justice without provoking war with the Klingon Empire, but find there is much more to the agent's mission, and the man himself, than what the Fleet Admiral ([[Peter Weller]]) has told them; the agent is none other than [[Khan Noonien Singh]]; his allegiance and his motives are initially not at all clear.\n\n====''Star Trek Beyond'' (2016)====\n{{Main|Star Trek Beyond}}\nThe ''Enterprise'' is ambushed and destroyed by countless alien micro-vessels; the crew abandon ship. Stranded on an unknown planet, and with no apparent means of escape or rescue, they find themselves in conflict with a new sociopathic enemy ([[Idris Elba]]) who has a well-earned hatred of the Federation and what it stands for.\n\n''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' was released on July 22, 2016, in time for the franchise's 50th anniversary celebrations.

In a truly atomistic view, the amount of substance is simply the number of particles that constitute the substance.<ref name=\"Baranski 2012\"> Baranski, A.

The value of the Avogadro constant ''N''<sub>A</sub> has been set to {{physconst|NA||ref=no}}. In the truly atomistic view, 1 mol particles = 6.022 140 76 x 10<sup>23</sup> particles [[Avogadro constant|(Avogadro's number)]] <ref name=\"Brown&Holme Book\"> Brown, L.; Holme, T. (2011) ''Chemistry for Engineering Students'', Brooks/Cole. </ref> and therefore the conversion constant is simply ''N''<sub>A</sub>  = 1.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20B\"></ref> The amount of substance is sometimes referred to as the '''chemical amount'''.\n\nThe mole (symbol \"mol\") is a unit of amount of substance in the [[International System of Units]], defined (since 2019) by fixing the Avogadro constant at the given value.  Historically, the mole was defined as the amount of substance in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. As a consequence, the mass of one mole of a [[chemical compound]], in [[gram]]s, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the mass of one molecule of the compound, in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s, and the molar mass of an isotope in grams per mole is equal to the mass number. For example, a molecule of water has a mass of about 18.015 daltons on average, whereas a mole of water (which contains {{physconst|NA|unit=no|ref=no}} water molecules) has a total mass of about 18.015 grams.\n\nIn chemistry, because of the [[law of multiple proportions]], it is often much more convenient to work with amounts of substances (that is, number of moles or of molecules) than with masses (grams) or volumes (liters).  For example, the chemical fact \"1 molecule of [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) will react with 2 molecules of [[hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2}}) to make 2 molecules of water ({{chem2|H2O}})\" can also be stated as \"1 mole of {{chem2|O2}} will react with 2 moles of {{chem2|H2}} to form 2 moles of water\". The same chemical fact, expressed in terms of masses, would be \"32 g of oxygen will react with approximately 2.0156 g of hydrogen to make approximately 18.0152 g of water\" (and the numbers would depend on the [[isotope|isotopic composition]] of the reagents). In terms of volume, the numbers would depend on the pressure and temperature of the reagents and products.  For the same reasons, the concentrations of reagents and products in solution are often specified in moles per liter, rather than grams per liter.\n\nThe amount of substance is also a convenient concept in [[thermodynamics]].  For example, the pressure of a certain quantity of a [[noble gas]] in a recipient of a given volume, at a given temperature, is directly related to the number of molecules in the gas (through the [[ideal gas law]]), not to its mass.\n\nThis technical sense of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confused with the general sense of \"amount\" in the [[English language]]. The latter may refer to other measurements such as mass or volume,<ref name=\"Giunta\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00690|title=What's in a Name?

For [[metal]]lic [[chemical element|elements]], and some non-metallic elements like [[carbon]] and [[silicon]] which have molecules of indefinite size, it usually refers to atoms instead.  For element [[allotrope]]s with discrete molecules \u2013 like [[iodine]], {{chem|I|2}}, [[chlorine]], {{chem|Cl|2}}, [[phosphorus|white phosphorus]] {{chem|P|4}}, and [[octasulfur]] {{chem|S|8}} \u2013 the term is ambiguous, and should be clarified.\n\nFor [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] (ionic solids) and for [[polymers]] of indeterminate molecular size, the term usually refers to the number of instances of the conventional chemical formula of the substance.  Thus, for example, 1 mol of [[calcium chloride]] ({{chem|CaCl2}}) is understood to contain one mole of [[calcium]] [[cation]]s {{chem|Ca|2+}} and two moles of [[chloride]] [[anion]]s {{chem|Cl|\u2212}}, even though the ions are not bound into separate three-atom molecules.  Likewise, 1 mol of solid [[silicon dioxide]] ({{chem|SiO|2}})<sub>''n''</sub>, which has a three-dimensional covalent lattice structure, is understood to contain one mole of silicon atoms and two moles of oxygen atoms. \n\nFor substances that normally exist in partially dissociated or polymerized form, the amount of substance usually refers to its nominal formula, without taking those changes into account.  For example, \"a solution of 1 mol of [[formaldehyde]] ({{chem|CH|2|O}}) in water\" is generally understood to contain one mole of carbon atoms, even though some of the formaldehyde may be in the form of [[methanediol]] {{chem|CH|4|O|2}} or [[oligomer]]s like [[paraformaldehyde]] {{chem|H|(|CH|2|O|)|''n''|OH}} and [[1,3,5-trioxane|metaformaldehyde]] {{chem|C|3|H|6|O|3}}.  Note that, because of the latter, the number of carbon-containing ''molecules'' in the solution may be substantially less than one mole.\n\n==Derived quantities==\n===Molar quantities (per mole)===\nThe quotient of some [[extensive property|extensive]] physical quantity of a homogeneous sample by its amount of substance is an [[intensive property]] of the substance, usually named by the prefix '''molar'''.<ref name=\"molar\">{{GreenBookRef|page=7}}</ref> \n\nFor example, the ratio of the mass of a sample by its amount of substance is the [[molar mass]], whose SI unit is kilograms (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about 18.015 g/mol for water, and 55.845 g/mol for [[iron]].  From the volume, one gets the [[molar volume]], which is about 17.962 [[milliliter]]/mol for liquid water and 7.092 mL/mol for iron at room temperature.  From the [[heat capacity]], one gets the [[molar heat capacity]], which is about 75.385 [[joule|J]]/[[kelvin|K]]/mol for water and about 25.10 J/K/mol for iron.\n\n===Amount concentration (moles per liter)===\nAnother important derived quantity is the [[amount of substance concentration]]<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=amount-of-substance concentration|file=A00298}}</ref> (also called ''amount concentration'', or ''substance concentration'' in [[clinical chemistry]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry | year = 1996 | title = Glossary of Terms in Quantities and Units in Clinical Chemistry | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1996/pdf/6804x0957.pdf | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 957\u20131000 | doi=10.1351/pac199668040957| author-link = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry }}</ref>; which is defined as the amount of a specific substance in a sample of a solution (or some other mixture), divided by the volume of the sample.  \n\nThe SI unit of this quantity is the mole (of the substance) per liter (of the solution).  Thus, for example, the amount concentration of [[sodium chloride]] in ocean water is typically about 0.599 mol/L.\n\nThe denominator is the volume of the solution, not of the solvent. Thus, for example, one liter of standard [[vodka]] contains about 0.40 L of [[ethanol]] (315 g, 6.85 mol) and 0.60 L of water. The amount concentration of ethanol is therefore (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(1 L of vodka) = 6.85 mol/L, not (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(0.60 L of water), which would be 11.4 mol/L. \n\nIn chemistry, it is customary to read the unit \"mol/L\" as '''[[molar (unit)|molar]]''', and denote it by the symbol \"M\" (both following the numeric value). Thus, for example, each liter of a \"0.5 molar\" or \"0.5 M\" solution of [[urea]] ({{chem|CH|4|N|2|O}}) in water contains 0.5 moles of that molecule.  By extension, the amount concentration is also commonly called the '''molarity''' of the substance of interest in the solution.  However, as of May 2007, these terms and symbols are not condoned by IUPAC.<ref>{{GreenBookRef|page=42&nbsp;(n.&nbsp;15)}}</ref>\n\nThis quantity should not be confused with the [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]], which is the mass of the substance of interest divided by the volume of the solution (about 35 g/L for sodium chloride in ocean water). \n\n===Amount fraction (moles per mole)===\nConfusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguished from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of moles (molecules) of the substance of interest divided by the total number of moles (molecules) in the solution sample.  This quantity is more properly called the [[amount fraction]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Alchemy|alchemists]], and especially the early [[metallurgist]]s, probably had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviving records of any generalization of the idea beyond a set of recipes. In 1758, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] questioned the idea that mass was the only measure of the quantity of matter,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lomonosov | first = Mikhail | authorlink = Mikhail Lomonosov | year = 1970 | contribution = On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight | editor-first = Henry M. | editor-last = Leicester | title = Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | contribution-url=//archive.org/stream/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp#page/n239/mode/2up | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | pages = 224\u201333 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> but he did so only in relation to his theories on [[gravitation]].

Historically, the mole was defined as the amount of substance in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. As a consequence, the mass of one mole of a [[chemical compound]], in [[gram]]s, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the mass of one molecule of the compound, in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s, and the molar mass of an isotope in grams per mole is equal to the mass number. For example, a molecule of water has a mass of about 18.015 daltons on average, whereas a mole of water (which contains {{physconst|NA|unit=no|ref=no}} water molecules) has a total mass of about 18.015 grams.\n\nIn chemistry, because of the [[law of multiple proportions]], it is often much more convenient to work with amounts of substances (that is, number of moles or of molecules) than with masses (grams) or volumes (liters).  For example, the chemical fact \"1 molecule of [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) will react with 2 molecules of [[hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2}}) to make 2 molecules of water ({{chem2|H2O}})\" can also be stated as \"1 mole of {{chem2|O2}} will react with 2 moles of {{chem2|H2}} to form 2 moles of water\". The same chemical fact, expressed in terms of masses, would be \"32 g of oxygen will react with approximately 2.0156 g of hydrogen to make approximately 18.0152 g of water\" (and the numbers would depend on the [[isotope|isotopic composition]] of the reagents). In terms of volume, the numbers would depend on the pressure and temperature of the reagents and products.  For the same reasons, the concentrations of reagents and products in solution are often specified in moles per liter, rather than grams per liter.\n\nThe amount of substance is also a convenient concept in [[thermodynamics]].  For example, the pressure of a certain quantity of a [[noble gas]] in a recipient of a given volume, at a given temperature, is directly related to the number of molecules in the gas (through the [[ideal gas law]]), not to its mass.\n\nThis technical sense of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confused with the general sense of \"amount\" in the [[English language]]. The latter may refer to other measurements such as mass or volume,<ref name=\"Giunta\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00690|title=What's in a Name?

For [[metal]]lic [[chemical element|elements]], and some non-metallic elements like [[carbon]] and [[silicon]] which have molecules of indefinite size, it usually refers to atoms instead.  For element [[allotrope]]s with discrete molecules \u2013 like [[iodine]], {{chem|I|2}}, [[chlorine]], {{chem|Cl|2}}, [[phosphorus|white phosphorus]] {{chem|P|4}}, and [[octasulfur]] {{chem|S|8}} \u2013 the term is ambiguous, and should be clarified.\n\nFor [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] (ionic solids) and for [[polymers]] of indeterminate molecular size, the term usually refers to the number of instances of the conventional chemical formula of the substance.  Thus, for example, 1 mol of [[calcium chloride]] ({{chem|CaCl2}}) is understood to contain one mole of [[calcium]] [[cation]]s {{chem|Ca|2+}} and two moles of [[chloride]] [[anion]]s {{chem|Cl|\u2212}}, even though the ions are not bound into separate three-atom molecules.  Likewise, 1 mol of solid [[silicon dioxide]] ({{chem|SiO|2}})<sub>''n''</sub>, which has a three-dimensional covalent lattice structure, is understood to contain one mole of silicon atoms and two moles of oxygen atoms. \n\nFor substances that normally exist in partially dissociated or polymerized form, the amount of substance usually refers to its nominal formula, without taking those changes into account.  For example, \"a solution of 1 mol of [[formaldehyde]] ({{chem|CH|2|O}}) in water\" is generally understood to contain one mole of carbon atoms, even though some of the formaldehyde may be in the form of [[methanediol]] {{chem|CH|4|O|2}} or [[oligomer]]s like [[paraformaldehyde]] {{chem|H|(|CH|2|O|)|''n''|OH}} and [[1,3,5-trioxane|metaformaldehyde]] {{chem|C|3|H|6|O|3}}.  Note that, because of the latter, the number of carbon-containing ''molecules'' in the solution may be substantially less than one mole.\n\n==Derived quantities==\n===Molar quantities (per mole)===\nThe quotient of some [[extensive property|extensive]] physical quantity of a homogeneous sample by its amount of substance is an [[intensive property]] of the substance, usually named by the prefix '''molar'''.<ref name=\"molar\">{{GreenBookRef|page=7}}</ref> \n\nFor example, the ratio of the mass of a sample by its amount of substance is the [[molar mass]], whose SI unit is kilograms (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about 18.015 g/mol for water, and 55.845 g/mol for [[iron]].  From the volume, one gets the [[molar volume]], which is about 17.962 [[milliliter]]/mol for liquid water and 7.092 mL/mol for iron at room temperature.  From the [[heat capacity]], one gets the [[molar heat capacity]], which is about 75.385 [[joule|J]]/[[kelvin|K]]/mol for water and about 25.10 J/K/mol for iron.\n\n===Amount concentration (moles per liter)===\nAnother important derived quantity is the [[amount of substance concentration]]<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=amount-of-substance concentration|file=A00298}}</ref> (also called ''amount concentration'', or ''substance concentration'' in [[clinical chemistry]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry | year = 1996 | title = Glossary of Terms in Quantities and Units in Clinical Chemistry | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1996/pdf/6804x0957.pdf | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 957\u20131000 | doi=10.1351/pac199668040957| author-link = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry }}</ref>; which is defined as the amount of a specific substance in a sample of a solution (or some other mixture), divided by the volume of the sample.  \n\nThe SI unit of this quantity is the mole (of the substance) per liter (of the solution).  Thus, for example, the amount concentration of [[sodium chloride]] in ocean water is typically about 0.599 mol/L.\n\nThe denominator is the volume of the solution, not of the solvent. Thus, for example, one liter of standard [[vodka]] contains about 0.40 L of [[ethanol]] (315 g, 6.85 mol) and 0.60 L of water. The amount concentration of ethanol is therefore (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(1 L of vodka) = 6.85 mol/L, not (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(0.60 L of water), which would be 11.4 mol/L. \n\nIn chemistry, it is customary to read the unit \"mol/L\" as '''[[molar (unit)|molar]]''', and denote it by the symbol \"M\" (both following the numeric value). Thus, for example, each liter of a \"0.5 molar\" or \"0.5 M\" solution of [[urea]] ({{chem|CH|4|N|2|O}}) in water contains 0.5 moles of that molecule.  By extension, the amount concentration is also commonly called the '''molarity''' of the substance of interest in the solution.  However, as of May 2007, these terms and symbols are not condoned by IUPAC.<ref>{{GreenBookRef|page=42&nbsp;(n.&nbsp;15)}}</ref>\n\nThis quantity should not be confused with the [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]], which is the mass of the substance of interest divided by the volume of the solution (about 35 g/L for sodium chloride in ocean water). \n\n===Amount fraction (moles per mole)===\nConfusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguished from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of moles (molecules) of the substance of interest divided by the total number of moles (molecules) in the solution sample.  This quantity is more properly called the [[amount fraction]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Alchemy|alchemists]], and especially the early [[metallurgist]]s, probably had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviving records of any generalization of the idea beyond a set of recipes. In 1758, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] questioned the idea that mass was the only measure of the quantity of matter,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lomonosov | first = Mikhail | authorlink = Mikhail Lomonosov | year = 1970 | contribution = On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight | editor-first = Henry M. | editor-last = Leicester | title = Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | contribution-url=//archive.org/stream/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp#page/n239/mode/2up | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | pages = 224\u201333 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> but he did so only in relation to his theories on [[gravitation]].

However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.\n\n[[File:Koeh-232.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Oryza sativa]]'', commonly known as Asian rice]]\nThe traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters [[vermin]]. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of [[irrigation]] require higher effort in [[Weed control|weed]] and [[pest control]] during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.\n\nThe name [[wild rice]] is usually used for species of the genera ''[[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]]'' and ''[[Porteresia]]'', both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of ''[[Oryza]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst used in English in the middle of the 13th century, the word \"rice\" derives from the [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|ris}}, which comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|riso}}, in turn from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|or\u0233za}}, which derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|oruza}}).

Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for ''[[risotto]]'' in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as ''[[arr\u00f2s negre]]'', in Spain. Some varieties of long-grain rice that are high in [[amylopectin]], known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|title=White Sticky Rice \u2013 Kao Niow|author=Loha-unchit, Kasma|accessdate=October 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013231727/http://thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|archive-date=October 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> A stickier medium-grain rice is used for ''[[sushi]]''; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].\n\n[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in [[Batter (cooking)|batters]] and breadings to increase crispiness.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Stages of rice milling.jpg|thumb|Unmilled to milled rice, from left to right, [[brown rice]], rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]], [[white rice]] ''([[Japanese rice]])'']]\n[[File:Rice Animation.gif|thumb|A: Rice with [[chaff]]<br>B: [[Brown rice]]<br>C: Rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]]<br>D: [[White rice]] with [[bran]] [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>E: Musenmai (Japanese: [[:ja:\u7121\u6d17\u7c73|\u7121\u6d17\u7c73]]), \"Polished and ready to boil rice\", literally, non-wash rice<br>(1): [[Chaff]]<br>(2): [[Bran]]<br>(3): Bran [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>(4): [[Cereal germ]]<br>(5): [[Endosperm]]]]\n\nRice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess [[starch]]. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.\n\nRice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.\n\nBrown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate [[germination]]. This process, called [[germinated brown rice]] (GBR),<ref>{{cite web |title=Marketing of Value-Added Rice Products in Japan: Germinated Grown Rice and Rice Bread |url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |accessdate=February 12, 2004 |author1=Shoichi Ito |author2=Yukihiro Ishikawa |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Tottori University, Japan. |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HeLK3CUV?url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |archive-date=June 25, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].\n\nRice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses.<ref>The Best Way to Cook Rice is All About the Right Ratio- What's Eating Dan? [[America's Test Kitchen]]</ref> With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] or [[biryani]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] .\n\n===Dishes===\n{{main|List of rice dishes}}\nIn [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is also used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Rice may also be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge or [[rice gruel]]) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is also a traditional food for the sick.\n\n==Food==\n===Nutrition===\nRice is the [[staple food]] of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa. Rice provides 20% of the world's dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice is Life|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|year=2004|url=http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|access-date=November 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110193515/http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|archive-date=November 10, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCooked, unenriched, white, long-grained rice is composed of 68% water, 28% [[carbohydrates]], 3% [[protein]], and negligible [[fat]] (table).

The building of the rice terraces consists of blanketing walls with stones and earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters.

At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].\n\nFrom the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh]]es and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia filipes|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century.

At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].\n\nEither by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.\n\nIn some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]] (also known as '''converted rice''' and '''easy-cook rice'''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | title=Types of rice | publisher=Rice Association | access-date=August 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802162740/http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | archive-date=August 2, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>) is subjected to a steaming or [[parboiling]] process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially [[thiamine]]) to move into the [[endosperm]], so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.\n\n[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.\n\nRaw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]].

Boiled rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or butter (known as [[fried rice]]), or beaten in a tub to make ''[[mochi]]''.\n\nRice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.<ref name=\"Protein content\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00006-0 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G.

This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]].

In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labor groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.\n\nA familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.\n\n===Distribution===\nBecause of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008).

Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance.<ref name=j2/> Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite [[Home stored product entomology|insect infestation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kogan, M. |author2=Ortman, E.F. |title=Antixenosis a new term proposed to defined to describe Painter's \"non-preference\" modality of resistance |journal=Bull.

For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as \"glutinous rice\" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to \"gluten\") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.\n\nIndian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (\u0a2c\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a2e\u0a24\u0a40) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.\n\nAromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.\n\nHigh-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.\n\nDraft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]). Rice was the first crop with a complete genome sequence.<ref>{{cite news | last=Gillis | first=Justing | title=Rice Genome Fully Mapped | date=August 11, 2005 | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html | access-date=September 10, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330212346/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html | archive-date=March 30, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2002, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared the year 2004 the International Year of Rice.

This project enabled labor markets in Asia to shift away from agriculture, and into industrial sectors. The first \"Rice Car\", IR8 was produced in 1966 at the [[International Rice Research Institute]] which is based in the Philippines at the [[University of the Philippines]]' Los Ba\u00f1os site. IR8 was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named \"Peta\" and a Chinese variety named \"Dee Geo Woo Gen.\"<ref name=\"ir8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |title=Rice Varieties |accessdate=July 13, 2006 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713032524/http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2006 }}.

Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.\n\n=== Future potential ===\nAs the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the \"Green Revolution\" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of \"[[New Rices for Africa]]\" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology \"from Africa, for Africa\". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence. Ongoing research in China to develop [[perennial rice]] could result in enhanced sustainability and [[food security]].\n\n=== Golden rice ===\n{{Main|Golden rice}}\nRice kernels do not contain [[vitamin A]], so people who obtain most of their calories from rice are at risk of [[vitamin A deficiency]].

Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=J.|last2=Hu|first2=C.|last3=Yan|first3=X.|last4=Jin|first4=Y.|last5=Chen|first5=Z.|last6=Guan|first6=Q.|last7=Wang|first7=Y.|last8=Zhong|first8=D.|last9=Jansson|first9=C.|last10=Wang|first10=F.|last11=Schn\u00fcrer|first11=A.|last12=Sun|first12=C.|title=Expression of barley SUSIBA2 transcription factor yields high-starch low-methane rice|journal=Nature|date=July 22, 2015|volume=523|issue=7562|pages=602\u201306|doi=10.1038/nature14673|bibcode=2015Natur.523..602S|pmid=26200336}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gerry|title=Feeding the World One Genetically Modified Tomato at a Time: A Scientific Perspective|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|website=SITN|accessdate=September 11, 2015|date=2015-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910164510/http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Meiosis and DNA repair==\nRice is used as a model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and [[DNA repair]] in higher plants.

However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.\n\n[[File:Koeh-232.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Oryza sativa]]'', commonly known as Asian rice]]\nThe traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters [[vermin]]. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of [[irrigation]] require higher effort in [[Weed control|weed]] and [[pest control]] during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.\n\nThe name [[wild rice]] is usually used for species of the genera ''[[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]]'' and ''[[Porteresia]]'', both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of ''[[Oryza]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst used in English in the middle of the 13th century, the word \"rice\" derives from the [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|ris}}, which comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|riso}}, in turn from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|or\u0233za}}, which derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|oruza}}).

Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].\n\n[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in [[Batter (cooking)|batters]] and breadings to increase crispiness.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Stages of rice milling.jpg|thumb|Unmilled to milled rice, from left to right, [[brown rice]], rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]], [[white rice]] ''([[Japanese rice]])'']]\n[[File:Rice Animation.gif|thumb|A: Rice with [[chaff]]<br>B: [[Brown rice]]<br>C: Rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]]<br>D: [[White rice]] with [[bran]] [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>E: Musenmai (Japanese: [[:ja:\u7121\u6d17\u7c73|\u7121\u6d17\u7c73]]), \"Polished and ready to boil rice\", literally, non-wash rice<br>(1): [[Chaff]]<br>(2): [[Bran]]<br>(3): Bran [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>(4): [[Cereal germ]]<br>(5): [[Endosperm]]]]\n\nRice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess [[starch]]. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.\n\nRice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.\n\nBrown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate [[germination]].

This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].\n\nRice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses.<ref>The Best Way to Cook Rice is All About the Right Ratio- What's Eating Dan? [[America's Test Kitchen]]</ref> With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] or [[biryani]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] .\n\n===Dishes===\n{{main|List of rice dishes}}\nIn [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is also used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Rice may also be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge or [[rice gruel]]) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is also a traditional food for the sick.\n\n==Food==\n===Nutrition===\nRice is the [[staple food]] of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa.

The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century.

At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].\n\nEither by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.\n\nIn some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]] (also known as '''converted rice''' and '''easy-cook rice'''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | title=Types of rice | publisher=Rice Association | access-date=August 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802162740/http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | archive-date=August 2, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>) is subjected to a steaming or [[parboiling]] process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially [[thiamine]]) to move into the [[endosperm]], so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.\n\n[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.\n\nRaw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]].

Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm\u00b3. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.\n\n===Harvesting, drying and milling===\n[[File:Rice-combine-harvester, Katori-city, Japan.jpg|thumb|Rice combine harvester [[Katori, Chiba|Katori-city]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], [[Japan]]]]\n[[File:Rice farmers Mae Wang Chiang Mai Province.jpg|thumb|After the harvest, rice straw is gathered in the traditional way from small paddy fields in [[Mae Wang District]], [[Chiang Mai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]\n{{Further|Paddy field}}\n<!-- [[Paddy]] and [[Padi]] link to this section -->\nUnmilled rice, known as \"paddy\" (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labor groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.\n\nA familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.\n\n===Distribution===\nBecause of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008).

The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance.<ref name=j2/> Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite [[Home stored product entomology|insect infestation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kogan, M. |author2=Ortman, E.F. |title=Antixenosis a new term proposed to defined to describe Painter's \"non-preference\" modality of resistance |journal=Bull.

When a rice variety is no longer able to resist pest infestations, resistance is said to have broken down.

For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as \"glutinous rice\" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to \"gluten\") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.\n\nIndian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (\u0a2c\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a2e\u0a24\u0a40) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.\n\nAromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.\n\nHigh-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.\n\nDraft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]). Rice was the first crop with a complete genome sequence.<ref>{{cite news | last=Gillis | first=Justing | title=Rice Genome Fully Mapped | date=August 11, 2005 | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html | access-date=September 10, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330212346/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html | archive-date=March 30, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2002, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared the year 2004 the International Year of Rice.

This project enabled labor markets in Asia to shift away from agriculture, and into industrial sectors. The first \"Rice Car\", IR8 was produced in 1966 at the [[International Rice Research Institute]] which is based in the Philippines at the [[University of the Philippines]]' Los Ba\u00f1os site. IR8 was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named \"Peta\" and a Chinese variety named \"Dee Geo Woo Gen.\"<ref name=\"ir8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |title=Rice Varieties |accessdate=July 13, 2006 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713032524/http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2006 }}.

Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.\n\n=== Future potential ===\nAs the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the \"Green Revolution\" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of \"[[New Rices for Africa]]\" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology \"from Africa, for Africa\". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence. Ongoing research in China to develop [[perennial rice]] could result in enhanced sustainability and [[food security]].\n\n=== Golden rice ===\n{{Main|Golden rice}}\nRice kernels do not contain [[vitamin A]], so people who obtain most of their calories from rice are at risk of [[vitamin A deficiency]].

informally delineated historical and [[Social class in the United States|social]] region of suburban [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Lying along the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s once prestigious [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Main Line]], it runs northwest from Center City Philadelphia parallel to [[Lancaster Avenue]] ([[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]]).\n\nThe railroad first connected the Main Line towns in the 19th century. They became home to sprawling [[Estate (land)#United States|country estate]]s belonging to Philadelphia's wealthiest families, and over the decades became a bastion of \"[[old money]]\". Today, the Main Line includes some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/moneymag/1007/gallery.best_places_top_earning_towns.moneymag/5.html |title=Top-Earning Towns |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> [[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]], and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=America\u2019s Richest Zip Codes 2011|url=http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111206/america-s-richest-zip-codes-2011#slide23}}</ref> Today, the railroad is [[Amtrak]]'s [[Keystone Corridor]], along which [[SEPTA]]'s [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] operates.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wayne-Station-Pennsylvania-08.27.2010.jpg|279x279px|thumb|[[Wayne (SEPTA station)|Wayne Station]] on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale line after renovations in 2010]]\n\nThe Main Line region was long part of [[Lenapehoking]], the homeland of the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (the \"true people\", or \"Delaware Indians\"). Europeans [[European colonization of the Americas|arrived]] in the 1600s, after [[William Penn]] sold a tract of land, called the [[Welsh Tract]], to a group of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in London in 1681. This accounts for the many Welsh place names in the area.<ref>{{cite book| title=Overbrook Farms.

Later in the century, the railroad, which owned much of the land surrounding the tracks, encouraged the development of this picturesque environment by building [[train station|way stations]] along the portion of its track closest to Philadelphia. The benefits of what was touted as \"healthy yet cultivated country living\" attracted Philadelphia's social [[American upper class|elite]], many of whom had one house in the city and another larger \"country home\" on the Main Line.\n\nIn the 20th century, many wealthy Philadelphia families moved to the Main Line suburbs. Part of the national trend of suburbanization, this drove rapid investment, prosperity, and growth that turned the area into greater Philadelphia's most affluent and fashionable region. Estates with sweeping lawns and towering maples, the [[d\u00e9butante]] balls and the [[Merion Cricket Club]], which drew crowds of 25,000 spectators to its matches in the early 1900s, were the setting for the 1940 [[Cary Grant|Grant]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]]/[[James Stewart|Stewart]] motion picture ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]].''<ref>Fodor's Philadelphia & the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 16th Edition (Fodor's Gold Guides), New York, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe railroad placed stops about two minutes apart, starting with Overbrook. The surrounding communities became known by the railroad station names which started at [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]] in Center City Philadelphia and went on to 32nd Street Station (replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933), and then the Main Line stations: [[Overbrook_station|Overbrook]], [[Merion_station|Merion]], [[Narberth_station_(SEPTA)|Narberth]], [[Wynnewood Station|Wynnewood]], [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania (Amtrak station)|Ardmore]], [[Haverford station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|Haverford]], [[Bryn Mawr (SEPTA Regional Rail station)|Bryn Mawr]], [[Rosemont_station_(SEPTA)|Rosemont]], [[Villanova Station|Villanova]], [[Radnor_station_(SEPTA_Regional_Rail)|Radnor]], [[St._Davids_station|St. Davids]], [[Wayne_station|Wayne]], [[Strafford (SEPTA station)|Strafford]], [[Devon_station|Devon]], [[Berwyn (SEPTA station)|Berwyn]], [[Daylesford_station|Daylesford]], and [[Paoli Station|Paoli]].  At least five of these station buildings, along with the first Bryn Mawr Hotel, were designed by [[Wilson Brothers & Company]]. Broad Street Station was replaced with [[Suburban Station]] in 1930, and [[30th Street Station]] replaced 32nd Street three years later. Suburban service now extends west of the Main Line to the communities of Malvern, Exton, Whitford, Downingtown, and Thorndale.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/January-2008/COVER-STORY/|title=Where the Tracks Lie|author=Jim Waltzer|date=January 2008|magazine=Main Line Today|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe railroad line then continued on to [[Chicago]], with major stations at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  The railroad, since taken over by [[Amtrak]], is still in service, although its route is slightly different from the original. It also serves the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] of the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] Regional Rail system.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\" />\n\n==Demographics of the Gilded Age==\nIt was not only extremely wealthy people on the Main Line in the period 1880-1920. Wealthy households required large numbers of servants in order to maintain their lifestyle. Often these servants were Black migrants from the South and recent immigrants from Europe. For example, in the 1900 census<ref>1900 census: Tredyffrin, Chester, Pennsylvania</ref>, Tredyffrin Township was 13.5% Black; another 15% had been born in Europe. The two largest countries of origin were Italy and Ireland. The corresponding figures for Lower Merion Township<ref>1900 census: Lower Merion, Montgomery, Pennsylvania</ref> were 6% Black and 15% born in Europe; almost 11% were from Ireland.\n\nAnother dimension of this story is illustrated by the community of Mount Pleasant, in Tredyffrin Township just north of Wayne. This is a community that became predominantly Black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <ref>https://tehistory.org/hqda/html/v12/v12n1p002.html\n</ref> As shown in the census for 1920<ref>US Census, 1920, Enumeration District 78, Tredyffrin, Eastern Precinct, Chester County, Pennsylvania</ref>, most of the Black residents of this neighborhood or their parents had come from the South. Many of the men in this neighborhood (along Henry Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue) were employed by the railroad, as quarry workers, or as chauffeurs and gardeners by private families. The occupations often given for women were cook and laundress. This remains a predominantly Black community to the present day.\n\n==The Main Line today==\n[[File:MilePostRadnor.JPG|thumb|Memorial [[Milestone|mile post]] on [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]], in front of the Anthony Wayne Theater with AT&T tower in background.|277x277px]]\n\nToday, the \"Main Line\" is another name for the western suburbs of Philadelphia along [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30)]] and the former Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line, extending from the city limits to, traditionally, Bryn Mawr and ultimately [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]],<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/prr.html Philly NRHS \u2013 PRR History]</ref> an area of about {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}}. The upper- and upper middle-class enclave has historically been one of the bastions of \"[[old money]]\" in the Northeast, along with places like Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]], [[Westchester County, New York]], [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].\n\nNeighborhoods along the Main Line include nineteenth and early twentieth-century [[Streetcar suburb#Railroad Suburbs|railroad suburbs]] and post-war subdivisions, as well as a few surviving buildings from before the suburban development era.\n\n==Communities on the Main Line==\nThe Main Line proper is a line of communities extending northwest from the City of Philadelphia, along what is currently the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]], from City Line Avenue west to Paoli.\n\n===Core Main Line towns===\nThe original Main Line towns are widely considered to follow the acronym \"Old Maids Never Wed And Have Babies.\"<ref>http://www.e-scholium.org/2017/12/02/discovering-the-entire-hidden-history-of-the-main-line/</ref> From Philadelphia, they are:\n*[[Overbrook]]\n*[[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]]\n*[[Narberth, Pennsylvania|Narberth]]\n*[[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]]\n*[[Ardmore, Pennsylvania|Ardmore]]\n*[[Haverford, Pennsylvania|Haverford]]\n*[[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]\n\nThese seven towns are characterized as one of the primary bastions of old money in Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are comparably more dense than other suburbs and have lively, walkable downtowns. All of these communities were established along Lancaster Avenue prior to the railroad's construction. Additionally, the following two towns are often grouped with the core Main Line, as they were established prior to the line's construction:\n*[[Wayne, Pennsylvania|Wayne]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]], widely considered the western anchor of the Main Line\n\n===Infill Communities===\nBeyond the 9 aforementioned communities, many nearby communities have seeded growth in the twentieth century, either in between the core towns or nearby them. They include:\n*[[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]], immediately to the northeast of Bryn Mawr\n*[[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]] and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], between Bryn Mawr and Wayne\n*[[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]] and [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], between Wayne and Paoli\n\nThese communities are primarily residential and comprise of larger lot sizes than in the 9 core towns. All of them, except Gladwyne, are on the railroad and have their own station stop.\n\n===Exurban Communities===\nWhile the Main Line traditionally ends at Paoli, in the 1990s SEPTA extended service west to [[Thorndale, Pennsylvania|Thorndale]]. As such, communities west along the Main Line to Thorndale or even as far west as Parkesburg are considered to be a part of the Main Line.\n\n==Demographics==\nThere is no collective data for the Main Line, so all data is by [[ZIP code]].

States|social]] region of suburban [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Lying along the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s once prestigious [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Main Line]], it runs northwest from Center City Philadelphia parallel to [[Lancaster Avenue]] ([[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]]).\n\nThe railroad first connected the Main Line towns in the 19th century. They became home to sprawling [[Estate (land)#United States|country estate]]s belonging to Philadelphia's wealthiest families, and over the decades became a bastion of \"[[old money]]\". Today, the Main Line includes some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/moneymag/1007/gallery.best_places_top_earning_towns.moneymag/5.html |title=Top-Earning Towns |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> [[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]], and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=America\u2019s Richest Zip Codes 2011|url=http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111206/america-s-richest-zip-codes-2011#slide23}}</ref> Today, the railroad is [[Amtrak]]'s [[Keystone Corridor]], along which [[SEPTA]]'s [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] operates.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wayne-Station-Pennsylvania-08.27.2010.jpg|279x279px|thumb|[[Wayne (SEPTA station)|Wayne Station]] on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale line after renovations in 2010]]\n\nThe Main Line region was long part of [[Lenapehoking]], the homeland of the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (the \"true people\", or \"Delaware Indians\"). Europeans [[European colonization of the Americas|arrived]] in the 1600s, after [[William Penn]] sold a tract of land, called the [[Welsh Tract]], to a group of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in London in 1681. This accounts for the many Welsh place names in the area.<ref>{{cite book| title=Overbrook Farms. Its historical background, growth and community life |first=Tello J. |last=D'Ap\u00e9ry| publisher= Magee Press| location=Philadelphia| year=1936| page=4| url=http://www.phillyh2o.org/backpages/PDFs_Misc/OverbrookFarms_Apery_1936.pdf#page=23}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] built its main line during the early 19th century as part of the [[Main Line of Public Works]] that spanned Pennsylvania. Later in the century, the railroad, which owned much of the land surrounding the tracks, encouraged the development of this picturesque environment by building [[train station|way stations]] along the portion of its track closest to Philadelphia. The benefits of what was touted as \"healthy yet cultivated country living\" attracted Philadelphia's social [[American upper class|elite]], many of whom had one house in the city and another larger \"country home\" on the Main Line.\n\nIn the 20th century, many wealthy Philadelphia families moved to the Main Line suburbs. Part of the national trend of suburbanization, this drove rapid investment, prosperity, and growth that turned the area into greater Philadelphia's most affluent and fashionable region. Estates with sweeping lawns and towering maples, the [[d\u00e9butante]] balls and the [[Merion Cricket Club]], which drew crowds of 25,000 spectators to its matches in the early 1900s, were the setting for the 1940 [[Cary Grant|Grant]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]]/[[James Stewart|Stewart]] motion picture ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]].''<ref>Fodor's Philadelphia & the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 16th Edition (Fodor's Gold Guides), New York, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe railroad placed stops about two minutes apart, starting with Overbrook. The surrounding communities became known by the railroad station names which started at [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]] in Center City Philadelphia and went on to 32nd Street Station (replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933), and then the Main Line stations: [[Overbrook_station|Overbrook]], [[Merion_station|Merion]], [[Narberth_station_(SEPTA)|Narberth]], [[Wynnewood Station|Wynnewood]], [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania (Amtrak station)|Ardmore]], [[Haverford station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|Haverford]], [[Bryn Mawr (SEPTA Regional Rail station)|Bryn Mawr]], [[Rosemont_station_(SEPTA)|Rosemont]], [[Villanova Station|Villanova]], [[Radnor_station_(SEPTA_Regional_Rail)|Radnor]], [[St._Davids_station|St. Davids]], [[Wayne_station|Wayne]], [[Strafford (SEPTA station)|Strafford]], [[Devon_station|Devon]], [[Berwyn (SEPTA station)|Berwyn]], [[Daylesford_station|Daylesford]], and [[Paoli Station|Paoli]].  At least five of these station buildings, along with the first Bryn Mawr Hotel, were designed by [[Wilson Brothers & Company]]. Broad Street Station was replaced with [[Suburban Station]] in 1930, and [[30th Street Station]] replaced 32nd Street three years later. Suburban service now extends west of the Main Line to the communities of Malvern, Exton, Whitford, Downingtown, and Thorndale.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/January-2008/COVER-STORY/|title=Where the Tracks Lie|author=Jim Waltzer|date=January 2008|magazine=Main Line Today|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe railroad line then continued on to [[Chicago]], with major stations at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  The railroad, since taken over by [[Amtrak]], is still in service, although its route is slightly different from the original. It also serves the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] of the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] Regional Rail system.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\" />\n\n==Demographics of the Gilded Age==\nIt was not only extremely wealthy people on the Main Line in the period 1880-1920. Wealthy households required large numbers of servants in order to maintain their lifestyle. Often these servants were Black migrants from the South and recent immigrants from Europe. For example, in the 1900 census<ref>1900 census: Tredyffrin, Chester, Pennsylvania</ref>, Tredyffrin Township was 13.5% Black; another 15% had been born in Europe. The two largest countries of origin were Italy and Ireland. The corresponding figures for Lower Merion Township<ref>1900 census: Lower Merion, Montgomery, Pennsylvania</ref> were 6% Black and 15% born in Europe; almost 11% were from Ireland.\n\nAnother dimension of this story is illustrated by the community of Mount Pleasant, in Tredyffrin Township just north of Wayne. This is a community that became predominantly Black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <ref>https://tehistory.org/hqda/html/v12/v12n1p002.html\n</ref> As shown in the census for 1920<ref>US Census, 1920, Enumeration District 78, Tredyffrin, Eastern Precinct, Chester County, Pennsylvania</ref>, most of the Black residents of this neighborhood or their parents had come from the South. Many of the men in this neighborhood (along Henry Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue) were employed by the railroad, as quarry workers, or as chauffeurs and gardeners by private families. The occupations often given for women were cook and laundress. This remains a predominantly Black community to the present day.\n\n==The Main Line today==\n[[File:MilePostRadnor.JPG|thumb|Memorial [[Milestone|mile post]] on [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]], in front of the Anthony Wayne Theater with AT&T tower in background.|277x277px]]\n\nToday, the \"Main Line\" is another name for the western suburbs of Philadelphia along [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30)]] and the former Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line, extending from the city limits to, traditionally, Bryn Mawr and ultimately [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]],<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/prr.html Philly NRHS \u2013 PRR History]</ref> an area of about {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}}. The upper- and upper middle-class enclave has historically been one of the bastions of \"[[old money]]\" in the Northeast, along with places like Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]], [[Westchester County, New York]], [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].\n\nNeighborhoods along the Main Line include nineteenth and early twentieth-century [[Streetcar suburb#Railroad Suburbs|railroad suburbs]] and post-war subdivisions, as well as a few surviving buildings from before the suburban development era.\n\n==Communities on the Main Line==\nThe Main Line proper is a line of communities extending northwest from the City of Philadelphia, along what is currently the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]], from City Line Avenue west to Paoli.\n\n===Core Main Line towns===\nThe original Main Line towns are widely considered to follow the acronym \"Old Maids Never Wed And Have Babies.\"<ref>http://www.e-scholium.org/2017/12/02/discovering-the-entire-hidden-history-of-the-main-line/</ref> From Philadelphia, they are:\n*[[Overbrook]]\n*[[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]]\n*[[Narberth, Pennsylvania|Narberth]]\n*[[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]]\n*[[Ardmore, Pennsylvania|Ardmore]]\n*[[Haverford, Pennsylvania|Haverford]]\n*[[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]\n\nThese seven towns are characterized as one of the primary bastions of old money in Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are comparably more dense than other suburbs and have lively, walkable downtowns. All of these communities were established along Lancaster Avenue prior to the railroad's construction. Additionally, the following two towns are often grouped with the core Main Line, as they were established prior to the line's construction:\n*[[Wayne, Pennsylvania|Wayne]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]], widely considered the western anchor of the Main Line\n\n===Infill Communities===\nBeyond the 9 aforementioned communities, many nearby communities have seeded growth in the twentieth century, either in between the core towns or nearby them. They include:\n*[[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]], immediately to the northeast of Bryn Mawr\n*[[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]] and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], between Bryn Mawr and Wayne\n*[[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]] and [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], between Wayne and Paoli\n\nThese communities are primarily residential and comprise of larger lot sizes than in the 9 core towns. All of them, except Gladwyne, are on the railroad and have their own station stop.\n\n===Exurban Communities===\nWhile the Main Line traditionally ends at Paoli, in the 1990s SEPTA extended service west to [[Thorndale, Pennsylvania|Thorndale]].

There are numerous shops, restaurants and businesses lining the road, which forms the southern boundary of Shepherd's Bush Green. It is designated part of the [[A402 road]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:ShepherdsBush Davies map 1841.jpg|thumb|right|Shepherd's Bush, from an 1841 London map by Davies.]]\nGoldhawk Road's name derives from one John Goldhawk, who in the late 14th century held extensive estates in Fulham.<ref>Charles James Feret, ''Fulham Old and New'' (The Leadenhall Press, London, 1900), Volume III, page 267</ref>\n\nGoldhawk Road was of little note until the mid-seventeenth century, when a cottage on the street became the home of one [[Miles Sindercombe]], a disgruntled [[Roundhead]] who in 1657 made several attempts to assassinate [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Sindercombe planned to ambush the Lord Protector using a specially built machine with muskets fixed to a frame. His plan failed, Sindercombe was sentenced to death, and his cottage was eventually demolished in the 1760s.<ref>Denny, p.51</ref>\n\nA map of London dated 1841 shows Goldhawk Road forming the southern boundary of Shepherd's Bush Green. At that time Shepherd's Bush was still largely undeveloped and chiefly rural in character, with much open farmland compared to fast-developing [[Hammersmith]], and several ponds or small lakes. Scattered buildings are shown, mostly lining the main thoroughfares of [[Wood Lane]], Cumberland Road (now the [[Uxbridge Road]]), and Goldhawk Road.<ref name=\"Denny, p.49\">Denny, p.49</ref>\n\nFrom 1939 until 1999 [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital|Queen Charlotte's Hospital]] was situated in Goldhawk Road.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lost Hospitals of London|url=http://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/queencharlottemarylebone.html|publisher=myzen.co.uk|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 2018, a water main near the Shepherd's Bush end of the road burst, flooding part of the road.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/shepherds-bush-flood-londoners-wake-to-no-water-as-burst-water-main-sparks-major-deluge-on-goldhawk-a3753951.html|title=Shepherd's Bush flooding: Londoners wake to \"major\" deluge on Goldhawk Road|work=Evening Standard|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=31 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Goldhawk Road stn east entrance.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Goldhawk Road tube station]]\n[[File:Goldhawk Road station approach geograph-3885438-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|Railway bridge and entrance to Goldhawk Road station in October 1993]]\nThere is also a tube station named Goldhawk Road, built in 1914. [[Goldhawk Road station]] is a [[London Underground]] station located in the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]], on the south side of Goldhawk Road, about 250m west of [[Shepherd's Bush]] Green. It is on the [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]] and [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] lines in [[Travelcard Zone 2]]. Although the line here was opened in 1864 a station was not opened at this location until 1 April 1914 when [[Shepherd's Bush Market tube station|Shepherd's Bush]] station (now Shepherd's Bush Market) was moved from its original location between Uxbridge Road and Goldhawk Road to a location on the north side of Uxbridge Road.\n\n[[Stamford Brook tube station|Stamford Brook Underground station]], though located in the [[London Borough of Hounslow]], also has its main entrance in Goldhawk Road, near the Chiswick end.\n\n==Future==\nHammersmith and Fulham Council have released plans, in association with property developers Orion Shepherd's Bush Ltd, to build around 200 flats and houses as part of a large-scale renovation and improvement of [[Shepherd's Bush Market]]. The development would involve demolition of a number of Victorian shopfronts, No's 30\u201352 Goldhawk Rd, including a Pie and Mash shop at number 48 which has been owned by the same family since 1899.

There are numerous shops, restaurants and businesses lining the road, which forms the southern boundary of Shepherd's Bush Green. It is designated part of the [[A402 road]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:ShepherdsBush Davies map 1841.jpg|thumb|right|Shepherd's Bush, from an 1841 London map by Davies.]]\nGoldhawk Road's name derives from one John Goldhawk, who in the late 14th century held extensive estates in Fulham.<ref>Charles James Feret, ''Fulham Old and New'' (The Leadenhall Press, London, 1900), Volume III, page 267</ref>\n\nGoldhawk Road was of little note until the mid-seventeenth century, when a cottage on the street became the home of one [[Miles Sindercombe]], a disgruntled [[Roundhead]] who in 1657 made several attempts to assassinate [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Sindercombe planned to ambush the Lord Protector using a specially built machine with muskets fixed to a frame. His plan failed, Sindercombe was sentenced to death, and his cottage was eventually demolished in the 1760s.<ref>Denny, p.51</ref>\n\nA map of London dated 1841 shows Goldhawk Road forming the southern boundary of Shepherd's Bush Green. At that time Shepherd's Bush was still largely undeveloped and chiefly rural in character, with much open farmland compared to fast-developing [[Hammersmith]], and several ponds or small lakes. Scattered buildings are shown, mostly lining the main thoroughfares of [[Wood Lane]], Cumberland Road (now the [[Uxbridge Road]]), and Goldhawk Road.<ref name=\"Denny, p.49\">Denny, p.49</ref>\n\nFrom 1939 until 1999 [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital|Queen Charlotte's Hospital]] was situated in Goldhawk Road.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lost Hospitals of London|url=http://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/queencharlottemarylebone.html|publisher=myzen.co.uk|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 2018, a water main near the Shepherd's Bush end of the road burst, flooding part of the road.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/shepherds-bush-flood-londoners-wake-to-no-water-as-burst-water-main-sparks-major-deluge-on-goldhawk-a3753951.html|title=Shepherd's Bush flooding: Londoners wake to \"major\" deluge on Goldhawk Road|work=Evening Standard|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=31 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Goldhawk Road stn east entrance.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Goldhawk Road tube station]]\n[[File:Goldhawk Road station approach geograph-3885438-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|Railway bridge and entrance to Goldhawk Road station in October 1993]]\nThere is also a tube station named Goldhawk Road, built in 1914. [[Goldhawk Road station]] is a [[London Underground]] station located in the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]], on the south side of Goldhawk Road, about 250m west of [[Shepherd's Bush]] Green. It is on the [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]] and [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] lines in [[Travelcard Zone 2]]. Although the line here was opened in 1864 a station was not opened at this location until 1 April 1914 when [[Shepherd's Bush Market tube station|Shepherd's Bush]] station (now Shepherd's Bush Market) was moved from its original location between Uxbridge Road and Goldhawk Road to a location on the north side of Uxbridge Road.\n\n[[Stamford Brook tube station|Stamford Brook Underground station]], though located in the [[London Borough of Hounslow]], also has its main entrance in Goldhawk Road, near the Chiswick end.\n\n==Future==\nHammersmith and Fulham Council have released plans, in association with property developers Orion Shepherd's Bush Ltd, to build around 200 flats and houses as part of a large-scale renovation and improvement of [[Shepherd's Bush Market]]. The development would involve demolition of a number of Victorian shopfronts, No's 30\u201352 Goldhawk Rd, including a Pie and Mash shop at number 48 which has been owned by the same family since 1899.
