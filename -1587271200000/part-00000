Christian theologians like [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] legitimized religious persecution to various extents, and during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offences and they also fought wars to impose Christianity on non-Christian populations (or Christian sects whose beliefs they considered heretical). However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority. Many Christians \"look back on the centuries of persecution with a mixture of revulsion and incomprehension.\"<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted during that time]]. Christianity's definition and practice of the concepts of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that in multiple ways.  However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence. <ref name=\u201cStroumsa\u201d>{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

In the view of many historians, the [[Constantinian shift]] turned Christianity from a persecuted into a persecuting religion.<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-22\">Coffey 2000: 22</ref> However: \u201cThe claim that there ever was a Constantinian shift has been disputed; Peter Leithart argues that there was a \"brief, ambiguous 'Constantinian moment' in the fourth century\", but that there was \"no permanent, epochal ''Constantinian shift''\".\u201d<ref name =\u201cConstantinian Shift\">[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinian_shift]</ref>  Instead, fourth century Rome featured sociological, political, economic and religious competition, producing tensions and hostilities between various groups, leading the fourth century to become one of the most polemical in the history of Christian thought. <ref name=\u201cTesta\u201d>{{cite book|editor1=Rita Lizza Testa| editor2=Michelle Renee Salzman|editor3=Marianne S\u00e1ghy|title=Pagans and Christians in Late Antique Rome: Conflict, Competition, and Coexistence in the Fourth Century|year=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=13, 407|ISBN=978-1-10711-030-4}}</ref><ref name=\u201cFerreiro\u201d>{{cite journal|last= Ferreiro.|first=Alberto|year=1995|title=Simon Magus and Priscillian in the \u2018Commonitorium\u2019 of Vincent of L\u00e9rins|journal=Vigiliae Christianae|volume=49|issue=2|page=180|publisher=JSTOR}}</ref>  Beginning in the late 4th century CE, [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|ancient pagan religions were actively suppressed]] as were alternate forms of Christianity.<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\">Coffey 2000: 23</ref>\n\nIn the East, there was the Arian controversy with its debate of Trinitarian formulas.

Encounters between [[Christianity and Paganism|Christians and Pagans]] were sometimes confrontational, and some Christian [[king]]s ([[Charlemagne]], [[Olaf I of Norway]]) were known for their violence against pagans. The [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n== Christian Roman doctrine in 4th and 5th century A.D.==\n{{Main|Persecution of Pagans by the Christian Roman Empire}}\n\nAfter he had adopted Christianity following the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]], [[Constantine I]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 (together with his co-emperor [[Licinius]]). Since 306 there had already had been several edicts that granted Christians [[religious toleration]] in parts of the Empire, but the Edict of Milan removed all obstacles to the Christian faith and made the Empire officially neutral with regard to religious worship. Constantine supported the church with his patronage; he had an extraordinary number of large [[basilicas]] built for the Christian church, and endowed it with land and other wealth.<ref name=MacMullan49>MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> In doing this, however, he required the Pagans \"to foot the bill\".<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> According to Christian chroniclers it appeared necessary to Constantine \"to teach his subjects to give up their rites (...) and to accustom them to despise their temples and the images contained therein,\"<ref>quoted after MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> which led to the closure of pagan temples due to a lack of support, their wealth flowing to the imperial treasure;<ref name=MacMullan50>MacMullan 1984:50.</ref> Constantine I did not need to use force to implement this;<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> his subjects are said to simply have obeyed him out of fear.

However, he changed his mind after he had witnessed how the [[Donatist]]s (a schismatic Christian sect) were \"brought over to the Catholic unity by fear of imperial edicts.\" When Augustine had characterized himself in ''De utilitate credenti'' (392), he said he was ''cupidus veri'', eager for truth.<ref name=\"Flasch168\">Kurt Flasch: ''Augustin - Einf\u00fchrung in sein Denken'' {{in lang|de}}, 3. ed., Reclam, 2003, p.168</ref> But  in his 93. letter he described himself as ''quietis avidus'', needing rest, and gave as reason the agitating Donatist.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> From a position that had trusted the power of philosophical argumentation, Augustine had moved to a position that emphasised the authority of the church.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> Augustine had become convinced of the effectiveness of mild forms of persecution and developed a defence of their use. His authority on this question was undisputed for over a millennium in [[Western Christianity]].<ref name=\"Coffey22\" /> Within this Augustinian consensus there was only disagreement about the extent to which Christians should persecute heretics. Augustine advocated fines, imprisonment, banishment and moderate floggings, but, according to [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], \"would have been horrified by the burning of heretics.\"<ref>quoted after Coffey 2000: 23.</ref> In [[late Antiquity]] those burnings appear very rare indeed, the only certain case being the execution of [[Priscillian]] and six of his followers in 385. This sentence was roundly condemned by bishops like [[Ambrose]], Augustine's mentor.<ref name=Coffey23>Coffey 2000:23.</ref>\n\n===The treatment of heretics===\n{{Further|Christian heresy}}\nWith the adoption of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Christianity by Constantine I]] (after [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]], 312), heresy had become a political issue in the late Roman empire. Adherents of unconventional Christian beliefs not covered by the [[Nicene Creed]] like [[Novatianism]] and [[Gnosticism]] were banned from holding meetings,<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />  but the Roman emperor intervened especially in the conflict between orthodox and [[Arianism|Arian]] Christianity, which resulted in the burning of Arian books.<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />\n\nIn contrast to the late antiquity, the execution of heretics was much more easily approved in the late [[Middle Ages]], after the Christianization of Europe was largely completed. The first known case is the burning of fourteen people  at [[Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1022.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In the following centuries groups like the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Waldensians]], [[Catharism|Cathars]] and [[Lollardy|Lollards]] were persecuted throughout Europe. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) codified the theory and practise of persecution.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In its third canon, the council declared: ''\"Secular authorities, whatever office they may hold, shall be admonished and induced and if necessary compelled by ecclesiastical censure, .. to take an oath that they will strive .. to exterminate in the territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics pointed out by the Church.\"''<ref>Medieval Sourcebook:  [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Twelfth Ecumenical Council: Lateran IV 1215]</ref>\n\nIn the process of eliminating these heretical movements, Church officials, especially members of the [[Inquisition]], made widespread use of torture to provoke confessions. Heretics who refused to recant their beliefs were hanged or burnt alive.<ref>Sean Martin, The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages, Pocket Essentials, 2005, p.g. 105-120</ref> At the [[Massacre at B\u00e9ziers|Siege of B\u00e9ziers]] during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (launched to eliminate the Cathars in [[Languedoc]], crusaders under the direction of a papal legate, [[Arnaud Amalric]] killed both Cathars and orthodox Catholics.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Zo\u00e9 Oldenbourg]] | title=Massacre at Monts\u00e9gur.

An example of this would be [[John Jewel]]. In defending the demand for religious uniformity by [[Elizabeth I of England]], he declared: ''\"Queen Elizabeth doth as did [[Moses]], [[Joshua|Josua]], [[David]], [[Solomon|Salomon]], [[Josias]], [[Jehoshaphat|Jesophat]], ...\"'' <ref>John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p.31</ref>\n\n==In the Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]], the Church began to sponsor and endorse forced conversion through conquest, something it had hitherto not done.<ref>Haverkamp, Alfred. Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

G\u00f6ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1975. p.g. 58</ref>\n\n==The Protestant theory of persecution==\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] changed the face of [[Western Christianity]] forever, but initially it did nothing to change the Christian endorsement of religious persecution. The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority.

Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.

This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s.

However, he changed his mind after he had witnessed how the [[Donatist]]s (a schismatic Christian sect) were \"brought over to the Catholic unity by fear of imperial edicts.\" When Augustine had characterized himself in ''De utilitate credenti'' (392), he said he was ''cupidus veri'', eager for truth.<ref name=\"Flasch168\">Kurt Flasch: ''Augustin - Einf\u00fchrung in sein Denken'' {{in lang|de}}, 3. ed., Reclam, 2003, p.168</ref> But  in his 93. letter he described himself as ''quietis avidus'', needing rest, and gave as reason the agitating Donatist.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> From a position that had trusted the power of philosophical argumentation, Augustine had moved to a position that emphasised the authority of the church.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> Augustine had become convinced of the effectiveness of mild forms of persecution and developed a defence of their use. His authority on this question was undisputed for over a millennium in [[Western Christianity]].<ref name=\"Coffey22\" /> Within this Augustinian consensus there was only disagreement about the extent to which Christians should persecute heretics. Augustine advocated fines, imprisonment, banishment and moderate floggings, but, according to [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], \"would have been horrified by the burning of heretics.\"<ref>quoted after Coffey 2000: 23.</ref> In [[late Antiquity]] those burnings appear very rare indeed, the only certain case being the execution of [[Priscillian]] and six of his followers in 385. This sentence was roundly condemned by bishops like [[Ambrose]], Augustine's mentor.<ref name=Coffey23>Coffey 2000:23.</ref>\n\n===The treatment of heretics===\n{{Further|Christian heresy}}\nWith the adoption of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Christianity by Constantine I]] (after [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]], 312), heresy had become a political issue in the late Roman empire. Adherents of unconventional Christian beliefs not covered by the [[Nicene Creed]] like [[Novatianism]] and [[Gnosticism]] were banned from holding meetings,<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />  but the Roman emperor intervened especially in the conflict between orthodox and [[Arianism|Arian]] Christianity, which resulted in the burning of Arian books.<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />\n\nIn contrast to the late antiquity, the execution of heretics was much more easily approved in the late [[Middle Ages]], after the Christianization of Europe was largely completed. The first known case is the burning of fourteen people  at [[Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1022.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In the following centuries groups like the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Waldensians]], [[Catharism|Cathars]] and [[Lollardy|Lollards]] were persecuted throughout Europe. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) codified the theory and practise of persecution.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In its third canon, the council declared: ''\"Secular authorities, whatever office they may hold, shall be admonished and induced and if necessary compelled by ecclesiastical censure, .. to take an oath that they will strive .. to exterminate in the territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics pointed out by the Church.\"''<ref>Medieval Sourcebook:  [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Twelfth Ecumenical Council: Lateran IV 1215]</ref>\n\nIn the process of eliminating these heretical movements, Church officials, especially members of the [[Inquisition]], made widespread use of torture to provoke confessions. Heretics who refused to recant their beliefs were hanged or burnt alive.<ref>Sean Martin, The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages, Pocket Essentials, 2005, p.g. 105-120</ref> At the [[Massacre at B\u00e9ziers|Siege of B\u00e9ziers]] during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (launched to eliminate the Cathars in [[Languedoc]], crusaders under the direction of a papal legate, [[Arnaud Amalric]] killed both Cathars and orthodox Catholics.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Zo\u00e9 Oldenbourg]] | title=Massacre at Monts\u00e9gur.

An example of this would be [[John Jewel]]. In defending the demand for religious uniformity by [[Elizabeth I of England]], he declared: ''\"Queen Elizabeth doth as did [[Moses]], [[Joshua|Josua]], [[David]], [[Solomon|Salomon]], [[Josias]], [[Jehoshaphat|Jesophat]], ...\"'' <ref>John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p.31</ref>\n\n==In the Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

Spacey began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s, obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the 1990s that culminated in his first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the [[neo-noir]] crime thriller ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the [[midlife crisis]]-themed drama ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999).\n\nSpacey's other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'' (1994), the psychological thriller ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995), the neo-noir crime film ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997), the drama ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000), the science fiction-mystery film ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-PAX]]'' (2001), the musical biopic ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'' (2004), the superhero film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), and the action film ''[[Baby Driver]]'' (2017).\n\nIn [[Broadway theatre]], Spacey won a [[Tony Award]] in 1991 for his role in ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. In 2017, he hosted the [[71st Tony Awards]]. He was the artistic director of [[the Old Vic]] theatre in [[London]] from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. From 2013 to 2017, he played [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] in the [[Netflix]] political drama series ''[[House of Cards (American TV series)|House of Cards]]'', which won him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama]] and two consecutive [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series|Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series]].\n\nIn October 2017, actor [[Anthony Rapp]] accused Spacey of making a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Numerous other men subsequently came forward alleging that Spacey had [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] or [[sexual assault|assaulted]] them.

Spacey began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s, obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the 1990s that culminated in his first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the [[neo-noir]] crime thriller ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the [[midlife crisis]]-themed drama ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999).\n\nSpacey's other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'' (1994), the psychological thriller ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995), the neo-noir crime film ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997), the drama ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000), the science fiction-mystery film ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-PAX]]'' (2001), the musical biopic ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'' (2004), the superhero film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), and the action film ''[[Baby Driver]]'' (2017).\n\nIn [[Broadway theatre]], Spacey won a [[Tony Award]] in 1991 for his role in ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. In 2017, he hosted the [[71st Tony Awards]]. He was the artistic director of [[the Old Vic]] theatre in [[London]] from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. From 2013 to 2017, he played [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] in the [[Netflix]] political drama series ''[[House of Cards (American TV series)|House of Cards]]'', which won him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama]] and two consecutive [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series|Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series]].\n\nIn October 2017, actor [[Anthony Rapp]] accused Spacey of making a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Numerous other men subsequently came forward alleging that Spacey had [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] or [[sexual assault|assaulted]] them. In December 2018, Spacey was charged with [[indecent assault|indecent assault and battery]] in relation to an accusation by anchorwoman [[Heather Unruh]] that he sexually assaulted her 18-year-old son, but by July 2019, the criminal charge had been dropped.\n\nAs a result of the allegations, Netflix cut ties with Spacey, shelving his film ''Gore'' and removing him from the last season of ''House of Cards''. Spacey's role as [[J. Paul Getty]] in [[Ridley Scott]]'s film ''[[All the Money in the World]]'' (2017) was reshot with actor [[Christopher Plummer]] in his place.

In these situations, researchers are often interested in questions related to [[social choice]], [[conformity]], and [[group polarization]].\n\n===Scientific opinion===\n\"Scientific opinion\" may reflect opinions on scientific concerns as articulated by one or more scientists, published in scholarly journals or respected textbooks, both of which entail peer-review and rigorous professional editing. It may also refer to opinions published by professional, academic, or governmental organizations about scientific findings and their possible implications.\n\nA related\u2014but not identical\u2014term, [[scientific consensus]], is the prevailing view on a scientific topic within the scientific community, such as the [[scientific opinion on climate change]].\n\nScientific opinion(s) can be \"partial, temporally contingent, conflicting, and uncertain\"<ref name=Wynne>{{cite journal|title=Knowledges in Context|journal=Science, Technology & Human Values|year=1991|volume=16|issue=1|pages=111\u2013121|author=Brian Wynne|doi=10.1177/016224399101600108|jstor=690044}}</ref> so that there may be no accepted consensus for a particular situation.

''Match Game'' took the regular 7 PM time slot the next day.}} From 1994 until about 1997, the network aired classic pre-1972 game shows as well as game shows made after 1972, most of which came from the [[Mark Goodson]]\u2013[[Bill Todman]] library. The network also used to air live interstitials as wraparound programming. In its first few months, GSN's commercials consisted of [[public service announcement]]s (PSAs), promotions for its programming and commercials related to network parent company [[Sony]]. By 1995, when the network began to expand, the network began accepting conventional advertising as it gained new sponsorships. On March 17, 1997, the Game Show Network rebranded with a new presentation package, a new logo (which had the network's name in boxes and a colorful swirling ball), and a new slogan: \"All Play, All Day\". The network's new promos and new idents were designed by graphics agency Lee Hunt Associates.\n\nOn October 11, 1997, the network's rights to the Goodson-Todman library expired, with the exceptions of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and the 1994\u201395 season of ''[[Family Feud]]'' (the only season in the second [[Richard Dawson]] era), which were both allowed to continue airing on the channel on a separate contract.

In late 1998, GSN eliminated all of its live programming, replacing them with in-show advertisements like ''Win TV''. In 1999, the network began a slate of original programming, including ''[[Inquizition]]'', ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|All New 3's a Crowd]]'', and ''[[Hollywood Showdown]]''. The channel also launched original shows such as ''Extreme Gong'' (a remake of the classic ''[[The Gong Show]]'').

In the Fall of 2001, the network acquired the rights to air the classic ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' but, due to pressure from CBS, the [[Michael Larson]] episodes were initially excluded. CBS eventually gave Game Show Network the rights to the Larson episodes, airing them in a separate package, as well as in conjunction with an original documentary called ''Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal''.\n\nIn the Fall of 2003, Game Show Network picked up the rights to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' with [[Regis Philbin]].

GSN also introduced the original series at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, ''[[World Series of Blackjack]]'', ''National Lampoon's Greek Games'', ''[[Kenny vs. Spenny]]'' (a Canadian import), and the short-lived ''Fake-a-Date'', a find-a-mate program with host Evan Marriott, the original Joe Millionaire.

''[[Prime Games]]'' was a similarly formatted show aired weeknights and hosted by [[Peter Tomarken]]. ''Wide World of Games'' was a Saturday night block of four shows built around a common theme.\n\nAfter a few years, these shows were replaced by ''Game TV'' (a half-hour interview show hosted by Nancy Sullivan and Dave Nemeth), ''Game World'' (which showed highlights of current game shows from around the world), and standalone 30-minute call-in games like ''Super Decades'' and ''Trivia Track''. Later, the channel attempted a ''Gong Show'' remake called ''Extreme Gong'' (hosted by [[George Gray (television personality)|George Gray]], in which the viewers could phone in their votes as to whether to \"gong\" acts off the air) and ''Throut And Neck'' (hosted by [[Rebecca Grant (American actress)|Rebecca Grant]])<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEkZvm8vZ1Y|title=Throut & Neck - Canadia Episode - Part 1|date=10 June 2009|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297650/|title=Throut and Neck (TV Series 1999\u2013 )|author=thewatcheruatu|date=25 May 2004|work=IMDb}}</ref> (where viewers controlled video game characters with their phones).

(TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'' (a game based on the [[Prisoner's dilemma#Friend or Foe?|Prisoner's Dilemma]]), ''[[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]]'', ''[[WinTuition]]'', ''[[Cram (game show)|Cram]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Funny Money]]'', and ''[[Lingo (American game show)|Lingo]]'' (a [[Chuck Woolery]]-hosted revival of the 1987\u201388 Canadian format in which teams guess five-letter words in a combination of [[Jotto]]/[[Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]] and [[Bingo (US)|bingo]]). The network produced six seasons of the show from 2002 to 2007.\n\nOriginals debuting in 2006 included ''[[PlayMania]]'', a late night call-in game that expanded from two to (at one point) six nights a week continuing until October 31, 2007, and a revival of ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]]'', which ended its run on June 9, 2007. ''[[That's the Question (American game show)|That's the Question]]'', ''[[Starface]]'', and a revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' also debuted in 2006. Debuting in July 2007 were ''[[Camouflage (2007 game show)|Camouflage]]'', remade as a word game, and ''[[Without Prejudice?]]'', a remake of a British show where five people decide which contestant would win $25,000 based in part on their responses to questioning. Debuting on August 4, 2007 was ''[[Grand Slam (American game show)|Grand Slam]]'', a game show involving big winners from other shows, including [[Ken Jennings]], [[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]], and [[Brad Rutter]].\n\nFor 2008, a U.S. version of a [[BBC]] game show called ''[[How Much Is Enough?]]'' debuted on January 8, 2008, hosted by [[Corbin Bernsen]], and then on March 31, 2008, ''[[Bingo America]]'' made its debut with [[Patrick Duffy]] as host. On July 21, 2008, as something of a tie-in with the movie ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'', Merrill Heatter returned to game-show producing with ''[[Catch 21]]'' (a revival of the 1970s game ''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]'') hosted by [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] with [[Mikki Padilla]] as the dealer. GSN also relaunched a live interactive call-in interstitial series, this time known as ''[[GSN Live]]'', which aired during commercial breaks between Noon and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Monday through Friday. Originally the series took place over a three-hour span, with [[Fred Roggin]] and [[Heidi Bohay]] hosting the interstitial segments. Later in the year GSN expanded the series to six hours, with Roggin moving to the 3:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. block with [[Kelly Packard]] while Alfonso Ribeiro replaced him earlier in the day. Packard was forced to leave her position shortly after taking it, and Roggin hosted with a guest host until May 15, 2009 when [[Debra Wilson|Debra Skelton]] was chosen to be a permanent co-host as of May 26, 2009. Roggin left GSN Live on July 2, 2009 in order to concentrate on his new game show ''[[The Money List]]''. Alfonso left GSN Live on August 11, 2009 in order to concentrate on hosting ''[[Catch 21]]''. ''GSN Live'' itself ended on July 29, 2011.\n\nAlso in 2009, ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' returned to the air on GSN, this time with [[Carnie Wilson]] as host. On June 13, 2009, GSN premiered its ''Big Saturday Night'' live interactive show block, hosted by [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Ross Matthews]] and [[Charissa Thompson]].

Included in the block are ''[[20Q (game show)|20Q]]'', hosted by [[Cat Deeley]] and featuring the voice of [[Hal Sparks]] as \"Mr. Q\", and ''[[The Money List]]'', hosted by [[Fred Roggin]]. A hidden camera series, ''[[Instant Recall]]'', hosted by [[Wink Martindale]], premiered on March 4, 2010.<ref name=\"tv\">{{cite web| last = Sassone| first = Bob| url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/02/04/wink-martindale-to-host-instant-recall-on-gsn-starting-march-4/| title = Wink Martindale to Host 'Instant Recall' on GSN Starting March 4| publisher = [[TV Squad]] ([[AOL]])| accessdate = 2010-02-05}}</ref><ref name=\"buzzerblog\">{{cite web |url=http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/gsn-revives-1-vs-100/ |title=GSN Revives 1 vs. 100 |publisher=Buzzerblog |accessdate=2010-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817182536/http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/gsn-revives-1-vs-100/ |archivedate=2010-08-17}}</ref> A revival of ''[[1 vs. 100 (American game show)|1 vs. 100]]'', hosted by [[Carrie Ann Inaba]], aired in 2010.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, Game Show Network announced that Drew Carey would host a new [[improvisational comedy]] show entitled ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]'' in the Spring of 2011 on April 11, 2011. The shows were filmed at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas in January and February 2011. The show lasted forty episodes before being canceled due to low ratings.\n\nIn August 23, 2012, ''[[The American Bible Challenge]]'' with [[Jeff Foxworthy]] became the channel's most popular program of all time, with the series premiere being watched by two million viewers. In the fall of 2012, GSN premiered a new revival titled ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The Pyramid]]'', with [[Mike Richards (producer)|Mike Richards]] hosting. GSN debuted an [[The Chase (American game show)|American version]] of the UK game show ''[[The Chase (UK game show)|The Chase]]'' on August 6, 2013, hosted by [[Brooke Burns]] and featuring [[Mark Labbett]], one of the \"Chasers\" on the UK version, as the sole \"Chaser\", known as \"the Beast\". The show received a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show|Outstanding Game Show]] in 2014, and Burns received a nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] two years later. In the summer of 2014, GSN debuted new series such as ''[[It Takes a Church]]'', ''[[Skin Wars]]'', and ''[[Idiotest]]''.\n\nGSN premiered the original series ''[[America Says]]'', hosted by [[John Michael Higgins]] on June 18, 2018, and the video clip game show ''[[Caroline & Friends]]'', hosted by actress [[Caroline Rhea]] on July 16, 2018. On March 21, 2019, GSN announced it would revive ''[[Catch 21]]'', featuring a different format with Ribeiro returning as host. The network also announced a new show, ''[[Best Ever Trivia Show]]'' with [[Sherri Shepherd]] as the host. The show debuted on June 10, 2019. GSN continued to introduce new originals, with ''[[Common Knowledge (game show)|Common Knowledge]]'' hosted by [[Joey Fatone]] debuting on January 14, 2019, the reboot of ''[[Catch 21]]'' with new dealer [[Witney Carson]] debuting on October 14, 2019, and ''[[Get a Clue (game show)|Get a Clue]]'' hosted by [[Robert Belushi]] premiering on January 6, 2020.\n\n====Specials====\nThe network has run blocks of classic game shows on Saturday nights, and for the first few months of 2006 programmed back-to-back episodes of ''[[Match Game]]'' in a block billed as ''That '70s Hour'' (a pun on ''[[That '70s Show]]''), which showed the original [[clapperboard|production slate]] before each episode as well as ''Match Game'' trivia and brief clips of an interview with host [[Gene Rayburn]] produced shortly before his death. Although production slates had been aired by the network prior to this, \"That '70s Hour\" was the first time the network ''intentionally'' did so. During the Summer of 2006, the network began a special seven-week run of ''The 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time''.\n\nIn November 2006, GSN started a series of eight documentaries hosted by [[Chuck Woolery]], each about game shows, beginning with a program on ''Match Game'' titled ''Behind The Blank''. Other subjects included game show producer [[Chuck Barris]], ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?'', a \"Top Ten\" countdown of game show hosts, memorable game show moments, women who have featured prominently on game shows, celebrities and how they impacted game shows, and an insider's guide to winning on a game show.\n\nOne particularly interesting subject was the installments of ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' in which [[Michael Larson]] won more than $100,000 in cash and prizes by memorizing the sequences of the board then used, which was the subject of ''Big Bucks: The \"Press Your Luck\" Scandal''. Peter Tomarken, who had hosted ''Press Your Luck'', hosted and narrated this documentary in 2003. The documentary became Game Show Network's most watched show ever at the time scoring a 1.7 at one point during the show. Originally, CBS, the original broadcaster of ''Press Your Luck'', did not want GSN to air the Larson episodes. However, this angered many fans, causing CBS to allow Game Show Network to air the episodes as part of the documentary as well as standalone episodes.\n\nIn 2007, the network debuted two new specials: the ''[[National Vocabulary Championship]]'', with a show airing on April 15, 2007 showcasing the first year of the event, and a broadcast of the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] International Cat Show, ''Catminster''. In November 2008, GSN and [[Meow Mix]] presented a special entitled ''[[Think Like a Cat]]'', hosted by Chuck Woolery, with a top prize of $1 million, one of the few times a game show on cable television has had that amount as a grand prize. On December 16, 2014, GSN aired a special called ''Game Show Flashback'', hosted by Ben Gleib, which featured some of the best moments in game show history. GSN aired a 2-hour special called ''[[The Line (game show)|The Line]]'' on December 23, 2014, which was hosted by Jeff Davis and Candace Bailey. On January 1, 2015, in preparation for the revival of ''[[Baggage (American game show)|Baggage]]'' entitled ''[[Baggage on the Road]]'', GSN aired a special called ''Baggage: Most Outrageous Moments'' hosted by Jerry Springer.\n\n===Acquired programming===\nGSN's acquired programming comes primarily from [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]], with acquired programming also coming from [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]], and [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]]. During the time that Liberty Media and successors DirecTV and AT&T had a stake in the channel from 2001 to 2019, GSN had had to pay a licensing fee to air game shows owned by founding parent company [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] subsidiary [[Columbia TriStar Television]].  Before that time period and again since Sony regained 100% ownership in November 2019, GSN has unlimited free access to the game shows owned by what is now Sony Pictures Television.\n\nFrom Fremantle, the network licenses ''[[Match Game]]'' (Rayburn), and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (Harvey). GSN had licensed the entire [[Mark Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman]] library from its inception until March 2009 and has in the past also licensed ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', and ''[[Sale of the Century (American game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (other Fremantle properties) for air on the network. Older versions of these shows are now aired on rival channel [[Buzzr]], a digital subchannel network over which Fremantle has sole programming control.\n\nIn the network's infancy, GSN regularly showcased vintage Goodson-Todman game and panel shows from the 1950s and 1960s, many of which were either originally broadcast or only preserved in [[black-and-white]] \u2013 such as ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', and ''[[Beat the Clock]]''. These classic shows made up much of the channel's lineup at the outset, but have been gradually cut back in prominence since the late 1990s. On October 1, 2006, only ''What's My Line?'' had a regular spot on the schedule, late Sunday/early Monday at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, it was followed by a selection from various 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Goodson-Todman shows, usually another panel game. On December 19, 2006, GSN reinstated the ''Black and White Overnight'' to seven days a week from 3:00&nbsp;a.m. to 4:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, showcasing ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' in the block, other shows, including ''[[Choose Up Sides]]'', ''[[The Name's the Same]]'', and the Bud Collyer-hosted primetime version of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' have been featured, this run ended March 31, 2009. ''Black and White Overnight'' has returned for two weeks in December since 2009, featuring ''What's My Line?'' and ''I've Got a Secret''.\n\nOver the years, GSN, in addition to its Goodson-Todman library, featured game shows from other studios:\n* [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]]: ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' (2000), ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', ''[[Dog Eat Dog (American game show)|Dog Eat Dog]]'', ''[[Deal or No Deal (American game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[1 vs. 100 (American game show)|1 vs. 100]]'', and ''[[Minute to Win It]]''\n* [[CBS Television Distribution]]: ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1998 version only)\n* [[MGM Television|MGM Domestic Television Distribution]]: ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1966 version only), ''[[Cash Cab (American game show)|Cash Cab]]''\n* [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]]: ''[[Love Connection]]'', ''[[Street Smarts]]'', and ''[[Let's Ask America]]''\n* [[20th Television]]/[[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]]: ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? (American game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' (Fox), ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'', and ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]''\n\nGSN also airs, or has aired, the [[Sony Pictures Television]] library programming from the following companies:\n* The Guber-Peters Entertainment Company (formerly [[Barris Industries]]): ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[The Gong Show]]'', ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|3's a Crowd]]'', ''[[Treasure Hunt (American game show)|Treasure Hunt]]'', and ''[[Quiz Kids Challenge]]''.\n* [[Barry & Enright Productions]]: ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]]'', ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', ''[[Break the Bank (1976 game show)|Break the Bank]]'', ''[[Bullseye (1980 U.S. game show)|Bullseye]]'', ''[[Play the Percentages]]'', and ''[[Bumper Stumpers]]''.\n* [[Merv Griffin Enterprises]]: ''[[Headline Chasers]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (excepting the Bob Goen era)\n* [[Stewart Television]]: ''[[Jackpot (game show)|Jackpot!]]'', ''[[Pass the Buck (American game show)|Pass the Buck]]'', ''[[Go (game show)|Go]]'', ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]]'', and the surviving ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' incarnations.\n* 2waytraffic: ''[[That's the Question (American game show)|That's the Question]]''\n* Sony Pictures Television (including its predecessors from [[Screen Gems]] to Columbia TriStar Television): ''Pyramid'', ''[[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]]'', ''[[Dealer's Choice (game show)|Dealer's Choice]]'', ''[[The Diamond Head Game]]'', ''The Fun Factory'', and ''[[Celebrity Charades]]''\n\nIn October 2003, GSN acquired the rerun rights to ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'' (from [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]], both the network and syndicated versions) and have added more episodes since, including the ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off from 2004; the show was off the schedule from November 2012 to December 2017, when repeats of the Chris Harrison episodes were added to the schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/GSN-Adds-WHO-WANTS-TO-BE-A-MILLIONAIRE-to-Daytime-Schedule-1218-20171204|title=GSN Adds WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE to Daytime Schedule, 12/18|author=TV News Desk|website=Broadway World}}</ref> Among the most well-known classic game shows previously aired regularly on the network include ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[Love Connection]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]''.\n\n===High-definition feed===\nGame Show Network HD is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] [[simulcast]] feed of the channel that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format; it was launched on September 15, 2010 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-s-new-hd-service-launches-time-warner-cable-new-york-city-bright-house-networks-a|title=Game Show Network Press Release|access-date=2011-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727111325/http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-s-new-hd-service-launches-time-warner-cable-new-york-city-bright-house-networks-a|archive-date=2011-07-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The HD feed is currently carried on most providers nationwide and in Canada.\n\n===GSN On Demand===\nGSN partnered with Vubiquity to launch GSN On Demand on August 15, 2013.

The first episode that aired on GSN was a representative episode of the oldest series in their archives, a What's My Line? episode from March 8, 1953 featuring Jackie Gleason. ''Match Game'' took the regular 7 PM time slot the next day.}} From 1994 until about 1997, the network aired classic pre-1972 game shows as well as game shows made after 1972, most of which came from the [[Mark Goodson]]\u2013[[Bill Todman]] library. The network also used to air live interstitials as wraparound programming. In its first few months, GSN's commercials consisted of [[public service announcement]]s (PSAs), promotions for its programming and commercials related to network parent company [[Sony]]. By 1995, when the network began to expand, the network began accepting conventional advertising as it gained new sponsorships. On March 17, 1997, the Game Show Network rebranded with a new presentation package, a new logo (which had the network's name in boxes and a colorful swirling ball), and a new slogan: \"All Play, All Day\". The network's new promos and new idents were designed by graphics agency Lee Hunt Associates.\n\nOn October 11, 1997, the network's rights to the Goodson-Todman library expired, with the exceptions of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and the 1994\u201395 season of ''[[Family Feud]]'' (the only season in the second [[Richard Dawson]] era), which were both allowed to continue airing on the channel on a separate contract. This period lasted until April 18, 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/GSN|publisher=[[TV Tropes]]|title=Awesome/GSN |accessdate=2020-03-07}}</ref> With the other Goodson-Todman shows gone, lesser-known Sony properties such as ''[[Juvenile Jury]]'', ''[[The Diamond Head Game]]'', the 1976\u201377 version of ''[[Break the Bank (1976 game show)|Break the Bank]]'', and the [[Bill Cullen]]-hosted games ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]]'' and ''[[Pass the Buck (American game show)|Pass the Buck]]'' all found their way onto the schedule. Shows from [[Chuck Barris]] also aired during this time, including ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[The Gong Show]]'', ''[[Treasure Hunt (American game show)|Treasure Hunt]]'', and ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|3's a Crowd]]''.\n\nGame Show Network aired a children's game show block at this time, featuring ''Joker! Joker! Joker!'', ''[[Jep!]]'', and ''[[Wheel 2000]]'' \u2013 the respective adaptations of ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.\n\n===1998\u20132004===\nOn April 18, 1998, Game Show Network bought back the rights to the Goodson-Todman library. In late 1998, GSN eliminated all of its live programming, replacing them with in-show advertisements like ''Win TV''. In 1999, the network began a slate of original programming, including ''[[Inquizition]]'', ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|All New 3's a Crowd]]'', and ''[[Hollywood Showdown]]''. The channel also launched original shows such as ''Extreme Gong'' (a remake of the classic ''[[The Gong Show]]''). In 2000, the network lost the rights to ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', with the last episode airing on April 3 of that year.\n\nIn 2001, a massive change in both leadership and programming at the network took place when [[Liberty Media]] acquired a 50% stake. Both president Michael Fleming and vice president Jake Tauber departed and former [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]] president Rich Cronin was hired to head the network.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Umstead|first1=R.

The All-New Press Your Luck]]'', ''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'', ''[[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]]'', ''[[Lingo (American game show)|Lingo]]'', ''[[WinTuition]]'', and ''[[Cram (game show)|Cram]]''. In the Fall of 2001, the network acquired the rights to air the classic ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' but, due to pressure from CBS, the [[Michael Larson]] episodes were initially excluded. CBS eventually gave Game Show Network the rights to the Larson episodes, airing them in a separate package, as well as in conjunction with an original documentary called ''Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal''.\n\nIn the Fall of 2003, Game Show Network picked up the rights to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' with [[Regis Philbin]]. In December of that year, the network began airing ''[[GSN Video Games]]''; the first program to air on the network that was unrelated to traditional game show formats.\n\n===2004\u20132018: GSN===\nOn March 15, 2004, Game Show Network began using the abbreviation \"GSN\" and introduced the tagline \"The Network for Games\", a move in line with the network expanding its programming to include the genre of [[reality television]] and various other competitions. GSN also introduced the original series at 10:00 p.m. weekdays, ''[[World Series of Blackjack]]'', ''National Lampoon's Greek Games'', ''[[Kenny vs. Spenny]]'' (a Canadian import), and the short-lived ''Fake-a-Date'', a find-a-mate program with host Evan Marriott, the original Joe Millionaire.

In 2006, GSN introduced ''[[High Stakes Poker]]'', a poker show with a private game format among professional players, and also aired additional series ''[[World Series of Blackjack]]'' and a spinoff, ''[[Celebrity Blackjack]]''. One of the most popular shows from the initial TV [[poker boom]], the ''[[World Poker Tour]]'', was slated to move from the [[Travel Channel]] to GSN on March 24, 2008. \n\n[[David Goldhill]] succeeded Rich Cronin as GSN president on August 1, 2007 and began making a series of programming changes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moss|first1=Linda|title=Goldhill Succeeds Cronin Atop GSN|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/goldhill-succeeds-cronin-atop-gsn-369714|accessdate=March 6, 2020|work=[[Multichannel News]]|date=July 25, 2007}}</ref> In March 2011, [[DirecTV]] (which by this point had taken over Liberty Media's stake in the network, which had increased to 65%) sold a 5% stake in the network back to [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]].

In the channel's early days, GSN aired a three-hour block called ''Club A.M.'', consisting of five classic game shows, surrounded by thirty minutes' worth of interstitial trivia, interviews with game show producers, personalities, contestants and fans, and interactive call-in games, all hosted by Laura Chambers and Steve Day (which was also rerun in late night, with some new segments, under the title ''Late Night Games''). ''[[Prime Games]]'' was a similarly formatted show aired weeknights and hosted by [[Peter Tomarken]]. ''Wide World of Games'' was a Saturday night block of four shows built around a common theme.\n\nAfter a few years, these shows were replaced by ''Game TV'' (a half-hour interview show hosted by Nancy Sullivan and Dave Nemeth), ''Game World'' (which showed highlights of current game shows from around the world), and standalone 30-minute call-in games like ''Super Decades'' and ''Trivia Track''. Later, the channel attempted a ''Gong Show'' remake called ''Extreme Gong'' (hosted by [[George Gray (television personality)|George Gray]], in which the viewers could phone in their votes as to whether to \"gong\" acts off the air) and ''Throut And Neck'' (hosted by [[Rebecca Grant (American actress)|Rebecca Grant]])<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEkZvm8vZ1Y|title=Throut & Neck - Canadia Episode - Part 1|date=10 June 2009|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297650/|title=Throut and Neck (TV Series 1999\u2013 )|author=thewatcheruatu|date=25 May 2004|work=IMDb}}</ref> (where viewers controlled video game characters with their phones). All these efforts were eventually canceled and removed from the network's schedule.\n\nTraditional game shows offered in this time included ''[[Hollywood Showdown]]'', ''[[Inquizition]]'', ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|All New 3's a Crowd]]'', ''[[Mall Masters]]'', ''[[Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck]]'', ''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'' (a game based on the [[Prisoner's dilemma#Friend or Foe?|Prisoner's Dilemma]]), ''[[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]]'', ''[[WinTuition]]'', ''[[Cram (game show)|Cram]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Funny Money]]'', and ''[[Lingo (American game show)|Lingo]]'' (a [[Chuck Woolery]]-hosted revival of the 1987\u201388 Canadian format in which teams guess five-letter words in a combination of [[Jotto]]/[[Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]] and [[Bingo (US)|bingo]]). The network produced six seasons of the show from 2002 to 2007.\n\nOriginals debuting in 2006 included ''[[PlayMania]]'', a late night call-in game that expanded from two to (at one point) six nights a week continuing until October 31, 2007, and a revival of ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]]'', which ended its run on June 9, 2007. ''[[That's the Question (American game show)|That's the Question]]'', ''[[Starface]]'', and a revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' also debuted in 2006. Debuting in July 2007 were ''[[Camouflage (2007 game show)|Camouflage]]'', remade as a word game, and ''[[Without Prejudice?]]'', a remake of a British show where five people decide which contestant would win $25,000 based in part on their responses to questioning. Debuting on August 4, 2007 was ''[[Grand Slam (American game show)|Grand Slam]]'', a game show involving big winners from other shows, including [[Ken Jennings]], [[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]], and [[Brad Rutter]].\n\nFor 2008, a U.S. version of a [[BBC]] game show called ''[[How Much Is Enough?]]'' debuted on January 8, 2008, hosted by [[Corbin Bernsen]], and then on March 31, 2008, ''[[Bingo America]]'' made its debut with [[Patrick Duffy]] as host. On July 21, 2008, as something of a tie-in with the movie ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'', Merrill Heatter returned to game-show producing with ''[[Catch 21]]'' (a revival of the 1970s game ''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]'') hosted by [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] with [[Mikki Padilla]] as the dealer. GSN also relaunched a live interactive call-in interstitial series, this time known as ''[[GSN Live]]'', which aired during commercial breaks between Noon and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Monday through Friday. Originally the series took place over a three-hour span, with [[Fred Roggin]] and [[Heidi Bohay]] hosting the interstitial segments. Later in the year GSN expanded the series to six hours, with Roggin moving to the 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. block with [[Kelly Packard]] while Alfonso Ribeiro replaced him earlier in the day. Packard was forced to leave her position shortly after taking it, and Roggin hosted with a guest host until May 15, 2009 when [[Debra Wilson|Debra Skelton]] was chosen to be a permanent co-host as of May 26, 2009. Roggin left GSN Live on July 2, 2009 in order to concentrate on his new game show ''[[The Money List]]''. Alfonso left GSN Live on August 11, 2009 in order to concentrate on hosting ''[[Catch 21]]''. ''GSN Live'' itself ended on July 29, 2011.\n\nAlso in 2009, ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' returned to the air on GSN, this time with [[Carnie Wilson]] as host. On June 13, 2009, GSN premiered its ''Big Saturday Night'' live interactive show block, hosted by [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Ross Matthews]] and [[Charissa Thompson]]. The three-hour block features a variety of games, such as identifying pictures. Included in the block are ''[[20Q (game show)|20Q]]'', hosted by [[Cat Deeley]] and featuring the voice of [[Hal Sparks]] as \"Mr. Q\", and ''[[The Money List]]'', hosted by [[Fred Roggin]].

The shows were filmed at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas in January and February 2011. The show lasted forty episodes before being canceled due to low ratings.\n\nIn August 23, 2012, ''[[The American Bible Challenge]]'' with [[Jeff Foxworthy]] became the channel's most popular program of all time, with the series premiere being watched by two million viewers. In the fall of 2012, GSN premiered a new revival titled ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The Pyramid]]'', with [[Mike Richards (producer)|Mike Richards]] hosting. GSN debuted an [[The Chase (American game show)|American version]] of the UK game show ''[[The Chase (UK game show)|The Chase]]'' on August 6, 2013, hosted by [[Brooke Burns]] and featuring [[Mark Labbett]], one of the \"Chasers\" on the UK version, as the sole \"Chaser\", known as \"the Beast\". The show received a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show|Outstanding Game Show]] in 2014, and Burns received a nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] two years later. In the summer of 2014, GSN debuted new series such as ''[[It Takes a Church]]'', ''[[Skin Wars]]'', and ''[[Idiotest]]''.\n\nGSN premiered the original series ''[[America Says]]'', hosted by [[John Michael Higgins]] on June 18, 2018, and the video clip game show ''[[Caroline & Friends]]'', hosted by actress [[Caroline Rhea]] on July 16, 2018. On March 21, 2019, GSN announced it would revive ''[[Catch 21]]'', featuring a different format with Ribeiro returning as host. The network also announced a new show, ''[[Best Ever Trivia Show]]'' with [[Sherri Shepherd]] as the host. The show debuted on June 10, 2019. GSN continued to introduce new originals, with ''[[Common Knowledge (game show)|Common Knowledge]]'' hosted by [[Joey Fatone]] debuting on January 14, 2019, the reboot of ''[[Catch 21]]'' with new dealer [[Witney Carson]] debuting on October 14, 2019, and ''[[Get a Clue (game show)|Get a Clue]]'' hosted by [[Robert Belushi]] premiering on January 6, 2020.\n\n====Specials====\nThe network has run blocks of classic game shows on Saturday nights, and for the first few months of 2006 programmed back-to-back episodes of ''[[Match Game]]'' in a block billed as ''That '70s Hour'' (a pun on ''[[That '70s Show]]''), which showed the original [[clapperboard|production slate]] before each episode as well as ''Match Game'' trivia and brief clips of an interview with host [[Gene Rayburn]] produced shortly before his death. Although production slates had been aired by the network prior to this, \"That '70s Hour\" was the first time the network ''intentionally'' did so. During the Summer of 2006, the network began a special seven-week run of ''The 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time''.\n\nIn November 2006, GSN started a series of eight documentaries hosted by [[Chuck Woolery]], each about game shows, beginning with a program on ''Match Game'' titled ''Behind The Blank''. Other subjects included game show producer [[Chuck Barris]], ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?'', a \"Top Ten\" countdown of game show hosts, memorable game show moments, women who have featured prominently on game shows, celebrities and how they impacted game shows, and an insider's guide to winning on a game show.\n\nOne particularly interesting subject was the installments of ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' in which [[Michael Larson]] won more than $100,000 in cash and prizes by memorizing the sequences of the board then used, which was the subject of ''Big Bucks: The \"Press Your Luck\" Scandal''. Peter Tomarken, who had hosted ''Press Your Luck'', hosted and narrated this documentary in 2003. The documentary became Game Show Network's most watched show ever at the time scoring a 1.7 at one point during the show. Originally, CBS, the original broadcaster of ''Press Your Luck'', did not want GSN to air the Larson episodes. However, this angered many fans, causing CBS to allow Game Show Network to air the episodes as part of the documentary as well as standalone episodes.\n\nIn 2007, the network debuted two new specials: the ''[[National Vocabulary Championship]]'', with a show airing on April 15, 2007 showcasing the first year of the event, and a broadcast of the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] International Cat Show, ''Catminster''. In November 2008, GSN and [[Meow Mix]] presented a special entitled ''[[Think Like a Cat]]'', hosted by Chuck Woolery, with a top prize of $1 million, one of the few times a game show on cable television has had that amount as a grand prize. On December 16, 2014, GSN aired a special called ''Game Show Flashback'', hosted by Ben Gleib, which featured some of the best moments in game show history. GSN aired a 2-hour special called ''[[The Line (game show)|The Line]]'' on December 23, 2014, which was hosted by Jeff Davis and Candace Bailey. On January 1, 2015, in preparation for the revival of ''[[Baggage (American game show)|Baggage]]'' entitled ''[[Baggage on the Road]]'', GSN aired a special called ''Baggage: Most Outrageous Moments'' hosted by Jerry Springer.\n\n===Acquired programming===\nGSN's acquired programming comes primarily from [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]], with acquired programming also coming from [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]], and [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]]. During the time that Liberty Media and successors DirecTV and AT&T had a stake in the channel from 2001 to 2019, GSN had had to pay a licensing fee to air game shows owned by founding parent company [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] subsidiary [[Columbia TriStar Television]].  Before that time period and again since Sony regained 100% ownership in November 2019, GSN has unlimited free access to the game shows owned by what is now Sony Pictures Television.\n\nFrom Fremantle, the network licenses ''[[Match Game]]'' (Rayburn), and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (Harvey). GSN had licensed the entire [[Mark Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman]] library from its inception until March 2009 and has in the past also licensed ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', and ''[[Sale of the Century (American game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (other Fremantle properties) for air on the network. Older versions of these shows are now aired on rival channel [[Buzzr]], a digital subchannel network over which Fremantle has sole programming control.\n\nIn the network's infancy, GSN regularly showcased vintage Goodson-Todman game and panel shows from the 1950s and 1960s, many of which were either originally broadcast or only preserved in [[black-and-white]] \u2013 such as ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', and ''[[Beat the Clock]]''. These classic shows made up much of the channel's lineup at the outset, but have been gradually cut back in prominence since the late 1990s. On October 1, 2006, only ''What's My Line?'' had a regular spot on the schedule, late Sunday/early Monday at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, it was followed by a selection from various 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Goodson-Todman shows, usually another panel game. On December 19, 2006, GSN reinstated the ''Black and White Overnight'' to seven days a week from 3:00&nbsp;a.m. to 4:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, showcasing ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' in the block, other shows, including ''[[Choose Up Sides]]'', ''[[The Name's the Same]]'', and the Bud Collyer-hosted primetime version of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' have been featured, this run ended March 31, 2009. ''Black and White Overnight'' has returned for two weeks in December since 2009, featuring ''What's My Line?'' and ''I've Got a Secret''.\n\nOver the years, GSN, in addition to its Goodson-Todman library, featured game shows from other studios:\n* [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]]: ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' (2000), ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', ''[[Dog Eat Dog (American game show)|Dog Eat Dog]]'', ''[[Deal or No Deal (American game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[1 vs. 100 (American game show)|1 vs. 100]]'', and ''[[Minute to Win It]]''\n* [[CBS Television Distribution]]: ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1998 version only)\n* [[MGM Television|MGM Domestic Television Distribution]]: ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1966 version only), ''[[Cash Cab (American game show)|Cash Cab]]''\n* [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]]: ''[[Love Connection]]'', ''[[Street Smarts]]'', and ''[[Let's Ask America]]''\n* [[20th Television]]/[[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]]: ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? (American game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' (Fox), ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'', and ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]''\n\nGSN also airs, or has aired, the [[Sony Pictures Television]] library programming from the following companies:\n* The Guber-Peters Entertainment Company (formerly [[Barris Industries]]): ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[The Gong Show]]'', ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|3's a Crowd]]'', ''[[Treasure Hunt (American game show)|Treasure Hunt]]'', and ''[[Quiz Kids Challenge]]''.\n* [[Barry & Enright Productions]]: ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]]'', ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', ''[[Break the Bank (1976 game show)|Break the Bank]]'', ''[[Bullseye (1980 U.S. game show)|Bullseye]]'', ''[[Play the Percentages]]'', and ''[[Bumper Stumpers]]''.\n* [[Merv Griffin Enterprises]]: ''[[Headline Chasers]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (excepting the Bob Goen era)\n* [[Stewart Television]]: ''[[Jackpot (game show)|Jackpot!]]'', ''[[Pass the Buck (American game show)|Pass the Buck]]'', ''[[Go (game show)|Go]]'', ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]]'', and the surviving ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' incarnations.\n* 2waytraffic: ''[[That's the Question (American game show)|That's the Question]]''\n* Sony Pictures Television (including its predecessors from [[Screen Gems]] to Columbia TriStar Television): ''Pyramid'', ''[[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]]'', ''[[Dealer's Choice (game show)|Dealer's Choice]]'', ''[[The Diamond Head Game]]'', ''The Fun Factory'', and ''[[Celebrity Charades]]''\n\nIn October 2003, GSN acquired the rerun rights to ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'' (from [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]], both the network and syndicated versions) and have added more episodes since, including the ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off from 2004; the show was off the schedule from November 2012 to December 2017, when repeats of the Chris Harrison episodes were added to the schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/GSN-Adds-WHO-WANTS-TO-BE-A-MILLIONAIRE-to-Daytime-Schedule-1218-20171204|title=GSN Adds WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE to Daytime Schedule, 12/18|author=TV News Desk|website=Broadway World}}</ref> Among the most well-known classic game shows previously aired regularly on the network include ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[Love Connection]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]''.\n\n===High-definition feed===\nGame Show Network HD is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] [[simulcast]] feed of the channel that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format; it was launched on September 15, 2010 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-s-new-hd-service-launches-time-warner-cable-new-york-city-bright-house-networks-a|title=Game Show Network Press Release|access-date=2011-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727111325/http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-s-new-hd-service-launches-time-warner-cable-new-york-city-bright-house-networks-a|archive-date=2011-07-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The HD feed is currently carried on most providers nationwide and in Canada.\n\n===GSN On Demand===\nGSN partnered with Vubiquity to launch GSN On Demand on August 15, 2013.
