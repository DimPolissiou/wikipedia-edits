{"title_page": "Ethiopian movement", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=September 2016}}\nThe '''Ethiopian movement''' is a religious movement that began in [[southern Africa]] towards the end of the 19th century, when two groups broke away from the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] and [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa|Methodist]] churches. One of the main reasons for breaking away was that the parent denominations were perceived to be too much under white control, with not enough scope being given to African leadership.\n\nThe Ethiopian movement was based on their interpretation of a [[Biblical]] passage (Psalm 68:31): \"Ethiopia shall soon stretch forth its hands unto God\" (in the original Hebrew, actually \u05db\u05d5\u05e9 [[Kingdom of Kush|Cush]]).\n\nThe term was later given a much wider interpretation by [[Bengt Sundkler]], whose book ''Bantu Prophets in South Africa'' was the first comprehensive study of [[African Initiated Church|African Independent Churches]] (AICs).\n\n== History ==\nIn about 1888, an evangelist, Joseph Mathunye Kanyane Napo, seceded from the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican Church]] to form the Africa Church or African Church, which was composed mostly of black Anglicans who were dissatisfied with white control of the Anglican Church. Kanyane Napo's Church was established in Marabastad, Pretoria and was the first intertribal church formed and led by Africans in South Africa. Napo was dissatisfied with racism inside the Anglican Church in Pretoria which was at that time led Bishop Bousefield (the first Anglican Bishop of Pretoria).\n\nIn 1892, a minister of the [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa|Wesleyan Methodist Church]], Mangena Maake Mokone, broke away from that denomination and formed the '''Ethiopian Church''', mainly because of dissatisfaction with segregation in the church and the lack of fellowship between black and white ministers. His [[preaching]]s included the theme of \"Africa for the Africans\", which was later a pillar of the [[UNIA-ACL]].\n\nA group of black former Anglican and Methodist leaders gathered around Mokone, including Kanyane Napo, Samuel James Brander, [[James Mata Dwane]] and several others. Two relatives of Mokone, Kate and Charlotte \nManeye were studying at [[Wilberforce University]] in America, and Kate wrote to Mokone to tell him about the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], which her sister Charlotte had joined. This led the Ethiopian Church to decide to join the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church) in 1896, and James Mata Dwane was sent to the USA to negotiate the union.\n\nThere were conflicting views of Dwane's mandate, however, and Dwane (who had originally been a Methodist), through conversations with Anglicans, came to believe that the AME Church did not have [[bishop]]s in the [[apostolic succession]], whereas the Anglicans did. Dwane and his followers thereupon left the AME Church and formed the [[Order of Ethiopia]], in association with the Church of the Province of Southern Africa (now [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]]). Most of them were in the [[Eastern Cape]].\n\nCharlotte Maneye married the Revd Marshall Maxeke, and they did missionary work for the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|AME Church]] in South Africa, and in 1908 they founded the Wilberforce Institute in the Transvaal, modelled on her American alma mater.\n\nMany of the original Ethiopianist leaders, however, became dissatisfied with the AME Church, and found black American domination of the church leadership as irksome as white British domination.<sup>[[#Note|1]]</sup> In 1904 Samuel James Brander formed the Ethiopian Catholic Church in Zion, which combined the Anglican and Methodist strands of the Ethiopian tradition. It initially included Kanyane Napo and Daniel William Alexander among its leaders, but both of them appear to have later broken away to revive Napo's African Church.

The immediate upper [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the Singapore River is known as the '''Singapore River Planning Area''', although the western part of the watershed is classified under [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]] planning area.\n\nSingapore River planning area sits within the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]] of the [[Central Region, Singapore|Central Region]] of [[Singapore]], as defined by the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]. The planning area shares boundaries with the following - [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]] and [[Museum Planning Area|Museum]] to the south, [[Tanglin]] and [[Bukit Merah]] to the west, [[Outram, Singapore|Outram]] to the south and the [[Downtown Core]] to the east.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lit-up CBD from Raffles City - RGW.jpg|thumb|right|Singapore River at night, as seen from [[Raffles City Singapore|Raffles City]]]] The Singapore River is approximately 3.2 kilometers long<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PULfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA132|title=The Routledge Companion to Urban Regeneration|last=Leary|first=Michael E.|last2=McCarthy|first2=John|date=2013-10-30|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136266546|location=|pages=132|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> from its [[source (river or stream)|source]] at Kim Seng Bridge to where it empties into [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]]; the [[river]] extends more than two kilometers beyond its original source at Kim Seng Bridge as [[Alexandra Canal, Singapore|Alexandra Canal]], as far as the junction of Commonwealth Avenue.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aerial Panorama of Merlion Park and its surrounds.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial Panorama of Merlion Park. The Singapore River ends its journey here.]]\n[[File:Photographic Views of Singapore Plate 04 Collyer Quay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Collyer Quay]] as viewed from what is now [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]], circa 1900s]]The mouth of the Singapore River was the old [[Port of Singapore]], being naturally sheltered by the southern islands. Historically, the city of Singapore initially grew around the port so the river mouth became the centre of [[trade]], [[commerce]] and [[finance]].\n\nAt one time, Singapore River was the very lifeblood of the [[colony]], the [[trade]] artery, the center of [[commerce|commercial]] activity, the heart of [[entrepot]] trade, the [[marine vessel|vessel]] of importance, the [[capillaries]] of life and the place which was frequented by the [[secret societies]], the ''swaylos'' ([[Cantonese]] for [[coolie]]s who worked on a boat) and the ''coolies'' who worked for the [[philanthropist]] [[Tan Tock Seng]] at [[Ellenborough Market]] and the ''towkay'' ([[Hokkien]] for business owner) [[Tan Kim Seng]] who was busy filling his [[warehouse|godown]] with the riches of the East.\n\nSingapore River is where the colourful and surprising history of the river and the [[mythology|myth]]s and [[legend]]s can still conjure up memories of the [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]], bumboats, ''tongkangs'' with their painted eyes to see the danger ahead and [[sampan]]s of yesteryear. This is where the [[Malay Peninsula|Malayan]] [[prince]]s once sailed and this is where the [[Cattle|bullock]] [[cart]]s plodded their way up and down each bank as the river found its way to the former [[rock (geology)|rocky]] river mouth. This is also where an early [[civilisation]] was conquered by the [[Java]]nese [[Majapahit Empire]], in the year 1376.\n\n[[File:Aerial panorama of Singapore's Downtown Core.jpg|thumb|Aerial panorama of Singapore's Downtown Core. The Singapore River sits at the bottom left of the image.]]\n[[File:Photographic Views of Singapore Plate 09 Boat Quay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boat Quay]] along the banks of the Singapore River, circa 1900s]]Some of the [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s and other [[places of worship]] still stand in the vicinity of the river. [[Bridge]]s such as [[Anderson Bridge]], [[Elgin Bridge (Singapore)|Elgin Bridge]] and [[Cavenagh Bridge]] still remain, the [[Merlion]], the [[shophouse]]s, and the large trees such as [[Banyan]] and [[Madras Thorn]]. Some parts of this area include [[quay]]s such as [[Clarke Quay]], [[Boat Quay]] and [[Robertson Quay]], which generated trade and extensive [[demand]] for services with the boats that landed at the quays. Boat Quay itself was handling three quarters of the [[shipping]] service in the 1860s. [[Shophouse]]s and [[warehouse]]s flourished around the quays due to their proximity to trade during the colonial era, but presently house various [[bar (establishment)|bars]], [[public house|pubs]] and restaurants, as well as old shops.\n\nThe river still borders places where seamen and others, for example, near [[Raffles Landing Place]], made offerings and burned their [[joss stick]]s. Poles with streamers flying were once used to tie up the [[barge]]s as the water lapped against the old [[rock (geology)|stone]] [[Stairway|step]]s and [[wall]]s.\n\n[[Sir Stamford Raffles]] lost no time after January 1819, when he landed on Singapore River among the ''[[orang laut]]'', in bargaining with [[Temenggong Abdul Rahman]], the [[Temenggong of Johor]] who then governed the place, having settled in 1811. At the very moment of landing, Raffles must have realised the importance of the river for, in the same year of 1819, the north bank was drained for government buildings,  in 1820, the Master Attendant was appointed with an office building to control shipping, and in 1822, the south bank was [[Land reclamation|reclaimed]] and a [[retaining wall]] and steps were built.\n\n[[File:Robertson Quay, Nov 05.JPG|thumb|right|[[Robertson Quay]] along the banks of the Singapore River]] \nThrough lack of knowledge or foresight, the bridges were constructed too low and the river was too shallow for the demands that were to be made on its use. This historic river, which Raffles had fashioned from salt [[marsh]]es, [[sand bar]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s, has witnessed the British rule and the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], and has supported years of economic activity by the Chinese, Malays, Indians and others. However, with the expansion of trade came congestion and [[pollution]].\n\nOld maps of the river state that it actually originates from Bukit Larangan (currently [[Fort Canning Hill]]).\n\n===Pollution and clean-up===\n[[File:Clarke Quay 5, Feb 06.JPG|thumb|right|[[Clarke Quay]] along the banks of the Singapore River]]Starting in 1819, there was heavy traffic on the Singapore River due to rapid [[urbanization]] and expanding [[trade]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Singapore River|work= Heritage Trails|url= http://heritagetrails.sg/content/521/Boat_Quay.html|accessdate= 2010-04-01|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090822164944/http://heritagetrails.sg/content/521/Boat_Quay.html|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}</ref> At the same time, it brought in [[water pollution]] caused by the disposal of garbage, [[sewage]] and other by-products of industries located along the river's [[river bank|banks]]. The sources of water pollution into the Singapore River and [[Kallang Basin]] included waste from [[pig]] and [[duck]] farms, unsewered premises, street hawkers and [[vegetable]] whole sellers. [[Riverine]] activities such as transport, [[boat building]] and repairs were also found along the Singapore River. This was a very beneficial action.\n\nSome 750 [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]] [[Wiktionary:Ply|plied]] along the Singapore River and Kallang Basin in 1977. Waste, [[oil spill]]s and [[wastewater]] from these boats and lighters added to the pollution of the rivers. In 1977, Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] called for a clean up of Singapore's rivers, which included the Singapore River and the [[Kallang River]]. The clean up cost the government $300 million and involved a relocation of about 4,000 squatters, along with hawkers and vegetable sellers, whose daily waste flowed into the river. Public housing was found for the squatters, while street hawkers were persuaded to move to hawker centres. The government then dredged foul-smelling mud from the banks and the bottom of the river, clearing the debris and other rubbish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/5-interesting-facts-about-the-singapore-river-clean-up|title=5 interesting facts about the Singapore River clean-up|last=migration|date=2014-07-04|access-date=2016-07-09}}</ref>\n\nDespite decades of effort, river cleanup remains a work-in-progress. On 26 November 2017, during a speech at the 60th anniversary of [[Berita Harian (Singapore)|Berita Harian]], Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] urged Singaporeans not to pollute the river with litter and trash. <ref>http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/river-cleanup-is-never-done-singaporeans-must-still-learn-not-to-litter-pm-lee-hsien-loong</ref>\n\n===Singapore River today===\nThe river is now part of the [[Marina Reservoir]] after damming the Singapore River at its outlet to the sea to create a new [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] of [[freshwater]].

The Port of Singapore is now located to the west of the island, using most of the south-west coast, and passenger ships to Singapore now typically berth at the [[Singapore Cruise Centre]] at [[HarbourFront (Singapore)|Harbourfront]]. Thus the Singapore River's economic role has shifted away from one that of trade, towards more a role accommodated for [[tourism in Singapore|tourism]] and aesthetics for the commercial zone which encloses it.\n\n==Sculptures==\n[[File:The River Merchants (2003) by Aw Tee Hong, Cavenagh Bridge, Singapore - 20060530.jpg|thumb|\nSculpture along the Singapore River - The River Merchants by Aw Tee Hong\n]]\nThere are a number of sculptures along the Singapore River.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sir Stamford Raffles statue and other sculptures along Singapore River to be cleaned next week|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sir-stamford-raffles-statue-and-other-sculptures-along-singapore-river-to-be-cleaned-next|website = The Straits Times|accessdate = 2015-11-23|date = |publication-place = Singapore|publication-date = 3 February 2015}}</ref> Many of these depict the life of people living and working along the river during the early days of Singapore.\n\nNotable sculptures include:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/sculptures-get-a-spruce-up|title=Sculptures by the Singapore River get a spruce up|last=Ang|first=Benson|date=18 September 2016|website=The Straits Times|publisher=|access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref>\n*First Generation, made by [[Chong Fah Cheong]]\n*Fishing at Singapore River, made by [[Chern Lian Shan]]\n*The River Merchants, made by [[Aw Tee Hong]]\n*A Great Emporium, made by [[Malcolm Koh]]\n*From Chettiars to Financiers, made by Chern Lian Shan\n*[[Singapura cat|Singapura Cats]], made by various artists\n\n==Bridges and tunnels==\nBetween 1819, when the first wooden jetty and the first bridge were built over the Singapore River in Singapore, and in 2015, 14 bridges were built across the river (or 17, although Marina Reservoir, where the estuary is now located, is considered a Singapore River). Until 1819, the river could only be crossed by boats and ferries. Some of the bridges were demolished and rebuilt or their purpose was changed (traffic bridge in pedestrian bridge and the like).\n\nFormer records from Singapore show a simple wooden bridge over the river from 1819, which had no name, and is considered the first bridge in the city.

The immediate upper [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the Singapore River is known as the '''Singapore River Planning Area''', although the western part of the watershed is classified under [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]] planning area.\n\nSingapore River planning area sits within the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]] of the [[Central Region, Singapore|Central Region]] of [[Singapore]], as defined by the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]. The planning area shares boundaries with the following - [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]] and [[Museum Planning Area|Museum]] to the south, [[Tanglin]] and [[Bukit Merah]] to the west, [[Outram, Singapore|Outram]] to the south and the [[Downtown Core]] to the east.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lit-up CBD from Raffles City - RGW.jpg|thumb|right|Singapore River at night, as seen from [[Raffles City Singapore|Raffles City]]]] The Singapore River is approximately 3.2 kilometers long<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PULfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA132|title=The Routledge Companion to Urban Regeneration|last=Leary|first=Michael E.|last2=McCarthy|first2=John|date=2013-10-30|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136266546|location=|pages=132|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> from its [[source (river or stream)|source]] at Kim Seng Bridge to where it empties into [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]]; the [[river]] extends more than two kilometers beyond its original source at Kim Seng Bridge as [[Alexandra Canal, Singapore|Alexandra Canal]], as far as the junction of Commonwealth Avenue.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aerial Panorama of Merlion Park and its surrounds.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial Panorama of Merlion Park. The Singapore River ends its journey here.]]\n[[File:Photographic Views of Singapore Plate 04 Collyer Quay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Collyer Quay]] as viewed from what is now [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]], circa 1900s]]The mouth of the Singapore River was the old [[Port of Singapore]], being naturally sheltered by the southern islands. Historically, the city of Singapore initially grew around the port so the river mouth became the centre of [[trade]], [[commerce]] and [[finance]].\n\nAt one time, Singapore River was the very lifeblood of the [[colony]], the [[trade]] artery, the center of [[commerce|commercial]] activity, the heart of [[entrepot]] trade, the [[marine vessel|vessel]] of importance, the [[capillaries]] of life and the place which was frequented by the [[secret societies]], the ''swaylos'' ([[Cantonese]] for [[coolie]]s who worked on a boat) and the ''coolies'' who worked for the [[philanthropist]] [[Tan Tock Seng]] at [[Ellenborough Market]] and the ''towkay'' ([[Hokkien]] for business owner) [[Tan Kim Seng]] who was busy filling his [[warehouse|godown]] with the riches of the East.\n\nSingapore River is where the colourful and surprising history of the river and the [[mythology|myth]]s and [[legend]]s can still conjure up memories of the [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]], bumboats, ''tongkangs'' with their painted eyes to see the danger ahead and [[sampan]]s of yesteryear. This is where the [[Malay Peninsula|Malayan]] [[prince]]s once sailed and this is where the [[Cattle|bullock]] [[cart]]s plodded their way up and down each bank as the river found its way to the former [[rock (geology)|rocky]] river mouth. This is also where an early [[civilisation]] was conquered by the [[Java]]nese [[Majapahit Empire]], in the year 1376.\n\n[[File:Aerial panorama of Singapore's Downtown Core.jpg|thumb|Aerial panorama of Singapore's Downtown Core. The Singapore River sits at the bottom left of the image.]]\n[[File:Photographic Views of Singapore Plate 09 Boat Quay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boat Quay]] along the banks of the Singapore River, circa 1900s]]Some of the [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s and other [[places of worship]] still stand in the vicinity of the river. [[Bridge]]s such as [[Anderson Bridge]], [[Elgin Bridge (Singapore)|Elgin Bridge]] and [[Cavenagh Bridge]] still remain, the [[Merlion]], the [[shophouse]]s, and the large trees such as [[Banyan]] and [[Madras Thorn]]. Some parts of this area include [[quay]]s such as [[Clarke Quay]], [[Boat Quay]] and [[Robertson Quay]], which generated trade and extensive [[demand]] for services with the boats that landed at the quays. Boat Quay itself was handling three quarters of the [[shipping]] service in the 1860s. [[Shophouse]]s and [[warehouse]]s flourished around the quays due to their proximity to trade during the colonial era, but presently house various [[bar (establishment)|bars]], [[public house|pubs]] and restaurants, as well as old shops.\n\nThe river still borders places where seamen and others, for example, near [[Raffles Landing Place]], made offerings and burned their [[joss stick]]s. Poles with streamers flying were once used to tie up the [[barge]]s as the water lapped against the old [[rock (geology)|stone]] [[Stairway|step]]s and [[wall]]s.\n\n[[Sir Stamford Raffles]] lost no time after January 1819, when he landed on Singapore River among the ''[[orang laut]]'', in bargaining with [[Temenggong Abdul Rahman]], the [[Temenggong of Johor]] who then governed the place, having settled in 1811. At the very moment of landing, Raffles must have realised the importance of the river for, in the same year of 1819, the north bank was drained for government buildings,  in 1820, the Master Attendant was appointed with an office building to control shipping, and in 1822, the south bank was [[Land reclamation|reclaimed]] and a [[retaining wall]] and steps were built.\n\n[[File:Robertson Quay, Nov 05.JPG|thumb|right|[[Robertson Quay]] along the banks of the Singapore River]] \nThrough lack of knowledge or foresight, the bridges were constructed too low and the river was too shallow for the demands that were to be made on its use. This historic river, which Raffles had fashioned from salt [[marsh]]es, [[sand bar]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s, has witnessed the British rule and the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], and has supported years of economic activity by the Chinese, Malays, Indians and others. However, with the expansion of trade came congestion and [[pollution]].\n\nOld maps of the river state that it actually originates from Bukit Larangan (currently [[Fort Canning Hill]]).\n\n===Pollution and clean-up===\n[[File:Clarke Quay 5, Feb 06.JPG|thumb|right|[[Clarke Quay]] along the banks of the Singapore River]]Starting in 1819, there was heavy traffic on the Singapore River due to rapid [[urbanization]] and expanding [[trade]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Singapore River|work= Heritage Trails|url= http://heritagetrails.sg/content/521/Boat_Quay.html|accessdate= 2010-04-01|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090822164944/http://heritagetrails.sg/content/521/Boat_Quay.html|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}</ref> At the same time, it brought in [[water pollution]] caused by the disposal of garbage, [[sewage]] and other by-products of industries located along the river's [[river bank|banks]]. The sources of water pollution into the Singapore River and [[Kallang Basin]] included waste from [[pig]] and [[duck]] farms, unsewered premises, street hawkers and [[vegetable]] whole sellers. [[Riverine]] activities such as transport, [[boat building]] and repairs were also found along the Singapore River. \n\nSome 750 [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]] [[Wiktionary:Ply|plied]] along the Singapore River and Kallang Basin in 1977. Waste, [[oil spill]]s and [[wastewater]] from these boats and lighters added to the pollution of the rivers. In 1977, Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] called for a clean up of Singapore's rivers, which included the Singapore River and the [[Kallang River]]. The clean up cost the government $300 million and involved a relocation of about 4,000 squatters, along with hawkers and vegetable sellers, whose daily waste flowed into the river. Public housing was found for the squatters, while street hawkers were persuaded to move to hawker centres. The government then dredged foul-smelling mud from the banks and the bottom of the river, clearing the debris and other rubbish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/5-interesting-facts-about-the-singapore-river-clean-up|title=5 interesting facts about the Singapore River clean-up|last=migration|date=2014-07-04|access-date=2016-07-09}}</ref>\n\nDespite decades of effort, river cleanup remains a work-in-progress. On 26 November 2017, during a speech at the 60th anniversary of [[Berita Harian (Singapore)|Berita Harian]], Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] urged Singaporeans not to pollute the river with litter and trash. <ref>http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/river-cleanup-is-never-done-singaporeans-must-still-learn-not-to-litter-pm-lee-hsien-loong</ref>\n\n===Singapore River today===\nThe river is now part of the [[Marina Reservoir]] after damming the Singapore River at its outlet to the sea to create a new [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] of [[freshwater]].

The Port of Singapore is now located to the west of the island, using most of the south-west coast, and passenger ships to Singapore now typically berth at the [[Singapore Cruise Centre]] at [[HarbourFront (Singapore)|Harbourfront]]. Thus the Singapore River's economic role has shifted away from one that of trade, towards more a role accommodated for [[tourism in Singapore|tourism]] and aesthetics for the commercial zone which encloses it.\n\n==Sculptures==\n[[File:The River Merchants (2003) by Aw Tee Hong, Cavenagh Bridge, Singapore - 20060530.jpg|thumb|\nSculpture along the Singapore River - The River Merchants by Aw Tee Hong\n]]\nThere are a number of sculptures along the Singapore River.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sir Stamford Raffles statue and other sculptures along Singapore River to be cleaned next week|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sir-stamford-raffles-statue-and-other-sculptures-along-singapore-river-to-be-cleaned-next|website = The Straits Times|accessdate = 2015-11-23|date = |publication-place = Singapore|publication-date = 3 February 2015}}</ref> Many of these depict the life of people living and working along the river during the early days of Singapore.\n\nNotable sculptures include:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/sculptures-get-a-spruce-up|title=Sculptures by the Singapore River get a spruce up|last=Ang|first=Benson|date=18 September 2016|website=The Straits Times|publisher=|access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref>\n*First Generation, made by [[Chong Fah Cheong]]\n*Fishing at Singapore River, made by [[Chern Lian Shan]]\n*The River Merchants, made by [[Aw Tee Hong]]\n*A Great Emporium, made by [[Malcolm Koh]]\n*From Chettiars to Financiers, made by Chern Lian Shan\n*[[Singapura cat|Singapura Cats]], made by various artists\n\n==Bridges and tunnels==\nBetween 1819, when the first wooden jetty and the first bridge were built over the Singapore River in Singapore, and in 2015, 14 bridges were built across the river (or 17, although Marina Reservoir, where the estuary is now located, is considered a Singapore River). Until 1819, the river could only be crossed by boats and ferries. Some of the bridges were demolished and rebuilt or their purpose was changed (traffic bridge in pedestrian bridge and the like).\n\nFormer records from Singapore show a simple wooden bridge over the river from 1819, which had no name, and is considered the first bridge in the city. In 1822, the bridge was replaced by a wooden bridge, the Presentment Bridge, from which later (1862 and 1927) today's Elgin Bridge emerged. In the years that followed, other bridges such as Coleman Bridge (1840), Kim Seng Bridge (1862), Cavenagh Bridge (1869) or Read Bridge (1889) were added.
