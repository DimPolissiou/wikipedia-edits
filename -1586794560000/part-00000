Written during the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131651), ''Leviathan'' argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]. Hobbes wrote that civil war and the brute situation of a [[state of nature]] (\"[[bellum omnium contra omnes|the war of all against all]]\") could only be avoided by strong, undivided government.\n\n==Content==\n\n===Title===\nThe title of Hobbes's treatise alludes to the [[Leviathan]] mentioned in the [[Book of Job]]. Unlike the more informative titles usually given to works of [[early modern]] [[political philosophy]], such as [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' or Hobbes's own earlier work ''[[The Elements of Law]]'', Hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise. [[lexicography|Lexicographers]] in the early modern period believed that the term \"[[leviathan]]\" was associated with the [[Hebrew]] words ''lavah'', meaning \"to couple, connect, or join\", and ''thannin'', meaning \"a serpent or dragon\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mintz|first=Samuel|date=1989|title=Leviathan as Metaphor|journal=Hobbes Studies|volume=2|issue=1 |pages=3\u20139|doi=10.1163/187502589X00023}}</ref> In the [[Westminster Assembly]]'s annotations on the Bible, the interpreters believed that the creature was named using these root words \u201cbecause by his bignesse he seemes not one single creature, but a coupling of divers together; or because his scales are closed, or straitly compacted together.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Downame |first=John |date=1645 |title=Annotations upon all the books of the Old and New Testament wherein the text is explained, doubts resolved, Scriptures parallelled and various readings observed |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A36467.0001.001 |location=London |publisher=John Legatt and John Raworth |page=sig. a3r |author-link=John Downame}}</ref> Samuel Mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to Hobbes's understanding of political force since both \"Leviathan and Hobbes's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals; they are omnipotent; they cannot be destroyed or divided; they inspire fear in men; they do not make pacts with men; theirs is the dominion of power.\"<ref>Mintz, p. 5</ref>\n\n===Frontispiece===\nAfter lengthy discussion with Thomas Hobbes, the Parisian [[Abraham Bosse]] created the [[etching]] for the book's famous [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] in the ''g\u00e9ometrique'' style which Bosse himself had refined. It is similar in organisation to the frontispiece of Hobbes' ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642), created by Jean Matheus. The frontispiece has two main elements, of which the upper part is by far the more striking.\n\nIn it, a giant crowned figure is seen emerging from the landscape, clutching a sword and a [[crosier]], beneath a quote from the [[Book of Job]]\u2014\"''Non est potestas Super Terram quae Comparetur ei. Iob. 41 . 24''\" (\"There is no power on earth to be compared to him. Job 41 . 24\")\u2014further linking the figure to the monster of that book. (Due to disagreements over the precise location of the [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|chapters and verses]] when they were divided in the [[Late Middle Ages]], the verse Hobbes quotes is usually given as Job 41:33 in modern Christian translations into English, Job 41:25 in the [[Masoretic text]], [[Septuagint]], and the [[Luther Bible]]; it is Iob 41:24 in the [[Vulgate]].) The torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons, in the style of [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]]; all are facing inwards with just the giant's head having visible features. (A manuscript of ''Leviathan'' created for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1651 has notable differences \u2013 a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces, all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions.)\n\nThe lower portion is a [[triptych]], framed in a wooden border. The centre form contains the title on an ornate curtain. The two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure \u2013 earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right. Each side element reflects the equivalent power \u2013 [[castle]] to church, [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] to [[mitre]], [[cannon]] to [[excommunication]], [[weapon]]s to [[logic]], and the [[battle]]field to the [[ecclesiastical court|religious court]]s. The giant holds the symbols of both sides, reflecting the union of secular, and spiritual in the sovereign, but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state.\n\n===Part I: Of Man===\nHobbes begins his treatise on politics with an account of human nature. He presents an image of man as matter in motion, attempting to show through example how everything about humanity can be explained materialistically, that is, without recourse to an incorporeal, immaterial soul or a faculty for understanding ideas that are external to the [[human mind]].\nHobbes proceeds by defining terms clearly and unsentimentally. Good and evil are nothing more than terms used to denote an individual's appetites and desires, while these appetites and desires are nothing more than the tendency to move toward or away from an object. Hope is nothing more than an appetite for a thing combined with an opinion that it can be had. He suggests that the dominant [[political theology]] of the time, [[Scholasticism]], thrives on confused definitions of everyday words, such as ''incorporeal substance'', which for Hobbes is a contradiction in terms.\n\nHobbes describes human psychology without any reference to the ''[[summum bonum]]'', or greatest good, as previous thought had done. Not only is the concept of a ''summum bonum'' superfluous, but given the variability of human desires, there could be no such thing. Consequently, any political community that sought to provide the greatest good to its members would find itself driven by competing conceptions of that good with no way to decide among them. The result would be [[civil war]].\n\nHowever, Hobbes states that there is a ''summum malum'', or greatest evil. This is the fear of violent death. A political community can be oriented around this fear.\n\nSince there is no ''summum bonum'', the natural state of man is not to be found in a political community that pursues the greatest good. But to be outside of a political community is to be in an anarchic condition. Given human nature, the variability of human desires, and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires, the [[state of nature]], as Hobbes calls this anarchic condition, must be a [[bellum omnium contra omnes|war of all against all]]. Even when two men are not fighting, there is no guarantee that the other will not try to kill him for his property or just out of an aggrieved sense of honour, and so they must constantly be on guard against one another. It is even reasonable to preemptively attack one's neighbour.\n\n{{quote|In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently no culture of the earth, no navigation nor the use of <!--\"nor use of the\"? - thus in Penguin edn-->commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.<ref>Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', XIII.9.</ref>}}\n\nThe desire to avoid the state of nature, as the place where the ''summum malum'' of violent death is most likely to occur, forms the polestar of political reasoning. It suggests a number of [[natural law|laws of nature]], although Hobbes is quick to point out that they cannot properly speaking be called \"laws,\" since there is no one to enforce them. The first thing that reason suggests is to seek peace, but that where peace cannot be had, to use all of the advantages of war.<ref>Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', XIV.4.</ref> Hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust, and every man must be considered to have a right to all things.<ref>Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', XIII.13.</ref> The second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one's right to all things where others are willing to do the same, to quit the state of nature, and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things. Hobbes concludes Part One by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign.\n\n===Part II: Of Common-wealth===\nThe purpose of a [[commonwealth]] is given at the start of Part II: {{quote|THE final cause, end, or design of men (who naturally love liberty, and dominion over others) in the introduction of that restraint upon themselves, in which we see them live in Commonwealths, is the foresight of their own preservation, and of a more contented life thereby; that is to say, of getting themselves out from that miserable condition of war which is necessarily consequent, as hath been shown, to the natural passions of men when there is no visible power to keep them in awe, and tie them by fear of punishment to the performance of their covenants...}}\n\nThe commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner: ''I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.''\n\nThe sovereign has twelve principal rights:<ref>Hobbes, Leviathan, XVIII.</ref>\n\n# Because a successive covenant cannot override a prior one, the subjects cannot (lawfully) [[Right of revolution|change the form of government]].\n# Because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from [[Social contract|subjects giving to the sovereign the right to act for them]], the sovereign cannot possibly breach the covenant; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign.\n# The sovereign exists because the majority has consented to his rule; the minority have agreed to abide by this arrangement and must then assent to the sovereign's actions.\n# Every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign: hence the sovereign cannot injure any of his [[British subject|subjects]] and cannot be accused of [[injustice]].\n# Following this, the sovereign cannot justly be [[Regicide|put to death]] by the subjects.\n# Because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace, and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord. Therefore, the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse, who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes, and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published.\n# To prescribe the rules of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[property]].\n# To be judge in all cases.\n# To make [[war powers|war and peace]] as he sees fit and to command the army.\n# To choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.\n# To reward with riches and [[honour]] or to punish with corporal or pecuniary punishment or [[wikt:ignominy|ignominy]].\n# To establish laws about honour and a scale of worth.\n\nHobbes explicitly rejects the idea of ''[[Separation of Powers]]''. In item 6 Hobbes is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of [[free speech]] should they be considered desirable by the sovereign to promote order.\n\n====Types of commonwealth====\nThere are three ([[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[democracy]]):\n\n{{quote|The difference of Commonwealths consisted in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude. And because the sovereignty is either in one man, or in an assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth. For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part. When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy.}}\n\nAnd only three; since unlike [[Politics (Aristotle)#Classification of constitutions|Aristotle]] he does not sub-divide them into \"good\" and \"deviant\":\n\n{{quote|Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire. There be other names of government in the histories and books of policy; as [[tyrant|tyranny]] and [[oligarchy]]; but they are not the names of other forms of government, but of the same forms misliked. For they that are discontented under monarchy call it tyranny; and they that are displeased with aristocracy call it oligarchy: so also, they which find themselves grieved under a democracy call it anarchy, which signifies want of government; and yet I think no man believes that want of government is any new kind of government: nor by the same reason ought they to believe that the government is of one kind when they like it, and another when they mislike it or are oppressed by the governors.}}\n\nAnd monarchy is the best, on practical grounds:\n\n{{quote|The difference between these three kinds of Commonwealth consisteth not in the difference of power, but in the difference of convenience or aptitude to produce the peace and security of the people; for which end they were instituted. And to compare monarchy with the other two, we may observe: first, that whosoever beareth the person of the people, or is one of that assembly that bears it, beareth also his own natural person. And though he be careful in his politic person to procure the common interest, yet he is more, or no less, careful to procure the private good of himself, his family, kindred and friends; and for the most part, if the public interest chance to cross the private, he prefers the private: for the passions of men are commonly more potent than their reason. From whence it follows that where the public and private interest are most closely united, there is the public most advanced. Now in monarchy the private interest is the same with the public. The riches, power, and honour of a monarch arise only from the riches, strength, and reputation of his subjects. For no king can be rich, nor glorious, nor secure, whose subjects are either poor, or contemptible, or too weak through want, or dissension, to maintain a war against their enemies; whereas in a democracy, or aristocracy, the public prosperity confers not so much to the private fortune of one that is corrupt, or ambitious, as doth many times a perfidious advice, a treacherous action, or a civil war.}}\n\n====Succession====\nThe right of succession always lies with the sovereign. Democracies and aristocracies have easy succession; monarchy is harder:\n\n{{quote|The greatest difficulty about the right of succession is in monarchy: and the difficulty ariseth from this, that at first sight, it is not manifest who is to appoint the successor; nor many times who it is whom he hath appointed. For in both these cases, there is required a more exact ratiocination than every man is accustomed to use.}}\n\nBecause in general people haven't thought carefully. However, the succession is definitely in the gift of the monarch:\n\n{{quote|As to the question who shall appoint the successor of a monarch that hath the sovereign authority... we are to consider that either he that is in possession has right to dispose of the succession, or else that right is again in the dissolved multitude. ... Therefore it is manifest that by the institution of monarchy, the disposing of the successor is always left to the judgement and will of the present possessor.}}\n\nBut, it is not always obvious who the monarch has appointed:\n\n{{quote|And for the question which may arise sometimes, who it is that the monarch in possession hath designed to the succession and inheritance of his power}}\n\nHowever, the answer is:\n\n{{quote|it is determined by his express words and testament; or by other tacit signs sufficient.}}\n\nAnd this means:\n\n{{quote|By express words, or testament, when it is declared by him in his lifetime, viva voce, or by writing; as the first emperors of Rome declared who should be their heirs.}}\n\nNote that (perhaps rather radically) this does '''not''' have to be any blood relative:\n\n{{quote|For the word heir does not of itself imply the children or nearest kindred of a man; but whomsoever a man shall any way declare he would have to succeed him in his estate. If therefore a monarch declare expressly that such a man shall be his heir, either by word or writing, then is that man immediately after the decease of his predecessor invested in the right of being monarch.}}\n\nHowever, practically this means:\n\n{{quote|But where testament and express words are wanting, other natural signs of the will are to be followed: whereof the one is custom. And therefore where the custom is that the next of kindred absolutely succeedeth, there also the next of kindred hath right to the succession; for that, if the will of him that was in possession had been otherwise, he might easily have declared the same in his lifetime...}}\n\n====Religion====\nIn ''Leviathan'', Hobbes explicitly states that the sovereign has authority to assert power over matters of faith and doctrine and that if he does not do so, he invites discord. Hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign (when that was re-established: again, ''Leviathan'' was written during the Civil War) as to whether his theory was acceptable. Hobbes materialistic presuppositions also led him to hold a view which was considered highly controversial at the time. Hobbes rejected the idea of incorporeal substances and subsequently argued that even God himself was a corporeal substance. Although Hobbes never explicitly stated he was an atheist, many allude to the possibility that he is.\nCool\n\n====Taxation====\nHobbes also touched upon the sovereign's ability to tax in ''Leviathan'', although he is not as widely cited for his economic theories as he is for his political theories.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Aaron Levy |date=October 1954 |title=Economic Views of Thomas Hobbes |journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=589\u2013595 |doi=10.2307/2707677 |jstor=2707677 |bibcode = 1961JHI....22..215C}}</ref> Hobbes believed that equal justice includes the equal imposition of taxes. The equality of taxes doesn't depend on equality of wealth, but on the equality of the debt that every man owes to the commonwealth for his defence and the maintenance of the [[rule of law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/hobbes2.pdf |title=Leviathan: Part II. Commonwealth; Chapters 17\u201331 |publisher=Early Modern Texts}}</ref> Hobbes also championed public support for those unable to maintain themselves by labour, which would presumably be funded by taxation. He advocated public encouragement of works of Navigation etc. to usefully employ the poor who could work.\n\n===Part III: Of a Christian Common-wealth===\nIn Part III Hobbes seeks to investigate the nature of a ''Christian'' commonwealth. This immediately raises the question of which [[scripture]]s we should trust, and why. If any person may claim [[supernatural]] [[revelation]] superior to the civil law, then there would be chaos, and Hobbes' fervent desire is to avoid this. Hobbes thus begins by establishing that we cannot infallibly know another's personal word to be [[divinity|divine]] revelation:\n\n{{quote|When God speaketh to man, it must be either immediately or by mediation of another man, to whom He had formerly spoken by Himself immediately. How God speaketh to a man immediately may be understood by those well enough to whom He hath so spoken; but how the same should be understood by another is hard, if not impossible, to know. For if a man pretend to me that God hath spoken to him supernaturally, and immediately, and I make doubt of it, I cannot easily perceive what argument he can produce to oblige me to believe it.}}\n\nThis is good, but if applied too fervently would lead to all the Bible being rejected. So, Hobbes says, we need a test: and the true test is established by examining the books of scripture, and is:\n\n{{quote|So that it is manifest that the teaching of the religion which God hath established, and the showing of a present miracle, joined together, were the only marks whereby the Scripture would have a true prophet, that is to say, immediate revelation, to be acknowledged; of them being singly sufficient to oblige any other man to regard what he saith.}}\n\n{{quote|Seeing therefore miracles now cease, we have no sign left whereby to acknowledge the pretended revelations or inspirations of any private man; nor obligation to give ear to any doctrine, farther than it is conformable to the Holy Scriptures, which since the time of our Saviour supply the place and sufficiently recompense the want of all other prophecy}}\n\n\"Seeing therefore miracles now cease\" means that only the books of the Bible can be trusted. Hobbes then discusses the various books which are accepted by various [[sect]]s, and the \"question much disputed between the diverse sects of Christian religion, from whence the Scriptures derive their authority\". To Hobbes, \"it is manifest that none can know they are God's word (though all true Christians believe it) but those to whom God Himself hath revealed it supernaturally\". And therefore \"The question truly stated is: by what authority they are made law?\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Hobbes concludes that ultimately there is no way to determine this other than the civil power:\n\n{{quote|He therefore to whom God hath not supernaturally revealed that they are His, nor that those that published them were sent by Him, is not obliged to obey them by any authority but his whose commands have already the force of laws; that is to say, by any other authority than that of the Commonwealth, residing in the sovereign, who only has the legislative power.}}\n\nHe discusses the [[Ten Commandments]], and asks \"who it was that gave to these written tables the obligatory force of laws. There is no doubt but they were made laws by God Himself: but because a law obliges not, nor is law to any but to them that acknowledge it to be the act of the sovereign, how could the people of [[Israel]], that were forbidden to approach the mountain to hear what God said to [[Moses]], be obliged to obedience to all those laws which Moses propounded to them?\" and concludes, as before, that \"making of the Scripture law, belonged to the civil sovereign.\"\n\nFinally: \"We are to consider now what office in the Church those persons have who, being civil sovereigns, have embraced also the Christian faith?\" to which the answer is: \"Christian kings are still the supreme pastors of their people, and have power to ordain what pastors they please, to teach the Church, that is, to teach the people committed to their charge.\"\n\nThere is an enormous amount of biblical scholarship in this third part. However, once Hobbes' initial argument is accepted (that no-one can know for sure anyone else's divine revelation) his conclusion (the religious power is subordinate to the civil) follows from his logic. The very extensive discussions of the chapter were probably necessary for its time. The need (as Hobbes saw it) for the civil sovereign to be supreme arose partly from the many sects that arose around the civil war, and to quash the ''Pope of Rome's challenge'', to which Hobbes devotes an extensive section.\n\n===Part IV: Of the Kingdom of Darkness===\nHobbes named Part IV of his book Kingdom of Darkness. By this, Hobbes does not mean [[Hell]] (he did not believe in Hell or [[Purgatory]])<ref>Chapter XLVI: ''Lastly, for the errors brought in from false or uncertain history, what is all the legend of fictitious miracles in the lives of the saints; and all the histories of apparitions and ghosts alleged by the doctors of the Roman Church, to make good their doctrines of hell and purgatory, the power of [[exorcism]], and other doctrines which have no warrant, neither in reason nor Scripture; as also all those traditions which they call the unwritten word of God; but old wives' fables?'',</ref> but the darkness of [[ignorance]] as opposed to the light of true knowledge. Hobbes' interpretation is largely unorthodox and so sees much darkness in what he sees as the misinterpretation of [[Scripture]].\n\n: This considered, the kingdom of darkness... is nothing else but a confederacy of deceivers that, to obtain dominion over men in this present world, endeavour, by dark and erroneous [[doctrine]]s, to extinguish in them the light...<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-j.html |title=Chapter XLIV |access-date=27 September 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803200902/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-j.html#CHAPTERXLIV |archive-date=3 August 2004 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHobbes enumerates four causes of this darkness.\n\nThe first is by extinguishing the light of scripture through misinterpretation. Hobbes sees the main abuse as teaching that the [[kingdom of God]] can be found in the church, thus undermining the authority of the civil sovereign. Another general abuse of scripture, in his view, is the turning of [[consecration]] into [[conjuration]], or silly [[ritual]].\n\nThe second cause is the [[demonology]] of the heathen poets: in Hobbes's opinion, [[demon]]s are nothing more than constructs of the brain. Hobbes then goes on to criticize what he sees as many of the practices of Catholicism: \"Now for the worship of [[saint]]s, and [[icon|image]]s, and [[relic]]s, and other things at this day practiced in the Church of Rome, I say they are not allowed by the word of God\".\n\nThe third is by mixing with the Scripture diverse relics of the religion, and much of the vain and erroneous [[Greek philosophy|philosophy of the Greeks]], especially of [[Aristotle]]. Hobbes has little time for the various disputing sects of philosophers and objects to what people have taken \"From Aristotle's civil philosophy, they have learned to call all manner of Commonwealths but the popular (such as was at that time the state of Athens), [[tyranny]]\". At the end of this comes an interesting section (darkness is suppressing true knowledge as well as introducing falsehoods), which would appear to bear on the discoveries of [[Galileo Galilei]]. \"Our own navigations make manifest, and all men learned in human sciences now acknowledge, there are [[antipodes]]\" (i.e., the Earth is round) \"...Nevertheless, men... have been punished for it by authority ecclesiastical. But what reason is there for it? Is it because such opinions are contrary to true religion? That cannot be, if they be true.\" However, Hobbes is quite happy for the truth to be suppressed if necessary: if \"they tend to disorder in government, as countenancing rebellion or sedition? Then let them be silenced, and the teachers punished\" \u2013 but only by the civil authority.\n\nThe fourth is by mingling with both these, false or uncertain traditions, and feigned or uncertain history.\n\nHobbes finishes by inquiring who benefits from the errors he diagnoses:\n\n: [[Cicero]] maketh honourable mention of one of the Cassii, a severe judge amongst the Romans, for a custom he had in criminal causes, when the testimony of the witnesses was not sufficient, to ask the accusers, ''cui bono;'' that is to say, what profit, honour, or other contentment the accused obtained or expected by the fact. For amongst presumptions, there is none that so evidently declareth the author as doth the benefit of the action.\n\nHobbes concludes that the beneficiaries are the churches and churchmen.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'' by Thomas Hobbes\n*[[Classical republicanism]]\n*[[John Locke]]\n*''[[Scientia potentia est]]''\n*[[Hobbes's moral and political philosophy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n[[File:Hobbes - Leviathan, 1904 - 2631590 F.jpg|thumb|upright|1904 edition edited by [[Alfred Rayney Waller]]]]\n\n===Editions of ''Leviathan''===\n* ''Leviathan.

Written during the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131651), ''Leviathan'' argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]. Hobbes wrote that civil war and the brute situation of a [[state of nature]] (\"[[bellum omnium contra omnes|the war of all against all]]\") could only be avoided by strong, undivided government.\n\n==Content==\n\n===Title===\nThe title of Hobbes's treatise alludes to the [[Leviathan]] mentioned in the [[Book of Job]]. Unlike the more informative titles usually given to works of [[early modern]] [[political philosophy]], such as [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' or Hobbes's own earlier work ''[[The Elements of Law]]'', Hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise. [[lexicography|Lexicographers]] in the early modern period believed that the term \"[[leviathan]]\" was associated with the [[Hebrew]] words ''lavah'', meaning \"to couple, connect, or join\", and ''thannin'', meaning \"a serpent or dragon\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mintz|first=Samuel|date=1989|title=Leviathan as Metaphor|journal=Hobbes Studies|volume=2|issue=1 |pages=3\u20139|doi=10.1163/187502589X00023}}</ref> In the [[Westminster Assembly]]'s annotations on the Bible, the interpreters believed that the creature was named using these root words \u201cbecause by his bignesse he seemes not one single creature, but a coupling of divers together; or because his scales are closed, or straitly compacted together.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Downame |first=John |date=1645 |title=Annotations upon all the books of the Old and New Testament wherein the text is explained, doubts resolved, Scriptures parallelled and various readings observed |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A36467.0001.001 |location=London |publisher=John Legatt and John Raworth |page=sig. a3r |author-link=John Downame}}</ref> Samuel Mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to Hobbes's understanding of political force since both \"Leviathan and Hobbes's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals; they are omnipotent; they cannot be destroyed or divided; they inspire fear in men; they do not make pacts with men; theirs is the dominion of power.\"<ref>Mintz, p. 5</ref>\n\n===Frontispiece===\nAfter lengthy discussion with Thomas Hobbes, the Parisian [[Abraham Bosse]] created the [[etching]] for the book's famous [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] in the ''g\u00e9ometrique'' style which Bosse himself had refined. It is similar in organisation to the frontispiece of Hobbes' ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642), created by Jean Matheus. The frontispiece has two main elements, of which the upper part is by far the more striking.\n\nIn it, a giant crowned figure is seen emerging from the landscape, clutching a sword and a [[crosier]], beneath a quote from the [[Book of Job]]\u2014\"''Non est potestas Super Terram quae Comparetur ei. Iob. 41 . 24''\" (\"There is no power on earth to be compared to him. Job 41 . 24\")\u2014further linking the figure to the monster of that book. (Due to disagreements over the precise location of the [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|chapters and verses]] when they were divided in the [[Late Middle Ages]], the verse Hobbes quotes is usually given as Job 41:33 in modern Christian translations into English, Job 41:25 in the [[Masoretic text]], [[Septuagint]], and the [[Luther Bible]]; it is Iob 41:24 in the [[Vulgate]].) The torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons, in the style of [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]]; all are facing inwards with just the giant's head having visible features. (A manuscript of ''Leviathan'' created for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1651 has notable differences \u2013 a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces, all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions.)\n\nThe lower portion is a [[triptych]], framed in a wooden border. The centre form contains the title on an ornate curtain. The two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure \u2013 earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right. Each side element reflects the equivalent power \u2013 [[castle]] to church, [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] to [[mitre]], [[cannon]] to [[excommunication]], [[weapon]]s to [[logic]], and the [[battle]]field to the [[ecclesiastical court|religious court]]s. The giant holds the symbols of both sides, reflecting the union of secular, and spiritual in the sovereign, but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state.\n\n===Part I: Of Man===\nHobbes begins his treatise on politics with an account of human nature. He presents an image of man as matter in motion, attempting to show through example how everything about humanity can be explained materialistically, that is, without recourse to an incorporeal, immaterial soul or a faculty for understanding ideas that are external to the [[human mind]].\nHobbes proceeds by defining terms clearly and unsentimentally. Good and evil are nothing more than terms used to denote an individual's appetites and desires, while these appetites and desires are nothing more than the tendency to move toward or away from an object. Hope is nothing more than an appetite for a thing combined with an opinion that it can be had. He suggests that the dominant [[political theology]] of the time, [[Scholasticism]], thrives on confused definitions of everyday words, such as ''incorporeal substance'', which for Hobbes is a contradiction in terms.\n\nHobbes describes human psychology without any reference to the ''[[summum bonum]]'', or greatest good, as previous thought had done. Not only is the concept of a ''summum bonum'' superfluous, but given the variability of human desires, there could be no such thing. Consequently, any political community that sought to provide the greatest good to its members would find itself driven by competing conceptions of that good with no way to decide among them. The result would be [[civil war]].\n\nHowever, Hobbes states that there is a ''summum malum'', or greatest evil. This is the fear of violent death. A political community can be oriented around this fear.\n\nSince there is no ''summum bonum'', the natural state of man is not to be found in a political community that pursues the greatest good. But to be outside of a political community is to be in an anarchic condition. Given human nature, the variability of human desires, and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires, the [[state of nature]], as Hobbes calls this anarchic condition, must be a [[bellum omnium contra omnes|war of all against all]]. Even when two men are not fighting, there is no guarantee that the other will not try to kill him for his property or just out of an aggrieved sense of honour, and so they must constantly be on guard against one another. It is even reasonable to preemptively attack one's neighbour.\n\n{{quote|In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently no culture of the earth, no navigation nor the use of <!--\"nor use of the\"? - thus in Penguin edn-->commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.<ref>Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', XIII.9.</ref>}}\n\nThe desire to avoid the state of nature, as the place where the ''summum malum'' of violent death is most likely to occur, forms the polestar of political reasoning. It suggests a number of [[natural law|laws of nature]], although Hobbes is quick to point out that they cannot properly speaking be called \"laws,\" since there is no one to enforce them. The first thing that reason suggests is to seek peace, but that where peace cannot be had, to use all of the advantages of war.<ref>Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', XIV.4.</ref> Hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust, and every man must be considered to have a right to all things.<ref>Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', XIII.13.</ref> The second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one's right to all things where others are willing to do the same, to quit the state of nature, and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things. Hobbes concludes Part One by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign.\n\n===Part II: Of Common-wealth===\nThe purpose of a [[commonwealth]] is given at the start of Part II: {{quote|THE final cause, end, or design of men (who naturally love liberty, and dominion over others) in the introduction of that restraint upon themselves, in which we see them live in Commonwealths, is the foresight of their own preservation, and of a more contented life thereby; that is to say, of getting themselves out from that miserable condition of war which is necessarily consequent, as hath been shown, to the natural passions of men when there is no visible power to keep them in awe, and tie them by fear of punishment to the performance of their covenants...}}\n\nThe commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner: ''I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.''\n\nThe sovereign has twelve principal rights:<ref>Hobbes, Leviathan, XVIII.</ref>\n\n# Because a successive covenant cannot override a prior one, the subjects cannot (lawfully) [[Right of revolution|change the form of government]].\n# Because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from [[Social contract|subjects giving to the sovereign the right to act for them]], the sovereign cannot possibly breach the covenant; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign.\n# The sovereign exists because the majority has consented to his rule; the minority have agreed to abide by this arrangement and must then assent to the sovereign's actions.\n# Every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign: hence the sovereign cannot injure any of his [[British subject|subjects]] and cannot be accused of [[injustice]].\n# Following this, the sovereign cannot justly be [[Regicide|put to death]] by the subjects.\n# Because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace, and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord. Therefore, the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse, who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes, and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published.\n# To prescribe the rules of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[property]].\n# To be judge in all cases.\n# To make [[war powers|war and peace]] as he sees fit and to command the army.\n# To choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.\n# To reward with riches and [[honour]] or to punish with corporal or pecuniary punishment or [[wikt:ignominy|ignominy]].\n# To establish laws about honour and a scale of worth.\n\nHobbes explicitly rejects the idea of ''[[Separation of Powers]]''. In item 6 Hobbes is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of [[free speech]] should they be considered desirable by the sovereign to promote order.\n\n====Types of commonwealth====\nThere are three ([[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[democracy]]):\n\n{{quote|The difference of Commonwealths consisted in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude. And because the sovereignty is either in one man, or in an assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth. For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part. When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy.}}\n\nAnd only three; since unlike [[Politics (Aristotle)#Classification of constitutions|Aristotle]] he does not sub-divide them into \"good\" and \"deviant\":\n\n{{quote|Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire. There be other names of government in the histories and books of policy; as [[tyrant|tyranny]] and [[oligarchy]]; but they are not the names of other forms of government, but of the same forms misliked. For they that are discontented under monarchy call it tyranny; and they that are displeased with aristocracy call it oligarchy: so also, they which find themselves grieved under a democracy call it anarchy, which signifies want of government; and yet I think no man believes that want of government is any new kind of government: nor by the same reason ought they to believe that the government is of one kind when they like it, and another when they mislike it or are oppressed by the governors.}}\n\nAnd monarchy is the best, on practical grounds:\n\n{{quote|The difference between these three kinds of Commonwealth consisteth not in the difference of power, but in the difference of convenience or aptitude to produce the peace and security of the people; for which end they were instituted. And to compare monarchy with the other two, we may observe: first, that whosoever beareth the person of the people, or is one of that assembly that bears it, beareth also his own natural person. And though he be careful in his politic person to procure the common interest, yet he is more, or no less, careful to procure the private good of himself, his family, kindred and friends; and for the most part, if the public interest chance to cross the private, he prefers the private: for the passions of men are commonly more potent than their reason. From whence it follows that where the public and private interest are most closely united, there is the public most advanced. Now in monarchy the private interest is the same with the public. The riches, power, and honour of a monarch arise only from the riches, strength, and reputation of his subjects. For no king can be rich, nor glorious, nor secure, whose subjects are either poor, or contemptible, or too weak through want, or dissension, to maintain a war against their enemies; whereas in a democracy, or aristocracy, the public prosperity confers not so much to the private fortune of one that is corrupt, or ambitious, as doth many times a perfidious advice, a treacherous action, or a civil war.}}\n\n====Succession====\nThe right of succession always lies with the sovereign. Democracies and aristocracies have easy succession; monarchy is harder:\n\n{{quote|The greatest difficulty about the right of succession is in monarchy: and the difficulty ariseth from this, that at first sight, it is not manifest who is to appoint the successor; nor many times who it is whom he hath appointed. For in both these cases, there is required a more exact ratiocination than every man is accustomed to use.}}\n\nBecause in general people haven't thought carefully. However, the succession is definitely in the gift of the monarch:\n\n{{quote|As to the question who shall appoint the successor of a monarch that hath the sovereign authority... we are to consider that either he that is in possession has right to dispose of the succession, or else that right is again in the dissolved multitude. ... Therefore it is manifest that by the institution of monarchy, the disposing of the successor is always left to the judgement and will of the present possessor.}}\n\nBut, it is not always obvious who the monarch has appointed:\n\n{{quote|And for the question which may arise sometimes, who it is that the monarch in possession hath designed to the succession and inheritance of his power}}\n\nHowever, the answer is:\n\n{{quote|it is determined by his express words and testament; or by other tacit signs sufficient.}}\n\nAnd this means:\n\n{{quote|By express words, or testament, when it is declared by him in his lifetime, viva voce, or by writing; as the first emperors of Rome declared who should be their heirs.}}\n\nNote that (perhaps rather radically) this does '''not''' have to be any blood relative:\n\n{{quote|For the word heir does not of itself imply the children or nearest kindred of a man; but whomsoever a man shall any way declare he would have to succeed him in his estate. If therefore a monarch declare expressly that such a man shall be his heir, either by word or writing, then is that man immediately after the decease of his predecessor invested in the right of being monarch.}}\n\nHowever, practically this means:\n\n{{quote|But where testament and express words are wanting, other natural signs of the will are to be followed: whereof the one is custom. And therefore where the custom is that the next of kindred absolutely succeedeth, there also the next of kindred hath right to the succession; for that, if the will of him that was in possession had been otherwise, he might easily have declared the same in his lifetime...}}\n\n====Religion====\nIn ''Leviathan'', Hobbes explicitly states that the sovereign has authority to assert power over matters of faith and doctrine and that if he does not do so, he invites discord. Hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign (when that was re-established: again, ''Leviathan'' was written during the Civil War) as to whether his theory was acceptable. Hobbes materialistic presuppositions also led him to hold a view which was considered highly controversial at the time. Hobbes rejected the idea of incorporeal substances and subsequently argued that even God himself was a corporeal substance. Although Hobbes never explicitly stated he was an atheist, many allude to the possibility that he is.\n\n====Taxation====\nHobbes also touched upon the sovereign's ability to tax in ''Leviathan'', although he is not as widely cited for his economic theories as he is for his political theories.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Aaron Levy |date=October 1954 |title=Economic Views of Thomas Hobbes |journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=589\u2013595 |doi=10.2307/2707677 |jstor=2707677 |bibcode = 1961JHI....22..215C}}</ref> Hobbes believed that equal justice includes the equal imposition of taxes. The equality of taxes doesn't depend on equality of wealth, but on the equality of the debt that every man owes to the commonwealth for his defence and the maintenance of the [[rule of law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/hobbes2.pdf |title=Leviathan: Part II. Commonwealth; Chapters 17\u201331 |publisher=Early Modern Texts}}</ref> Hobbes also championed public support for those unable to maintain themselves by labour, which would presumably be funded by taxation. He advocated public encouragement of works of Navigation etc. to usefully employ the poor who could work.\n\n===Part III: Of a Christian Common-wealth===\nIn Part III Hobbes seeks to investigate the nature of a ''Christian'' commonwealth. This immediately raises the question of which [[scripture]]s we should trust, and why. If any person may claim [[supernatural]] [[revelation]] superior to the civil law, then there would be chaos, and Hobbes' fervent desire is to avoid this. Hobbes thus begins by establishing that we cannot infallibly know another's personal word to be [[divinity|divine]] revelation:\n\n{{quote|When God speaketh to man, it must be either immediately or by mediation of another man, to whom He had formerly spoken by Himself immediately. How God speaketh to a man immediately may be understood by those well enough to whom He hath so spoken; but how the same should be understood by another is hard, if not impossible, to know. For if a man pretend to me that God hath spoken to him supernaturally, and immediately, and I make doubt of it, I cannot easily perceive what argument he can produce to oblige me to believe it.}}\n\nThis is good, but if applied too fervently would lead to all the Bible being rejected. So, Hobbes says, we need a test: and the true test is established by examining the books of scripture, and is:\n\n{{quote|So that it is manifest that the teaching of the religion which God hath established, and the showing of a present miracle, joined together, were the only marks whereby the Scripture would have a true prophet, that is to say, immediate revelation, to be acknowledged; of them being singly sufficient to oblige any other man to regard what he saith.}}\n\n{{quote|Seeing therefore miracles now cease, we have no sign left whereby to acknowledge the pretended revelations or inspirations of any private man; nor obligation to give ear to any doctrine, farther than it is conformable to the Holy Scriptures, which since the time of our Saviour supply the place and sufficiently recompense the want of all other prophecy}}\n\n\"Seeing therefore miracles now cease\" means that only the books of the Bible can be trusted. Hobbes then discusses the various books which are accepted by various [[sect]]s, and the \"question much disputed between the diverse sects of Christian religion, from whence the Scriptures derive their authority\". To Hobbes, \"it is manifest that none can know they are God's word (though all true Christians believe it) but those to whom God Himself hath revealed it supernaturally\". And therefore \"The question truly stated is: by what authority they are made law?\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Hobbes concludes that ultimately there is no way to determine this other than the civil power:\n\n{{quote|He therefore to whom God hath not supernaturally revealed that they are His, nor that those that published them were sent by Him, is not obliged to obey them by any authority but his whose commands have already the force of laws; that is to say, by any other authority than that of the Commonwealth, residing in the sovereign, who only has the legislative power.}}\n\nHe discusses the [[Ten Commandments]], and asks \"who it was that gave to these written tables the obligatory force of laws. There is no doubt but they were made laws by God Himself: but because a law obliges not, nor is law to any but to them that acknowledge it to be the act of the sovereign, how could the people of [[Israel]], that were forbidden to approach the mountain to hear what God said to [[Moses]], be obliged to obedience to all those laws which Moses propounded to them?\" and concludes, as before, that \"making of the Scripture law, belonged to the civil sovereign.\"\n\nFinally: \"We are to consider now what office in the Church those persons have who, being civil sovereigns, have embraced also the Christian faith?\" to which the answer is: \"Christian kings are still the supreme pastors of their people, and have power to ordain what pastors they please, to teach the Church, that is, to teach the people committed to their charge.\"\n\nThere is an enormous amount of biblical scholarship in this third part. However, once Hobbes' initial argument is accepted (that no-one can know for sure anyone else's divine revelation) his conclusion (the religious power is subordinate to the civil) follows from his logic. The very extensive discussions of the chapter were probably necessary for its time. The need (as Hobbes saw it) for the civil sovereign to be supreme arose partly from the many sects that arose around the civil war, and to quash the ''Pope of Rome's challenge'', to which Hobbes devotes an extensive section.\n\n===Part IV: Of the Kingdom of Darkness===\nHobbes named Part IV of his book Kingdom of Darkness. By this, Hobbes does not mean [[Hell]] (he did not believe in Hell or [[Purgatory]])<ref>Chapter XLVI: ''Lastly, for the errors brought in from false or uncertain history, what is all the legend of fictitious miracles in the lives of the saints; and all the histories of apparitions and ghosts alleged by the doctors of the Roman Church, to make good their doctrines of hell and purgatory, the power of [[exorcism]], and other doctrines which have no warrant, neither in reason nor Scripture; as also all those traditions which they call the unwritten word of God; but old wives' fables?'',</ref> but the darkness of [[ignorance]] as opposed to the light of true knowledge. Hobbes' interpretation is largely unorthodox and so sees much darkness in what he sees as the misinterpretation of [[Scripture]].\n\n: This considered, the kingdom of darkness... is nothing else but a confederacy of deceivers that, to obtain dominion over men in this present world, endeavour, by dark and erroneous [[doctrine]]s, to extinguish in them the light...<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-j.html |title=Chapter XLIV |access-date=27 September 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803200902/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-j.html#CHAPTERXLIV |archive-date=3 August 2004 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHobbes enumerates four causes of this darkness.\n\nThe first is by extinguishing the light of scripture through misinterpretation. Hobbes sees the main abuse as teaching that the [[kingdom of God]] can be found in the church, thus undermining the authority of the civil sovereign. Another general abuse of scripture, in his view, is the turning of [[consecration]] into [[conjuration]], or silly [[ritual]].\n\nThe second cause is the [[demonology]] of the heathen poets: in Hobbes's opinion, [[demon]]s are nothing more than constructs of the brain. Hobbes then goes on to criticize what he sees as many of the practices of Catholicism: \"Now for the worship of [[saint]]s, and [[icon|image]]s, and [[relic]]s, and other things at this day practiced in the Church of Rome, I say they are not allowed by the word of God\".\n\nThe third is by mixing with the Scripture diverse relics of the religion, and much of the vain and erroneous [[Greek philosophy|philosophy of the Greeks]], especially of [[Aristotle]]. Hobbes has little time for the various disputing sects of philosophers and objects to what people have taken \"From Aristotle's civil philosophy, they have learned to call all manner of Commonwealths but the popular (such as was at that time the state of Athens), [[tyranny]]\". At the end of this comes an interesting section (darkness is suppressing true knowledge as well as introducing falsehoods), which would appear to bear on the discoveries of [[Galileo Galilei]]. \"Our own navigations make manifest, and all men learned in human sciences now acknowledge, there are [[antipodes]]\" (i.e., the Earth is round) \"...Nevertheless, men... have been punished for it by authority ecclesiastical. But what reason is there for it? Is it because such opinions are contrary to true religion? That cannot be, if they be true.\" However, Hobbes is quite happy for the truth to be suppressed if necessary: if \"they tend to disorder in government, as countenancing rebellion or sedition? Then let them be silenced, and the teachers punished\" \u2013 but only by the civil authority.\n\nThe fourth is by mingling with both these, false or uncertain traditions, and feigned or uncertain history.\n\nHobbes finishes by inquiring who benefits from the errors he diagnoses:\n\n: [[Cicero]] maketh honourable mention of one of the Cassii, a severe judge amongst the Romans, for a custom he had in criminal causes, when the testimony of the witnesses was not sufficient, to ask the accusers, ''cui bono;'' that is to say, what profit, honour, or other contentment the accused obtained or expected by the fact. For amongst presumptions, there is none that so evidently declareth the author as doth the benefit of the action.\n\nHobbes concludes that the beneficiaries are the churches and churchmen.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'' by Thomas Hobbes\n*[[Classical republicanism]]\n*[[John Locke]]\n*''[[Scientia potentia est]]''\n*[[Hobbes's moral and political philosophy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n[[File:Hobbes - Leviathan, 1904 - 2631590 F.jpg|thumb|upright|1904 edition edited by [[Alfred Rayney Waller]]]]\n\n===Editions of ''Leviathan''===\n* ''Leviathan.

(2011) ''Chemistry for Engineering Students'', Brooks/Cole. </ref> and therefore the conversion constant is simply ''N''<sub>A</sub>  = 1.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20B\"></ref> The amount of substance is sometimes referred to as the '''chemical amount'''.\n\nThe mole (symbol \"mol\") is a unit of amount of substance in the [[International System of Units]], defined (since 2019) by fixing the Avogadro constant at the given value.  Historically, the mole was defined as the amount of substance in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. As a consequence, the mass of one mole of a [[chemical compound]], in [[gram]]s, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the mass of one molecule of the compound, in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s, and the molar mass of an isotope in grams per mole is equal to the mass number. For example, a molecule of water has a mass of about 18.015 daltons on average, whereas a mole of water (which contains {{physconst|NA|unit=no|ref=no}} water molecules) has a total mass of about 18.015 grams.\n\nIn chemistry, because of the [[law of multiple proportions]], it is often much more convenient to work with amounts of substances (that is, number of moles or of molecules) than with masses (grams) or volumes (liters).  For example, the chemical fact \"1 molecule of [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) will react with 2 molecules of [[hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2}}) to make 2 molecules of water ({{chem2|H2O}})\" can also be stated as \"1 mole of {{chem2|O2}} will react with 2 moles of {{chem2|H2}} to form 2 moles of water\". The same chemical fact, expressed in terms of masses, would be \"32 g of oxygen will react with approximately 2.0156 g of hydrogen to make approximately 18.0152 g of water\" (and the numbers would depend on the [[isotope|isotopic composition]] of the reagents). In terms of volume, the numbers would depend on the pressure and temperature of the reagents and products.  For the same reasons, the concentrations of reagents and products in solution are often specified in moles per liter, rather than grams per liter.\n\nThe amount of substance is also a convenient concept in [[thermodynamics]].  For example, the pressure of a certain quantity of a [[noble gas]] in a recipient of a given volume, at a given temperature, is directly related to the number of molecules in the gas (through the [[ideal gas law]]), not to its mass.\n\nThis technical sense of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confused with the general sense of \"amount\" in the [[English language]]. The latter may refer to other measurements such as mass or volume,<ref name=\"Giunta\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00690|title=What's in a Name?

For [[metal]]lic [[chemical element|elements]], and some non-metallic elements like [[carbon]] and [[silicon]] which have molecules of indefinite size, it usually refers to atoms instead.  For element [[allotrope]]s with discrete molecules \u2013 like [[iodine]], {{chem|I|2}}, [[chlorine]], {{chem|Cl|2}}, [[phosphorus|white phosphorus]] {{chem|P|4}}, and [[octasulfur]] {{chem|S|8}} \u2013 the term is ambiguous, and should be clarified.\n\nFor [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] (ionic solids) and for [[polymers]] of indeterminate molecular size, the term usually refers to the number of instances of the conventional chemical formula of the substance.  Thus, for example, 1 mol of [[calcium chloride]] ({{chem|CaCl2}}) is understood to contain one mole of [[calcium]] [[cation]]s {{chem|Ca|2+}} and two moles of [[chloride]] [[anion]]s {{chem|Cl|\u2212}}, even though the ions are not bound into separate three-atom molecules.  Likewise, 1 mol of solid [[silicon dioxide]] ({{chem|SiO|2}})<sub>''n''</sub>, which has a three-dimensional covalent lattice structure, is understood to contain one mole of silicon atoms and two moles of oxygen atoms. \n\nFor substances that normally exist in partially dissociated or polymerized form, the amount of substance usually refers to its nominal formula, without taking those changes into account.  For example, \"a solution of 1 mol of [[formaldehyde]] ({{chem|CH|2|O}}) in water\" is generally understood to contain one mole of carbon atoms, even though some of the formaldehyde may be in the form of [[methanediol]] {{chem|CH|4|O|2}} or [[oligomer]]s like [[paraformaldehyde]] {{chem|H|(|CH|2|O|)|''n''|OH}} and [[1,3,5-trioxane|metaformaldehyde]] {{chem|C|3|H|6|O|3}}.  Note that, because of the latter, the number of carbon-containing ''molecules'' in the solution may be substantially less than one mole.\n\n==Derived quantities==\n===Molar quantities (per mole)===\nThe quotient of some [[extensive property|extensive]] physical quantity of a homogeneous sample by its amount of substance is an [[intensive property]] of the substance, usually named by the prefix '''molar'''.<ref name=\"molar\">{{GreenBookRef|page=7}}</ref> \n\nFor example, the ratio of the mass of a sample by its amount of substance is the [[molar mass]], whose SI unit is kilograms (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about 18.015 g/mol for water, and 55.845 g/mol for [[iron]].  From the volume, one gets the [[molar volume]], which is about 17.962 [[milliliter]]/mol for liquid water and 7.092 mL/mol for iron at room temperature.  From the [[heat capacity]], one gets the [[molar heat capacity]], which is about 75.385 [[joule|J]]/[[kelvin|K]]/mol for water and about 25.10 J/K/mol for iron.\n\n===Amount concentration (moles per liter)===\nAnother important derived quantity is the [[amount of substance concentration]]<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=amount-of-substance concentration|file=A00298}}</ref> (also called ''amount concentration'', or ''substance concentration'' in [[clinical chemistry]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry | year = 1996 | title = Glossary of Terms in Quantities and Units in Clinical Chemistry | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1996/pdf/6804x0957.pdf | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 957\u20131000 | doi=10.1351/pac199668040957| author-link = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry }}</ref>; which is defined as the amount of a specific substance in a sample of a solution (or some other mixture), divided by the volume of the sample.  \n\nThe SI unit of this quantity is the mole (of the substance) per liter (of the solution).  Thus, for example, the amount concentration of [[sodium chloride]] in ocean water is typically about 0.599 mol/L.\n\nThe denominator is the volume of the solution, not of the solvent. Thus, for example, one liter of standard [[vodka]] contains about 0.40 L of [[ethanol]] (315 g, 6.85 mol) and 0.60 L of water. The amount concentration of ethanol is therefore (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(1 L of vodka) = 6.85 mol/L, not (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(0.60 L of water), which would be 11.4 mol/L. \n\nIn chemistry, it is customary to read the unit \"mol/L\" as '''[[molar (unit)|molar]]''', and denote it by the symbol \"M\" (both following the numeric value). Thus, for example, each liter of a \"0.5 molar\" or \"0.5 M\" solution of [[urea]] ({{chem|CH|4|N|2|O}}) in water contains 0.5 moles of that molecule.  By extension, the amount concentration is also commonly called the '''molarity''' of the substance of interest in the solution.  However, as of May 2007, these terms and symbols are not condoned by IUPAC.<ref>{{GreenBookRef|page=42&nbsp;(n.&nbsp;15)}}</ref>\n\nThis quantity should not be confused with the [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]], which is the mass of the substance of interest divided by the volume of the solution (about 35 g/L for sodium chloride in ocean water). \n\n===Amount fraction (moles per mole)===\nConfusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguished from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of moles (molecules) of the substance of interest divided by the total number of moles (molecules) in the solution sample.  This quantity is more properly called the [[amount fraction]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Alchemy|alchemists]], and especially the early [[metallurgist]]s, probably had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviving records of any generalization of the idea beyond a set of recipes. In 1758, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] questioned the idea that mass was the only measure of the quantity of matter,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lomonosov | first = Mikhail | authorlink = Mikhail Lomonosov | year = 1970 | contribution = On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight | editor-first = Henry M. | editor-last = Leicester | title = Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | contribution-url=//archive.org/stream/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp#page/n239/mode/2up | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | pages = 224\u201333 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> but he did so only in relation to his theories on [[gravitation]].

Historically, the mole was defined as the amount of substance in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. As a consequence, the mass of one mole of a [[chemical compound]], in [[gram]]s, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the mass of one molecule of the compound, in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s, and the molar mass of an isotope in grams per mole is equal to the mass number. For example, a molecule of water has a mass of about 18.015 daltons on average, whereas a mole of water (which contains {{physconst|NA|unit=no|ref=no}} water molecules) has a total mass of about 18.015 grams.\n\nIn chemistry, because of the [[law of multiple proportions]], it is often much more convenient to work with amounts of substances (that is, number of moles or of molecules) than with masses (grams) or volumes (liters).  For example, the chemical fact \"1 molecule of [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) will react with 2 molecules of [[hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2}}) to make 2 molecules of water ({{chem2|H2O}})\" can also be stated as \"1 mole of {{chem2|O2}} will react with 2 moles of {{chem2|H2}} to form 2 moles of water\". The same chemical fact, expressed in terms of masses, would be \"32 g of oxygen will react with approximately 2.0156 g of hydrogen to make approximately 18.0152 g of water\" (and the numbers would depend on the [[isotope|isotopic composition]] of the reagents). In terms of volume, the numbers would depend on the pressure and temperature of the reagents and products.  For the same reasons, the concentrations of reagents and products in solution are often specified in moles per liter, rather than grams per liter.\n\nThe amount of substance is also a convenient concept in [[thermodynamics]].  For example, the pressure of a certain quantity of a [[noble gas]] in a recipient of a given volume, at a given temperature, is directly related to the number of molecules in the gas (through the [[ideal gas law]]), not to its mass.\n\nThis technical sense of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confused with the general sense of \"amount\" in the [[English language]].

For [[metal]]lic [[chemical element|elements]], and some non-metallic elements like [[carbon]] and [[silicon]] which have molecules of indefinite size, it usually refers to atoms instead.  For element [[allotrope]]s with discrete molecules \u2014 like [[iodine]], {{chem|I|2}}, [[chlorine]], {{chem|Cl|2}}, [[phosphorus|white phosphorus]] {{chem|P|4}}, and [[octasulfur]] {{chem|S|8}} \u2014 the term is ambiguous, and should be clarified.\n\nFor [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] (ionic solids) and for [[polymers]] of indeterminate molecular size, the term usually refers to the number of instances of the conventional chemical formula of the substance.  Thus, for example, 1 mol of [[calcium chloride]] ({{chem|CaCl2}}) is understood to contain one mole of [[calcium]] [[cation]]s {{chem|Ca|2+}} and two moles of [[chloride]] [[anion]]s {{chem|Cl|\u2212}}, even though the ions are not bound into separate three-atom molecules.  Likewise, 1 mol of solid [[silicon dioxide]] ({{chem|SiO|2}})<sub>''n''</sub>, which has a three-dimensional covalent lattice structure, is understood to contain one mole of silicon atoms and two moles of oxygen atoms. \n\nFor substances that normally exist in partially dissociated or polymerized form, the amount of substance usually refers to its nominal formula, without taking those changes into account.  For example, \"a solution of 1 mol of [[formaldehyde]] ({{chem|CH|2|O}}) in water\" is generally understood to contain one mole of carbon atoms, even though some of the formaldehyde may be in the form of [[methanediol]] {{chem|CH|4|O|2}} or [[oligomer]]s like [[paraformaldehyde]] {{chem|H|(|CH|2|O|)|''n''|OH}} and [[1,3,5-trioxane|metaformaldehyde]] {{chem|C|3|H|6|O|3}}.  Note that, because of the latter, the number of carbon-containing ''molecules'' in the solution may be substantially less than one mole.\n\n==Derived quantities==\n===Molar quantities (per mole)===\nThe quotient of some [[extensive property|extensive]] physical quantity of a homogeneous sample by its amount of substance is an [[intensive property]] of the substance, usually named by the prefix '''molar'''.<ref name=\"molar\">{{GreenBookRef|page=7}}</ref> \n\nFor example, the ratio of the mass of a sample by its amount of substance is the [[molar mass]], whose SI unit is kilograms (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about 18.015 g/mol for water, and 55.845 g/mol for [[iron]].  From the volume, one gets the [[molar volume]], which is about 17.962 [[milliliter]]/mol for liquid water and 7.092 mL/mol for iron at room temperature.  From the [[heat capacity]], one gets the [[molar heat capacity]], which is about 75.385 [[joule|J]]/[[kelvin|K]]/mol for water and about 25.10 J/K/mol for iron.\n\n===Amount concentration (moles per liter)===\nAnother important derived quantity is the [[amount of substance concentration]]<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=amount-of-substance concentration|file=A00298}}</ref> (also called ''amount concentration'', or ''substance concentration'' in [[clinical chemistry]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry | year = 1996 | title = Glossary of Terms in Quantities and Units in Clinical Chemistry | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1996/pdf/6804x0957.pdf | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 957\u20131000 | doi=10.1351/pac199668040957| author-link = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry }}</ref>; which is defined as the amount of a specific substance in a sample of a solution (or some other mixture), divided by the volume of the sample.  \n\nThe SI unit of this quantity is the mole (of the substance) per liter (of the solution).  Thus, for example, the amount concentration of [[sodium chloride]] in ocean water is typically about 0.599 mol/L.\n\nThe denominator is the volume of the solution, not of the solvent. Thus, for example, one liter of standard [[vodka]] contains about 0.40 L of [[ethanol]] (315 g, 6.85 mol) and 0.60 L of water. The amount concentration of ethanol is therefore (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(1 L of vodka) = 6.85 mol/L, not (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(0.60 L of water), which would be 11.4 mol/L. \n\nIn chemistry, it is customary to read the unit \"mol/L\" as '''[[molar (unit)|molar]]''', and denote it by the symbol \"M\" (both following the numeric value). Thus, for example, each liter of a \"0.5 molar\" or \"0.5 M\" solution of [[urea]] ({{chem|CH|4|N|2|O}}) in water contains 0.5 moles of that molecule.  By extension, the amount concentration is also commonly called the '''molarity''' of the substance of interest in the solution.  However, as of May 2007, these terms and symbols are not condoned by IUPAC.<ref>{{GreenBookRef|page=42&nbsp;(n.&nbsp;15)}}</ref>\n\nThis quantity should not be confused with the [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]], which is the mass of the substance of interest divided by the volume of the solution (about 35 g/L for sodium chloride in ocean water). \n\n===Amount fraction (moles per mole)===\nConfusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguished from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of moles (molecules) of the substance of interest divided by the total number of moles (molecules) in the solution sample.  This quantity is more properly called the [[amount fraction]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Alchemy|alchemists]], and especially the early [[metallurgist]]s, probably had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviving records of any generalization of the idea beyond a set of recipes. In 1758, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] questioned the idea that mass was the only measure of the quantity of matter,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lomonosov | first = Mikhail | authorlink = Mikhail Lomonosov | year = 1970 | contribution = On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight | editor-first = Henry M. | editor-last = Leicester | title = Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | contribution-url=//archive.org/stream/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp#page/n239/mode/2up | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | pages = 224\u201333 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> but he did so only in relation to his theories on [[gravitation]].

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nAfter several delays and cost overruns, production finally began in late 1980.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages.

All of them noted disappointing performance especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a GT car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time in 2017.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\n[[File:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|thumb|Early pull strap]]\n[[File:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|thumb|Later-style one-piece bolster]]\n[[File:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|thumb|Mid-1981 silver wheel]]\n\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

When equipped with an automatic transmission, the DeLorean would accelerate from {{convert|0|to|60|mph|}} in 10.5 seconds as tested by ''Road & Track'' magazine. The car's top speed is {{convert|109|mph|0}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/classic-cars/reviews/a27099/1982-delorean-dmc-12-road-test/|title=1982 DeLorean DMC-12: The Vintage Road & Track Test|date=October 21, 2015|work=Road & Track|publisher=|access-date=July 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803211950/http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/classic-cars/reviews/a27099/1982-delorean-dmc-12-road-test/|archive-date=August 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Road and Track called the car: \".. not quick for a sports/GT car in this price category ..\".\n\n==Problems and issues==\nDeLoreans, early production models in particular, suffered from poor build quality as well as mechanical issues with the vehicle.  Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\n[[File:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|thumb|Early pull strap]]\n[[File:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|thumb|Later-style one-piece bolster]]\n[[File:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|thumb|Mid-1981 silver wheel]]\n\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n\n===Prototypes and pilot cars===\nOnly one of two DeLorean prototypes still exists.<ref>{{cite web |author=PJ Grady Europe |url=http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |publisher=DeLorean PJ Grady Europe |title=Delorean Repairs |accessdate=January 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421053458/http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |archivedate=April 21, 2014  }}</ref> Prototype 1 sold at the bankruptcy auction in 1984 for $37,000.<ref name=\"upi.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |title=DeLorean prototype cars sell at auction for total $58,000 |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602233213/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The car remained in a private collection until 2005 when it was sold to the owner of DeLorean Motor Company of Florida (DMCFL) where it received a complete restoration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |title=1587: 1976 DeLorean DMC-12 Original Prototype |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602234250/https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Proto 1 is now on display at DMCFL.

VIN 510 is understood to be the first of this batch of cars converted and was later sold at the factory auction in 1984. The other 12 cars were auctioned off by the receivers in early 1983. As a result, several of these cars were registered at the same time and have the Northern Irish registration (license) number \"SIJ xxxx\". All of this first batch of cars had a black interior and all had manual transmission, except VIN 12175. This car is the only factory-authorized right-hand-drive black-interior automatic car and is owned by Andrew Withers, former editor of the UK DeLorean Owners Club.\n# The second batch were registered and used by the factory in Northern Ireland, with registration numbers (license plates), AXI 1697, AXI 1698, AXI 1699 and are referred to by enthusiasts as the \"AXI cars\". These three cars (VINs 5565, 5592 and 5638) differ from the first Wooler-Hodec cars in several ways. They all had roof-mounted radio antennas, indicator repeater lights, no side marker lights, white forward-facing door lights, fog-light switch, and textured body rubstrips on the stainless panels. No [[catalytic converters]] or [[Oxygen sensor|lambda equipment]] were fitted, as British legislation did not require them. VIN 5565 with the registration number AXI 1697 was a fully UK homologated example, which was shown at the British motor show at Birmingham, UK in October 1982. It includes a unique rearward-facing twin exhaust, no catalytic converters and the UK-specification engine as used by Volvo, but retaining the usual Renault ancillaries. The transmission final drive was also set at 3.88:1 versus the standard 3.44:1. Attention was paid to other unique details such as correctly offset wing mirrors.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nA common misconception surrounding the factory-authorized right-hand-drive DeLoreans is that they were all fitted with different, so-called \"Euro-spec\", tail lights<ref name=\"rubberlight\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deloreans.co.uk/features/eurospec/big_pics/rubberlight02.jpg |publisher=DeLorean Owners Club UK |title=Reference image illustrating so-called \"Euro-spec\" tail light unit |accessdate=December 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724223141/http://www.deloreans.co.uk/features/eurospec/big_pics/rubberlight02.jpg |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}</ref> as part of the right-hand-drive conversion program.

The programme from the 21st to the 31st January 2021 comprises ten sporting disciplines, to be contested at seven event venues.

It was in 1959 that [[International University Sports Federation|FISU]] launched the [[Universiades]], now the largest multi-sport event for students. Since then, a total of 29 Winter Universiades and 30 Summer Universiades have already taken place. Unlike the Olympic Games, both Universiades are held in the same year and in a two-year cycle. In March 2016, [[International University Sports Federation|FISU]] assigned the 30th winter edition to Central Switzerland with Lucerne as the host city. The six cantons of Central Switzerland and the city of Lucerne founded an association for the purpose of this major project. Government representatives from each of the six cantons and Lucerne\u2019s city council are responsible for strategic decisions under the chairmanship of [[Guido Graf]], Cantonal Councillor Lucerne. The organising committee, directed by the Managing Director [[Urs Hunkeler]], reports directly to this board.\n\nThe organising committee works closely with [[Swiss University Sports]]. The National University Sports Federation of Switzerland is a member of [[International University Sports Federation|FISU]] and is in charge of the selection of Swiss athletes for the multi-sport event. It has set itself the goal of building a strong Swiss team for the upcoming Winter Universiade at home.<ref>https://www.winteruniversiade2021.ch/media/images/2020.03.26.-Media-Documentation_EN.pdf</ref>\n\n== University of Lucerne ==\nThe organising committee can count on the generous support of the University of Lucerne and the PH Lucerne. During the Winter Universiade, the University/PH building will be transformed into the hub of the multi-sport event.\n\nIn the building you will find\nthe accreditation centre,\nthe information centre for all participants,\nthe canteen as a catering centre for volunteers, the organising committee and other customer groups,\nthe media centre as well as a room for press conferences and\nthe international broadcasting centre.\n\nIn addition, the following rooms/facilities in particular are available for use by the delegations:\na waxing and storage room for skis and snowboards in alpine snow sports,\nmeeting rooms,\nindividual offices of the delegations.\n\nMoreover, the Uni/PH building will also be the headquarters of the organising committee during the event. The organising committee will be using rooms for the following purposes:\noffices of the various departments,\nmeeting rooms,\nmain operation centre of the multi-sport event.\n\n=== Student Projects ===\nThe Winter Universiade offers space for innovative projects, scientific research and creative ideas. Students at Swiss universities can actively get involved in the planning and organisation of the event by submitting student projects. \"For us, the involvement of students is key,\" explains Esther M\u00fcller, Director of Academic Liaison, and continues: \"This event is a unique opportunity. We want as many students as possible to benefit\".\n\nIn addition to a study on the suitability of a venue or a bachelor's thesis on how to maintain sponsor satisfaction, the Winter Universiade mascot, for example, was also designed by students. Four aspiring female artists from the Lucerne School of Art and Design have each designed a character. A seven-member jury selected Luisa Z\u00fcrcher's proposal to be the mascot of the Winter Universiade 2021. The four students volunteered for the student design project and worked on it in their spare time. The decision to take part was easy, as the 23-year-old Luisa Z\u00fcrcher explains: \"What could be more exciting than designing a mascot that you can later hug?\" In addition to numerous design tasks, the students support the marketing department, especially in the area of social media.\n\nBy the way: interested students can still work on numerous projects and contribute their ideas. The complete overview can be found on the website of the organising committee at winteruniversiade2021.ch/en/universities.\n\n=== World Conference ===\nThe FISU World Conference on Innovation \u2013 Education \u2013 Sport will be held during the Lucerne 2021 Winter Universiade on 25 and 26 January 2021. Under the main topic Challenges and Opportunities in Sport in modern society researchers will focus on three subthemes: Dual career / Digitalization / Women in top-class sport. The conference is located at the building of the University of Lucerne and organized by the University of Lucerne, the Universities of teacher education Lucerne, Zug and Schwyz and the Universities of applied sciences of Lucerne and Grisons.\n\n== Mascot ==\n[[File:2020.02.20.-Fasnacht.jpg|thumb]]\nWhether \"Cooly\", the mascot of the Ice Hockey World Championships 2009 and 2020, the FC Lucerne mascots \"Siegfried & Leu\" or \"Yodli\" at the Youth Olympic Games in Lausanne 2020 \u2013 all mascots have one thing in common: they captivate audiences and have become an integral part of major sporting events. On the occasion of the \"One-Year-To-Go\" event, the Winter Universiade 2021 has also introduced an event mascot. This fabulous creature was designed by Luisa Z\u00fcrcher, an animation student at the Lucerne School of Art and Design.\nThe young artist was inspired by Yeti, the mountains of Central Switzerland and its myths, and the carnival, which has deep roots in the traditions of Central Switzerland. Luisa Z\u00fcrcher has created a character perfectly suited to the Winter Universiade: the fabulous creature has its origins in the myths of Central Switzerland, loves carnival, and lives in the mountains of the region. The curious mascot will travel to Winter Universiade venues to make friends with athletes from all over the world. The sporty mascot will help visitors to the Winter Universiade 2021 feel at home, in keeping with the event motto \"Welcome Home\".\n\nLuisa Z\u00fcrcher volunteered for the student design project, and created the mascot in her spare time. The decision to take part was easy, as the 23-year-old explains: \"What could be more exciting than designing a mascot that you can later hug?\" This moment became reality for Luisa Z\u00fcrcher at the \"One-Year-To-Go\" event. Over the next twelve months, the fabulous creature will put a smile on the faces of many more people with a hug.\n\nThe Organising Committee of the Winter Universiade 2021 named the mascot \u2018Wuli\u2019 in a ceremony held at the IBU Biathlon Youth and Junior World Championships in Lenzerheide. The name is a combination of the initials of \"Winter Universiade\" with the typical Swiss word ending \"-li\". It was chosen by the public in an online vote on the social media channels of the Winter Universiade 2021. The naming ceremony was conducted by the Head of Marketing & Sponsoring Fabienne Meyerhans, and Hannes Parpan, President of the local organising committee in Lenzerheide.\n\u2003\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.winteruniversiade2021.ch/}}\n\n[[Category:Winter Universiade|2021]]\n[[Category:2021 in multi-sport events|Universiade Winter]]\n[[Category:2021 in Swiss sport|Universiade Winter]]\n[[Category:Scheduled multi-sport events|Winter Universiade]]\n[[Category:Winter sports competitions in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Multi-sport events in Switzerland|Winter Universiade]]\n[[Category:Sport in Lucerne]]\n\n{{Universiade}}\n\n{{sport-event-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Universiade infobox \n|Name             = Lucerne 2021 Winteruniversiade\n| Logo = univesiade_logo_new_2021.png \n| Size = 150px\n| Motto = <!--\"\"Welcome Home\" -->\n| Optional caption = ''Welcome Home!''\n| host city= [[Lucerne]]-Central Switzerland, Switzerland\n| Nations participating = - approx. 50\n| Athletes participating = approx. 1600\n| Sports = 10\n| Opening ceremony = 21 January\n| Closing ceremony = 31 January\n| Officially opened by = \n| Athlete's Oath = -\n| Judge's Oath = -\n| Torch Lighter = - \n| website = http://winteruniversiade2021.ch/\n| previous = [[2019 Winter Universiade|2019]]\n| next = [[2023 Winter World University Games|2023]]\n}}\n<!--[[File:Real Welcome Home.png|thumb|Welcome Home 2021]]-->\nThe '''[[Winter Universiade]]''' is the largest winter multisport event after the Olympic Games.

A seven-member jury selected Luisa Z\u00fcrcher's proposal to be the mascot of the Winter Universiade 2021. The four students volunteered for the student design project and worked on it in their spare time. The decision to take part was easy, as the 23-year-old Luisa Z\u00fcrcher explains: \"What could be more exciting than designing a mascot that you can later hug?\" In addition to numerous design tasks, the students support the marketing department, especially in the area of social media.\n\nBy the way: interested students can still work on numerous projects and contribute their ideas. The complete overview can be found on the website of the organising committee at winteruniversiade2021.ch/en/universities.\n\n=== World Conference ===\nThe FISU World Conference on Innovation \u2013 Education \u2013 Sport will be held during the Lucerne 2021 Winter Universiade on 25 and 26 January 2021. Under the main topic Challenges and Opportunities in Sport in modern society researchers will focus on three subthemes: Dual career / Digitalization / Women in top-class sport. The conference is located at the building of the University of Lucerne and organized by the University of Lucerne, the Universities of teacher education Lucerne, Zug and Schwyz and the Universities of applied sciences of Lucerne and Grisons.\n\n== Mascot ==\n[[File:2020.02.20.-Fasnacht.jpg|thumb]]\nWhether \"Cooly\", the mascot of the Ice Hockey World Championships 2009 and 2020, the FC Lucerne mascots \"Siegfried & Leu\" or \"Yodli\" at the Youth Olympic Games in Lausanne 2020 \u2013 all mascots have one thing in common: they captivate audiences and have become an integral part of major sporting events. On the occasion of the \"One-Year-To-Go\" event, the Winter Universiade 2021 has also introduced an event mascot. This fabulous creature was designed by Luisa Z\u00fcrcher, an animation student at the Lucerne School of Art and Design.\nThe young artist was inspired by Yeti, the mountains of Central Switzerland and its myths, and the carnival, which has deep roots in the traditions of Central Switzerland. Luisa Z\u00fcrcher has created a character perfectly suited to the Winter Universiade: the fabulous creature has its origins in the myths of Central Switzerland, loves carnival, and lives in the mountains of the region. The curious mascot will travel to Winter Universiade venues to make friends with athletes from all over the world. The sporty mascot will help visitors to the Winter Universiade 2021 feel at home, in keeping with the event motto \"Welcome Home\".\n\nLuisa Z\u00fcrcher volunteered for the student design project, and created the mascot in her spare time. The decision to take part was easy, as the 23-year-old explains: \"What could be more exciting than designing a mascot that you can later hug?\" This moment became reality for Luisa Z\u00fcrcher at the \"One-Year-To-Go\" event. Over the next twelve months, the fabulous creature will put a smile on the faces of many more people with a hug.\n\nThe Organising Committee of the Winter Universiade 2021 named the mascot \u2018Wuli\u2019 in a ceremony held at the IBU Biathlon Youth and Junior World Championships in Lenzerheide. The name is a combination of the initials of \"Winter Universiade\" with the typical Swiss word ending \"-li\". It was chosen by the public in an online vote on the social media channels of the Winter Universiade 2021. The naming ceremony was conducted by the Head of Marketing & Sponsoring Fabienne Meyerhans, and Hannes Parpan, President of the local organising committee in Lenzerheide.\n\u2003\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.winteruniversiade2021.ch/}}\n\n[[Category:Winter Universiade|2021]]\n[[Category:2021 in multi-sport events|Universiade Winter]]\n[[Category:2021 in Swiss sport|Universiade Winter]]\n[[Category:Scheduled multi-sport events|Winter Universiade]]\n[[Category:Winter sports competitions in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Multi-sport events in Switzerland|Winter Universiade]]\n[[Category:Sport in Lucerne]]\n\n{{Universiade}}\n\n{{sport-event-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toFISU(link changed toInternational University Sports Federation; link changed toInternational University Sports Federation; link changed toInternational University Sports Federation) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Winter_Universiade"}

Later dinosaurs regarded as predators sometimes grew much larger, but retained the same set of features. Instead of chewing their food, these predators swallowed it whole.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\">{{Cite book\n| author=Norman, D.B. | chapter=Dinosaur Feeding | date=April 2001\n| title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences | publisher= John Wiley & Sons | doi=10.1038/npg.els.0003321\n| chapter-url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9780470015902/els/article/a0003321/current/abstract\n| accessdate=2009-09-10\n| isbn=978-0470016176 }}</ref>\n\nThe feeding habits of [[ornithomimosaur]]s and [[oviraptorosaur]]s are a mystery: although they evolved from a predatory [[theropod]] lineage, they have small jaws and lack the blade-like teeth of typical predators, but there is no evidence of their diet or how they ate and digested it.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nFeatures of other groups of dinosaurs indicate they were herbivores. These features include:\n* Jaws that only slightly opened and closed so that all the teeth met at the same time\n* Large abdomens that could accommodate large amounts of vegetation and store it for the long time it takes to digest vegetation\n* Guts that likely contained [[Endosymbiotic]] micro-organisms that digest [[cellulose]], as no known animal can digest this tough material directly<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\n[[Sauropod]]s, which were herbivores, did not chew their food, as their teeth and jaws appear suitable only for stripping leaves off plants. [[Ornithischian]]s, also herbivores, show a variety of approaches. The armored [[ankylosaur]]s and [[stegosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, and are thought to have fed in much the same way as sauropods. The [[pachycephalosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, but their lack of large digestive systems suggests a different diet, possibly fruits, seeds, or young shoots, which would have been more nutritious to them than leaves.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nOn the other hand, [[ornithopod]]s such as ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'', ''[[Iguanodon]]'' and various [[hadrosaur]]s had horny beaks for snipping off vegetation and jaws and teeth that were well-adapted for chewing. The horned [[ceratopsian]]s had similar mechanisms.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nIt has often been suggested that at least some dinosaurs used swallowed stones, known as [[gastrolith]]s, to aid digestion by grinding their food in muscular [[gizzard]]s, and that this was a feature they shared with birds. In 2007 Oliver Wings reviewed references to gastroliths in scientific literature and found considerable confusion, starting with the lack of an agreed and objective definition of \"gastrolith\". He found that swallowed hard stones or grit can assist digestion in birds that mainly feed on grain but may not be essential\u2014and that birds that eat insects in summer and grain in winter usually get rid of the stones and grit in summer. Gastroliths have often been described as important for [[sauropod]] dinosaurs, whose diet of vegetation required very thorough digestion, but Wings concluded that this idea was incorrect: gastroliths are found with only a small percentage of sauropod fossils; where they have been found, the amounts are too small and in many cases the stones are too soft to have been effective in grinding food; most of these gastroliths are highly polished, but gastroliths used by modern animals to grind food are roughened by wear and corroded by stomach acids; hence the sauropod gastroliths were probably swallowed accidentally. On the other hand, he concluded that gastroliths found with fossils of advanced [[theropod]] dinosaurs such as ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'' and ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' resemble those of birds, and that the use of gastroliths for grinding food may have appeared early in the group of dinosaurs from which these dinosaurs and birds both evolved.<ref name=\"Wings2007ReviewOfGastrolithFunction\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wings, O. | year=2007\n| title=A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification\n| journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume=52 | issue=1 |pages=1\u201316\n| url=http://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-001.pdf | accessdate=2008-09-10\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WingsSander2007NoGastricMillInSauropods\">{{cite journal\n|author1=Wings, O. |author2=Sander.

But this does not imply that ornithischians could not have had metabolic rates comparable to those of mammals, since mammals also do not have air sacs.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nThree explanations have been suggested for the development of air sacs in dinosaurs:<ref name=\"SerenoMartinezEtAl2008AvianIntrathoracicAirSacsInNewPredatoryDinosaur\" />\n* Increase in respiratory capacity. This is probably the most common hypothesis, and fits well with the idea that many dinosaurs had fairly high [[metabolic rate]]s.\n* Improving balance and maneuvrability by lowering the [[center of gravity]] and reducing [[rotational inertia]]. However this does not explain the expansion of air sacs in the quadrupedal sauropods.\n* As a cooling mechanism. It seems that air sacs and feathers evolved at about the same time in [[coelurosaur]]s. If feathers retained heat, their owners would have required a means of dissipating excess heat. This idea is plausible but needs further empirical support.\n\nCalculations of the volumes of various parts of the sauropod ''Apatosaurus''' respiratory system support the evidence of bird-like air sacs in sauropods:\n* Assuming that ''Apatosaurus'', like dinosaurs' nearest surviving relatives [[crocodilia]]ns and birds, did not have a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] of a 30-ton specimen would be about 184 liters. This is the total volume of the mouth, trachea and air tubes. If the animal exhales less than this, stale air is not expelled and is sucked back into the lungs on the following inhalation.\n* Estimates of its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]]&nbsp;\u2013 the amount of air moved into or out of the lungs in a single breath&nbsp;\u2013 depend on the type of [[respiratory system]] the animal had: 904&nbsp;liters if avian; 225&nbsp;liters if mammalian; 19&nbsp;liters if reptilian.\nOn this basis, ''Apatosaurus'' could not have had a reptilian respiratory system, as its tidal volume would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;184&nbsp;=&nbsp;41&nbsp;liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath. ''Apatosaurus'' must therefore have had either a system unknown in the modern world or one like [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|birds]]', with multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600&nbsp;liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950&nbsp;liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700&nbsp;liters of space available in a 30-ton ''Apatosaurus''\u2032 chest.<ref name=\"PaladinoEtAlInFarlowBrettSurman1997\">{{Cite book |author=Paladino, F.V., Spotila, J.R., and Dodson, P. |year=1997 |contribution=A Blueprint for Giants: Modeling the Physiology of Large Dinosaurs |editor=Farlow, J.O. |editor2=Brett-Surman, M.K.  |title=The Complete Dinosaur |pages=491\u2013504 |isbn=978-0-253-21313-6 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind.}}</ref>\n\nDinosaur respiratory systems with bird-like air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build can sustain.

The activity of metabolic enzymes varies with temperature, so temperature control is vital for any organism, whether endothermic or ectothermic. Organisms can be categorized as [[poikilotherms]] (poikilo&nbsp;\u2013 changing), which are tolerant of internal temperature fluctuations, and [[homeotherms]] (homeo&nbsp;\u2013 same), which must maintain a constant core temperature. Animals can be further categorized as [[endotherms]], which regulate their temperature internally, and [[ectotherms]], which regulate temperature by the use of external heat sources.\n\n=== What the debate is about ===\n{{see also|Gigantothermy}}\n\"[[Warm-blooded]]ness\" is a complex and rather ambiguous term, because it includes some or all of:\n* '''[[Homeotherm]]y''', i.e. maintaining a fairly constant body temperature. Modern endotherms maintain a variety of temperatures: {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[monotreme]]s and [[sloth]]s;  {{convert|33|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[marsupial]]s;  {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in most [[placental]]s; and around {{convert|41|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in birds.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* '''[[Tachymetabolism]]''', i.e. maintaining a high [[metabolic rate]], particularly when at rest. This requires a fairly high and stable body temperature, since biochemical processes run about half as fast if an animal's temperature drops by 10C\u00b0; most [[enzyme]]s have an optimum [[operating temperature]] and their efficiency drops rapidly outside the preferred range.<ref name=\"McGowan11991DinosaursSpitfiresSeaDragonsP133To135\">{{cite book |author=McGowan, C. |title=Dinosaurs, Spitfires and Sea Dragons |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 133\u2013135] |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-20769-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 }}</ref>\n* '''[[Endotherm]]y''', i.e. the ability to generate heat internally, for example by \"burning\" fat, rather than via behaviors such as basking or muscular activity. Although endothermy is in principle the most reliable way to maintain a fairly constant temperature, it is expensive; for example modern mammals need 10 to 13 times as much food as modern reptiles.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nLarge dinosaurs may also have maintained their temperatures by inertial homeothermy, also known as \"bulk homeothermy\" or \"mass homeothermy\". In other words, the [[thermal capacity]] of such large animals was so high that it would take two days or more for their temperatures to change significantly, and this would have smoothed out variations caused by daily temperature cycles. This smoothing effect has been observed in large turtles and [[crocodilian]]s, but ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', which weighed about {{convert|700|kg|lb}}, may have been the smallest dinosaur in which it would have been effective.

In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge [[herbivorous]] [[sauropod]]s may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author=Paul, G.S. | chapter=Cope's rule | page=211\n| title=Morrison Symposium Proceedings: A Special Issue Of The Journal Modern Geology\n| editor=Carpenter, K. |editor2=Fraser, N. |editor3=Chure, D. |editor4=Kirkland, J.I.\n| publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=1998 | isbn=978-90-5699-183-8\n| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=CLEPeg_SjTcC&dq=sprawling+limbs+efficient | accessdate=2008-09-12\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Metabolic options ===\nThe main possibilities are that:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Dinosaurs were cold-blooded, like modern reptiles, except that the large size of many would have stabilized their body temperatures.\n* They were warm-blooded, more like modern mammals or birds than modern reptiles.\n* They were neither cold-blooded nor warm-blooded in modern terms, but had metabolisms that were different from and in some ways intermediate between those of modern cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.\n* They included animals with two or three of these types of metabolism.\n\nDinosaurs were around for about 150 million years, so it is very likely that different groups evolved different metabolisms and thermoregulatory regimes, and that some developed different physiologies from the first dinosaurs.\n\nIf all or some dinosaurs had intermediate metabolisms, they may have had the following features:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Low resting metabolic rates\u2014which would reduce the amount of food they needed and allow them to use more of that food for growth than do animals with high resting metabolic rates.\n* Inertial homeothermy\n* The ability to control heat loss by expanding and contracting blood vessels just under the skin, as many modern reptiles do.\n* Two-part circulations driven by four-chambered hearts.\n* High [[aerobic capacity]], allowing sustained activity.\nRobert Reid has suggested that such animals could be regarded as \"failed endotherms\". He envisaged both dinosaurs and the Triassic ancestors of mammals passing through a stage with these features. Mammals were forced to become smaller as [[archosaur]]s came to dominate [[ecological niche]]s for medium to large animals. Their decreasing size made them more vulnerable to heat loss because it increased their ratios of surface area to mass, and thus forced them to increase internal heat generation and thus become full endotherms. On the other hand, dinosaurs became medium to very large animals and thus were able to retain the \"intermediate\" type of metabolism.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\n=== Bone structure ===\nArmand de Ricql\u00e8s discovered [[Haversian canals]] in dinosaur bones, and argued that there was evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs. These canals are common in \"warm-blooded\" animals and are associated with fast growth and an active life style because they help to recycle bone to facilitate rapid growth and repair damage caused by stress or injuries.<ref>Ricqles, A. J. de. (1974). ''Evolution of endothermy: histological evidence''. Evolutionary Theory 1: 51\u201380</ref> Dense secondary Haversian bone, which is formed during remodeling, is found in many living endotherms as well as dinosaurs, pterosaurs and therapsids. Secondary Haversian canals are correlated with size and age, mechanical stress and nutrient turnover.

This system is responsible for replacing old bone with new bone, thereby repairing microbreaks that occur naturally during locomotion.  Without this repair, microbreaks would build up, leading to [[stress fractures]] and ultimately catastrophic bone failure. The size of the nutrient foramen provides an index of blood flow through it, according to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]].  The size is also related to the body size of animal, of course, so this effect is removed by analysis of [[allometry]].  Blood flow index of the nutrient foramen of the femurs in living mammals increases in direct proportion to the animals' maximum metabolic rates, as measured during maximum sustained locomotion.  Mammalian blood flow index is about 10 times greater than in [[ectotherm]]ic reptiles.  Ten species of fossil dinosaurs from five taxonomic groups reveal indices even higher than in mammals, when body size is accounted for, indicating that they were highly active, aerobic animals.  Thus high blood flow rate, high blood pressure, a four-chambered heart and sustained aerobic metabolism are all consistent with [[endotherm]]y.\n\n=== Growth rates ===\nDinosaurs grew from small eggs to several tons in weight relatively quickly.

Bakker obtained his numbers by counting museum specimens, but these have a bias towards rare or especially well-preserved specimens, and do not represent what exists in fossil beds. Even fossil beds may not accurately represent the actual populations, for example smaller and younger animals have less robust bones and are therefore less likely to be preserved.\n* There are no published predator\u2013prey ratios for large ectothermic predators, because such predators are very rare and mostly occur only on fairly small islands. Large ectothermic herbivores are equally rare. So Bakker was forced to compare mammalian predator\u2013prey ratios with those of fish and invertebrate communities, where life expectancies are much shorter and other differences also distort the comparison.\n* The concept assumes that predator populations are limited only by the availability of prey. However other factors such as shortage of nesting sites, cannibalism or predation of one predator on another can hold predator populations below the limit imposed by prey biomass, and this would misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio.\n* Ecological factors can misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio, for example: a predator might prey on only some of the \"prey\" species present;  disease, parasites and starvation might kill some of the prey animals before the predators get a chance to hunt them.\n* It is very difficult to state precisely what preys on what. For example, the young of herbivores may be preyed upon by lizards and snakes while the adults are preyed on by mammals. Conversely the young of many predators live largely on invertebrates and switch to vertebrates as they grow.\n\n=== Posture and gait ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|right | 300px | Hip joints and limb postures.]]\nDinosaurs' limbs were erect and held under their bodies, rather than sprawling out to the sides like those of lizards and newts. The evidence for this is the angles of the joint surfaces and the locations of muscle and tendon attachments on the bones. Attempts to represent dinosaurs with sprawling limbs result in creatures with dislocated hips, knees, shoulders and elbows.<ref>This was recognized not later than 1909: {{cite web|title=Dr. Holland and the Sprawling Sauropods |url=http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612180650/http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |archivedate=12 June 2011 }} The arguments and many of the images are also presented in {{cite book |title=Hot Blooded Dinosaurs |last=Desmond |first=A. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |publisher=DoubleDay |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-385-27063-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Carrier's constraint]] states that air-breathing vertebrates with two lungs that flex their bodies sideways during locomotion find it difficult to move and breathe at the same time. This severely limits stamina, and forces them to spend more time resting than moving.<ref name=\"Carrier1987LocomotorStaminaInTetrapods\" />\n\nSprawling limbs require sideways flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, which are very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that spend most of their time resting on their bellies and only move for a few seconds at a time\u2014because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of getting up and lying down.\n\nErect limbs increase the costs of getting up and lying down, but avoid Carrier's constraint. This indicates that dinosaurs were active animals because [[natural selection]] would have favored the retention of sprawling limbs if dinosaurs had been sluggish and spent most of their waking time resting. An active lifestyle requires a metabolism that quickly regenerates energy supplies and breaks down waste products which cause fatigue, i.e., it requires a fairly fast metabolism and a considerable degree of homeothermy.\n\nAdditionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, the result of a rapidly functioning neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.251.</ref> Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained running, characteristic of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy to stave off the onset of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.252.</ref>\n\nBakker and Ostrom both pointed out that all dinosaurs had erect hindlimbs and that all quadrupedal dinosaurs had erect forelimbs; and that among living animals only the endothermic (\"warm-blooded\") mammals and birds have erect limbs (Ostrom acknowledged that [[crocodilian]]s' occasional \"high walk\" was a partial exception).

The encephalization quotient (EQ) of dinosaurs, a measure of brain size calculated using brain endocasts, varies on a spectrum from bird-like to reptile-like. Using EQ alone, coelosaurs appear to have been as active as living mammals, while theropods and ornithopods fall somewhere between mammals and reptiles, and other dinosaurs resemble reptiles.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.255\"/>\n\nA study published by Roger Seymour in 2013 added more support to the idea that dinosaurs were endothermic.

Non-crocodilian reptiles have three-chambered hearts, which are less efficient because they allow oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood to mix and therefore send some de-oxygenated blood out to the body instead of to the lungs. Modern crocodilians' hearts are four-chambered, but are smaller relative to body size and run at lower pressure than those of modern mammals and birds.

These features include:\n* Jaws that only slightly opened and closed so that all the teeth met at the same time\n* Large abdomens that could accommodate large amounts of vegetation and store it for the long time it takes to digest vegetation\n* Guts that likely contained [[Endosymbiotic]] micro-organisms that digest [[cellulose]], as no known animal can digest this tough material directly<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\n[[Sauropod]]s, which were herbivores, did not chew their food, as their teeth and jaws appear suitable only for stripping leaves off plants. [[Ornithischian]]s, also herbivores, show a variety of approaches. The armored [[ankylosaur]]s and [[stegosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, and are thought to have fed in much the same way as sauropods. The [[pachycephalosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, but their lack of large digestive systems suggests a different diet, possibly fruits, seeds, or young shoots, which would have been more nutritious to them than leaves.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nOn the other hand, [[ornithopod]]s such as ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'', ''[[Iguanodon]]'' and various [[hadrosaur]]s had horny beaks for snipping off vegetation and jaws and teeth that were well-adapted for chewing. The horned [[ceratopsian]]s had similar mechanisms.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nIt has often been suggested that at least some dinosaurs used swallowed stones, known as [[gastrolith]]s, to aid digestion by grinding their food in muscular [[gizzard]]s, and that this was a feature they shared with birds. In 2007 Oliver Wings reviewed references to gastroliths in scientific literature and found considerable confusion, starting with the lack of an agreed and objective definition of \"gastrolith\". He found that swallowed hard stones or grit can assist digestion in birds that mainly feed on grain but may not be essential\u2014and that birds that eat insects in summer and grain in winter usually get rid of the stones and grit in summer. Gastroliths have often been described as important for [[sauropod]] dinosaurs, whose diet of vegetation required very thorough digestion, but Wings concluded that this idea was incorrect: gastroliths are found with only a small percentage of sauropod fossils; where they have been found, the amounts are too small and in many cases the stones are too soft to have been effective in grinding food; most of these gastroliths are highly polished, but gastroliths used by modern animals to grind food are roughened by wear and corroded by stomach acids; hence the sauropod gastroliths were probably swallowed accidentally. On the other hand, he concluded that gastroliths found with fossils of advanced [[theropod]] dinosaurs such as ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'' and ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' resemble those of birds, and that the use of gastroliths for grinding food may have appeared early in the group of dinosaurs from which these dinosaurs and birds both evolved.<ref name=\"Wings2007ReviewOfGastrolithFunction\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wings, O. | year=2007\n| title=A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification\n| journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume=52 | issue=1 |pages=1\u201316\n| url=http://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-001.pdf | accessdate=2008-09-10\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WingsSander2007NoGastricMillInSauropods\">{{cite journal\n|author1=Wings, O. |author2=Sander.

But this does not imply that ornithischians could not have had metabolic rates comparable to those of mammals, since mammals also do not have air sacs.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nThree explanations have been suggested for the development of air sacs in dinosaurs:<ref name=\"SerenoMartinezEtAl2008AvianIntrathoracicAirSacsInNewPredatoryDinosaur\" />\n* Increase in respiratory capacity. This is probably the most common hypothesis, and fits well with the idea that many dinosaurs had fairly high [[metabolic rate]]s.\n* Improving balance and maneuvrability by lowering the [[center of gravity]] and reducing [[rotational inertia]]. However this does not explain the expansion of air sacs in the quadrupedal sauropods.\n* As a cooling mechanism. It seems that air sacs and feathers evolved at about the same time in [[coelurosaur]]s. If feathers retained heat, their owners would have required a means of dissipating excess heat. This idea is plausible but needs further empirical support.\n\nCalculations of the volumes of various parts of the sauropod ''Apatosaurus''' respiratory system support the evidence of bird-like air sacs in sauropods:\n* Assuming that ''Apatosaurus'', like dinosaurs' nearest surviving relatives [[crocodilia]]ns and birds, did not have a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] of a 30-ton specimen would be about 184 liters. This is the total volume of the mouth, trachea and air tubes. If the animal exhales less than this, stale air is not expelled and is sucked back into the lungs on the following inhalation.\n* Estimates of its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]]&nbsp;\u2013 the amount of air moved into or out of the lungs in a single breath&nbsp;\u2013 depend on the type of [[respiratory system]] the animal had: 904&nbsp;liters if avian; 225&nbsp;liters if mammalian; 19&nbsp;liters if reptilian.\nOn this basis, ''Apatosaurus'' could not have had a reptilian respiratory system, as its tidal volume would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;184&nbsp;=&nbsp;41&nbsp;liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath.

In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge [[herbivorous]] [[sauropod]]s may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author=Paul, G.S. | chapter=Cope's rule | page=211\n| title=Morrison Symposium Proceedings: A Special Issue Of The Journal Modern Geology\n| editor=Carpenter, K. |editor2=Fraser, N. |editor3=Chure, D. |editor4=Kirkland, J.I.\n| publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=1998 | isbn=978-90-5699-183-8\n| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=CLEPeg_SjTcC&dq=sprawling+limbs+efficient | accessdate=2008-09-12\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Metabolic options ===\nThe main possibilities are that:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Dinosaurs were cold-blooded, like modern reptiles, except that the large size of many would have stabilized their body temperatures.\n* They were warm-blooded, more like modern mammals or birds than modern reptiles.\n* They were neither cold-blooded nor warm-blooded in modern terms, but had metabolisms that were different from and in some ways intermediate between those of modern cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.\n* They included animals with two or three of these types of metabolism.\n\nDinosaurs were around for about 150 million years, so it is very likely that different groups evolved different metabolisms and thermoregulatory regimes, and that some developed different physiologies from the first dinosaurs.\n\nIf all or some dinosaurs had intermediate metabolisms, they may have had the following features:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Low resting metabolic rates\u2014which would reduce the amount of food they needed and allow them to use more of that food for growth than do animals with high resting metabolic rates.\n* Inertial homeothermy\n* The ability to control heat loss by expanding and contracting blood vessels just under the skin, as many modern reptiles do.\n* Two-part circulations driven by four-chambered hearts.\n* High [[aerobic capacity]], allowing sustained activity.\nRobert Reid has suggested that such animals could be regarded as \"failed endotherms\". He envisaged both dinosaurs and the Triassic ancestors of mammals passing through a stage with these features. Mammals were forced to become smaller as [[archosaur]]s came to dominate [[ecological niche]]s for medium to large animals. Their decreasing size made them more vulnerable to heat loss because it increased their ratios of surface area to mass, and thus forced them to increase internal heat generation and thus become full endotherms. On the other hand, dinosaurs became medium to very large animals and thus were able to retain the \"intermediate\" type of metabolism.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\n=== Bone structure ===\nArmand de Ricql\u00e8s discovered [[Haversian canals]] in dinosaur bones, and argued that there was evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs.

This system is responsible for replacing old bone with new bone, thereby repairing microbreaks that occur naturally during locomotion.  Without this repair, microbreaks would build up, leading to [[stress fractures]] and ultimately catastrophic bone failure. The size of the nutrient foramen provides an index of blood flow through it, according to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]].  The size is also related to the body size of animal, of course, so this effect is removed by analysis of [[allometry]].  Blood flow index of the nutrient foramen of the femurs in living mammals increases in direct proportion to the animals' maximum metabolic rates, as measured during maximum sustained locomotion.  Mammalian blood flow index is about 10 times greater than in [[ectotherm]]ic reptiles.  Ten species of fossil dinosaurs from five taxonomic groups reveal indices even higher than in mammals, when body size is accounted for, indicating that they were highly active, aerobic animals.  Thus high blood flow rate, high blood pressure, a four-chambered heart and sustained aerobic metabolism are all consistent with [[endotherm]]y.\n\n=== Growth rates ===\nDinosaurs grew from small eggs to several tons in weight relatively quickly.

Bakker obtained his numbers by counting museum specimens, but these have a bias towards rare or especially well-preserved specimens, and do not represent what exists in fossil beds. Even fossil beds may not accurately represent the actual populations, for example smaller and younger animals have less robust bones and are therefore less likely to be preserved.\n* There are no published predator\u2013prey ratios for large ectothermic predators, because such predators are very rare and mostly occur only on fairly small islands. Large ectothermic herbivores are equally rare. So Bakker was forced to compare mammalian predator\u2013prey ratios with those of fish and invertebrate communities, where life expectancies are much shorter and other differences also distort the comparison.\n* The concept assumes that predator populations are limited only by the availability of prey. However other factors such as shortage of nesting sites, cannibalism or predation of one predator on another can hold predator populations below the limit imposed by prey biomass, and this would misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio.\n* Ecological factors can misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio, for example: a predator might prey on only some of the \"prey\" species present;  disease, parasites and starvation might kill some of the prey animals before the predators get a chance to hunt them.\n* It is very difficult to state precisely what preys on what. For example, the young of herbivores may be preyed upon by lizards and snakes while the adults are preyed on by mammals. Conversely the young of many predators live largely on invertebrates and switch to vertebrates as they grow.\n\n=== Posture and gait ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|right | 300px | Hip joints and limb postures.]]\nDinosaurs' limbs were erect and held under their bodies, rather than sprawling out to the sides like those of lizards and newts. The evidence for this is the angles of the joint surfaces and the locations of muscle and tendon attachments on the bones. Attempts to represent dinosaurs with sprawling limbs result in creatures with dislocated hips, knees, shoulders and elbows.<ref>This was recognized not later than 1909: {{cite web|title=Dr. Holland and the Sprawling Sauropods |url=http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612180650/http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |archivedate=12 June 2011 }} The arguments and many of the images are also presented in {{cite book |title=Hot Blooded Dinosaurs |last=Desmond |first=A. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |publisher=DoubleDay |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-385-27063-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Carrier's constraint]] states that air-breathing vertebrates with two lungs that flex their bodies sideways during locomotion find it difficult to move and breathe at the same time. This severely limits stamina, and forces them to spend more time resting than moving.<ref name=\"Carrier1987LocomotorStaminaInTetrapods\" />\n\nSprawling limbs require sideways flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, which are very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that spend most of their time resting on their bellies and only move for a few seconds at a time\u2014because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of getting up and lying down.\n\nErect limbs increase the costs of getting up and lying down, but avoid Carrier's constraint. This indicates that dinosaurs were active animals because [[natural selection]] would have favored the retention of sprawling limbs if dinosaurs had been sluggish and spent most of their waking time resting. An active lifestyle requires a metabolism that quickly regenerates energy supplies and breaks down waste products which cause fatigue, i.e., it requires a fairly fast metabolism and a considerable degree of homeothermy.\n\nAdditionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, the result of a rapidly functioning neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered.

In living birds and mammals, water loss is limited by pulling moisture out of exhaled air with mucous-covered respiratory turbinates, tissue-covered bony sheets in the nasal cavity. Several dinosaurs have olfactory turbinates, used for smell, but none have yet been identified with respiratory turbinates.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.255\">Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.255.</ref>\n\nBecause endothermy allows refined neuromuscular control, and because brain matter requires large amounts of energy to sustain, some speculate that increased brain size indicates increased activity and, thus, endothermy. The encephalization quotient (EQ) of dinosaurs, a measure of brain size calculated using brain endocasts, varies on a spectrum from bird-like to reptile-like. Using EQ alone, coelosaurs appear to have been as active as living mammals, while theropods and ornithopods fall somewhere between mammals and reptiles, and other dinosaurs resemble reptiles.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.255\"/>\n\nA study published by Roger Seymour in 2013 added more support to the idea that dinosaurs were endothermic. After studying saltwater crocodiles, Seymour found that even if their large sizes could provide stable and high body temperatures, during activity the crocodile's ectothermic metabolism provided less aerobic abilities and generate only 14% of the total muscle power of a similar sized endothermic mammal before full fatigue.

Non-crocodilian reptiles have three-chambered hearts, which are less efficient because they allow oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood to mix and therefore send some de-oxygenated blood out to the body instead of to the lungs. Modern crocodilians' hearts are four-chambered, but are smaller relative to body size and run at lower pressure than those of modern mammals and birds. They also have a bypass that makes them functionally three-chambered when under water, conserving oxygen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s167223.htm |title=Secret of the crocodile heart }}</ref>\n* a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], which aids breathing.\n* a [[secondary palate]], which allows the animal to eat and breathe at the same time.\n* a [[Lung#Reptilian lungs|hepatic piston]] mechanism for pumping the lungs.

The bones, jars, shells, and other artifacts and fossils were found in the Bolobok Rock Shelter Cave Archaeological Site, which has been declared as an Important Cultural Treasure by the government in 2017.<ref>http://www.ironwulf.net/2009/03/19/tawi-tawi-balobok-rock-shelter/</ref>\n\nMuch of the Bongao area was the center of [[Bajau]] culture and arts for hundreds of years. By the 14th century, [[Muslim]] missionaries from Arabia arrived and established the first ever [[mosque]] in the Philippines. The area was heavily converted to Islam, especially when the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] in nearby Sulu province was founded.\n\nThe province of Tawi-tawi was never officially controlled directly by the Spanish as the Sultanate of Sulu was in a perpetual war with Spain, resulting to the preservation of its Muslim and Bajau cultures. However, the sultanate waned and was captured by Spain, only to be handed to American forces after a few years. [[Sibutu]] remained under Spanish rule until 1900.\n\nBefore the [[Moro insurgency in the Philippines|armed rebellion of the MNLF in the early 1970s]], Bongao was merely a backwater village ruled by the prominent noble Halun family, who used to own about three-quarters of the island. The capital of the province was ''Batu-Batu'' (in [[Panglima Sugala]]) in the mainland situated in a cove with deep waters suited for anchors of the [[Philippine Navy]]. At the height of the armed rebellion and fearing that the provincial capitol might be overrun, the government transferred it to Bongao. The white-washed, [[Taj Mahal]]-inspired provincial capitol building is located on a hill overlooking the bay and the whole town to the North of the Island against the backdrop of Mount Kabugan and the famous [[Bud Bongao]] (Bongao Peak).\n\nThe transfer of the seat of government ushered the rapid development of the island as the southernmost center of commerce and trade. Suddenly, the population swelled as individuals (and their families) who are in government service moved to the town.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bongao\n| 1903 = 1854\n| 1918 = 3486\n| 1939 = 4510\n| 1948 = 5626\n| 1960 = 10822\n| 1970 = 20983\n| 1975 = 20560\n| 1980 = 27884\n| 1990 = 37932\n| 1995 = 46672\n| 2000 = 58174\n| 2007 = 95055\n| 2010 = 79362\n| 2015 = 100527\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n[[File:US Navy 060614-N-6501M-015 The U.S. Military Sealift Command (MSC) Hospital Ship USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) is anchored off of the coast of Tawi Tawi.jpg|thumb|Bongao poblacion]]\n\n==Culture==\nToday, Bongao is a minuscule cosmopolitan site that is becoming a model of multicultural society.

The bones, jars, shells, and other artifacts and fossils were found in the Bolobok Rock Shelter Cave Archaeological Site, which has been declared as an Important Cultural Treasure by the government in 2017.<ref>http://www.ironwulf.net/2009/03/19/tawi-tawi-balobok-rock-shelter/</ref>\n\nMuch of the Bongao area was the center of [[Bajau]] culture and arts for hundreds of years. By the 14th century, [[Muslim]] missionaries from Arabia arrived and established the first ever [[mosque]] in the Philippines. The area was heavily converted to Islam, especially when the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] in nearby Sulu province was founded.\n\nThe province of Tawi-tawi was never officially controlled directly by the Spanish as the Sultanate of Sulu was in a perpetual war with Spain, resulting to the preservation of its Muslim and Bajau cultures. However, the sultanate waned and was captured by Spain, only to be handed to American forces after a few years. [[Sibutu]] remained under Spanish rule until 1900.\n\nBefore the [[Moro insurgency in the Philippines|armed rebellion of the MNLF in the early 1970s]], Bongao was merely a backwater village ruled by the prominent noble Halun family, who used to own about three-quarters of the island. The capital of the province was ''Batu-Batu'' (in [[Panglima Sugala]]) in the mainland situated in a cove with deep waters suited for anchors of the [[Philippine Navy]]. At the height of the armed rebellion and fearing that the provincial capitol might be overrun, the government transferred it to Bongao. The white-washed, [[Taj Mahal]]-inspired provincial capitol building is located on a hill overlooking the bay and the whole town to the North of the Island against the backdrop of Mount Kabugan and the famous [[Bud Bongao]] (Bongao Peak).\n\nThe transfer of the seat of government ushered the rapid development of the island as the southernmost center of commerce and trade. Suddenly, the population swelled as individuals (and their families) who are in government service moved to the town.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bongao\n| 1903 = 1854\n| 1918 = 3486\n| 1939 = 4510\n| 1948 = 5626\n| 1960 = 10822\n| 1970 = 20983\n| 1975 = 20560\n| 1980 = 27884\n| 1990 = 37932\n| 1995 = 46672\n| 2000 = 58174\n| 2007 = 95055\n| 2010 = 79362\n| 2015 = 100527\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n[[File:US Navy 060614-N-6501M-015 The U.S. Military Sealift Command (MSC) Hospital Ship USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) is anchored off of the coast of Tawi Tawi.jpg|thumb|Bongao poblacion]]\n\n==Culture==\nToday, Bongao is a minuscule cosmopolitan site that is becoming a model of multicultural society.

She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research.

She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819.

(2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref> \n\nThe biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>\n\nIn 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299\u2013301</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and later life===\n[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\nIn 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> \n\nWilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839\u201340. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95\u20136</ref> \n\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\n===Death===\nThroughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> \n\nOn 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348\u2013349</ref>\n\n== Compositions ==\n{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] \nFanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2\u20133</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied f\u00fcr Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829\u201330, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833\u201334.

She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93\u20134</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542\u2013544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\nShe also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary.

Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>\n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Museum===\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]].

She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  \n\nThe [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n==Life==\n=== Early life and education ===\n[[File:Fannymendelssohn-improved.jpg|thumb|upright|Fanny Mendelssohn, sketched in 1829 by her future husband [[Wilhelm Hensel]]]]Mendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including her brother Felix Mendelssohn born four years after her.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, n\u00e9e Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3\u20135</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]]. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny C\u00e4cilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy.<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629</ref><ref>Citron (1994), p. 322</ref> Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy' with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of  \"Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987, p. 66</ref>\n\nWhile growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,<ref>Forney (2015), p. 278</ref> Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]], which was led by Zelter at the time.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \"She plays like a man.\"<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]], were equally impressed by both siblings.<ref>Conway (2011), p. 169</ref><ref>Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179</ref>\n\n=== Gender and class limitations ===\nIn the words of the music historian Kristine Forney, at this period \"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\".<ref>Forney et al. (2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref> \n\nThe biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref>Citron (2004), p. 51</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>\n\nIn 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299\u2013301</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and later life===\n[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=Citron0451 >Citron (2004), p. 51</ref>\n\nIn 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> \n\nWilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=Citron0451 /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839\u201340. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95\u20136</ref> \n\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=Citron0451 />\n\n===Death===\nThroughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> \n\nOn 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348\u2013349</ref>\n\n== Compositions ==\n{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] \nFanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2\u20133</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied f\u00fcr Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829\u201330, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833\u201334. Fanny's sets of ''Lieder f\u00fcr Klavier'' were written in the period 1836\u20131837, at about the same time as Felix's set Op. 38.<ref name=Mace118>Mace (2013) p. 118</ref><ref>Song (2016), pp. 5\u20137</ref>\n\n[[File:IMSLP99178-PMLP194743-Hensel Fanny Sechs Lieder fuer eine Stimme mit Begleitung des Pianoforte Op 1 Bote 1046 1846 p 1pdf.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Title page of first edition of Fanny Hensel's Op. 1, 1846]]The majority of Fanny Mendelssohn's compositions are limited to lieder and piano pieces as she felt her abilities did not extend to larger, more intricate compositions. She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93\u20134</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542\u2013544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\nShe also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Style and form ===\n[[File:Julius Eduard Wilhelm Helfft - The Music Room of Fanny Hensel (nee Mendelssohn) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Hensel's music room in the Hensel house, Leipziger Str. 3, Berlin]] Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Fanny Hensel's authorship of the ''Easter Sonata'', considers that Fanny was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \"harmonic density\" that serves to express emotion.<ref>Mace (2013) p. 10</ref> \n\nR. Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>\n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Museum===\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]].

Supporting actors include [[Mo'Nique]], [[Loni Love]], [[K.D. Aubert]], [[D.L. Hughley]], [[Godfrey (comedian)|Godfrey]] and [[Sof\u00eda Vergara|Sofia Vergara]]. The film revolves around multiple characters in different scenarios on-board an airplane. ''Soul Plane'' garnered negative reviews from critics and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $14 million worldwide against a $16 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nNashawn Wade ([[Kevin Hart (actor)|Kevin Hart]]) claims that he has loved planes since he was a baby, but he has a horrible experience with a typical [[airline]]: his dog Dre was classified as a [[checked baggage]] instead of a [[Hand luggage|carry-on]], he eats a horrible [[airline meal]], his buttocks gets stuck in the toilet while he has [[diarrhea]] (due to his meal) during turbulence, and Dre is sucked and killed through a jet engine to his death (after a stewardess accidentally opens the cargo door). Nashawn is taken away after an emergency landing with an ice cube on his buttocks to cool it off from turbulence. In response to the torture he has, he sues the airline and is awarded $100,000,000 by the jury. He decides to use the money to start his own airline, called N.W.A. (Nashawn Wade Airlines), whose acronym and logo are a pop culture reference to rap group [[N.W.A]]. The airline specifically caters to African Americans and hip hop culture.  The [[Airport terminal|terminal]] at the airport is called the [[Malcolm X]] terminal, where two non-working [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] Agents, Jamiqua ([[Mo'Nique]]) and Shaniece ([[Loni Love]]), are goofing off instead of checking belongings. The plane is a heavily modified [[Boeing 747SP]], customized with low-rider [[hydraulics]], [[Spinner (wheel)|spinners]], [[Wingtip device|blended winglets]] to compensate for the drag from the decorations, and a dance club. The [[Pre-flight safety demonstration|safety video]] is also a parody of the [[Destiny's Child]] song \"[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]\".\n\nAfter taking off from [[Los Angeles International Airport]], Nashawn must deal with a multitude of problems, starting with his [[Acrophobia|acrophobic]] captain, Captain Mack ([[Snoop Dogg]]). At a cruising altitude of Flight Level 330, it is revealed that he has never left the ground because he learned to fly on computer simulators in prison. Meanwhile, his cousin Muggsey ([[Method Man]]) sets up a miniature casino and strip joint in one of the areas of the plane (as seen in the workprint and unrated versions of the film), and Nashawn's ex-girlfriend is on board and less than happy to see him. Meanwhile, the Hunkee family, the only caucasian passengers on board, must also deal with their own problems; Elvis Hunkee's ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) daughter is turning 18 and plans to use her newfound freedom by drinking and having sex, his son has transformed from an exact duplicate of him to a stereotypical [[wigger]], and his wife has found a new interest in black men after viewing pictures in a pornographic magazine.\n\nCaptain Mack seemingly dies after eating mushrooms that the co-pilot, First Officer Gaemon ([[Godfrey (comedian)|Godfrey]]), uses to soothe his [[Crab louse|genital crabs]]. Nashawn attempts to contact Gaemon, who is incapacitated after slipping near a hot tub, forcing Nashawn to attempt to land the plane himself. Nashawn lands the plane safely, using the airplane stewardess' ([[Sof\u00eda Vergara]]) flight knowledge which she learned while having sex in the cockpit with the pilot on another plane. The plane lands in the middle of [[Central Park]] instead of [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], and the spinners are stolen from the plane. Nashawn reconciles with his ex-girlfriend after earlier revealing to her that he only broke up with her so she would not give up her college opportunities for him.\n\nThe movie ends with Nashawn telling the audience the fate of his crew. He claims that he and his ex-girlfriend are back together taking their relationship slow this time around, his cousin Muggsey has started a strip club and gambling casino located in another airplane similar to the club in Nashawn's plane, Elvis Hunkee has begun a sexual relationship with one of the abrasive airline security guards ([[Mo'Nique]]), and Elvis Hunkee's son has become a major music video director but has disappeared shortly after filming a [[Michael Jackson]] video.

That's a bad idea to begin with: like ''Scary Movie'', parodies of a parody are on to a loser from the start.
