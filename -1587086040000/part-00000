It was published by [[Frederick Warne & Co]]. in July 1906. Jeremy's origin lies in a letter she wrote to a child in 1893. She revised it in 1906, and moved its setting from the [[River Tay]] to the English [[Lake District]]. The tale reflects her love for the Lake District and her admiration for children's illustrator [[Randolph Caldecott]].\n\nJeremy Fisher is a frog that lives in a \"slippy-sloppy\" house at the edge of a pond. During one rainy day, he collects worms for fishing and sets off across the pond on his lily-pad boat. He plans to invite his friends for dinner if he catches more than five minnows. He encounters all sorts of setbacks to his goal, and  escapes a large trout who tries to swallow him. He swims for shore, decides he will not go fishing again, and hops home.\n\nPotter's tale pays homage to the leisurely summers her father and his companions passed sport fishing at rented country estates in Scotland. Following the tale's publication, a child fan wrote to Potter suggesting Jeremy find a wife. Potter responded with a series of miniature letters on the theme as if from Jeremy and his pals. After Potter's death in 1943, licences were issued to various firms to produce the Potter characters. Jeremy and his friends were released as porcelain figurines, [[plush]] toys, and other merchandise.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Image:Mr jeremy fisher stickleback.jpg|thumb|left|Mr Jeremy Fisher and the Stickleback.]]\nJeremy Fisher is a [[frog]] that lives in a damp little house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond. His larder and back passage are \"slippy-sloppy\" with water, but he likes getting his feet wet; no one ever scolds and he never catches cold. One day, Jeremy finds it raining and decides to go fishing. Should he catch more than five [[minnow]]s, he would invite his friends to dinner. He puts on a [[mackintosh]] and shiny [[galoshes]], takes his rod and basket, and sets off with \"enormous hops\" to the place where he keeps his lily-pad boat. He poles to a place he knows is good for minnows.\n\nOnce there, the frog sits cross-legged on his lily-pad and arranges his tackle. He has \"the dearest little red float\". His rod is a stalk of grass and his line a horsehair. An hour passes without a nibble. He takes a break and lunches on a [[butterfly]] sandwich. A [[water beetle]] tweaks his toe, causing him to withdraw his legs, and [[rats]] rustling about in the rushes force him to seek a safer location. He drops his line into the water and immediately has a bite, only for it to be little Jack Sharp, a [[three-spined stickleback|stickleback]]. Jeremy pricks his fingers on Jack's spines and Jack escapes. A shoal of little fishes come to the surface to laugh at Jeremy.\n\nJeremy sucks his sore fingers. A large [[trout]] seizes him with a snap (Mr. Jeremy screams, \"OW-OW-OW!!!\"). The trout dives to the bottom, but finds the mackintosh sour and spits Jeremy out, swallowing only his galoshes. Jeremy bounces \"up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle\", and swims to the pond's edge. He scrambles up the bank and hops home through the meadow, having lost his fishing equipment but quite sure he will never go fishing again.\n\nIn the last few pages, Jeremy has put [[sticking plaster]] on his fingers and welcomes his friends, Sir Isaac Newton, a [[newt]]; and [[Alderman]] Ptolemy Tortoise, a tortoise that eats [[salad]]. Jeremy has prepared roasted [[grasshopper]] with [[ladybird]] sauce. The narrator describes the dish as a \"frog treat\", but thinks \"it must have been nasty!\"<ref name=\"MacD96\">MacDonald 1986, p. 96</ref><ref>Potter 2002, pp. 6&ndash;57</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn addition to the pet frogs of Potter's youth,<ref name=\"Lane149\">Lane 1978, p. 149</ref> influences on ''Jeremy'' include Potter's sport fishing father Rupert William Potter and illustrator [[Randolph Caldecott]]. [[Margaret Lane]], author of ''The Magic Years of Beatrix Potter'', notes, \"Mr. Potter was fond of taking his friends fishing and Beatrix ... from an early age had been familiar with [the] hazards and excitements of angling and dry-fly fishing ... as a girl [she] had often enough had to endure her father and his friends relating their fishing adventures, and the picture of Mr Jeremy Fisher retailing his mishap to Sir Isaac Newton is so rich in observation, both of amphibians and elderly gentlemen, that one is ever afterwards prone to confuse them in memory\".<ref name=\"Lane149,152\">Lane 1978, pp. 149,152</ref> Mr. Potter not only fished for sport but collected the works of [[Randolph Caldecott]].<ref name=\"Lear47\">Lear 2007, p. 47</ref> In ''Jeremy Fisher'', Potter tried to copy Caldecott but felt she had failed. \"I did try to copy Caldecott,\" she stated, \"but ... I did not achieve much resemblance.\"<ref name=\"Tay129\">Taylor 1987, p. 129</ref> Biographer [[Linda Lear]] writes Potter declared, \"I have the greatest admiration for his work &ndash; a jealous appreciation; for I think that others, whose names are commonly bracketed with his, are not on the same plane at all as artist-illustrators\".<ref name=\"Lear47\" />\n\nPotter biographer [[Linda Lear]] and author of ''Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature'' writes: <blockquote>\n[Potter] wanted to do a frog story for some time, because it was amusing and offered the opportunity for the naturalist illustrations she delighted in&nbsp;... The story of a fisherman down on his luck reminded Beatrix of the 'fish stories' her father's friends had told in Scotland, as well as her brother's travails with rod and reel. She also recreated the gentlemen's club atmosphere absorbed from her father's reports of evenings spent at the [[Reform Club|Reform]] and the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum]]&nbsp;... The text and illustrations for this story are some of the most balanced and compatible of all her writing. Nature is described and illustrated truthfully: beautifully tranquil as well as unpredictably aggressive&nbsp;....Its carefully coloured botanical backgrounds of water plants, a frog with anatomically correct turned-out feet, a trout that any self-respecting fisherman would enjoy snagging, and a rather frighteningly rendered water-beetle who tweaks Jeremy's dainty toes, all made it a delight to look at as well as to read.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 212&ndash;3</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Kinnoull Hill and the River Tay - geograph.org.uk - 8703.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A river winds through the countryside|The [[River Tay]] (2004)]]\n\nThe origin of ''The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher'' lies in a story letter Potter wrote to a child in September 1893 while summering on the [[River Tay]].<ref name=\"Lear211&ndash;2\">Lear 2007, pp. 211&ndash;2</ref> The following year, she created nine sketches called \"A Frog he would a-fishing go\" and sold them to publisher Ernest Nister. They were released with verses by Clifton Bingham in 1896.<ref name=\"Tay126&ndash;7\"/><ref name=\"CC\">''Collecting Caldecott''</ref>\n\nEnergized by the success of ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' in 1902, Potter considered expanding the frog tale and bought back her drawings and the publisher's printer's blocks.<ref name=\"CC\"/> She wrote her editor [[Norman Warne]], \"I should like to do Mr. Jeremy Fisher&nbsp;... I think I can make something of him\".<ref name=\"Tay126&ndash;7\">Taylor 1987, pp. 126&ndash;7</ref><ref name=\"Tay80&ndash;1\">Taylor 1996, pp. 80&ndash;1</ref> The tale was set aside while Potter and Warne developed other projects, but in 1905 he approved the frog tale. As Potter biographer Daphne Kutzner writes of Potter's  illustrations for ''Jeremy'': \"When she finally did the illustrations for the book, she changed the original background from the River Tay in Scotland to Eswaithe Water in the Lakes. The illustrations are indeed lovely, showing Potter's skill both as a naturalist and a fantasist\".<ref name=\"Kut117\">Kutzer 2003, p. 117</ref>\n\nIn August 1905, Norman Warne died, and his brother Harold became Potter's editor. She wrote to him indicating Norman had approved the frog project: \"We had thought of doing&nbsp;... \"Mr. Jeremy Fisher\" to carry on the series of little [books]. I know some people don't like frogs! but I think I had convinced Norman that I could make it a really pretty book with a good many flowers & water plants for backgrounds\".<ref name=\"Tay111\">Taylor 1996, p. 111</ref> Warne decided to put ''Jeremy Fisher'' into print.<ref name=\"Tay106\">Taylor 1996, p. 106</ref>\n\nIn July 1906, 20,000 copies of ''The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher'' were released in paper boards at a [[\u00a3sd|shilling]] and in decorated cloth at one shilling six pence in a small format. Another 5,000 copies were published in September 1906 and another 5,000 in September 1907.<ref>Linder 1971, p. 426</ref> The book was dedicated to Stephanie Hyde Parker, the daughter of Potter's cousin Ethel, Lady Hyde Parker: \"For Stephanie from Cousin B\".<ref name=\"Lear211&ndash;3\">Lear 2007, pp. 211&ndash;3</ref> ''Jeremy'' sold as profitably as other Potter productions.<ref name=\"Lane152\">Lane 1978, p. 152</ref>\n\n==Themes and style ==\n[[File:Mr jeremy fisher fishing.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. Jeremy Fisher fishing.]]\nM. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh]] and author of ''Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code'', observes that the social positions of Jeremy and his friends are established through the clothing they wear.  Although Potter sharply critiqued the upper class elsewhere, Kutzer observes that in ''Jeremy Fisher'' her tone is more moderate. She suggests that Potter's relocation to [[Sawrey]] and Hill Top Farm may have produced in her a willingness \"to accept the silliness of the aspiring middle class as well as the eccentricities of the upper classes\".<ref name=\"Kut121\">Kutzer 2003, p. 121</ref>\n\nRuth K. MacDonald, Professor of English at [[New Mexico State University]] and author of ''Beatrix Potter'' points out that although Potter regarded the lives of her father and his friends as comical and even beneath notice, yet she clearly respected and valued their outdoor pursuits from the bemused treatment she accorded them in ''Jeremy Fisher''. She valued nature untouched by humans even more, MacDonald notes, as evidenced by the careful observation in the illustrations. ''Jeremy Fisher'' was written without the many revisions typical of Potter's other productions, and the pictures appear effortless in their execution. MacDonald writes, \"Her ability to show human society without also implying its damaging effects on flora and fauna further underscores the book's felicitous composition and success\".<ref>MacDonald 1986, p. 98</ref>\n\nLiterary scholar [[Humphrey Carpenter]] writes in ''Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children's Literature'' the basis for Potter's writing style can be found in the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible. ''Jeremy Fisher'' reflects the characteristic cadence and \"employs a psalm-like caesura in the middle of [a] sentence\".<ref>Carpenter, p. 143</ref>\n\nCarpenter sees in Potter's work thematic shifts from the early work onward. In the first stage of her work, he sees in stories such as ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' a type of Jack-the-Giant-Killer theme, in which a small creature confronts a large creature that he believes culminates in ''The Tale of Jeremy Fisher''. Potter places Jeremy Fisher in a dangerous world, according to Carpenter. The fishing experience is frightening: the bank-side creatures  worry him, the stickleback threatens him directly, and the trout tries to swallow him. But Potter makes the point that all creatures are prey, ending the story with Jeremy Fisher himself eating a grasshopper smothered in [[Coccinellidae|lady-bird sauce]].<ref>Carpenter, 145-147</ref>\n\n== Miniature letters ==\n\nAbout 1907 Potter created miniature letters delivered to child fans in either a miniature mail bag or a miniature mail box.  \"Some of the letters were very funny,\" Potter wrote, \"The defect was that inquiries and answers were all mixed up.\"<ref name=\"Linder72\">Linder 1971, p. 72</ref>\n\nFour ''Jeremy'' letters were written at about 1910 to Drew Fayle who thought Jeremy should marry. In one letter, Sir Isaac promises Master Fayle a piece of wedding cake should Jeremy marry and, in another letter, Ptolemy writes that Jeremy's parties \"would be much more agreeable if there were a lady to preside at the table.\" Jeremy writes in the third letter: \"When I bought my sprigged waistcoat & my maroon tail-coat I had hopes ... but I am alone ... if there were a 'Mrs. Jeremy Fisher' she might object to snails. It is some satisfaction to be able to have as much water & mud in the house as a person likes.\"\n\n[[The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle]], a hedgehog washerwoman in another Potter tale, writes Master Fayle in the fourth letter:<blockquote>Dear Master Drew,<br>\nIf you please Sir I am a widow; & I think it very wrong that there is not any Mrs. Fisher, but ''I'' would not marry Mr. Jeremy not for worlds, the way he does live in that house all slippy-sloppy; not any lady would stand it, & not a bit of good starching his cravats.<br>\n<center>Yr. obedient washerwoman,</center><center>Tiggy Winkle.<ref>Linder 1971, pp. 79&ndash;80</ref></center></blockquote>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Merchandise ==\n\nThe characters from ''Jeremy Fisher'' have appeared as porcelain figurines, plush toys, and other merchandise. In 1950, [[Beswick Pottery]] issued a porcelain figurine of Jeremy and figurines of Isaac and Ptolemy in the 1970s. Other figurines of Jeremy have been produced over the years as well as a Jeremy mug.<ref>DuBay 2006, pp. 30,35</ref> Jeremy was one of the first eight [[plush]] toys released by Eden Toys, Inc. of New York in 1973.

One day, Jeremy finds it raining and decides to go fishing. Should he catch more than five [[minnow]]s, he would invite his friends to dinner. He puts on a [[mackintosh]] and shiny [[galoshes]], takes his rod and basket, and sets off with \"enormous hops\" to the place where he keeps his lily-pad boat. He poles to a place he knows is good for minnows.\n\nOnce there, the frog sits cross-legged on his lily-pad and arranges his tackle. He has \"the dearest little red float\". His rod is a stalk of grass and his line a horsehair. An hour passes without a nibble. He takes a break and lunches on a butterfly sandwich. A water beetle tweaks his toe, causing him to withdraw his legs, and rats rustling about in the rushes force him to seek a safer location. He drops his line into the water and immediately has a bite. It is not a minnow but little Jack Sharp, a [[three-spined stickleback|stickleback]]. Jeremy pricks his fingers on Jack's spines and Jack escapes. A shoal of little fishes come to the surface to laugh at Jeremy.\n\nJeremy sucks his sore fingers. A [[trout]] rises from the water and seizes him with a snap (Mr. Jeremy screams, \"OW-OW-OW!!!\"). The trout dives to the bottom, but finds the mackintosh bad-tasting and spits Jeremy out, swallowing only his galoshes. Jeremy bounces \"up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle\", and swims to the pond's edge. He scrambles up the bank and hops home through the meadow, having lost his fishing equipment but quite sure he will never go fishing again.\n\nIn the last few pages, Jeremy has put [[sticking plaster]] on his fingers and welcomes his friends, Sir Isaac Newton, a newt; and [[Alderman]] Ptolemy Tortoise, a tortoise that eats salad.

I did not achieve much resemblance.\"<ref name=\"Tay129\">Taylor 1987, p. 129</ref> Biographer [[Linda Lear]] writes Potter declared, \"I have the greatest admiration for his work &ndash; a jealous appreciation; for I think that others, whose names are commonly bracketed with his, are not on the same plane at all as artist-illustrators\".<ref name=\"Lear47\" />\n\nPotter biographer [[Linda Lear]] and author of ''Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature'' writes: <blockquote>\n[Potter] wanted to do a frog story for some time, because it was amusing and offered the opportunity for the naturalist illustrations she delighted in&nbsp;... The story of a fisherman down on his luck reminded Beatrix of the 'fish stories' her father's friends had told in Scotland, as well as her brother's travails with rod and reel. She also recreated the gentlemen's club atmosphere absorbed from her father's reports of evenings spent at the [[Reform Club|Reform]] and the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum]]&nbsp;... The text and illustrations for this story are some of the most balanced and compatible of all her writing. Nature is described and illustrated truthfully: beautifully tranquil as well as unpredictably aggressive&nbsp;....Its carefully coloured botanical backgrounds of water plants, a frog with anatomically correct turned-out feet, a trout that any self-respecting fisherman would enjoy snagging, and a rather frighteningly rendered water-beetle who tweaks Jeremy's dainty toes, all made it a delight to look at as well as to read.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 212&ndash;3</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Kinnoull Hill and the River Tay - geograph.org.uk - 8703.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A river winds through the countryside|The [[River Tay]] (2004)]]\n\nThe origin of ''The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher'' lies in a story letter Potter wrote to a child in September 1893 while summering on the [[River Tay]].<ref name=\"Lear211&ndash;2\">Lear 2007, pp. 211&ndash;2</ref> The following year, she created nine sketches called \"A Frog he would a-fishing go\" and sold them to publisher Ernest Nister. They were released with verses by Clifton Bingham in 1896.<ref name=\"Tay126&ndash;7\"/><ref name=\"CC\">''Collecting Caldecott''</ref>\n\nEnergized by the success of ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' in 1902, Potter considered expanding the frog tale and bought back her drawings and the publisher's printer's blocks.<ref name=\"CC\"/> She wrote her editor [[Norman Warne]], \"I should like to do Mr. Jeremy Fisher&nbsp;... I think I can make something of him\".<ref name=\"Tay126&ndash;7\">Taylor 1987, pp. 126&ndash;7</ref><ref name=\"Tay80&ndash;1\">Taylor 1996, pp. 80&ndash;1</ref> The tale was set aside while Potter and Warne developed other projects, but in 1905 he approved the frog tale. As Potter biographer Daphne Kutzner writes of Potter's  illustrations for ''Jeremy'': \"When she finally did the illustrations for the book, she changed the original background from the River Tay in Scotland to Eswaithe Water in the Lakes. The illustrations are indeed lovely, showing Potter's skill both as a naturalist and a fantasist\".<ref name=\"Kut117\">Kutzer 2003, p. 117</ref>\n\nIn August 1905, Norman Warne died, and his brother Harold became Potter's editor. She wrote to him indicating Norman had approved the frog project: \"We had thought of doing&nbsp;... \"Mr. Jeremy Fisher\" to carry on the series of little [books]. I know some people don't like frogs! but I think I had convinced Norman that I could make it a really pretty book with a good many flowers & water plants for backgrounds\".<ref name=\"Tay111\">Taylor 1996, p. 111</ref> Warne decided to put ''Jeremy Fisher'' into print.<ref name=\"Tay106\">Taylor 1996, p. 106</ref>\n\nIn July 1906, 20,000 copies of ''The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher'' were released in paper boards at a [[\u00a3sd|shilling]] and in decorated cloth at one shilling six pence in a small format. Another 5,000 copies were published in September 1906 and another 5,000 in September 1907.<ref>Linder 1971, p. 426</ref> The book was dedicated to Stephanie Hyde Parker, the daughter of Potter's cousin Ethel, Lady Hyde Parker: \"For Stephanie from Cousin B\".<ref name=\"Lear211&ndash;3\">Lear 2007, pp. 211&ndash;3</ref> ''Jeremy'' sold as profitably as other Potter productions.<ref name=\"Lane152\">Lane 1978, p. 152</ref>\n\n==Themes and style ==\n[[File:Mr jeremy fisher fishing.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. Jeremy Fisher fishing.]]\nM. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh]] and author of ''Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code'', observes that the social positions of Jeremy and his friends are established through the clothing they wear.  Although Potter sharply critiqued the upper class elsewhere, Kutzer observes that in ''Jeremy Fisher'' her tone is more moderate. She suggests that Potter's relocation to [[Sawrey]] and Hill Top Farm may have produced in her a willingness \"to accept the silliness of the aspiring middle class as well as the eccentricities of the upper classes\".<ref name=\"Kut121\">Kutzer 2003, p. 121</ref>\n\nRuth K. MacDonald, Professor of English at [[New Mexico State University]] and author of ''Beatrix Potter'' points out that although Potter regarded the lives of her father and his friends as comical and even beneath notice, yet she clearly respected and valued their outdoor pursuits from the bemused treatment she accorded them in ''Jeremy Fisher''. She valued nature untouched by humans even more, MacDonald notes, as evidenced by the careful observation in the illustrations. ''Jeremy Fisher'' was written without the many revisions typical of Potter's other productions, and the pictures appear effortless in their execution. MacDonald writes, \"Her ability to show human society without also implying its damaging effects on flora and fauna further underscores the book's felicitous composition and success\".<ref>MacDonald 1986, p. 98</ref>\n\nLiterary scholar [[Humphrey Carpenter]] writes in ''Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children's Literature'' the basis for Potter's writing style can be found in the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible. ''Jeremy Fisher'' reflects the characteristic cadence and \"employs a psalm-like caesura in the middle of [a] sentence\".<ref>Carpenter, p. 143</ref>\n\nCarpenter sees in Potter's work thematic shifts from the early work onward. In the first stage of her work, he sees in stories such as ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' a type of Jack-the-Giant-Killer theme, in which a small creature confronts a large creature that he believes culminates in ''The Tale of Jeremy Fisher''. Potter places Jeremy Fisher in a dangerous world, according to Carpenter. The fishing experience is frightening: the bank-side creatures  worry him, the stickleback threatens him directly, and the trout tries to swallow him. But Potter makes the point that all creatures are prey, ending the story with Jeremy Fisher himself eating a grasshopper smothered in [[Coccinellidae|lady-bird sauce]].<ref>Carpenter, 145-147</ref>\n\n== Miniature letters ==\n\nAbout 1907 Potter created miniature letters delivered to child fans in either a miniature mail bag or a miniature mail box.  \"Some of the letters were very funny,\" Potter wrote, \"The defect was that inquiries and answers were all mixed up.\"<ref name=\"Linder72\">Linder 1971, p. 72</ref>\n\nFour ''Jeremy'' letters were written at about 1910 to Drew Fayle who thought Jeremy should marry. In one letter, Sir Isaac promises Master Fayle a piece of wedding cake should Jeremy marry and, in another letter, Ptolemy writes that Jeremy's parties \"would be much more agreeable if there were a lady to preside at the table.\" Jeremy writes in the third letter: \"When I bought my sprigged waistcoat & my maroon tail-coat I had hopes ... but I am alone ... if there were a 'Mrs. Jeremy Fisher' she might object to snails. It is some satisfaction to be able to have as much water & mud in the house as a person likes.\"\n\n[[The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle]], a hedgehog washerwoman in another Potter tale, writes Master Fayle in the fourth letter:<blockquote>Dear Master Drew,<br>\nIf you please Sir I am a widow; & I think it very wrong that there is not any Mrs. Fisher, but ''I'' would not marry Mr. Jeremy not for worlds, the way he does live in that house all slippy-sloppy; not any lady would stand it, & not a bit of good starching his cravats.<br>\n<center>Yr. obedient washerwoman,</center><center>Tiggy Winkle.<ref>Linder 1971, pp. 79&ndash;80</ref></center></blockquote>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Merchandise ==\n\nThe characters from ''Jeremy Fisher'' have appeared as porcelain figurines, plush toys, and other merchandise.

Other figurines of Jeremy have been produced over the years as well as a Jeremy mug.<ref>DuBay 2006, pp. 30,35</ref> Jeremy was one of the first eight [[plush]] toys released by Eden Toys, Inc. of New York in 1973.

Syme did not propose the sandwich idea and his paper did not mention waterproofing. Waterproofing garments with rubber was an old idea, and was practised in pre-Columbian times by Aztecs, who impregnated fabric with [[Natural rubber#Prehistoric uses|latex]]. Later, French scientists made balloons gas-tight (and incidentally, impermeable) by impregnating fabric with rubber dissolved in turpentine, but this solvent was not satisfactory for making apparel.\n\nIn 1830 Macintosh's company merged with the clothing company of [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in [[Manchester]]. Hancock had also been experimenting with rubber coated fabrics since 1819. Production of rubberised coats soon spread all over the UK.  Every kind of coat was produced with rubberized material including [[riding coat]]s and coats supplied to the British Army, British railways, and UK police forces.\n\nEarly coats had problems with smell, stiffness, and a tendency to melt in hot weather, but Hancock further improved his waterproof fabrics, patenting a method for [[sulfur vulcanisation|vulcanising]] rubber in 1843 which solved many of the problems.<ref name=\"bt\">[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/return-of-the-mac-28065280.html]</ref>\n\n[[File:Mackintosh-store.jpg|thumb|upright|Mackintosh Store, 104 Mount St, [[Mayfair]], London.]]\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the company continued to make waterproof clothing.

Syme did not propose the sandwich idea and his paper did not mention waterproofing. Waterproofing garments with rubber was an old idea, and was practised in pre-Columbian times by Aztecs, who impregnated fabric with [[Natural rubber#Prehistoric uses|latex]]. Later, French scientists made balloons gas-tight (and incidentally, impermeable) by impregnating fabric with rubber dissolved in turpentine, but this solvent was not satisfactory for making apparel.\n\nIn 1830 Macintosh's company merged with the clothing company of [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in [[Manchester]]. Hancock had also been experimenting with rubber coated fabrics since 1819. Production of rubberised coats soon spread all over the UK.  Every kind of coat was produced with rubberized material including [[riding coat]]s and coats supplied to the British Army, British railways, and UK police forces.\n\nEarly coats had problems with smell, stiffness, and a tendency to melt in hot weather, but Hancock further improved his waterproof fabrics, patenting a method for [[sulfur vulcanisation|vulcanising]] rubber in 1843 which solved many of the problems.<ref name=\"bt\">[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/return-of-the-mac-28065280.html]</ref>\n\n[[File:Mackintosh-store.jpg|thumb|upright|Mackintosh Store, 104 Mount St, [[Mayfair]], London.]]\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the company continued to make waterproof clothing.

In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ can become [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n! Unround ||Round\n!Round\n|- \n! align=\"left\" | [[Close vowel|Close]] (High)\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|i}} <nowiki><i></nowiki>\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|y}} <nowiki><u></nowiki>\n| align=\"center\" | \n|-\n! align=\"left\" | [[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|e}} <e>\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u00f8}} <\u00f6>\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|o}} <o>\n|-\n! align=\"left\" | [[Open vowel|Open]] (Low)\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|a}} <a>\n| align=\"center\" | \n| align=\"center\" | \n|}\nVowel nasalisation occurs on diphthongs only; the few which are not nasalised all end in /i/.\n\n==== Vowel Alternations <ref name=\":0\" />====\n\n* [i] alternates with [\u026a] in unstressed syllables if the vowel in the vowel in the following syllable is [i]. E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare: /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non-compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold; for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories is stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, xi\u02bc nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi\u02bc) and non-xi\u02bc nouns. Xi\u02bc nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.) Mao 'ina.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p\n\n'I went.'\n\n(b ii.) *Mao 'ina wata'.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p emph:1s\n\n'I went.'\n\nA verb can have up to four arguments, but it is uncommon to express more than one at a time. Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence - or a variable in the sentence - a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.'

In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ can become [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n!

E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare: /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non-compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold; for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories are stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, xi\u02bc nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi\u02bc) and non-xi\u02bc nouns. Xi\u02bc nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.) Mao 'ina.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p\n\n'I went.'\n\n(b ii.) *Mao 'ina wata'.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p emph:1s\n\n'I went.'\n\nA verb can have up to four arguments, but it is uncommon to express more than one at a time. Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence - or a variable in the sentence - a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.'

Usually the term \"Markov chain\" is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, that is, a '''discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC)''',<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"Everitt, B.S. 2002\">Everitt, B.S. (2002) ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics''. CUP. {{ISBN|0-521-81099-X}}</ref><ref name=\"Everitt, B.S. 2002\"/> but a few authors use the term \"Markov process\" to refer to a '''continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC)''' without explicit mention.<ref>Parzen, E.

''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}</ref> In addition, there are other extensions of Markov processes that are referred to as such but do not necessarily fall within any of these four categories (see [[Markov model]]). Moreover, the time index need not necessarily be real-valued; like with the state space, there are conceivable processes that move through index sets with other mathematical constructs. Notice that the general state space continuous-time Markov chain is general to such a degree that it has no designated term.\n\nWhile the time parameter is usually discrete, the [[state space]] of a Markov chain does not have any generally agreed-on restrictions: the term may refer to a process on an arbitrary state space.<ref>Meyn, S. Sean P., and Richard L. Tweedie. (2009) ''Markov chains and stochastic stability''. Cambridge University Press. (Preface, p. iii)</ref> However, many applications of Markov chains employ finite or [[countable set|countably infinite]] state spaces, which have a more straightforward statistical analysis. Besides time-index and state-space parameters, there are many other variations, extensions and generalizations (see [[#Variations|Variations]]). For simplicity, most of this article concentrates on the discrete-time, discrete state-space case, unless mentioned otherwise.\n\n=== Transitions ===\nThe changes of state of the system are called transitions.<ref name=\":0\"/> The probabilities associated with various state changes are called transition probabilities. The process is characterized by a state space, a [[stochastic matrix|transition matrix]] describing the probabilities of particular transitions, and an initial state (or initial distribution) across the state space. By convention, we assume all possible states and transitions have been included in the definition of the process, so there is always a next state, and the process does not terminate.\n\nA discrete-time random process involves a system which is in a certain state at each step, with the state changing randomly between steps.<ref name=\":0\"/> The steps are often thought of as moments in time, but they can equally well refer to physical distance or any other discrete measurement. Formally, the steps are the [[integers]] or [[natural numbers]], and the random process is a mapping of these to states.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location=USA, NJ|pages=159\u2013163}}</ref> The Markov property states that the [[conditional probability distribution]] for the system at the next step (and in fact at all future steps) depends only on the current state of the system, and not additionally on the state of the system at previous steps.\n\nSince the system changes randomly, it is generally impossible to predict with certainty the state of a Markov chain at a given point in the future.<ref name=\":1\"/> However, the statistical properties of the system's future can be predicted.<ref name=\":1\"/> In many applications, it is these statistical properties that are important.\n\n==History==\nMarkov studied Markov processes in the early 20th century, publishing his first paper on the topic in 1906.<ref>{{cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location=USA, NJ|pages=2\u20138}}</ref><ref name=\"GrinsteadSnell1997page4643\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/flooved3489|title=Introduction to Probability|author1=Charles Miller Grinstead|author2=James Laurie Snell|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8218-0749-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/flooved3489/page/n473 464]\u2013466}}</ref><ref name=\"Bremaud2013pageIX3\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrPVBwAAQBAJ|title=Markov Chains: Gibbs Fields, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Queues|author=Pierre Bremaud|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4757-3124-8|page=ix|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323160437/https://books.google.com/books?id=jrPVBwAAQBAJ|archivedate=23 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Hayes20133\">{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Brian|year=2013|title=First links in the Markov chain|journal=American Scientist|volume=101|issue=2|pages=92\u201396|doi=10.1511/2013.101.92}}</ref> Markov processes in continuous time were discovered long before [[Andrey Markov]]'s work in the early 20th century<ref name=\":0\" /> in the form of the [[Poisson point process|Poisson process]].<ref name=\"Ross1996page235and3583\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImUPAQAAMAAJ|title=Stochastic processes|author=Sheldon M.

From any position there are two possible transitions, to the next or previous integer. The transition probabilities depend only on the current position, not on the manner in which the position was reached. For example, the transition probabilities from 5 to 4 and 5 to 6 are both 0.5, and all other transition probabilities from 5 are 0. These probabilities are independent of whether the system was previously in 4 or 6.\n\nAnother example is the dietary habits of a creature who eats only grapes, cheese, or lettuce, and whose dietary habits conform to the following rules:\n*It eats exactly once a day.\n*If it ate cheese today, tomorrow it will eat lettuce or grapes with equal probability.\n*If it ate grapes today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 1/10, cheese with probability 4/10, and lettuce with probability 5/10.\n*If it ate lettuce today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 4/10 or cheese with probability 6/10. It will not eat lettuce again tomorrow.\nThis creature's eating habits can be modeled with a Markov chain since its choice tomorrow depends solely on what it ate today, not what it ate yesterday or any other time in the past. One statistical property that could be calculated is the expected percentage, over a long period, of the days on which the creature will eat grapes.\n\nA series of independent events (for example, a series of coin flips) satisfies the formal definition of a Markov chain. However, the theory is usually applied only when the probability distribution of the next step depends non-trivially on the current state.\n\n===A non-Markov example===\nSuppose that there is a coin purse containing five quarters (each worth 25\u00a2), five dimes (each worth 10\u00a2), and five nickels (each worth 5\u00a2), and one by one, coins are randomly drawn from the purse and are set on a table. If <math>X_n</math> represents the total value of the coins set on the table after {{mvar|n}} draws, with <math>X_0 = 0</math>, then the sequence <math>\\{X_n : n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}</math> is ''not'' a Markov process.\n\nTo see why this is the case, suppose that in the first six draws, all five nickels and a quarter are drawn. Thus <math>X_6 = \\$0.50</math>. If we know not just <math>X_6</math>, but the earlier values as well, then we can determine which coins have been drawn, and we know that the next coin will not be a nickel; so we can determine that <math>X_7 \\geq \\$0.60</math> with probability 1. But if we do not know the earlier values, then based only on the value <math>X_6</math> we might guess that we had drawn four dimes and two nickels, in which case it would certainly be possible to draw another nickel next. Thus, our guesses about <math>X_7</math> are impacted by our knowledge of values prior to <math>X_6</math>.\n\nHowever, it is possible to model this scenario as a Markov process. Instead of defining <math>X_n</math> to represent the ''total value'' of the coins on the table, we could define <math>X_n</math> to represent the ''count'' of the various coin types on the table. For instance, <math>X_6 = 1,0,5</math> could be defined to represent the state where there is one quarter, zero dimes, and five nickels on the table after 6 one-by-one draws. This new model would be represented by 216 possible states (that is, 6x6x6 states, since each of the three coin types could have zero to five coins on the table by the end of the 6 draws). Suppose that the first draw results in state <math>X_1 = 0,1,0</math>. The probability of achieving <math>X_2</math> now depends on <math>X_1</math>; for example, the state <math>X_2 = 1,0,1</math> is not possible. After the second draw, the third draw depends on which coins have so far been drawn, but no longer only on the coins that were drawn for the first state (since probabilistically important information has since been added to the scenario). In this way, the likelihood of the <math>X_n = i,j,k</math> state depends exclusively on the outcome of the <math>X_{n-1}= \\ell,m,p</math> state.\n\n==Formal definition==\n\n===Discrete-time Markov chain===\nA discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of [[random variable]]s ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''X''<sub>3</sub>, ... with the [[Markov property]], namely that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \\ldots, X_n=x_n) = \\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=x_n),</math> if both [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]] are well defined, that is, if <math>\\Pr(X_1=x_1,\\ldots,X_n=x_n)>0.</math>\n\nThe possible values of ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> form a [[countable set]] ''S'' called the state space of the chain.\n\nMarkov chains are often described by a sequence of [[directed graph]]s, where the edges of graph ''n'' are labeled by the probabilities of going from one state at time ''n'' to the other states at time ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=x_n).</math> The same information is represented by the transition matrix from time ''n'' to time ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. However, Markov chains are frequently assumed to be time-homogeneous (see variations below), in which case the graph and matrix are independent of ''n'' and are thus not presented as sequences.\n\nThese descriptions highlight the structure of the Markov chain that is independent of the initial distribution <math>\\Pr(X_1=x_1).</math> When time-homogeneous, the chain can be interpreted as a state machine assigning a probability of hopping from each vertex or state to an adjacent one. The probability <math>\\Pr(X_n=x\\mid X_1=x_1)</math> of the machine's state can be analyzed as the statistical behavior of the machine with an element <math>x_1</math> of the state space as input, or as the behavior of the machine with the initial distribution <math>\\Pr(X_1=y)=[x_1=y]</math> of states as input, where <math>[P]</math> is the [[Iverson bracket]].\n\nThe fact that some sequences of states might have zero probability of occurring corresponds to a graph with multiple [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]], where we omit edges that would carry a zero transition probability. For example, if ''a'' has a nonzero probability of going to ''b'', but ''a'' and ''x'' lie in different connected components of the graph, then <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=b\\mid X_n=a)</math> is defined, while <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=b\\mid X_1=x, \\ldots, X_n=a)</math> is not.\n\n====Variations====\n*{{Anchor|homogeneous}}Time-homogeneous Markov chains (or stationary Markov chains) are processes where\n::<math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=y) = \\Pr(X_n=x\\mid X_{n-1}=y)</math>\n:for all ''n''. The probability of the transition is independent of ''n''.\n*A Markov chain with memory (or a Markov chain of order ''m'')\n:where ''m'' is finite, is a process satisfying\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\n{} &\\Pr(X_n=x_n\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\dots , X_1=x_1) \\\\\n= &\\Pr(X_n=x_n\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\dots, X_{n-m}=x_{n-m})\n\\text{ for }n > m\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n:In other words, the future state depends on the past ''m'' states. It is possible to construct a chain <math>(Y_n)</math> from <math>(X_n)</math> which has the 'classical' Markov property by taking as state space the ordered ''m''-tuples of ''X'' values, ie. <math>Y_n= \\left( X_n,X_{n-1},\\ldots,X_{n-m+1} \\right)</math>.\n\n===Continuous-time Markov chain===\n{{See also | Kolmogorov equations (Markov jump process)}}\nA continuous-time Markov chain (''X''<sub>''t''</sub>)<sub>''t''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0</sub> is defined by a finite or countable state space ''S'', a [[transition rate matrix]] ''Q'' with dimensions equal to that of the state space and initial probability distribution defined on the state space. For ''i''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''j'', the elements ''q''<sub>''ij''</sub> are non-negative and describe the rate of the process transitions from state ''i'' to state ''j''. The elements ''q''<sub>''ii''</sub> are chosen such that each row of the transition rate matrix sums to zero, while the row-sums of a probability transition matrix in a (discrete) Markov chain are all equal to one.\n\nThere are three equivalent definitions of the process.<ref name=\"norris1\">{{cite book|title=Markov Chains|year=1997|isbn=9780511810633|pages=60\u2013107|chapter=Continuous-time Markov chains I|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511810633.004|pmc=|pmid=|last1=Norris|first1=J.

If there is more than one unit eigenvector then a weighted sum of the corresponding stationary states is also a stationary state. But for a Markov chain one is usually more interested in a stationary state that is the limit of the sequence of distributions for some initial distribution.\n\nThe values of a stationary distribution <math> \\textstyle \\pi_i </math> are associated with the state space of '''P''' and its eigenvectors have their relative proportions preserved. Since the components of &pi; are positive and the constraint that their sum is unity can be rewritten as <math>\\textstyle \\sum_i 1 \\cdot \\pi_i=1</math> we see that the dot product of &pi; with a vector whose components are all 1 is unity and that &pi; lies on a [[standard simplex|simplex]].\n\n====Time-homogeneous Markov chain with a finite state space====\n{{No footnotes\n|date= February 2012\n|section}}\nIf the Markov chain is time-homogeneous, then the transition matrix '''P''' is the same after each step, so the ''k''-step transition probability can be computed as the ''k''-th power of the transition matrix, '''P'''<sup>''k''</sup>.\n\nIf the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic, then there is a unique stationary distribution {{pi}}.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite journal|last=Serfozo|first=Richard|date=2009|title=Basics of Applied Stochastic Processes|url=https://archive.org/details/basicsappliedsto00serf_111|url-access=registration|journal=Probability and Its Applications|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-89332-5|issn=1431-7028|isbn=978-3-540-89331-8}}</ref> Additionally, in this case '''P'''<sup>''k''</sup> converges to a rank-one matrix in which each row is the stationary distribution {{pi}}:\n:<math>\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}\\mathbf{P}^k=\\mathbf{1}\\pi</math>\nwhere '''1''' is the column vector with all entries equal to 1.

However, there are many techniques that can assist in finding this limit. Let '''P''' be an ''n''\u00d7''n'' matrix, and define <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{Q} = \\lim\\limits_{k\\to\\infty}\\mathbf{P}^k.</math>\n\nIt is always true that\n:<math>\\mathbf{QP} = \\mathbf{Q}.</math>\n\nSubtracting '''Q''' from both sides and factoring then yields\n:<math>\\mathbf{Q}(\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{I}_{n}) = \\mathbf{0}_{n,n} ,</math>\nwhere '''I'''<sub>''n''</sub> is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n'', and '''0'''<sub>''n'',''n''</sub> is the [[zero matrix]] of size ''n''\u00d7''n''. Multiplying together stochastic matrices always yields another stochastic matrix, so '''Q''' must be a [[stochastic matrix]] (see the definition above). It is sometimes sufficient to use the matrix equation above and the fact that '''Q''' is a stochastic matrix to solve for '''Q'''. Including the fact that the sum of each the rows in '''P''' is 1, there are ''n+1'' equations for determining ''n'' unknowns, so it is computationally easier if on the one hand one selects one row in '''Q''' and substitutes each of its elements by one, and on the other one substitutes the corresponding element (the one in the same column) in the vector '''0''', and next left-multiplies this latter vector by the inverse of transformed former matrix to find '''Q'''.\n\nHere is one method for doing so: first, define the function ''f''('''A''') to return the matrix '''A''' with its right-most column replaced with all 1's.

So it needs any n\u00d7n independent linear equations of the (n\u00d7n+n) equations to solve for the n\u00d7n variables. In this example, the n equations from \u201cQ multiplied by the right-most column of (P-In)\u201d have been replaced by the n stochastic ones.\nOne thing to notice is that if '''P''' has an element '''P'''<sub>''i'',''i''</sub> on its main diagonal that is equal to 1 and the ''i''th row or column is otherwise filled with 0's, then that row or column will remain unchanged in all of the subsequent powers '''P'''<sup>''k''</sup>.

The main idea is to see if there is a point in the state space that the chain hits with probability one. Generally, it is not true for continuous state space, however, we can define sets ''A'' and ''B'' along with a positive number ''\u03b5'' and a probability measure ''\u03c1'', such that\n:<math>\\begin{cases}\n\\text{If }\\tau_A = \\inf\\{n\\geq 0: X_n \\in A\\},&\\text{ then } P_z(\\tau_A<\\infty)>0\\text{ for all }z.\\\\\n\\text{If }x \\in A\\text{ and }C\\subset B,&\\text{ then } p(x, C)\\geq \\varepsilon \\rho(C).\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen we could collapse the sets into an auxiliary point ''\u03b1'', and a recurrent [[Harris chain]] can be modified to contain ''\u03b1''. Lastly, the collection of [[Harris chain]]s is a comfortable level of generality, which is broad enough to contain a large number of interesting examples, yet restrictive enough to allow for a rich theory.\n\nThe use of Markov chains in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods covers cases where the process follows a continuous state space.\n\n====Locally interacting Markov chains====\nConsidering a collection of Markov chains whose evolution takes in account the state of other Markov chains, is related to the notion of [[locally interacting Markov chains]].

The accessibility relation is reflexive and transitive, but not necessarily symmetric.\n\nA state ''i'' is said to communicate with state ''j'' (written ''i''&nbsp;\u2194&nbsp;''j'') if both ''i''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''j'' and ''j''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''i''. A communicating class is a maximal set of states ''C'' such that every pair of states in ''C'' communicates with each other. Communication is an [[equivalence relation]], and communicating classes are the [[equivalence class]]es of this relation.\n\nA communicating class is closed if the probability of leaving the class is zero, namely if ''i'' is in ''C'' but ''j'' is not, then ''j'' is not accessible from&nbsp;''i''. The set of communicating classes forms a [[directed acyclic graph|directed, acyclic graph]] by inheriting the arrows from the original state space. A communicating class is closed if and only if it has no outgoing arrows in this graph.\n\nA state ''i'' is said to be essential or final if for all ''j'' such that ''i''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''j'' it is also true that ''j''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''i''. A state ''i'' is inessential if it is not essential.<ref>{{cite book|last=Asher Levin|first=David|title=Markov chains and mixing times|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Cg5Nq5sSv4C&lpg=PA16&dq=essential%20class%20markov&pg=PA16#v=onepage|isbn=978-0-8218-4739-8|year=2009|accessdate=2016-03-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205163334/https://books.google.com/books?id=6Cg5Nq5sSv4C&lpg=PA16&dq=essential%20class%20markov&pg=PA16#v=onepage|archivedate=2017-02-05}}</ref> A state is final if and only if its communicating class is closed.\n\nA Markov chain is said to be irreducible if its state space is a single communicating class; in other words, if it is possible to get to any state from any state.\n\n===Periodicity===\nA state <math>i</math> has period <math>k</math> if any return to state <math>i</math> must occur in multiples of <math>k</math> time steps. Formally, the [[periodic function|period]] of state <math>i</math> is defined as\n\n:<math> k = \\gcd\\{ n > 0: \\Pr(X_n = i \\mid X_0 = i) > 0\\}</math>\n\n(where <math>gcd</math> is the [[greatest common divisor]]) provided that this set is not empty. Otherwise the period is not defined. Note that even though a state has period <math>k</math>, it may not be possible to reach the state in <math>k</math> steps. For example, suppose it is possible to return to the state in <math>\\{6,~8,~10,~12,\\dots\\}</math> time steps; <math>k</math> would be <math>2</math>, even though <math>2</math> does not appear in this list.\n\nIf <math>k = 1</math>, then the state is said to be aperiodic.\nOtherwise (<math> k > 1</math>), the state is said to be periodic with period&nbsp;<math>k</math>. A Markov chain is aperiodic if every state is aperiodic. An irreducible Markov chain only needs one aperiodic state to imply all states are aperiodic.\n\nEvery state of a [[bipartite graph]] has an even period.\n\n==={{anchor|Transience}}{{anchor|Recurrence}}Transience and recurrence===\nA state ''i'' is said to be transient if, given that we start in state ''i'', there is a non-zero probability that we will never return to ''i''. Formally, let the [[random variable]] ''T<sub>i</sub>'' be the first return time to state ''i'' (the \"hitting time\"):\n\n:<math> T_i = \\inf \\{ n\\ge1: X_n = i\\}.</math>\n\nThe number\n\n:<math> f_{ii}^{(n)} = \\Pr(T_i = n \\mid X_0 = i)</math>\n\nis the probability that we return to state ''i'' for the first time after ''n'' steps.\nTherefore, state ''i'' is transient if\n\n:<math> \\Pr(T_i < \\infty \\mid X_0 = i) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f_{ii}^{(n)} < 1. </math>\n\nState ''i'' is recurrent (or persistent) if it is not transient.\nRecurrent states are guaranteed (with probability 1) to have a finite hitting time.\nRecurrence and transience are class properties, that is, they either hold or do not hold equally for all members of a communicating class.\n\n====Mean recurrence time====\nEven if the hitting time is finite with probability ''1'', it need not have a finite [[expected value|expectation]]<!-- Should provide example later for this and reference it here -->.\nThe mean recurrence time at state ''i'' is the expected return time ''M<sub>i</sub>'':\n\n:<math> M_i = E[T_i]=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n\\cdot f_{ii}^{(n)}.</math>\n\nState ''i'' is positive recurrent (or non-null persistent) if ''M<sub>i</sub>'' is finite; otherwise, state ''i'' is null recurrent (or null persistent).\n\n====Expected number of visits====\nIt can be shown that a state ''i'' is recurrent [[if and only if]] the expected number of visits to this state is infinite:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty p_{ii}^{(n)} = \\infty.</math>\n\n====Absorbing states====\nA state ''i'' is called absorbing if it is impossible to leave this state.

In other words, a state ''i'' is ergodic if it is recurrent, has a period of ''1'', and has finite mean recurrence time. If all states in an irreducible Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain is said to be ergodic.\n\nIt can be shown that a finite state irreducible Markov chain is ergodic if it has an aperiodic state. More generally, a Markov chain is ergodic if there is a number ''N'' such that any state can be reached from any other state in any number of steps less or equal to a number ''N''. In case of a fully connected transition matrix, where all transitions have a non-zero probability, this condition is fulfilled with&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nA Markov chain with more than one state and just one out-going transition per state is either not irreducible or not aperiodic, hence cannot be ergodic.\n\n===Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions===\nIf the Markov chain is a [[time-homogeneous Markov chain]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wan|first=Lijie|last2=Lou|first2=Wenjie|last3=Abner|first3=Erin|last4=Kryscio|first4=Richard J.|date=2016|title=A comparison of time-homogeneous Markov chain and Markov process multi-state models|journal=Communications in Statistics: Case Studies, Data Analysis and Applications|volume=2|issue=3\u20134|pages=92\u2013100|doi=10.1080/23737484.2017.1361366|issn=2373-7484|pmc=5803756|pmid=29430521}}</ref> so that the process is described by a single, [[time-independent matrix]] <math>p_{ij}</math>, then the vector <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> is called a stationary distribution (or [[invariant measure]]) if <math>\\forall j \\in S</math> it satisfies\n\n:<math>0\\leq\\pi_j\\leq1.</math>\n:<math>\\sum_{j \\in S}\\pi_j = 1.</math>\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\pi_i p_{ij}.</math>\n\nAn irreducible chain has a positive stationary distribution (a stationary distribution such that <math>\\forall i, \\pi_i > 0</math>) if and only if all of its states are positive recurrent.<ref>{{citation\n|last= Serfozo\n|first= Richard\n|doi= 10.1007/978-3-540-89332-5\n|isbn= 978-3-540-89331-8\n|mr= 2484222\n|page= 35\n|title= Basics of Applied Stochastic Processes\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JBBRiuxTN0QC&pg=PA35\n|year= 2009\n|journal= Probability and Its Applications\n|url-status= live\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150319050311/https://books.google.com/books?id=JBBRiuxTN0QC&pg=PA35\n|archivedate= 2015-03-19\n}}</ref> In that case, {{pi}} is unique and is related to the expected return time:\n\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\frac{C}{M_j}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>C</math> is the normalizing constant. Further, if the positive recurrent chain is both irreducible and aperiodic, it is said to have a ''limiting'' distribution; for any ''i'' and ''j'',\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\frac{C}{M_j}.</math>\n\n(There is no assumption on the starting distribution; the chain converges to the stationary distribution regardless of where it begins. Such ''<math>\\pi</math>'' is called the equilibrium distribution of the chain.)\n\nIf a chain has more than one closed communicating class, its stationary distributions will not be unique (consider any [[#Reducibility|closed communicating class]] <math>C_i</math> in the chain; each one will have its own unique stationary distribution <math>\\pi_i</math>. Extending these distributions to the overall chain, setting all values to zero outside the communication class, yields that the set of invariant measures of the original chain is the set of all convex combinations of the <math>\\pi_i</math>'s). However, if a state ''j'' is aperiodic, then\n<math>\\lim\\nolimits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} p_{jj}^{(n)} = \\tfrac{C}{M_j}</math>\nand for any other state ''i'', let ''f<sub>ij</sub>'' be the probability that the chain ever visits state ''j'' if it starts at&nbsp;''i'',\n<math>\\lim\\nolimits_{n \\rightarrow\\infty} p_{ij}^{(n)} = C \\tfrac{f_{ij}}{M_j}.</math>\n\nIf a state ''i'' is periodic with period ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 then the limit\n<math>\\lim\\nolimits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} p_{ii}^{(n)}</math>\ndoes not exist, although the limit\n<math>\\lim\\nolimits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} p_{ii}^{(kn+r)}</math>\ndoes exist for every integer&nbsp;''r''.\n\n====Steady-state analysis and the time-inhomogeneous Markov chain====\nA Markov chain need not necessarily be time-homogeneous to have an equilibrium distribution. If there is a probability distribution over states <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> such that\n\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\pi_i \\, \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_n = i)</math>\n\nfor every state ''j'' and every time ''n'' then <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> is an equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain. Such can occur in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in situations where a number of different transition matrices are used, because each is efficient for a particular kind of mixing, but each matrix respects a shared equilibrium distribution.\n\n===Reversible Markov chain{{Anchor|detailed balance}}===\nA Markov chain is said to be reversible if there is a probability distribution '''{{pi}}''' over its states such that\n\n:<math>\\pi_i \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_{n} = i) = \\pi_j \\Pr(X_{n+1} = i \\mid X_{n} = j)</math>\n\nfor all times ''n'' and all states ''i'' and ''j''. This condition is known as the '''[[detailed balance]]''' condition (some books call it the local balance equation).\n\nConsidering a fixed arbitrary time ''n'' and using the shorthand\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_n = i)\\,,</math>\n\nthe detailed balance equation can be written more compactly as\n\n:<math>\\pi_i p_{ij} = \\pi_j p_{ji}\\,.</math>\n\nThe single time-step from ''n'' to ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 can be thought of as each person ''i'' having {{pi}}<sub>''i''</sub> dollars initially and paying each person ''j'' a fraction ''p<sub>ij</sub>'' of it. The detailed balance condition states that upon each payment, the other person pays exactly the same amount of money back.<ref name=\"Durrett2012\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_Ovy6OvI54C&pg=PA37|title=Essentials of Stochastic Processes|author=Richard Durrett|date=19 May 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-3615-7|page=37|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206031627/https://books.google.com/books?id=i_Ovy6OvI54C&pg=PA37|archivedate=6 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Clearly the total amount of money '''{{pi}}''' each person has remains the same after the time-step, since every dollar spent is balanced by a corresponding dollar received. This can be shown more formally by the equality\n\n:<math>\\sum_i \\pi_i p_{ij} = \\sum_i \\pi_j p_{ji} = \\pi_j \\sum_i p_{ji} = \\pi_j\\,,</math>\n\nwhich essentially states that the total amount of money person ''j'' receives (including from himself) during the time-step equals the amount of money he pays others, which equals all the money he initially had because it was assumed that all money is spent (that is, ''p<sub>ji</sub>'' sums to 1 over ''i''). The assumption is a technical one, because the money not really used is simply thought of as being paid from person ''j'' to himself (that is, ''p<sub>jj</sub>'' is not necessarily zero).\n\nAs ''n'' was arbitrary, this reasoning holds for any ''n'', and therefore for reversible Markov chains '''{{pi}}''' is always a steady-state distribution of Pr(''X''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''X''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''i'') for every&nbsp;''n''.\n\nIf the Markov chain begins in the steady-state distribution, that is, if <math>Pr(X_0=i)=\\pi_i</math>, then <math>Pr(X_n=i)=\\pi_i</math> for all <math>n</math> and the detailed balance equation can be written as\n\n:<math>\\Pr(X_{n} = i, X_{n+1} = j) = \\Pr(X_{n+1} = i, X_{n} = j)\\,.</math>\n\nThe left- and right-hand sides of this last equation are identical except for a reversing of the time indices ''n'' and&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\n[[Kolmogorov's criterion]] gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a Markov chain to be reversible directly from the transition matrix probabilities. The criterion requires that the products of probabilities around every closed loop are the same in both directions around the loop.\n\nReversible Markov chains are common in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches because the detailed balance equation for a desired distribution '''{{pi}}''' necessarily implies that the Markov chain has been constructed so that '''{{pi}}''' is a steady-state distribution. Even with time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, where multiple transition matrices are used, if each such transition matrix exhibits detailed balance with the desired '''{{pi}}''' distribution, this necessarily implies that '''{{pi}}''' is a steady-state distribution of the Markov chain.\n\n===Markovian representations===\nIn some cases, apparently non-Markovian processes may still have Markovian representations, constructed by expanding the concept of the 'current' and 'future' states. For example, let ''X'' be a non-Markovian process. Then define a process ''Y'', such that each state of ''Y'' represents a time-interval of states of ''X''. Mathematically, this takes the form:\n:<math>Y(t) = \\big\\{ X(s): s \\in [a(t), b(t)] \\, \\big\\}.</math>\nIf ''Y'' has the Markov property, then it is a Markovian representation of ''X''.\n\nAn example of a non-Markovian process with a Markovian representation is an [[autoregressive model|autoregressive]] [[time series]] of order greater than one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Doblinger |first1=G. |title=Smoothing of noisy AR signals using an adaptive Kalman filter |journal=9th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 1998) |date=September 1998 |pages=781\u2013784 |url=https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub-et_3285.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Transient evolution===\nThe probability of going from state ''i'' to state ''j'' in ''n'' time steps is\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\Pr(X_n=j\\mid X_0=i) </math>\n\nand the single-step transition is\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_1=j\\mid X_0=i). </math>\n\nFor a time-homogeneous Markov chain:\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\Pr(X_{k+n}=j \\mid X_{k}=i) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_{k+1}=j \\mid X_k=i). </math>\n\nThe ''n''-step transition probabilities satisfy the [[Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation]], that for any ''k'' such that 0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n'',\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\sum_{r \\in S} p_{ir}^{(k)} p_{rj}^{(n-k)}</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is the state space of the Markov chain.\n\nThe [[marginal distribution]] Pr(''X''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'') is the distribution over states at time ''n''. The initial distribution is Pr(''X''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''). The evolution of the process through one time step is described by\n\n:<math> \\Pr(X_n=j) = \\sum_{r \\in S} p_{rj} \\Pr(X_{n-1}=r) = \\sum_{r \\in S} p_{rj}^{(n)} \\Pr(X_0=r).</math>\n\n(The superscript (''n'') is an [[indexed family|index]], and not an [[exponent]]).\n\n===Transient behaviour===\nWrite P(''t'') for the matrix with entries ''p''<sub>''ij''</sub> = P(''X''<sub>''t''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''X''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''i''). Then the matrix P(''t'') satisfies the forward equation, a [[first-order differential equation]]\n:<math>P'(t) = P(t) Q</math>\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation with respect to ''t''. The solution to this equation is given by a [[matrix exponential]]\n:<math>P(t) = e^{tQ}</math>\n\nIn a simple case such as a CTMC on the state space {1,2}. The general ''Q'' matrix for such a process is the following 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2 matrix with ''\u03b1'',''\u03b2''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0\n:<math>Q = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\alpha & \\alpha \\\\ \\beta & -\\beta \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe above relation for forward matrix can be solved explicitly in this case to give\n:<math>P(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nHowever, direct solutions are complicated to compute for larger matrices. The fact that ''Q'' is the generator for a [[semigroup]] of matrices\n:<math>P(t+s) = e^{(t+s)Q} = e^{tQ} e^{sQ} = P(t) P(s)</math>\nis used.\n\n===Stationary distribution===\nThe stationary distribution for an irreducible recurrent CTMC is the probability distribution to which the process converges for large values of ''t''. Observe that for the two-state process considered earlier with P(''t'') given by\n:<math>P(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nas ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e the distribution tends to\n:<math>P_\\pi = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nObserve that each row has the same distribution as this does not depend on starting state.

There is a bidirectional secret passage between states 2 and 8.]]\nThe image to the right describes a discrete-time Markov chain with state-space {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. Meanwhile, he is being hunted by ghosts. For convenience, the maze shall be a small 3x3-grid and the monsters move randomly in horizontal and vertical directions. A secret passageway between states 2 and 8 can be used in both directions. Entries with probability zero are removed in the following transition matrix:\n\n<math>Q=\\begin{pmatrix} & \\frac{1}{2} & & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4}&&&\\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n& \\frac{1}{2} & & & & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{3} & & & & \\frac{1}{3} & & \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n& \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n& & \\frac{1}{3} & & \\frac{1}{3} & & & & \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n& & & \\frac{1}{2} & & & & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n& \\frac{1}{4} & && \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n& & & & & \\frac{1}{2} & & \\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nThis Markov chain is irreducible, because the ghosts can fly from every state to every state in a finite amount of time. Due to the secret passageway, the Markov chain is also aperiodic, because the monsters can move from any state to any state both in an even and in an uneven number of state transitions. Therefore, a unique stationary distribution exists and can be found by solving {{pi}}&nbsp;''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1. The solution of this linear equation subject to the constraint is <math>\\pi=(7.7,15.4,7.7,11.5,15.4,11.5,7.7,15.4,7.7)\\%.</math>\nThe central state and the border states 2 and 8 of the adjacent secret passageway are visited most and the corner states are visited least.\n\n===Hitting times===\n{{Main|Phase-type distribution}}The hitting time is the time, starting in a given set of states until the chain arrives in a given state or set of states. The distribution of such a time period has a phase type distribution. The simplest such distribution is that of a single exponentially distributed transition.\n\n====Expected hitting times====\nFor a subset of states ''A''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''S'', the vector ''k''<sup>''A''</sup> of hitting times (where element <math> k_i^A </math> represents the [[expected value]], starting in state ''i'' that the chain enters one of the states in the set ''A'') is the minimal non-negative solution to<ref name=\"norris2\" />\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nk_i^A = 0 & \\text{ for } i \\in A\\\\\n-\\sum_{j \\in S} q_{ij} k_j^A = 1&\\text{ for } i \\notin A.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Time reversal===\nFor a CTMC ''X''<sub>''t''</sub>, the time-reversed process is defined to be <math>\\scriptstyle \\hat X_t = X_{T-t}</math>. By [[Kelly's lemma]] this process has the same stationary distribution as the forward process.\n\nA chain is said to be reversible if the reversed process is the same as the forward process. [[Kolmogorov's criterion]] states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a process to be reversible is that the product of transition rates around a closed loop must be the same in both directions.\n\n=== Embedded Markov chain <!-- Embedded Markov chain redirects here --> ===\n\nOne method of finding the [[stationary probability distribution]], {{pi}}, of an [[ergodic]] continuous-time Markov chain, ''Q'', is by first finding its '''embedded Markov chain (EMC)'''. Strictly speaking, the EMC is a regular discrete-time Markov chain, sometimes referred to as a '''[[jump process]]'''. Each element of the one-step transition probability matrix of the EMC, ''S'', is denoted by ''s''<sub>''ij''</sub>, and represents the [[conditional probability]] of transitioning from state ''i'' into state ''j''. These conditional probabilities may be found by\n\n:<math>\ns_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{q_{ij}}{\\sum_{k \\neq i} q_{ik}} & \\text{if } i \\neq j \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nFrom this, ''S'' may be written as\n:<math>S = I - \\left( \\operatorname{diag}(Q) \\right)^{-1} Q</math>\nwhere ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] and diag(''Q'') is the [[diagonal matrix]] formed by selecting the [[main diagonal]] from the matrix ''Q'' and setting all other elements to zero.\n\nTo find the stationary probability distribution vector, we must next find <math>\\varphi</math> such that\n:<math>\\varphi S = \\varphi, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi</math> being a row vector, such that all elements in <math>\\varphi</math> are greater than 0 and [[norm (mathematics)|<math>\\|\\varphi\\|_1</math>]] = 1. From this, {{pi}} may be found as\n:<math>\\pi = {-\\varphi (\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\over \\left\\| \\varphi (\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\right\\|_1}.</math>\n\n(''S'' may be periodic, even if ''Q'' is not. Once {{pi}} is found, it must be normalized to a [[unit vector]].)\n\nAnother discrete-time process that may be derived from a continuous-time Markov chain is a \u03b4-skeleton&mdash;the (discrete-time) Markov chain formed by observing ''X''(''t'') at intervals of \u03b4 units of time. The random variables ''X''(0),&nbsp;''X''(\u03b4),&nbsp;''X''(2\u03b4),&nbsp;... give the sequence of states visited by the \u03b4-skeleton.\n\n== Special types of Markov chains ==\n\n=== Markov model ===\n{{Main|Markov model}}\nMarkov models are used to model changing systems. There are 4 main types of models, that generalize Markov chains depending on whether every sequential state is observable or not, and whether the system is to be adjusted on the basis of observations made:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n!\n!System state is fully observable\n!System state is partially observable\n|-\n!System is autonomous\n|Markov chain\n|[[Hidden Markov model]]\n|-\n!System is controlled\n|[[Markov decision process]]\n|[[Partially observable Markov decision process]]\n|}\n\n===Bernoulli scheme===\n{{Main|Bernoulli scheme}}\nA [[Bernoulli scheme]] is a special case of a Markov chain where the transition probability matrix has identical rows, which means that the next state is even independent of the current state (in addition to being independent of the past states).

For example, imagine a large number ''n'' of molecules in solution in state A, each of which can undergo a chemical reaction to state B with a certain average rate. Perhaps the molecule is an enzyme, and the states refer to how it is folded. The state of any single enzyme follows a Markov chain, and since the molecules are essentially independent of each other, the number of molecules in state A or B at a time is ''n'' times the probability a given molecule is in that state.\n\nThe classical model of enzyme activity, [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics]], can be viewed as a Markov chain, where at each time step the reaction proceeds in some direction.

An algorithm is constructed to produce output note values based on the transition matrix weightings, which could be [[MIDI]] note values, frequency ([[Hertz|Hz]]), or any other desirable metric.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Making Music with Algorithms: A Case-Study System |author1=K McAlpine |author2=E Miranda |author3=S Hoggar |journal=Computer Music Journal |issue=2 |year=1999 |volume=23 |doi=10.1162/014892699559733 |pages=19\u201330}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left\"\n|+ 1st-order matrix\n!

Higher, ''n''th-order chains tend to \"group\" particular notes together, while 'breaking off' into other patterns and sequences occasionally.

Moreover, the time index need not necessarily be real-valued; like with the state space, there are conceivable processes that move through index sets with other mathematical constructs. Notice that the general state space continuous-time Markov chain is general to such a degree that it has no designated term.\n\nWhile the time parameter is usually discrete, the [[state space]] of a Markov chain does not have any generally agreed-on restrictions: the term may refer to a process on an arbitrary state space.<ref>Meyn, S. Sean P., and Richard L. Tweedie. (2009) ''Markov chains and stochastic stability''. Cambridge University Press. (Preface, p. iii)</ref> However, many applications of Markov chains employ finite or [[countable set|countably infinite]] state spaces, which have a more straightforward statistical analysis. Besides time-index and state-space parameters, there are many other variations, extensions and generalizations (see [[#Variations|Variations]]). For simplicity, most of this article concentrates on the discrete-time, discrete state-space case, unless mentioned otherwise.\n\n=== Transitions ===\nThe changes of state of the system are called transitions.<ref name=\":0\"/> The probabilities associated with various state changes are called transition probabilities. The process is characterized by a state space, a [[stochastic matrix|transition matrix]] describing the probabilities of particular transitions, and an initial state (or initial distribution) across the state space. By convention, we assume all possible states and transitions have been included in the definition of the process, so there is always a next state, and the process does not terminate.\n\nA discrete-time random process involves a system which is in a certain state at each step, with the state changing randomly between steps.<ref name=\":0\"/> The steps are often thought of as moments in time, but they can equally well refer to physical distance or any other discrete measurement. Formally, the steps are the [[integers]] or [[natural numbers]], and the random process is a mapping of these to states.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location=USA, NJ|pages=159\u2013163}}</ref> The Markov property states that the [[conditional probability distribution]] for the system at the next step (and in fact at all future steps) depends only on the current state of the system, and not additionally on the state of the system at previous steps.\n\nSince the system changes randomly, it is generally impossible to predict with certainty the state of a Markov chain at a given point in the future.<ref name=\":1\"/> However, the statistical properties of the system's future can be predicted.<ref name=\":1\"/> In many applications, it is these statistical properties that are important.\n\n==History==\nMarkov studied Markov processes in the early 20th century, publishing his first paper on the topic in 1906.<ref>{{cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location=USA, NJ|pages=2\u20138}}</ref><ref name=\"GrinsteadSnell1997page4643\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/flooved3489|title=Introduction to Probability|author1=Charles Miller Grinstead|author2=James Laurie Snell|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8218-0749-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/flooved3489/page/n473 464]\u2013466}}</ref><ref name=\"Bremaud2013pageIX3\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrPVBwAAQBAJ|title=Markov Chains: Gibbs Fields, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Queues|author=Pierre Bremaud|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4757-3124-8|page=ix|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323160437/https://books.google.com/books?id=jrPVBwAAQBAJ|archivedate=23 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Hayes20133\">{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Brian|year=2013|title=First links in the Markov chain|journal=American Scientist|volume=101|issue=2|pages=92\u201396|doi=10.1511/2013.101.92}}</ref> Markov processes in continuous time were discovered long before [[Andrey Markov]]'s work in the early 20th century<ref name=\":0\" /> in the form of the [[Poisson point process|Poisson process]].<ref name=\"Ross1996page235and3583\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImUPAQAAMAAJ|title=Stochastic processes|author=Sheldon M.

From any position there are two possible transitions, to the next or previous integer. The transition probabilities depend only on the current position, not on the manner in which the position was reached. For example, the transition probabilities from 5 to 4 and 5 to 6 are both 0.5, and all other transition probabilities from 5 are 0. These probabilities are independent of whether the system was previously in 4 or 6.\n\nAnother example is the dietary habits of a creature who eats only grapes, cheese, or lettuce, and whose dietary habits conform to the following rules:\n*It eats exactly once a day.\n*If it ate cheese today, tomorrow it will eat lettuce or grapes with equal probability.\n*If it ate grapes today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 1/10, cheese with probability 4/10, and lettuce with probability 5/10.\n*If it ate lettuce today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 4/10 or cheese with probability 6/10. It will not eat lettuce again tomorrow.\nThis creature's eating habits can be modeled with a Markov chain since its choice tomorrow depends solely on what it ate today, not what it ate yesterday or any other time in the past. One statistical property that could be calculated is the expected percentage, over a long period, of the days on which the creature will eat grapes.\n\nA series of independent events (for example, a series of coin flips) satisfies the formal definition of a Markov chain. However, the theory is usually applied only when the probability distribution of the next step depends non-trivially on the current state.\n\n===A non-Markov example===\nSuppose that there is a coin purse containing five quarters (each worth 25\u00a2), five dimes (each worth 10\u00a2), and five nickels (each worth 5\u00a2), and one by one, coins are randomly drawn from the purse and are set on a table. If <math>X_n</math> represents the total value of the coins set on the table after {{mvar|n}} draws, with <math>X_0 = 0</math>, then the sequence <math>\\{X_n : n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}</math> is ''not'' a Markov process.\n\nTo see why this is the case, suppose that in the first six draws, all five nickels and a quarter are drawn. Thus <math>X_6 = \\$0.50</math>. If we know not just <math>X_6</math>, but the earlier values as well, then we can determine which coins have been drawn, and we know that the next coin will not be a nickel; so we can determine that <math>X_7 \\geq \\$0.60</math> with probability 1. But if we do not know the earlier values, then based only on the value <math>X_6</math> we might guess that we had drawn four dimes and two nickels, in which case it would certainly be possible to draw another nickel next. Thus, our guesses about <math>X_7</math> are impacted by our knowledge of values prior to <math>X_6</math>.\n\nHowever, it is possible to model this scenario as a Markov process. Instead of defining <math>X_n</math> to represent the ''total value'' of the coins on the table, we could define <math>X_n</math> to represent the ''count'' of the various coin types on the table. For instance, <math>X_6 = 1,0,5</math> could be defined to represent the state where there is one quarter, zero dimes, and five nickels on the table after 6 one-by-one draws. This new model would be represented by 216 possible states (that is, 6x6x6 states, since each of the three coin types could have zero to five coins on the table by the end of the 6 draws). Suppose that the first draw results in state <math>X_1 = 0,1,0</math>. The probability of achieving <math>X_2</math> now depends on <math>X_1</math>; for example, the state <math>X_2 = 1,0,1</math> is not possible. After the second draw, the third draw depends on which coins have so far been drawn, but no longer only on the coins that were drawn for the first state (since probabilistically important information has since been added to the scenario). In this way, the likelihood of the <math>X_n = i,j,k</math> state depends exclusively on the outcome of the <math>X_{n-1}= \\ell,m,p</math> state.\n\n==Formal definition==\n\n===Discrete-time Markov chain===\nA discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of [[random variable]]s ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''X''<sub>3</sub>, ... with the [[Markov property]], namely that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \\ldots, X_n=x_n) = \\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=x_n),</math> if both [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]] are well defined, that is, if <math>\\Pr(X_1=x_1,\\ldots,X_n=x_n)>0.</math>\n\nThe possible values of ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> form a [[countable set]] ''S'' called the state space of the chain.\n\nMarkov chains are often described by a sequence of [[directed graph]]s, where the edges of graph ''n'' are labeled by the probabilities of going from one state at time ''n'' to the other states at time ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=x_n).</math> The same information is represented by the transition matrix from time ''n'' to time ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. However, Markov chains are frequently assumed to be time-homogeneous (see variations below), in which case the graph and matrix are independent of ''n'' and are thus not presented as sequences.\n\nThese descriptions highlight the structure of the Markov chain that is independent of the initial distribution <math>\\Pr(X_1=x_1).</math> When time-homogeneous, the chain can be interpreted as a state machine assigning a probability of hopping from each vertex or state to an adjacent one. The probability <math>\\Pr(X_n=x\\mid X_1=x_1)</math> of the machine's state can be analyzed as the statistical behavior of the machine with an element <math>x_1</math> of the state space as input, or as the behavior of the machine with the initial distribution <math>\\Pr(X_1=y)=[x_1=y]</math> of states as input, where <math>[P]</math> is the [[Iverson bracket]].\n\nThe fact that some sequences of states might have zero probability of occurring corresponds to a graph with multiple [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]], where we omit edges that would carry a zero transition probability. For example, if ''a'' has a nonzero probability of going to ''b'', but ''a'' and ''x'' lie in different connected components of the graph, then <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=b\\mid X_n=a)</math> is defined, while <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=b\\mid X_1=x, \\ldots, X_n=a)</math> is not.\n\n====Variations====\n*{{Anchor|homogeneous}}Time-homogeneous Markov chains (or stationary Markov chains) are processes where\n::<math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=y) = \\Pr(X_n=x\\mid X_{n-1}=y)</math>\n:for all ''n''.

Multiplying together stochastic matrices always yields another stochastic matrix, so '''Q''' must be a [[stochastic matrix]] (see the definition above).

In this example, the n equations from \u201cQ multiplied by the right-most column of (P-In)\u201d have been replaced by the n stochastic ones.\nOne thing to notice is that if '''P''' has an element '''P'''<sub>''i'',''i''</sub> on its main diagonal that is equal to 1 and the ''i''th row or column is otherwise filled with 0's, then that row or column will remain unchanged in all of the subsequent powers '''P'''<sup>''k''</sup>.

The main idea is to see if there is a point in the state space that the chain hits with probability one. Generally, it is not true for continuous state space, however, we can define sets ''A'' and ''B'' along with a positive number ''\u03b5'' and a probability measure ''\u03c1'', such that\n:<math>\\begin{cases}\n\\text{If }\\tau_A = \\inf\\{n\\geq 0: X_n \\in A\\},&\\text{ then } P_z(\\tau_A<\\infty)>0\\text{ for all }z.\\\\\n\\text{If }x \\in A\\text{ and }C\\subset B,&\\text{ then } p(x, C)\\geq \\varepsilon \\rho(C).\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen we could collapse the sets into an auxiliary point ''\u03b1'', and a recurrent [[Harris chain]] can be modified to contain ''\u03b1''. Lastly, the collection of [[Harris chain]]s is a comfortable level of generality, which is broad enough to contain a large number of interesting examples, yet restrictive enough to allow for a rich theory.\n\nThe use of Markov chains in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods covers cases where the process follows a continuous state space.\n\n====Locally interacting Markov chains====\nConsidering a collection of Markov chains whose evolution takes in account the state of other Markov chains, is related to the notion of [[locally interacting Markov chains]].

If all states in an irreducible Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain is said to be ergodic.\n\nIt can be shown that a finite state irreducible Markov chain is ergodic if it has an aperiodic state. More generally, a Markov chain is ergodic if there is a number ''N'' such that any state can be reached from any other state in any number of steps less or equal to a number ''N''. In case of a fully connected transition matrix, where all transitions have a non-zero probability, this condition is fulfilled with&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nA Markov chain with more than one state and just one out-going transition per state is either not irreducible or not aperiodic, hence cannot be ergodic.\n\n===Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions===\nIf the Markov chain is a [[time-homogeneous Markov chain]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wan|first=Lijie|last2=Lou|first2=Wenjie|last3=Abner|first3=Erin|last4=Kryscio|first4=Richard J.|date=2016|title=A comparison of time-homogeneous Markov chain and Markov process multi-state models|journal=Communications in Statistics: Case Studies, Data Analysis and Applications|volume=2|issue=3\u20134|pages=92\u2013100|doi=10.1080/23737484.2017.1361366|issn=2373-7484|pmc=5803756|pmid=29430521}}</ref> so that the process is described by a single, [[time-independent matrix]] <math>p_{ij}</math>, then the vector <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> is called a stationary distribution (or [[invariant measure]]) if <math>\\forall j \\in S</math> it satisfies\n\n:<math>0\\leq\\pi_j\\leq1.</math>\n:<math>\\sum_{j \\in S}\\pi_j = 1.</math>\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\pi_i p_{ij}.</math>\n\nAn irreducible chain has a positive stationary distribution (a stationary distribution such that <math>\\forall i, \\pi_i > 0</math>) if and only if all of its states are positive recurrent.<ref>{{citation\n|last= Serfozo\n|first= Richard\n|doi= 10.1007/978-3-540-89332-5\n|isbn= 978-3-540-89331-8\n|mr= 2484222\n|page= 35\n|title= Basics of Applied Stochastic Processes\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JBBRiuxTN0QC&pg=PA35\n|year= 2009\n|journal= Probability and Its Applications\n|url-status= live\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150319050311/https://books.google.com/books?id=JBBRiuxTN0QC&pg=PA35\n|archivedate= 2015-03-19\n}}</ref> In that case, {{pi}} is unique and is related to the expected return time:\n\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\frac{C}{M_j}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>C</math> is the normalizing constant.

If there is a probability distribution over states <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> such that\n\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\pi_i \\, \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_n = i)</math>\n\nfor every state ''j'' and every time ''n'' then <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> is an equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain. Such can occur in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in situations where a number of different transition matrices are used, because each is efficient for a particular kind of mixing, but each matrix respects a shared equilibrium distribution.\n\n===Reversible Markov chain{{Anchor|detailed balance}}===\nA Markov chain is said to be reversible if there is a probability distribution '''{{pi}}''' over its states such that\n\n:<math>\\pi_i \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_{n} = i) = \\pi_j \\Pr(X_{n+1} = i \\mid X_{n} = j)</math>\n\nfor all times ''n'' and all states ''i'' and ''j''. This condition is known as the '''[[detailed balance]]''' condition (some books call it the local balance equation).\n\nConsidering a fixed arbitrary time ''n'' and using the shorthand\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_n = i)\\,,</math>\n\nthe detailed balance equation can be written more compactly as\n\n:<math>\\pi_i p_{ij} = \\pi_j p_{ji}\\,.</math>\n\nThe single time-step from ''n'' to ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 can be thought of as each person ''i'' having {{pi}}<sub>''i''</sub> dollars initially and paying each person ''j'' a fraction ''p<sub>ij</sub>'' of it. The detailed balance condition states that upon each payment, the other person pays exactly the same amount of money back.<ref name=\"Durrett2012\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_Ovy6OvI54C&pg=PA37|title=Essentials of Stochastic Processes|author=Richard Durrett|date=19 May 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-3615-7|page=37|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206031627/https://books.google.com/books?id=i_Ovy6OvI54C&pg=PA37|archivedate=6 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Clearly the total amount of money '''{{pi}}''' each person has remains the same after the time-step, since every dollar spent is balanced by a corresponding dollar received. This can be shown more formally by the equality\n\n:<math>\\sum_i \\pi_i p_{ij} = \\sum_i \\pi_j p_{ji} = \\pi_j \\sum_i p_{ji} = \\pi_j\\,,</math>\n\nwhich essentially states that the total amount of money person ''j'' receives (including from himself) during the time-step equals the amount of money he pays others, which equals all the money he initially had because it was assumed that all money is spent (that is, ''p<sub>ji</sub>'' sums to 1 over ''i''). The assumption is a technical one, because the money not really used is simply thought of as being paid from person ''j'' to himself (that is, ''p<sub>jj</sub>'' is not necessarily zero).\n\nAs ''n'' was arbitrary, this reasoning holds for any ''n'', and therefore for reversible Markov chains '''{{pi}}''' is always a steady-state distribution of Pr(''X''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''X''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''i'') for every&nbsp;''n''.\n\nIf the Markov chain begins in the steady-state distribution, that is, if <math>Pr(X_0=i)=\\pi_i</math>, then <math>Pr(X_n=i)=\\pi_i</math> for all <math>n</math> and the detailed balance equation can be written as\n\n:<math>\\Pr(X_{n} = i, X_{n+1} = j) = \\Pr(X_{n+1} = i, X_{n} = j)\\,.</math>\n\nThe left- and right-hand sides of this last equation are identical except for a reversing of the time indices ''n'' and&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\n[[Kolmogorov's criterion]] gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a Markov chain to be reversible directly from the transition matrix probabilities. The criterion requires that the products of probabilities around every closed loop are the same in both directions around the loop.\n\nReversible Markov chains are common in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches because the detailed balance equation for a desired distribution '''{{pi}}''' necessarily implies that the Markov chain has been constructed so that '''{{pi}}''' is a steady-state distribution. Even with time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, where multiple transition matrices are used, if each such transition matrix exhibits detailed balance with the desired '''{{pi}}''' distribution, this necessarily implies that '''{{pi}}''' is a steady-state distribution of the Markov chain.\n\n===Markovian representations===\nIn some cases, apparently non-Markovian processes may still have Markovian representations, constructed by expanding the concept of the 'current' and 'future' states. For example, let ''X'' be a non-Markovian process. Then define a process ''Y'', such that each state of ''Y'' represents a time-interval of states of ''X''. Mathematically, this takes the form:\n:<math>Y(t) = \\big\\{ X(s): s \\in [a(t), b(t)] \\, \\big\\}.</math>\nIf ''Y'' has the Markov property, then it is a Markovian representation of ''X''.\n\nAn example of a non-Markovian process with a Markovian representation is an [[autoregressive model|autoregressive]] [[time series]] of order greater than one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Doblinger |first1=G. |title=Smoothing of noisy AR signals using an adaptive Kalman filter |journal=9th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 1998) |date=September 1998 |pages=781\u2013784 |url=https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub-et_3285.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Transient evolution===\nThe probability of going from state ''i'' to state ''j'' in ''n'' time steps is\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\Pr(X_n=j\\mid X_0=i) </math>\n\nand the single-step transition is\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_1=j\\mid X_0=i). </math>\n\nFor a time-homogeneous Markov chain:\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\Pr(X_{k+n}=j \\mid X_{k}=i) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_{k+1}=j \\mid X_k=i). </math>\n\nThe ''n''-step transition probabilities satisfy the [[Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation]], that for any ''k'' such that 0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n'',\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\sum_{r \\in S} p_{ir}^{(k)} p_{rj}^{(n-k)}</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is the state space of the Markov chain.\n\nThe [[marginal distribution]] Pr(''X''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'') is the distribution over states at time ''n''. The initial distribution is Pr(''X''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''). The evolution of the process through one time step is described by\n\n:<math> \\Pr(X_n=j) = \\sum_{r \\in S} p_{rj} \\Pr(X_{n-1}=r) = \\sum_{r \\in S} p_{rj}^{(n)} \\Pr(X_0=r).</math>\n\n(The superscript (''n'') is an [[indexed family|index]], and not an [[exponent]]).\n\n===Transient behaviour===\nWrite P(''t'') for the matrix with entries ''p''<sub>''ij''</sub> = P(''X''<sub>''t''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''X''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''i''). Then the matrix P(''t'') satisfies the forward equation, a [[first-order differential equation]]\n:<math>P'(t) = P(t) Q</math>\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation with respect to ''t''. The solution to this equation is given by a [[matrix exponential]]\n:<math>P(t) = e^{tQ}</math>\n\nIn a simple case such as a CTMC on the state space {1,2}. The general ''Q'' matrix for such a process is the following 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2 matrix with ''\u03b1'',''\u03b2''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0\n:<math>Q = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\alpha & \\alpha \\\\ \\beta & -\\beta \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe above relation for forward matrix can be solved explicitly in this case to give\n:<math>P(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nHowever, direct solutions are complicated to compute for larger matrices. The fact that ''Q'' is the generator for a [[semigroup]] of matrices\n:<math>P(t+s) = e^{(t+s)Q} = e^{tQ} e^{sQ} = P(t) P(s)</math>\nis used.\n\n===Stationary distribution===\nThe stationary distribution for an irreducible recurrent CTMC is the probability distribution to which the process converges for large values of ''t''. Observe that for the two-state process considered earlier with P(''t'') given by\n:<math>P(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nas ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e the distribution tends to\n:<math>P_\\pi = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nObserve that each row has the same distribution as this does not depend on starting state.

There is a bidirectional secret passage between states 2 and 8.]]\nThe image to the right describes a discrete-time Markov chain with state-space {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. Meanwhile, he is being hunted by ghosts. For convenience, the maze shall be a small 3x3-grid and the monsters move randomly in horizontal and vertical directions. A secret passageway between states 2 and 8 can be used in both directions. Entries with probability zero are removed in the following transition matrix:\n\n<math>Q=\\begin{pmatrix} & \\frac{1}{2} & & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4}&&&\\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n& \\frac{1}{2} & & & & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{3} & & & & \\frac{1}{3} & & \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n& \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n& & \\frac{1}{3} & & \\frac{1}{3} & & & & \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n& & & \\frac{1}{2} & & & & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n& \\frac{1}{4} & && \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n& & & & & \\frac{1}{2} & & \\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nThis Markov chain is irreducible, because the ghosts can fly from every state to every state in a finite amount of time. Due to the secret passageway, the Markov chain is also aperiodic, because the monsters can move from any state to any state both in an even and in an uneven number of state transitions. Therefore, a unique stationary distribution exists and can be found by solving {{pi}}&nbsp;''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1. The solution of this linear equation subject to the constraint is <math>\\pi=(7.7,15.4,7.7,11.5,15.4,11.5,7.7,15.4,7.7)\\%.</math>\nThe central state and the border states 2 and 8 of the adjacent secret passageway are visited most and the corner states are visited least.\n\n===Hitting times===\n{{Main|Phase-type distribution}}The hitting time is the time, starting in a given set of states until the chain arrives in a given state or set of states. The distribution of such a time period has a phase type distribution. The simplest such distribution is that of a single exponentially distributed transition.\n\n====Expected hitting times====\nFor a subset of states ''A''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''S'', the vector ''k''<sup>''A''</sup> of hitting times (where element <math> k_i^A </math> represents the [[expected value]], starting in state ''i'' that the chain enters one of the states in the set ''A'') is the minimal non-negative solution to<ref name=\"norris2\" />\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nk_i^A = 0 & \\text{ for } i \\in A\\\\\n-\\sum_{j \\in S} q_{ij} k_j^A = 1&\\text{ for } i \\notin A.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Time reversal===\nFor a CTMC ''X''<sub>''t''</sub>, the time-reversed process is defined to be <math>\\scriptstyle \\hat X_t = X_{T-t}</math>. By [[Kelly's lemma]] this process has the same stationary distribution as the forward process.\n\nA chain is said to be reversible if the reversed process is the same as the forward process. [[Kolmogorov's criterion]] states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a process to be reversible is that the product of transition rates around a closed loop must be the same in both directions.\n\n=== Embedded Markov chain <!-- Embedded Markov chain redirects here --> ===\n\nOne method of finding the [[stationary probability distribution]], {{pi}}, of an [[ergodic]] continuous-time Markov chain, ''Q'', is by first finding its '''embedded Markov chain (EMC)'''. Strictly speaking, the EMC is a regular discrete-time Markov chain, sometimes referred to as a '''[[jump process]]'''. Each element of the one-step transition probability matrix of the EMC, ''S'', is denoted by ''s''<sub>''ij''</sub>, and represents the [[conditional probability]] of transitioning from state ''i'' into state ''j''. These conditional probabilities may be found by\n\n:<math>\ns_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{q_{ij}}{\\sum_{k \\neq i} q_{ik}} & \\text{if } i \\neq j \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nFrom this, ''S'' may be written as\n:<math>S = I - \\left( \\operatorname{diag}(Q) \\right)^{-1} Q</math>\nwhere ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] and diag(''Q'') is the [[diagonal matrix]] formed by selecting the [[main diagonal]] from the matrix ''Q'' and setting all other elements to zero.\n\nTo find the stationary probability distribution vector, we must next find <math>\\varphi</math> such that\n:<math>\\varphi S = \\varphi, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi</math> being a row vector, such that all elements in <math>\\varphi</math> are greater than 0 and [[norm (mathematics)|<math>\\|\\varphi\\|_1</math>]] = 1. From this, {{pi}} may be found as\n:<math>\\pi = {-\\varphi (\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\over \\left\\| \\varphi (\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\right\\|_1}.</math>\n\n(''S'' may be periodic, even if ''Q'' is not. Once {{pi}} is found, it must be normalized to a [[unit vector]].)\n\nAnother discrete-time process that may be derived from a continuous-time Markov chain is a \u03b4-skeleton&mdash;the (discrete-time) Markov chain formed by observing ''X''(''t'') at intervals of \u03b4 units of time. The random variables ''X''(0),&nbsp;''X''(\u03b4),&nbsp;''X''(2\u03b4),&nbsp;... give the sequence of states visited by the \u03b4-skeleton.\n\n== Special types of Markov chains ==\n\n=== Markov model ===\n{{Main|Markov model}}\nMarkov models are used to model changing systems. There are 4 main types of models, that generalize Markov chains depending on whether every sequential state is observable or not, and whether the system is to be adjusted on the basis of observations made:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n!\n!System state is fully observable\n!System state is partially observable\n|-\n!System is autonomous\n|Markov chain\n|[[Hidden Markov model]]\n|-\n!System is controlled\n|[[Markov decision process]]\n|[[Partially observable Markov decision process]]\n|}\n\n===Bernoulli scheme===\n{{Main|Bernoulli scheme}}\nA [[Bernoulli scheme]] is a special case of a Markov chain where the transition probability matrix has identical rows, which means that the next state is even independent of the current state (in addition to being independent of the past states).
