Bands applying were required to provide a pastoral reference, that is a reference from a church leader, to ensure that the core members of any act were committed Christians. In some cases individual members of a band were not Christian but Parachute saw this as a good way to involve people in the festival community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parachutefestival.com/info/faqs|title=FAQ\u2019s &#124; Parachute Music Festival 2014|publisher=Parachutefestival.com|accessdate=2015-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706160638/http://www.parachutefestival.com/info/faqs/|archive-date=2015-07-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> While many local bands from New Zealand applied, Parachute received applications from all over the world.

It is classified as a [[non-denominational]] Christian event, with enforced bans on drugs or alcohol and unmarried couples being discouraged from tenting together. However, a large number of non-Christian people did attend. Because Parachute was a [[non-denominational]] Christian festival, events such as Catholic Mass and Anglican Eucharist were often included in the festival programme.\n\nThe Festival was covered by most New Zealand media and was a well known event of the New Zealand summer. It was also supported by and been in partnerships with a number of businesses and organisations - Some examples are [[Coca-Cola]], [[Sanitarium Health Food Company|Sanitarium]], [[V (drink)|V]], [[Pepsi]], [[Vodafone New Zealand|Vodafone]] and The [[NZ Police]].\n\nParachute often partnered with charities<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.challengeweekly.co.nz/national/1998-justice-at-p12-parachute-festival-2012.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209160317/http://challengeweekly.co.nz/national/1998-justice-at-p12-parachute-festival-2012.html |archivedate=2013-02-09 }}</ref> such as, [[World Vision]].

Bands applying were required to provide a pastoral reference, that is a reference from a church leader, to ensure that the core members of any act were committed Christians. In some cases individual members of a band were not Christian but Parachute saw this as a good way to involve people in the festival community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parachutefestival.com/info/faqs|title=FAQ\u2019s &#124; Parachute Music Festival 2014|publisher=Parachutefestival.com|accessdate=2015-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706160638/http://www.parachutefestival.com/info/faqs/|archive-date=2015-07-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> While many local bands from New Zealand applied, Parachute received applications from all over the world.

It is classified as a [[non-denominational]] Christian event, with enforced bans on drugs or alcohol and unmarried couples being discouraged from tenting together. However, a large number of non-Christian people did attend. Because Parachute was a [[non-denominational]] Christian festival, events such as Catholic Mass and Anglican Eucharist were often included in the festival programme.\n\nThe Festival was covered by most New Zealand media and was a well known event of the New Zealand summer. It was also supported by and been in partnerships with a number of businesses and organisations - Some examples are [[Coca-Cola]], [[Sanitarium Health Food Company|Sanitarium]], [[V (drink)|V]], [[Pepsi]], [[Vodafone New Zealand|Vodafone]] and The [[NZ Police]].\n\nParachute often partnered with charities<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.challengeweekly.co.nz/national/1998-justice-at-p12-parachute-festival-2012.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209160317/http://challengeweekly.co.nz/national/1998-justice-at-p12-parachute-festival-2012.html |archivedate=2013-02-09 }}</ref> such as, [[World Vision]].

Marton, which consisted of Great Marton, Little Marton, Marton Fold and The Peel, was originally part of the parish of [[Poulton-le-Fylde]], before the development of Blackpool as a resort.\n\n==History==\nGreat Marton and Little Marton were collectively listed in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Meretun''.<ref name=Domesday /> The name usually means \"farmstead by a pool\", derived from the [[Old English]] words ''mere'' and ''t\u016bn''.<ref name=ADM /> Its area was estimated in that survey to be six [[carucate]]s of arable land.<ref name=Porter285 />\n\nBy no later than the end of the 11th century, [[St Chad's Church, Poulton-le-Fylde|St Chad's Church]] had been built in the nearby town of [[Poulton-le-Fylde]] and became the [[parish church]] for the area following the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century.<ref name=Storey17 /> Marton residents travelled {{convert|5|mi}} to worship at St Chad's, a journey that was difficult in winter. Around 1625, they petitioned to become a separate parish from Poulton-le-Fylde, with [[Layton, Lancashire|Layton]] and Blackpool.<ref name=Porter287 /> It was not until 1800 that their request was granted and the Church of St Paul was built in Great Marton. Originally a [[Chapel of ease|chapel]] of Poulton-le-Fylde, the church was [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1804. It later became a parish church. In 1857, the church as extended to accommodate Marton's growing population, and a tower was added.<ref name=Porter288 />\n\nIn 1894, the hamlet of Great Marton was incorporated into Blackpool and parts of Little Marton into [[St-Anne's-on-Sea]].<ref name=Farrer />\n\n==Governance==\nMarton is an [[Ward (country subdivision)|electoral ward]] in the [[borough constituency]] of [[Blackpool South (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackpool South]].

Marton, which consisted of Great Marton, Little Marton, Marton Fold and The Peel, was originally part of the parish of [[Poulton-le-Fylde]], before the development of Blackpool as a resort.\n\n==History==\nGreat Marton and Little Marton were collectively listed in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Meretun''.<ref name=Domesday /> The name usually means \"farmstead by a pool\", derived from the [[Old English]] words ''mere'' and ''t\u016bn''.<ref name=ADM /> Its area was estimated in that survey to be six [[carucate]]s of arable land.<ref name=Porter285 />\n\nBy no later than the end of the 11th century, [[St Chad's Church, Poulton-le-Fylde|St Chad's Church]] had been built in the nearby town of [[Poulton-le-Fylde]] and became the [[parish church]] for the area following the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century.<ref name=Storey17 /> Marton residents travelled {{convert|5|mi}} to worship at St Chad's, a journey that was difficult in winter. Around 1625, they petitioned to become a separate parish from Poulton-le-Fylde, with [[Layton, Lancashire|Layton]] and Blackpool.<ref name=Porter287 /> It was not until 1800 that their request was granted and the Church of St Paul was built in Great Marton. Originally a [[Chapel of ease|chapel]] of Poulton-le-Fylde, the church was [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1804. It later became a parish church. In 1857, the church as extended to accommodate Marton's growing population, and a tower was added.<ref name=Porter288 />\n\nIn 1894, the hamlet of Great Marton was incorporated into Blackpool and parts of Little Marton into [[St-Anne's-on-Sea]].<ref name=Farrer />\n\n==Governance==\nMarton is an [[Ward (country subdivision)|electoral ward]] in the [[borough constituency]] of [[Blackpool South (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackpool South]].

It is approximately {{convert|6|mi}} long and {{convert|1.5|mi}} wide.<ref name=Porter124 /> The structure of the [[Bog|moss]] is [[peat]], on top of a layer of [[clay]], in which is embedded whole (and fragments of) tree trunks. These trunks indicate that the area was once covered in dense woodland.<ref name=Porter124 />\n\n==Landmarks==\nThe original Church of St Paul was replaced by the current church, built 1908\u201309.<ref name=ChurchHist /> It is situated a few metres from the original site, on Whitegate Drive, and was designed by F.

Although dockers considered it a strike, it was strictly a dispute as the employers, Mersey Docks, sacked the dockers for breach of contract when they struck alongside their sacked Torside colleagues. Initially, five Torside workers were dismissed following a dispute regarding overtime pay, who in turn formed a picket line that other dockers refused to cross in solidarity. The dispute was never officially recognised by their union due to a ballot not being undertaken prior to the walkout, although the union did offer support financially and helped towards settlement negotiations.\n\nVarious celebrities and high-profile figures, including [[Robbie Fowler]] and [[Noel Gallagher]], expressed and showed their support during the dispute, either through public awareness or financial support. Despite the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|election success]] of a Labour government in 1997, this did not help towards ending the dispute, given the new administration failed to reverse anti-trade union legislation enacted by the former Conservative administration.\n\nThe dockers had previously been described by [[Lloyd's List]] as \"the most productive workforce in Europe\". Various settlement offers were made by Mersey Docks and subsequently rejected by the dockers during the course of the dispute. By the time a settlement was negotiated and accepted in 1998, the conflict had become one of the longest disputes in labour history.\n\n==Background==\nAt the heart of the dispute was a belief that Mersey Docks were seeking to reintroduce a casual workforce.<ref name=\"pickets_last_stand\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/pickets-last-stand-in-liverpool-docks-1523826.html |title=Pickets' last stand in Liverpool docks |work=The Independent |date=3 December 1995 |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> The [[National Dock Labour Scheme]] had been established in 1947, which became responsible for defining workers' rights, payment and training within a national dockers register; a National Dock Labour Board was also set up, comprising representatives from the unions and employers in equal measure, although in doing so afforded unions significant control over recruitment.<ref name=\"dock_labour_scheme_portcities\">{{cite web |url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.112/chapterId/2364/Labour-unrest-in-the-port-after-1889.html |title=The National Dock Labour Scheme and labour relations after 1945 |publisher=Portcities London |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref> The scheme, which had protected employment terms and conditions as well as wages and benefits, was abolished in 1989, a decision which was opposed by unions who called a national dock strike against the abolition, yet was defeated and followed with many dock unions becoming derecognised.{{sfn|Mukul|1998|p=1612}} Liverpool was the last port to cease strike action against the dispute.<ref name=\"no_going_back\"/> Prior to the scheme's dissolution, dockers had described going to work as \"a real pleasure\" in a \"more relaxed atmosphere\", although hard work was still expected and earnings had to be fought for.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=210}} Following the scheme's abolishment, Mersey Docks assured dockers that casual labour would not return to the docklands and continued, albeit alone amongst ports across Britain, to recognise the dockers' union.<ref name=\"pickets_last_stand\"/>\n\nAn aggressive stance was adopted by Mersey Docks towards its relations with the dockers, with regulations being introduced towards the end of the 1980s requiring dockers to be available for work at all times, including days off.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=211}} Dockworkers saw their living standards and income gradually eroded in order to ensure that trade union relations with dock companies remained cost-effective. From 1983 to 1989, docker numbers nationally fell to 9400 from 14,631, whilst the tonnage workload that each docker handled increased three-fold.<ref name=\"hard_lessons\"/>\n\nAs dockers retired, their jobs were typically replaced by [[Subcontractor|sub-contracted]] workers under different working conditions, typically with Torside Limited. Between 1989\u20131992, around 80% of dockers left the industry, whilst the number of employees between 1989\u20131995 fell by over half, from 1100 to 500.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=213}} Whilst docker numbers decreased, the volumes handled by the port were increasing, from around 20 million tonnes in 1988 to over 30 million tonnes in 1997. The number of Liverpool dockers employed was in stark contrast to 12,000 employed during the 1960s, although this had dropped to 6000 by 1980. Workers wanting to enter the dock trade, which often included the sons of established dockers, had to do so via sub-contracted firms due to the lack of jobs available. The conditions of these jobs would ultimately create the conditions that resulted in the dispute.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=214}}\n\nIn 1993, Mersey Docks worked towards imposing harsher employment contracts, including more working hours that required dockers to be available \"at any time\", knowing it would be rejected by the dockers and their union alike. To ensure dockers accepted the revised contracts, Mersey Docks advertised new jobs locally, receiving thousands of applications and interviewing many, yet no single individual was employed on a permanent basis. In a state of confusion and apprehension, dockers accepted the new contracts, despite initially rejecting them outright. From this period through to the start of the dispute, individual dock workers were harassed and intimidated for various reasons and by 1995, 170 faced disciplinary proceedings.{{sfn|Mukul|1998|p=1613}} Many of the dockers felt their lives were restricted by the unstructured working hours, which may have involved little to no notice requirement to work during the night. Surveys of the time showed that the new procedures were taking its toll on the workforce and affecting morale, whilst over 85% were concerned about the longer working hours. Of those surveyed, over half felt that standards of health and safety were severely compromised, as rates of accidents increased.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=213}}\n\n==Sequence of events==\n===Dispute origins===\nOn 25 September 1995, sub-contractor Torside Limited were in dispute with its workers regarding overtime pay, which resulted in five employees being dismissed.<ref name=\"no_going_back\"/> The sacked dockers formed a [[Picketing (protest)|picket line]] which fellow dockers refused to cross, ultimately resulting in the company dismissing all 80 of its workforce.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=215}}<ref name=\"livecho_timeline_sep15\">{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/what-1995-1998-liverpool-docks-10079401 |title=What was the 1995\u20131998 Liverpool docks dispute all about? |work=Liverpool Echo |date=20 September 2015 |access-date=28 January 2019}}</ref> Dockers directly employed by Mersey Docks similarly refused to cross the picket line in support of their fellow dockers and were also dismissed from employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-docks-dispute-20-years-10077766|title=Liverpool docks dispute 20 years on: Part One \u2013 How dockers paid with their jobs for refusing to cross a picket line|date=20 September 2015|accessdate=12 September 2017|publisher=Liverpool Echo}}</ref> Whilst picketing, dockers were surrounded by police and private security guards, yet stood firm, buoyed by support from musicians and footballers, to name but a few, defying Mersey Docks' strategy of waiting until the pickets diminished.{{sfn|Mukul|1998|p=1612}}\n\nSome dockers were offered new contracts, subject to alteration by the Mersey Docks. Without a ballot being held, the union declared unofficial strike action<ref name=\"strike_timeline_mirror\"/> with dockers in breach of contract. Mersey Docks terminated contracts and advertised for replacement labour within 24 hours, albeit at lower rates of pay and under different contractual conditions.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=215}} An offer was made by Mersey Docks the following month for \u00a310,000 per docker, which was rejected.<ref name=\"livecho_timeline_sep15\"/> [[Lloyd's List]] had previously described the dockers as \"the most productive workforce in Europe\".<ref name=\"strike_timeline_mirror\"/>\n\n===Support and public campaign===\n[[File:Official_portrait_of_Lord_Morris_of_Handsworth_crop_2.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Official

Morris]], expressed a desire to support the dockers by voting to establish a hardship fund and welcomed promises by foreign unions to boycott ships using the Merseyside terminals.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=217}} In December 1995, three sacked dockers formed a picket line in [[New York City|New York]] which local workers refused to cross.<ref name=\"livecho_timeline_sep15\"/> The timing of the dispute coincided with the emergence of the [[world wide web]], with dockers among the first to embrace the technology to communicate their plight beyond the national media.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=219-220}} After 14 months, the dispute had been running longer than the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|miners' strike of 1984-85]].{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=218}}\n\nThroughout the dispute, dockers waged a high-profile public campaign for their reinstatement and allied themselves with dockers worldwide and support groups such as [[Reclaim the Streets]].<ref name=\"strike_timeline_mirror\"/> Organised workers were generally unwilling to take solidarity action through fear of victimisation, with bitter defeats such as that of the 1985 miner's strike still fresh in memory.<ref name=\"hard_lessons\"/> A Mersey Docks spokesman suggested in July 1996 that the dispute was \"winding down\", claiming the new workforce were 30\u201340 per cent more productive.<ref name=\"independent_aclresume\"/> Around this time, dockers rejected an offer via postal ballot to reinstate 40 jobs, with a payoff settlement of \u00a325,000

suggested the resistance from dockers in not holding a secret ballot was hindering progress talks.<ref name=\"mdhc800k\"/> Hopes of a resolution were high upon the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|election]] of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government in 1997 given their 14% financial share in Mersey Docks, although the dockers were unaware that the new Government would seek to retain previous economic policies and offer no help towards resolving the dispute.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=219}} The country's trade union establishment made its expression of contempt clear during the 1997 [[Trades Union Congress]] annual conference, suggesting the only place for dockers who had sought support of trade unionists worldwide was \"on the pavement outside the hall, with a collection bucket\".{{sfn|Pilger|2010|p=357}}\n\nIn the latter part of 1997, [[Merseyside Police]] increased their presence and actions towards dockers picketing, with 13 dockers arrested in the weeks around August 1997, three of whom were [[shop steward]]s, whilst other dockers who had previously been arrested were prohibited by bail conditions from being within 25 foot of the picket line.<ref

dockers. In October 1997, Morris ordered a postal [[secret ballot]] to determine whether the dockers would accept a \u00a328,000 settlement redundancy package ({{Inflation|UK|28000|1997|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}); of the 310 ballots counted, only 97 ballots, representing just under a third of responses, voted to accept, with the rest declining. Following the ballot, Mersey Docks made the same offer on an individual basis for a limited period of time, with assurances that it would remain confidential.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=225}}\n\nOn 26 January 1998, the dockers ultimately accepted a settlement and continuity of pensions but without job reinstatement.{{sfn|Mukul|1998|p=1612}} The settlement was limited to around two-thirds of the former workforce, with the other third receiving financial support from the sale of a music CD titled \"Rock The Dock\".<ref name=\"independent_revolution\"/> At a length of two and a half years, the dispute became one of the longest in British industrial relations history.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=215}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nWhilst strike failed in its declared objectives, it was successful in providing a modern example of strong [[Social Movement Unionism]] in the [[United Kingdom]], with the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] describing Liverpool as \"symbolic of the collective solidarity inside the working class movement\". The [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party]], known as the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant tendency]] prior to 1997, claimed nothing further could have been done, suggesting that \"the union needs reclaiming\" for the working class.<ref name=\"hardlessons\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1998/02/live-f14.html |title=Hard lessons from the Liverpool docks lock-out |publisher=World Socialist Web Site |date=14 February 1998 |access-date=4 January 2019}}</ref> There is no single reason for the length of the dispute, although the area's militant history of trade unionism, coupled with a lack of other jobs the dockers could take, were contributing factors.<ref name=\"no_going_back\"/>\n\n[[File:The Casa.jpg|thumb|190px|The Casa on Hope Street, Liverpool]]\nFollowing the dispute, some dockers bought a semi-derelict bar named The Casablanca on Hope Street in Liverpool City Centre, later renamed to The Casa.<ref name=\"strike_timeline_mirror\"/> The bar was purchased using the \u00a3130,000 fee received from writing a television drama about the events and was opened as a community hub that offered advice and help for those in need.

In 2012, General Secretary of [[Unite the Union]] [[Len McCluskey]], himself a former dockworker, invited sacked dockers to return to the docks for the first time since the dispute ended. The intention was to help bring unionization back to the docks by offering sacked dockers the opportunity to share their experience and knowledge with the 280 dockworkers in Liverpool.{{sfn|Mah|2014|p=98}}\n\n==Union involvement==\nThe union did not officially recognise the dispute, justifying their stance by suggesting anti-union laws prevented them from further involvement. The union was keen to avoid financial penalties and wanted to ensure a continued working relationship with Mersey Docks. All aspects of the dispute were controlled and managed by the union, via the Shop Stewards Committee, which declared full solidarity with the leadership.<ref name=\"hard_lessons\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1998/02/live-f14.html |title=Hard lessons from the Liverpool docks lock-out |publisher=World Socialist Web Site |date=14 February 1998 |access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Despite this, within 18 months, relations between the union and dockers had deteriorated, in particular with Bill Morris, who came under scrutiny for misleading statements.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=217}} Although the union did not officially support the dispute, it is believed to have contributed up to \u00a3700,000 ({{Inflation|UK|700000|1998|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) towards the dockers' hardship fund and supported them with premises towards helping to negotiate a settlement.<ref name=\"morris_traitor_film\"/>\n\nOne docker discovered through a discussion with the General Secretary of the [[Fire Brigades Union]] that they had been willing to grant dockers an interest free loan of \u00a3250,000 ({{Inflation|UK|250000|1996|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) to help towards running costs, yet the dockers' own General Secretary had blocked it, indicating the disparity in support between other trade unions and the dockers' own union.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=218}} The dispute leaders sought no industrial support from other unions, instead opting to organise an international campaign in the hope of gaining support and backing from worldwide trade unions. Whilst the objective in seeking international support was to hope Mersey Docks backtracked on their stance to casualise the workforce, the ultimate consequence was isolation of the dockers, particularly at a national level.<ref name=\"hard_lessons\"/>\n\n==Responses==\n===Media coverage===\nThe national press did not start covering the dispute until around two months after it started. The [[BBC]]'s Liverpool correspondent, Kevin Bocquet, disclosed that he had covered the dispute in only four pieces for television and radio apiece within the first fourteen months of the dispute, suggesting editors found it less than appealing to cover the news as they questioned how it affected the economy.{{sfn|Pilger|2010|p=354}} Initially, little was published about the dispute among the national media, who tended to portray the dockers as \"dinosaurs from another age\".{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=219}} The national media did not take notice until international organisations became aware via internet communication channels, who offered their support, whilst observers at the time suggested that British newspapers only started covering the dispute once the international press became aware and converged upon Liverpool.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=220}}\n\nThe internet offered an opportunity for dockers to engage with worldwide trade unionists without needing to channel messages via their own union and government. Dockers concluded within the first few months that their best chance to gain support was by spreading their message globally and hoping dockers worldwide supported their plight, such as boycotting ships sailing to or from Liverpool. Picket lines abroad were also arranged to work around the legal restrictions of setting up secondary picket lines in Britain.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=220}}\n\nUntil late 1996, ITV show [[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]] was broadcast at Liverpool's [[Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool|Albert Dock]], yet failed to mention or discuss the dispute and struggles of dockers picketing just miles away from the studio; when questioned, the programme producer suggested that \"people just don't want to know\".{{sfn|Pilger|2010|p=354}}\n\n===Political reaction===\n[[File:Tony Blair in 2002.jpg|thumb|150px|Tony Blair in 2002]]\nIn late 1997, the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|newly elected]] [[Blair ministry|Labour Government]] discarded appeals to its leadership and former hard-left to reverse anti-trade union legislation enacted by the former Conservative administration.<ref name=\"no_going_back\"/> Appeals from dockers for Labour to use its 14% share in Mersey Docks to help towards their reinstatement were unsuccessful. Consequently, it brought about a request from the government for the union leader Bill Morris to hastily end the dispute, at the former dockers' expense, with the termination of all hardship payments and the acceptance that the jobs would not be reinstated.<ref name=\"hard_lessons\"/> [[Tony Blair]] believed the dockers were ultimately responsible for the defeat through an unwillingness to alter their own views and \"long-standing abuse of monopoly power\".{{sfn|Lees|2013|p=214}} and would later provoke a trade dispute in 2002 following the collapse of relations with union bosses with his stance on the [[UK firefighter dispute 2002\u201303|2002 firefighter's dispute]]; Bill Morris suggested around this time that it was difficult to find differences between the Labour and Conservative parties.<ref name=\"blair_unions_2002\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-to-dismiss-union-demands-for-changes-to-recognition-law-135604.html |title=Blair to dismiss union demands for changes to recognition law |publisher=The Independent |date=11 December 2002 |access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Worldwide solidarity===\n[[File:Atlantic Sun.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Atlantic Container Lines ship]]\nDockers worldwide aligned themselves in support and solidarity of the Liverpool dockers.<ref name=\"solidarity_alive_mirror\"/> In December 1995, three months after the start of the dispute, dockers in [[New York City|New York]] refused to cross a picket line set up by three Liverpool dockers and nearly cost Liverpool the business of American shipping company [[Atlantic Container Line|Atlantic Containers]], who threatened to pull out of the port.<ref name=\"livecho_timeline_sep15\"/> The shipping company, then one of Mersey Docks' largest customers with an estimated annual value of \u00a34 million ({{inflation|UK|4000000|1996|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}), ultimately did pull out of the port in June 1996, citing the sympathy action taken by American dockers, although resumed services the following month.<ref name=\"independent_aclresume\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/dockers-to-continue-mersey-campaign-1330269.html |title=Dockers to continue Mersey campaign |publisher=The Independent |date=24 July 1996 |access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref> On 20 January 1997, almost a year before the dispute would end, the dockers designated it the day of \"international solidarity\", with solidarity actions in around 27 countries including unlawful work standstills.

Although dockers considered it a strike, it was strictly a dispute as the employers, Mersey Docks, sacked the dockers for breach of contract when they struck alongside their sacked Torside colleagues. Initially, five Torside workers were dismissed following a dispute regarding overtime pay, who in turn formed a picket line that other dockers refused to cross in solidarity. The dispute was never officially recognised by their union due to a ballot not being undertaken prior to the walkout, although the union did offer support financially and helped towards settlement negotiations.\n\nVarious celebrities and high-profile figures, including [[Robbie Fowler]] and [[Noel Gallagher]], expressed and showed their support during the dispute, either through public awareness or financial support. Despite the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|election success]] of a Labour government in 1997, this did not help towards ending the dispute, given the new administration failed to reverse anti-trade union legislation enacted by the former Conservative administration.\n\nThe dockers had previously been described by [[Lloyd's List]] as \"the most productive workforce in Europe\". Various settlement offers were made by Mersey Docks and subsequently rejected by the dockers during the course of the dispute. By the time a settlement was negotiated and accepted in 1998, the conflict had become one of the longest disputes in labour history.\n\n==Background==\nAt the heart of the dispute was a belief that Mersey Docks were seeking to reintroduce a casual workforce.<ref name=\"pickets_last_stand\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/pickets-last-stand-in-liverpool-docks-1523826.html |title=Pickets' last stand in Liverpool docks |work=The Independent |date=3 December 1995 |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> The [[National Dock Labour Scheme]] had been established in 1947, which became responsible for defining workers' rights, payment and training within a national dockers register; a National Dock Labour Board was also set up, comprising representatives from the unions and employers in equal measure, although in doing so afforded unions significant control over recruitment.<ref name=\"dock_labour_scheme_portcities\">{{cite web |url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.112/chapterId/2364/Labour-unrest-in-the-port-after-1889.html |title=The National Dock Labour Scheme and labour relations after 1945 |publisher=Portcities London |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref> The scheme, which had protected employment terms and conditions as well as wages and benefits, was abolished in 1989, a decision which was opposed by unions who called a national dock strike against the abolition, yet was defeated and followed with many dock unions becoming derecognised.{{sfn|Mukul|1998|p=1612}} Liverpool was the last port to cease strike action against the dispute.<ref name=\"no_going_back\"/> Prior to the scheme's dissolution, dockers had described going to work as \"a real pleasure\" in a \"more relaxed atmosphere\", although hard work was still expected and earnings had to be fought for.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=210}} Following the scheme's abolishment, Mersey Docks assured dockers that casual labour would not return to the docklands and continued, albeit alone amongst ports across Britain, to recognise the dockers' union.<ref name=\"pickets_last_stand\"/>\n\nAn aggressive stance was adopted by Mersey Docks towards its relations with the dockers, with regulations being introduced towards the end of the 1980s requiring dockers to be available for work at all times, including days off.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=211}} Dockworkers saw their living standards and income gradually eroded in order to ensure that trade union relations with dock companies remained cost-effective. From 1983 to 1989, docker numbers nationally fell to 9400 from 14,631, whilst the tonnage workload that each docker handled increased three-fold.<ref name=\"hard_lessons\"/>\n\nAs dockers retired, their jobs were typically replaced by [[Subcontractor|sub-contracted]] workers under different working conditions, typically with Torside Limited. Between 1989\u20131992, around 80% of dockers left the industry, whilst the number of employees between 1989-1995 fell by over half, from 1100 to 500.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=213}} Whilst docker numbers decreased, the volumes handled by the port were increasing, from around 20 million tonnes in 1988 to over 30 million tonnes in 1997. The number of Liverpool dockers employed was in stark contrast to 12,000 employed during the 1960s, although this had dropped to 6000 by 1980. Workers wanting to enter the dock trade, which often included the sons of established dockers, had to do so via sub-contracted firms due to the lack of jobs available. The conditions of these jobs would ultimately create the conditions that resulted in the dispute.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=214}}\n\nIn 1993, Mersey Docks worked towards imposing harsher employment contracts, including more working hours that required dockers to be available \"at any time\", knowing it would be rejected by the dockers and their union alike. To ensure dockers accepted the revised contracts, Mersey Docks advertised new jobs locally, receiving thousands of applications and interviewing many, yet no single individual was employed on a permanent basis. In a state of confusion and apprehension, dockers accepted the new contracts, despite initially rejecting them outright. From this period through to the start of the dispute, individual dock workers were harassed and intimidated for various reasons and by 1995, 170 faced disciplinary proceedings.{{sfn|Mukul|1998|p=1613}} Many of the dockers felt their lives were restricted by the unstructured working hours, which may have involved little to no notice requirement to work during the night. Surveys of the time showed that the new procedures were taking its toll on the workforce and affecting morale, whilst over 85% were concerned about the longer working hours. Of those surveyed, over half felt that standards of health and safety were severely compromised, as rates of accidents increased.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=213}}\n\n==Sequence of events==\n===Dispute origins===\nOn 25 September 1995, sub-contractor Torside Limited were in dispute with its workers regarding overtime pay, which resulted in five employees being dismissed.<ref name=\"no_going_back\"/> The sacked dockers formed a [[Picketing (protest)|picket line]] which fellow dockers refused to cross, ultimately resulting in the company dismissing all 80 of its workforce.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=215}}<ref name=\"livecho_timeline_sep15\">{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/what-1995-1998-liverpool-docks-10079401 |title=What was the 1995-1998 Liverpool docks dispute all about? |work=Liverpool Echo |date=20 September 2015 |access-date=28 January 2019}}</ref> Dockers directly employed by Mersey Docks similarly refused to cross the picket line in support of their fellow dockers and were also dismissed from employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-docks-dispute-20-years-10077766|title=Liverpool docks dispute 20 years on: Part One - How dockers paid with their jobs for refusing to cross a picket line|date=20 September 2015|accessdate=12 September 2017|publisher=Liverpool Echo}}</ref> Whilst picketing, dockers were surrounded by police and private security guards, yet stood firm, buoyed by support from musicians and footballers, to name but a few, defying Mersey Docks' strategy of waiting until the pickets diminished.{{sfn|Mukul|1998|p=1612}}\n\nSome dockers were offered new contracts, subject to alteration by the Mersey Docks. Without a ballot being held, the union declared unofficial strike action<ref name=\"strike_timeline_mirror\"/> with dockers in breach of contract. Mersey Docks terminated contracts and advertised for replacement labour within 24 hours, albeit at lower rates of pay and under different contractual conditions.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=215}} An offer was made by Mersey Docks the following month for \u00a310,000 per docker, which was rejected.<ref name=\"livecho_timeline_sep15\"/> [[Lloyd's List]] had previously described the dockers as \"the most productive workforce in Europe\".<ref name=\"strike_timeline_mirror\"/>\n\n===Support and public campaign===\n[[File:Official_portrait_of_Lord_Morris_of_Handsworth_crop_2.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Official portrait of [[Bill Morris, Baron Morris of Handsworth|Bill Morris]]]]\nWithin 3 months, the leader of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]], [[Bill Morris, Baron Morris of Handsworth|Bill Morris]], expressed a desire to support the dockers by voting to establish a hardship fund and welcomed promises by foreign unions to boycott ships using the Merseyside terminals.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=217}} In December 1995, three sacked dockers formed a picket line in [[New York City|New York]] which local workers refused to cross.<ref name=\"livecho_timeline_sep15\"/> The timing of the dispute coincided with the emergence of the [[world wide web]], with dockers among the first to embrace the technology to communicate their plight beyond the national media.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=219-220}} After 14 months, the dispute had been running longer than the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|miners' strike of 1984-85]].{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=218}}\n\nThroughout the dispute, dockers waged a high-profile public campaign for their reinstatement and allied themselves with dockers worldwide and support groups such as [[Reclaim the Streets]].<ref name=\"strike_timeline_mirror\"/> Organised workers were generally unwilling to take solidarity action through fear of victimisation, with bitter defeats such as that of the 1985 miner's strike still fresh in memory.<ref name=\"hard_lessons\"/> A Mersey Docks spokesman suggested in July 1996 that the dispute was \"winding down\", claiming the new workforce were 30-40 per cent more productive.<ref name=\"independent_aclresume\"/> Around this time, dockers rejected an offer via postal ballot to reinstate 40 jobs, with a payoff settlement of \u00a325,000 offered for the rest of the sacked workforce.<ref name=\"mdhc800k\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/docks-dispute-cost-mersey-pounds-800000-1280735.html |title=Docks

name=\"independent_revolution\"/>\n\n===Latter stages===\nMersey Docks' then chief executive, Trevor Furlong, suggested talks towards reaching a settlement were ongoing in February 1997, although suggested the resistance from dockers in not holding a secret ballot was hindering progress talks.<ref name=\"mdhc800k\"/> Hopes of a resolution were high upon the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|election]] of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government in 1997 given their 14% financial share in Mersey Docks, although the dockers were unaware that the new Government would seek to retain previous economic policies and offer no help towards resolving the dispute.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=219}} The country's trade union establishment made its expression of contempt clear during the 1997 [[Trades Union Congress]] annual conference, suggesting the only place for dockers who had sought support of trade unionists worldwide was \"on the pavement outside the hall, with a collection bucket\".{{sfn|Pilger|2010|p=357}}\n\nIn the latter part of 1997, [[Merseyside Police]] increased their presence and actions towards dockers picketing, with 13 dockers arrested in the weeks around August 1997, three of whom were [[shop steward]]s, whilst other dockers who had previously been arrested were prohibited by bail conditions from being within 25 foot of the picket line.<ref

Weekly |date=6 August 1997 |access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Settlement===\nMersey Docks made numerous offers throughout the course of the dispute, which were all voted down by the picketing dockers. In October 1997, Morris ordered a postal [[secret ballot]] to determine whether the dockers would accept a \u00a328,000 settlement redundancy package ({{Inflation|UK|28000|1997|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}); of the 310 ballots counted, only 97 ballots, representing just under a third of responses, voted to accept, with the rest declining. Following the ballot, Mersey Docks made the same offer on an individual basis for a limited period of time, with assurances that it would remain confidential.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=225}}\n\nOn 26 January 1998, the dockers ultimately accepted a settlement and continuity of pensions but without job reinstatement.{{sfn|Mukul|1998|p=1612}} The settlement was limited to around two-thirds of the former workforce, with the other third receiving financial support from the sale of a music CD titled \"Rock The Dock\".<ref name=\"independent_revolution\"/> At a length of two and a half years, the dispute became one of the longest in British industrial relations history.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=215}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nWhilst strike failed in its declared objectives, it was successful in providing a modern example of strong [[Social Movement Unionism]] in the [[United Kingdom]], with the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] describing Liverpool as \"symbolic of the collective solidarity inside the working class movement\". The [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party]], known as the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant tendency]] prior to 1997, claimed nothing further could have been done, suggesting that \"the union needs reclaiming\" for the working class.<ref name=\"hardlessons\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1998/02/live-f14.html |title=Hard lessons from the Liverpool docks lock-out |publisher=World Socialist Web Site |date=14 February 1998 |access-date=4 January 2019}}</ref> There is no single reason for the length of the dispute, although the area's militant history of trade unionism, coupled with a lack of other jobs the dockers could take, were contributing factors.<ref name=\"no_going_back\"/>\n\n[[File:The Casa.jpg|thumb|190px|The Casa on Hope Street, Liverpool]]\nFollowing the dispute, some dockers bought a semi-derelict bar named The Casablanca on Hope Street in Liverpool City Centre, later renamed to The Casa.<ref name=\"strike_timeline_mirror\"/> The bar was purchased using the \u00a3130,000 fee received from writing a television drama about the events and was opened as a community hub that offered advice and help for those in need. Between the years 2000\u20132015, an estimated \u00a310 million worth of free advice was offered to people in desperate need.<ref name=\"solidarity_alive_mirror\">{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/keeping-spirit-solidarity-alive-20-4992151 |title=Keeping the spirit of solidarity alive 20 years after Robbie Fowler backed Liverpool dockers |work=The Mirror |date=16 January 2015 |access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref> The funding source is primarily from the main bar, whilst small offices on the upper floors provide support and training facilities.{{sfn|Mah|2014|p=96}}\n\nWith the passage of time, the bitterness felt among dockworkers had reduced. In 2012, General Secretary of [[Unite the Union]] [[Len McCluskey]], himself a former dockworker, invited sacked dockers to return to the docks for the first time since the dispute ended. The intention was to help bring unionization back to the docks by offering sacked dockers the opportunity to share their experience and knowledge with the 280 dockworkers in Liverpool.{{sfn|Mah|2014|p=98}}\n\n==Union involvement==\nThe union did not officially recognise the dispute, justifying their stance by suggesting anti-union laws prevented them from further involvement. The union was keen to avoid financial penalties and wanted to ensure a continued working relationship with Mersey Docks. All aspects of the dispute were controlled and managed by the union, via the Shop Stewards Committee, which declared full solidarity with the leadership.<ref name=\"hard_lessons\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1998/02/live-f14.html |title=Hard lessons from the Liverpool docks lock-out |publisher=World Socialist Web Site |date=14 February 1998 |access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Despite this, within 18 months, relations between the union and dockers had deteriorated, in particular with Bill Morris, who came under scrutiny for misleading statements.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=217}} Although the union did not officially support the dispute, it is believed to have contributed up to \u00a3700,000 ({{Inflation|UK|700000|1998|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) towards the dockers' hardship fund and supported them with premises towards helping to negotiate a settlement.<ref name=\"morris_traitor_film\"/>\n\nOne docker discovered through a discussion with the General Secretary of the [[Fire Brigades Union]] that they had been willing to grant dockers an interest free loan of \u00a3250,000 ({{Inflation|UK|250000|1996|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) to help towards running costs, yet the dockers' own General Secretary had blocked it, indicating the disparity in support between other trade unions and the dockers' own union.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=218}} The dispute leaders sought no industrial support from other unions, instead opting to organise an international campaign in the hope of gaining support and backing from worldwide trade unions. Whilst the objective in seeking international support was to hope Mersey Docks backtracked on their stance to casualise the workforce, the ultimate consequence was isolation of the dockers, particularly at a national level.<ref name=\"hard_lessons\"/>\n\n==Responses==\n===Media coverage===\nThe national press did not start covering the dispute until around two months after it started. The [[BBC]]'s Liverpool correspondent, Kevin Bocquet, disclosed that he had covered the dispute in only four pieces for television and radio apiece within the first fourteen months of the dispute, suggesting editors found it less than appealing to cover the news as they questioned how it affected the economy.{{sfn|Pilger|2010|p=354}} Initially, little was published about the dispute among the national media, who tended to portray the dockers as \"dinosaurs from another age\".{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=219}} The national media did not take notice until international organisations became aware via internet communication channels, who offered their support, whilst observers at the time suggested that British newspapers only started covering the dispute once the international press became aware and converged upon Liverpool.{{sfn|Marren|2016|p=220}}\n\nThe internet offered an opportunity for dockers to engage with worldwide trade unionists without needing to channel messages via their own union and government. Dockers concluded within the first few months that their best chance to gain support was by spreading their message globally and hoping dockers worldwide supported their plight, such as boycotting ships sailing to or from Liverpool.

This is not only a 'British' question. We express our deepest gratitude to waterfront workers acting in solidarity, but they are also acting on their behalf.
