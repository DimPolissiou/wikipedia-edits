This is because the grammar of the language requires that the verb and its [[subject (grammar)|subject]] agree in ''person''. The pronouns ''I'' and ''he'' are first and third person respectively, as are the verb forms ''am'' and ''is''.

Some categories that commonly trigger grammatical agreement are noted below.\n\n===Person===\nAgreement based on [[grammatical person]] is found mostly between [[verb]] and [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. An example from English (''I am'' vs. ''he is'') has been given in the introduction to this article.\n\nAgreement between pronoun (or corresponding [[possessive adjective]]) and antecedent also requires the selection of the correct person. For example, if the antecedent is the first person noun phrase ''Mary and I'', then a first person pronoun (''we/us/our'') is required; however, most noun phrases (''the dog'', ''my cats'', ''Jack and Jill'', etc.) are third person, and are replaced by a third person pronoun (''he/she/it/they'' etc.).\n\n===Number===\nAgreement based on [[grammatical number]] can occur between verb and subject, as in the case of grammatical person discussed above. In fact the two categories are often conflated within [[verb conjugation]] patterns: there are specific verb forms for first person singular, second person plural and so on. Some examples:\n* ''<u>I</u> really <u>am</u>'' (1st pers. singular) vs. ''<u>We</u> really <u>are</u>'' (1st pers. plural)\n* ''The boy sing<u>s</u>'' (3rd pers. singular) vs. ''The boy<u>s</u> sing'' (3rd pers. plural)\n\nAgain as with person, there is agreement in number between pronouns (or their corresponding possessives) and antecedents: \n* ''The girl did <u>her</u> job'' vs. ''The girl<u>s</u> did <u>their</u> job''\n\nAgreement also occurs between nouns and their [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] and [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s, in some situations. This is common in languages such as French and Spanish, where [[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[determiners]] and [[adjective]]s (both attributive and predicative) agree in number with the nouns they qualify:\n* ''<u>le</u> grand homme'' (\"the great man\") vs. ''<u>les</u> grand<u>s</u> homme<u>s</u>'' (\"the great men\")\n*<u>''el''</u> ''hombre alto'' (\"the tall man\") vs. ''<u>los</u> hombre<u>s</u> alto<u>s</u>'' (\"the tall men\")\n\nIn English this is not such a common feature, although there are certain determiners that occur specifically with singular or plural nouns only:\n*''<u>One</u> big car'' vs. ''<u>Two</u> big car<u>s</u>''\n*''<u>Much</u> great work'' vs. ''<u>Many</u> great work<u>s</u>''\n\n===Gender===\nIn languages in which [[grammatical gender]] plays a significant role, there is often agreement in gender between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in [[French grammar|French]]:\n*''<u>le</u> grand homme'' (\"the big man\"; ''homme'' is masculine) vs. ''<u>la</u> grand<u>e</u> chaise'' (\"the big chair\"; ''chaise'' is feminine)\nSuch agreement is also found with [[predicate adjective]]s: ''l'homme est grand'' (\"the man is big\") vs. ''la chaise est grand<u>e</u>'' (\"the chair is big\"). (However, in some languages, such as [[German grammar|German]], this is not the case; only attributive modifiers show agreement.)\n\nIn the case of verbs, gender agreement is less common, although it may still occur. For example, in the French compound past tense, the past participle agrees in certain circumstances with the subject or with an object (see ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'' for details). In [[Russian grammar|Russian]] and most other [[Slavic languages]], the form of the past tense agrees in gender with the subject.\n\nThere is also agreement in gender between pronouns and antecedents. Examples of this can be found in English (although English pronouns principally follow natural gender rather than grammatical gender):\n*''The <u>man</u> reached <u>his</u> destination'' vs. ''The <u>ship</u> reached <u>her</u>/<u>its</u> destination''\nFor more detail see [[Gender in English]].\n\n===Case===\nIn languages that have a system of [[grammatical case|cases]], there is often agreement by case between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in [[German grammar|German]]:\n*''<u>der</u> gut<u>e</u> Mann'' (\"the good man\", [[nominative]] case) vs. ''<u>des</u> gut<u>en</u> Mann<u>(e)s</u>'' (\"of the good man\", [[genitive]] case)\nIn fact, the modifiers of nouns in languages such as German and [[Latin]] agree with their nouns in number, gender and case; all three categories are conflated together in paradigms of [[declension]].\n\nCase agreement is not a significant feature of English (only [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] and the pronoun [[who (pronoun)|''who'']] have any case marking). Agreement between such pronouns can sometimes be observed:\n*''<u>Who</u> came first \u2013 <u>he</u> or his brother?'' vs. ''<u>Whom</u> did you see \u2013 <u>him</u> or his brother?''\n\n=== Alliterative agreement ===\nA rare type of agreement that phonologically copies parts of the head rather than agreeing with a [[grammatical category]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staticweb.hum.uu.nl/medewerkers/alexis.dimitriadis/papers/allit-glow97.pdf|title=Alliterative Concord in Phonology-Free Syntax|last=Dimitriadis|first=Alexis}}</ref> For example, in [[Banyum language|Bainouk]]:\n\n''<u>ka</u>tama-\u014b\u0254 in-<u>ka</u> / <u>ka</u>tama-<u>\u0101</u>-\u014b\u0254 in-<u>ka</u>-<u>\u0101</u>''\n\n''river-prox. this / river-pl-prox. these''\n\nIn this example, what is copied is not a prefix, but rather the initial syllable of the head \"river\".\n\n==By language==\nLanguages can have no conventional agreement whatsoever, as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Malay language|Malay]]; barely any, as in [[English language|English]]; a small amount, as in spoken [[French language|French]]; a moderate amount, as in [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin language|Latin]]; or a large amount, as in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].\n\n===English===\nModern English does not have a particularly large amount of agreement, although it is present.\n\nApart from verbs, the main examples are the determiners \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d, which become \u201cthese\u201d and \u201cthose\u201d respectively when the following noun is plural:\n: ''this woman'' \u2014 ''these women''\n: ''that dog'' \u2014 ''those dogs''\n\nAll [[English verbs|regular verbs]] (and nearly all [[English irregular verbs|irregular]] ones) in English agree in the third-person singular of the present [[indicative]] by adding a [[Affix|suffix]] of either ''-s'' or ''-es''.  The latter is generally used after stems ending in the [[sibilant]]s ''sh'', ''ch'', ''ss'' or ''zz'' (e.g. ''he rushes'', ''it lurches'', ''she amasses'', ''it buzzes''.)\n\nPresent tense of ''to love'':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''I love''|| ''we love''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''you love''|| ''you love''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''he/she/it love'''s'''''|| ''they love''\n|}\n\nThere are not many irregularities in this formation:\n* ''to have'','' to go'' and ''to do'' render ''has'', ''goes'' and ''does''.\n\nThe highly irregular verb ''to be'' is the only verb with more agreement than this in the present tense.\n\nPresent tense of ''to be'':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''I am''|| ''we are''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''you are''|| ''you are''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''he/she/it is''|| ''they are''\n|}\n\nIn English, [[defective verb]]s generally show no agreement for person or number, they include the [[modal verb]]s: ''can'', ''may'', ''shall'', ''will'', ''must'', ''should'', ''ought''.\n\nIn [[Early Modern English]] agreement existed for the second person singular of all verbs in the present tense, as well as in the past tense of some common verbs.  This was usually in the form ''-est'', but ''-st'' and ''-t'' also occurred.  Note that this does not affect the endings for other persons and numbers.\n\nExample present tense forms: ''thou wilt'', ''thou shalt'', ''thou art'', ''thou hast'', ''thou canst''.\nExample past tense forms: ''thou wouldst'', ''thou shouldst'', ''thou wast'', ''thou hadst'', ''thou couldst''\n\nNote also the agreement shown by ''to be'' even in the [[subjunctive mood]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Imperfect subjunctive of ''to be'' in Early modern English\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''(if) I were''|| ''(if) we were''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''(if) [[thou]] wert''|| ''(if) you were''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''(if) he/she/it were''|| ''(if) they were''\n|}\n\nHowever, for nearly all regular verbs, a separate ''[[thou]]'' form was no longer commonly used in the past tense.  Thus the [[auxiliary verb]] ''to do'' is used, e.g.'' thou didst help'', not ''*thou helpedst''.\n\n===Latin===\nCompared with English, Latin is an example of a highly [[inflected]] language. The consequences for agreement are thus:\n\nVerbs must agree in person and number, and sometimes in gender, with their subjects.  Articles and adjectives must agree in case, number and gender with the nouns they modify.\n\nSample Latin (Spanish) verb: the present indicative active of ''portare'' (''portar''), to carry:\n\n:port''o'' (port''o'') -  I carry\n\n:port''as'' (port''as'') - you [singular] carry\n\n:port''at'' (port''a'') - he carries\n\n:port''amus'' (port''amos'') - we carry\n\n:port''atis'' (port''\u00e1is'') - you [plural] carry\n\n:port''ant'', (port''an'') - they carry\n\nIn Latin, a pronoun such as \"ego\" and \"tu\" is only inserted for contrast and selection. Proper nouns and common nouns functioning as subject are nonetheless frequent. For this reason, Latin is described as a [[null-subject language]].\n\n===French===\nSpoken French always distinguishes the second person plural, and the first person plural in formal speech, from each other and from the rest of the present tense in all verbs in the first conjugation (infinitives in -er) other than ''aller''. The first person plural form and pronoun (''nous'') are now usually replaced by the pronoun ''on'' (literally: \"one\") and a third person singular verb form in Modern French. Thus, ''nous travaillons'' (formal) becomes ''on travaille''. In most verbs from the other conjugations, each person in the plural can be distinguished among themselves and from the singular forms, again, when using the traditional first person plural. The other endings that appear in written French (i.e.: all singular endings, and also the third person plural of verbs other than those with infinitives in -er) are often pronounced the same, except in [[liaison (French)|liaison]] contexts. Irregular verbs such as ''\u00eatre'', ''faire'', ''aller'', and ''avoir'' possess more distinctly pronounced agreement forms than regular verbs.\n\nAn example of this is the verb ''travailler'', which goes as follows (the single words in italic type are pronounced /t\u0281a.vaj/):\n* je ''travaille''\n* tu ''travailles''\n* il ''travaille''\n* nous travaillons, or on ''travaille''\n* vous travaillez\n* ils ''travaillent''\n\nOn the other hand, a verb like ''partir'' has (the single words in italic type are pronounced /pa\u0281/):\n* je ''pars''\n* tu ''pars''\n* il ''part''\n* nous partons, or on ''part''\n* vous partez\n* ils partent\n\nThe final S or T is silent, and the other three forms sound different from one another and from the singular forms.\n\nAdjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns that they modify in French. As with verbs, the agreements are sometimes only shown in spelling since forms that are written with different agreement suffixes are sometimes pronounced the same (e.g. ''joli'', ''jolie''); although in many cases the final consonant is pronounced in feminine forms, but silent in masculine forms (e.g. ''petit'' vs. ''petite''). Most plural forms end in ''-s'', but this consonant is only pronounced in liaison contexts, and it is determinants that help understand if the singular or plural is meant. The [[participle]]s of verbs agree in gender and number with the subject or object in some instances.\n\nArticles, possessives and other determinants also decline for number and (only in the singular) for gender, with plural determinants being the same for both genders. This normally produces three forms: one for masculine singular nouns, one for feminine singular nouns, and another for plural nouns of either gender:\n* Definite article: ''le, la, les''\n* Indefinite article: ''un, une, des''\n* Partitive article: ''du, de la, des''\n* Possessives (for the first person singular): ''mon, ma, mes''\n* Demonstratives: ''ce, cette, ces''\n\nNotice that some of the above also change (in the singular) if the following word begins with a vowel: ''le'' and ''la'' become ''l\u2032'', ''du'' and ''de la'' become ''de l\u2032'', ''ma'' becomes ''mon'' (as if the noun  were masculine) and ''ce'' becomes ''cet''.\n\n===Hungarian===\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], verbs have [[polypersonal agreement]], which means they agree with more than one of the verb's [[verb argument|arguments]]: not only its subject but also its (accusative) object. Difference is made between the case when there is a definite object and the case when the object is indefinite or there is no object at all. (The adverbs do not affect the form of the verb.) Examples: ''Szeretek'' (I love somebody or something unspecified), ''szeretem'' (I love him, her, it, or them, specifically), ''szeretlek'' (I love you); ''szeret'' (he loves me, us, you, someone, or something unspecified), ''szereti'' (he loves her, him, it, or them specifically). Of course, nouns or pronouns may specify the exact object. In short, there is agreement between a verb and the person and number of its subject and the specificity of its object (which often refers to the person more or less exactly).\n\n:''See [[Hungarian grammar (verbs)#Definite and indefinite conjugations|Definite and indefinite conjugations]]''\n\nThe [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] agrees in number with the subject and if it is [[Copula (linguistics)|copulative]] (i.e., it consists of a noun/adjective and a linking verb), both parts agree in number with the subject. For example: ''A k\u00f6nyv'''ek''' \u00e9rdekes'''ek''' volt'''ak''''' \"The books were interesting\" (\"a\": the, \"k\u00f6nyv\": book, \"\u00e9rdekes\": interesting, \"voltak\": were): the plural is marked on the subject as well as both the adjectival and the copulative part of the predicate.\n\nWithin noun phrases, adjectives do not show agreement with the noun, though pronouns do. e.g. ''a sz\u00e9p k\u00f6nyv'''eitekkel''''' \"with your nice books\" (\"sz\u00e9p\": nice):  the suffixes of the plural, the possessive \"your\" and the case marking \"with\" are only marked on the noun.\n\n===Scandinavian languages===\n\n==== [[Adjective|Adjectives]] ====\nIn the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], adjectives (both [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] and [[Predicative adjective|predicative]]) are declined according to the [[Gender (grammar)|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[definiteness]] of the noun they modify. In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], adjectives are also declined according to [[grammatical case]], unlike the other Scandinavian languages.  \n\nIn some cases in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], adjectives and participles as [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] appear to disagree with their subjects. This phenomenon is referred to as [[pancake sentence]]s. \n\n===== Examples (Norwegian) =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Agreement of the adjective \u00abliten\u00bb(small) in Norwegian\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Plural\n!Definite (strong inflection)\n|-\n|Liten\n|Lita\n|Lite\n|Sm\u00e5\n|Lille\n|}\n\n* En '''liten''' gnist (a small spark)\n* Ei '''lita''' hytte (a small cabin)\n* Et '''lite''' tre (a small tree)\n*De '''sm\u00e5''' barna (the small children)\n* Flammen er '''liten''' (the fire is small)\n* Hytta er '''lita''' (the cabin is small)\n* Treet er '''lite''' (the tree is small)\n*Barna er '''sm\u00e5''' (the children are small)\n* Den '''lille''' gutten (the small boy)\n\n==== [[Participle|Participles]] ====\nIn [[Norwegian Nynorsk|Norwegian nynorsk]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the past participle must agree in gender, number and definiteness when the participle is in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] or [[Predicative adjective|predicative]] position. In Icelandic and Faroese, past participles would also have to agree in grammatical case.\n\nIn [[Bokm\u00e5l|Norwegian bokm\u00e5l]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] it is only required to decline past participles in number and definiteness when in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] position. \n\n===Slavic languages===\n\nMost [[Slavic languages]] are highly inflected, except for [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. The agreement is similar to Latin, for instance between adjectives and nouns in gender, number, case and [[animacy]] (if counted as a separate category). The following examples are from [[Serbo-Croatian]]:\n\n: ''\u017eivim u <u>malom</u> stanu'' \"I live in a small apartment\" (masculine inanimate, singular, locative)\n: ''\u017eivim u <u>maloj</u> ku\u0107i'' \"I live in a small house\" (feminine, singular, locative)\n: ''imam <u>mali</u> stan'' \"I have a small apartment\" (masculine inanimate, singular, accusative)\n: ''imam <u>malu</u> ku\u0107u'' \"I have a small house\" (feminine, singular, accusative)\n: ''imam <u>malog</u> psa'' \"I have a small dog\" (masculine animate, singular, accusative)\n\nVerbs have 6 different forms in the present tense, for three persons in singular and plural. As in Latin, subject is frequently dropped.\n\nAnother characteristic is agreement in participles, which have different forms for different genders:\n\n: ''ja sam <u>jela</u>'' \"I was eating\" (female speaking)\n: ''ja sam <u>jeo</u>'' \"I was eating\" (male speaking)\n\n===Swahili===\n[[Swahili language|Swahili]], like all other [[Bantu languages]], has numerous [[noun class]]es. Verbs must agree in class with their subjects and objects, and adjectives with the nouns that they qualify. For example: '''''Ki'''tabu '''ki'''moja '''ki'''tatosha'' (One book will be enough)'', '''M'''chungwa '''m'''moja '''u'''tatosha'' (One orange-tree will be enough), ''Chungwa moja '''li'''tatosha'' (One orange will be enough).\n \nThere is also agreement in number. For example: '''''Vi'''tabu '''vi'''wili '''vi'''tatosha'' (Two books will be enough), '''''Mi'''chungwa '''mi'''wili '''i'''tatosha'' (Two orange-trees will be enough), '''''Ma'''chungwa '''ma'''wili '''ya'''tatosha'' (Two oranges will be enough).\n \nClass and number are indicated with prefixes (or sometimes their absence), which are not always the same for nouns, adjectives and verbs, as illustrated by the examples.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Attraction (grammar)]]\n*[[Case government]]\n*[[Declension]]\n*[[Inflection]]\n*[[Redundancy (linguistics)]]\n*[[Sequence of tenses]] &mdash; sometimes called '''agreement of tenses'''\n*[[Synthetic language]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |first1=Greville G. |last1=Corbett |chapter=Agreement |editor1-last=Asher|editor1-first=R.

Some categories that commonly trigger grammatical agreement are noted below.\n\n===Person===\nAgreement based on [[grammatical person]] is found mostly between [[verb]] and [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. An example from English (''I am'' vs. ''he is'') has been given in the introduction to this article.\n\nAgreement between pronoun (or corresponding [[possessive adjective]]) and antecedent also requires the selection of the correct person. For example, if the antecedent is the first person noun phrase ''Mary and I'', then a first person pronoun (''we/us/our'') is required; however, most noun phrases (''the dog'', ''my cats'', ''Jack and Jill'', etc.) are third person, and are replaced by a third person pronoun (''he/she/it/they'' etc.).\n\n===Number===\nAgreement based on [[grammatical number]] can occur between verb and subject, as in the case of grammatical person discussed above. In fact the two categories are often conflated within [[verb conjugation]] patterns: there are specific verb forms for first person singular, second person plural and so on. Some examples:\n* ''<u>I</u> really <u>am</u>'' (1st pers. singular) vs. ''<u>We</u> really <u>are</u>'' (1st pers. plural)\n* ''The boy sing<u>s</u>'' (3rd pers. singular) vs. ''The boy<u>s</u> sing'' (3rd pers. plural)\n\nAgain as with person, there is agreement in number between pronouns (or their corresponding possessives) and antecedents: \n* ''The girl did <u>her</u> job'' vs. ''The girl<u>s</u> did <u>their</u> job''\n\nAgreement also occurs between nouns and their [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] and [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s, in some situations. This is common in languages such as French and Spanish, where [[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[determiners]] and [[adjective]]s (both attributive and predicative) agree in number with the nouns they qualify:\n* ''<u>le</u> grand homme'' (\"the great man\") vs. ''<u>les</u> grand<u>s</u> homme<u>s</u>'' (\"the great men\")\n*<u>''el''</u> ''hombre alto'' (\"the tall man\") vs. ''<u>los</u> hombre<u>s</u> alto<u>s</u>'' (\"the tall men\")\n\nIn English this is not such a common feature, although there are certain determiners that occur specifically with singular or plural nouns only:\n*''<u>One</u> big car'' vs. ''<u>Two</u> big car<u>s</u>''\n*''<u>Much</u> great work'' vs. ''<u>Many</u> great work<u>s</u>''\n\n===Gender===\nIn languages in which [[grammatical gender]] plays a significant role, there is often agreement in gender between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in [[French grammar|French]]:\n*''<u>le</u> grand homme'' (\"the big man\"; ''homme'' is masculine) vs. ''<u>la</u> grand<u>e</u> chaise'' (\"the big chair\"; ''chaise'' is feminine)\nSuch agreement is also found with [[predicate adjective]]s: ''l'homme est grand'' (\"the man is big\") vs. ''la chaise est grand<u>e</u>'' (\"the chair is big\"). (However, in some languages, such as [[German grammar|German]], this is not the case; only attributive modifiers show agreement.)\n\nIn the case of verbs, gender agreement is less common, although it may still occur. For example, in the French compound past tense, the past participle agrees in certain circumstances with the subject or with an object (see ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'' for details). In [[Russian grammar|Russian]] and most other [[Slavic languages]], the form of the past tense agrees in gender with the subject.\n\nThere is also agreement in gender between pronouns and antecedents. Examples of this can be found in English (although English pronouns principally follow natural gender rather than grammatical gender):\n*''The <u>man</u> reached <u>his</u> destination'' vs. ''The <u>ship</u> reached <u>her</u>/<u>its</u> destination''\nFor more detail see [[Gender in English]].\n\n===Case===\nIn languages that have a system of [[grammatical case|cases]], there is often agreement by case between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in [[German grammar|German]]:\n*''<u>der</u> gut<u>e</u> Mann'' (\"the good man\", [[nominative]] case) vs. ''<u>des</u> gut<u>en</u> Mann<u>(e)s</u>'' (\"of the good man\", [[genitive]] case)\nIn fact, the modifiers of nouns in languages such as German and [[Latin]] agree with their nouns in number, gender and case; all three categories are conflated together in paradigms of [[declension]].\n\nCase agreement is not a significant feature of English (only [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] and the pronoun [[who (pronoun)|''who'']] have any case marking). Agreement between such pronouns can sometimes be observed:\n*''<u>Who</u> came first \u2013 <u>he</u> or his brother?'' vs. ''<u>Whom</u> did you see \u2013 <u>him</u> or his brother?''\n\n=== Alliterative agreement ===\nA rare type of agreement that phonologically copies parts of the head rather than agreeing with a [[grammatical category]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staticweb.hum.uu.nl/medewerkers/alexis.dimitriadis/papers/allit-glow97.pdf|title=Alliterative Concord in Phonology-Free Syntax|last=Dimitriadis|first=Alexis}}</ref> For example, in [[Banyum language|Bainouk]]:\n\n''<u>ka</u>tama-\u014b\u0254 in-<u>ka</u> / <u>ka</u>tama-<u>\u0101</u>-\u014b\u0254 in-<u>ka</u>-<u>\u0101</u>''\n\n''river-prox. this / river-pl-prox. these''\n\nIn this example, what is copied is not a prefix, but rather the initial syllable of the head \"river\".\n\n==By language==\nLanguages can have no conventional agreement whatsoever, as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Malay language|Malay]]; barely any, as in [[English language|English]]; a small amount, as in spoken [[French language|French]]; a moderate amount, as in [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin language|Latin]]; or a large amount, as in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].\n\n===English===\nModern English does not have a particularly large amount of agreement, although it is present.\n\nApart from verbs, the main examples are the determiners \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d, which become \u201cthese\u201d and \u201cthose\u201d respectively when the following noun is plural:\n: ''this woman'' \u2014 ''these women''\n: ''that dog'' \u2014 ''those dogs''\n\nAll [[English verbs|regular verbs]] (and nearly all [[English irregular verbs|irregular]] ones) in English agree in the third-person singular of the present [[indicative]] by adding a [[Affix|suffix]] of either ''-s'' or ''-es''.  The latter is generally used after stems ending in the [[sibilant]]s ''sh'', ''ch'', ''ss'' or ''zz'' (e.g. ''he rushes'', ''it lurches'', ''she amasses'', ''it buzzes''.)\n\nPresent tense of ''to love'':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''I love''|| ''we love''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''you love''|| ''you love''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''he/she/it love'''s'''''|| ''they love''\n|}\n\nThere are not many irregularities in this formation:\n* ''to have'','' to go'' and ''to do'' render ''has'', ''goes'' and ''does''.\n\nThe highly irregular verb ''to be'' is the only verb with more agreement than this in the present tense.\n\nPresent tense of ''to be'':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''I am''|| ''we are''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''you are''|| ''you are''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''he/she/it is''|| ''they are''\n|}\n\nIn English, [[defective verb]]s generally show no agreement for person or number, they include the [[modal verb]]s: ''can'', ''may'', ''shall'', ''will'', ''must'', ''should'', ''ought''.\n\nIn [[Early Modern English]] agreement existed for the second person singular of all verbs in the present tense, as well as in the past tense of some common verbs.  This was usually in the form ''-est'', but ''-st'' and ''-t'' also occurred.  Note that this does not affect the endings for other persons and numbers.\n\nExample present tense forms: ''thou wilt'', ''thou shalt'', ''thou art'', ''thou hast'', ''thou canst''.\nExample past tense forms: ''thou wouldst'', ''thou shouldst'', ''thou wast'', ''thou hadst'', ''thou couldst''\n\nNote also the agreement shown by ''to be'' even in the [[subjunctive mood]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Imperfect subjunctive of ''to be'' in Early modern English\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''(if) I were''|| ''(if) we were''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''(if) [[thou]] wert''|| ''(if) you were''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''(if) he/she/it were''|| ''(if) they were''\n|}\n\nHowever, for nearly all regular verbs, a separate ''[[thou]]'' form was no longer commonly used in the past tense.  Thus the [[auxiliary verb]] ''to do'' is used, e.g.'' thou didst help'', not ''*thou helpedst''.\n\n===Latin===\nCompared with English, Latin is an example of a highly [[inflected]] language. The consequences for agreement are thus:\n\nVerbs must agree in person and number, and sometimes in gender, with their subjects.  Articles and adjectives must agree in case, number and gender with the nouns they modify.\n\nSample Latin (Spanish) verb: the present indicative active of ''portare'' (''portar''), to carry:\n\n:port''o'' (port''o'') -  I carry\n\n:port''as'' (port''as'') - you [singular] carry\n\n:port''at'' (port''a'') - he carries\n\n:port''amus'' (port''amos'') - we carry\n\n:port''atis'' (port''\u00e1is'') - you [plural] carry\n\n:port''ant'', (port''an'') - they carry\n\nIn Latin, a pronoun such as \"ego\" and \"tu\" is only inserted for contrast and selection. Proper nouns and common nouns functioning as subject are nonetheless frequent. For this reason, Latin is described as a [[null-subject language]].\n\n===French===\nSpoken French always distinguishes the second person plural, and the first person plural in formal speech, from each other and from the rest of the present tense in all verbs in the first conjugation (infinitives in -er) other than ''aller''. The first person plural form and pronoun (''nous'') are now usually replaced by the pronoun ''on'' (literally: \"one\") and a third person singular verb form in Modern French. Thus, ''nous travaillons'' (formal) becomes ''on travaille''. In most verbs from the other conjugations, each person in the plural can be distinguished among themselves and from the singular forms, again, when using the traditional first person plural. The other endings that appear in written French (i.e.: all singular endings, and also the third person plural of verbs other than those with infinitives in -er) are often pronounced the same, except in [[liaison (French)|liaison]] contexts. Irregular verbs such as ''\u00eatre'', ''faire'', ''aller'', and ''avoir'' possess more distinctly pronounced agreement forms than regular verbs.\n\nAn example of this is the verb ''travailler'', which goes as follows (the single words in italic type are pronounced /t\u0281a.vaj/):\n* je ''travaille''\n* tu ''travailles''\n* il ''travaille''\n* nous travaillons, or on ''travaille''\n* vous travaillez\n* ils ''travaillent''\n\nOn the other hand, a verb like ''partir'' has (the single words in italic type are pronounced /pa\u0281/):\n* je ''pars''\n* tu ''pars''\n* il ''part''\n* nous partons, or on ''part''\n* vous partez\n* ils partent\n\nThe final S or T is silent, and the other three forms sound different from one another and from the singular forms.\n\nAdjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns that they modify in French. As with verbs, the agreements are sometimes only shown in spelling since forms that are written with different agreement suffixes are sometimes pronounced the same (e.g. ''joli'', ''jolie''); although in many cases the final consonant is pronounced in feminine forms, but silent in masculine forms (e.g. ''petit'' vs. ''petite''). Most plural forms end in ''-s'', but this consonant is only pronounced in liaison contexts, and it is determinants that help understand if the singular or plural is meant. The [[participle]]s of verbs agree in gender and number with the subject or object in some instances.\n\nArticles, possessives and other determinants also decline for number and (only in the singular) for gender, with plural determinants being the same for both genders. This normally produces three forms: one for masculine singular nouns, one for feminine singular nouns, and another for plural nouns of either gender:\n* Definite article: ''le, la, les''\n* Indefinite article: ''un, une, des''\n* Partitive article: ''du, de la, des''\n* Possessives (for the first person singular): ''mon, ma, mes''\n* Demonstratives: ''ce, cette, ces''\n\nNotice that some of the above also change (in the singular) if the following word begins with a vowel: ''le'' and ''la'' become ''l\u2032'', ''du'' and ''de la'' become ''de l\u2032'', ''ma'' becomes ''mon'' (as if the noun  were masculine) and ''ce'' becomes ''cet''.\n\n===Hungarian===\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], verbs have [[polypersonal agreement]], which means they agree with more than one of the verb's [[verb argument|arguments]]: not only its subject but also its (accusative) object. Difference is made between the case when there is a definite object and the case when the object is indefinite or there is no object at all. (The adverbs do not affect the form of the verb.) Examples: ''Szeretek'' (I love somebody or something unspecified), ''szeretem'' (I love him, her, it, or them, specifically), ''szeretlek'' (I love you); ''szeret'' (he loves me, us, you, someone, or something unspecified), ''szereti'' (he loves her, him, it, or them specifically). Of course, nouns or pronouns may specify the exact object. In short, there is agreement between a verb and the person and number of its subject and the specificity of its object (which often refers to the person more or less exactly).\n\n:''See [[Hungarian grammar (verbs)#Definite and indefinite conjugations|Definite and indefinite conjugations]]''\n\nThe [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] agrees in number with the subject and if it is [[Copula (linguistics)|copulative]] (i.e., it consists of a noun/adjective and a linking verb), both parts agree in number with the subject. For example: ''A k\u00f6nyv'''ek''' \u00e9rdekes'''ek''' volt'''ak''''' \"The books were interesting\" (\"a\": the, \"k\u00f6nyv\": book, \"\u00e9rdekes\": interesting, \"voltak\": were): the plural is marked on the subject as well as both the adjectival and the copulative part of the predicate.\n\nWithin noun phrases, adjectives do not show agreement with the noun, though pronouns do. e.g. ''a sz\u00e9p k\u00f6nyv'''eitekkel''''' \"with your nice books\" (\"sz\u00e9p\": nice):  the suffixes of the plural, the possessive \"your\" and the case marking \"with\" are only marked on the noun.\n\n===Scandinavian languages===\n\n==== [[Adjective|Adjectives]] ====\nIn the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], adjectives (both [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] and [[Predicative adjective|predicative]]) are declined according to the [[Gender (grammar)|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[definiteness]] of the noun they modify. In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], adjectives are also declined according to [[grammatical case]], unlike the other Scandinavian languages.  \n\nIn some cases in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], adjectives and participles as [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] appear to disagree with their subjects. This phenomenon is referred to as [[pancake sentence]]s. \n\n===== Examples (Norwegian) =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Agreement of the adjective \u00abliten\u00bb(small) in Norwegian\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Plural\n!Definite (strong inflection)\n|-\n|Liten\n|Lita\n|Lite\n|Sm\u00e5\n|Lille\n|}\n\n* En '''liten''' gnist (a small spark)\n* Ei '''lita''' hytte (a small cabin)\n* Et '''lite''' tre (a small tree)\n*De '''sm\u00e5''' barna (the small children)\n* Flammen er '''liten''' (the fire is small)\n* Hytta er '''lita''' (the cabin is small)\n* Treet er '''lite''' (the tree is small)\n*Barna er '''sm\u00e5''' (the children are small)\n* Den '''lille''' gutten (the small boy)\n\n==== [[Participle|Participles]] ====\nIn [[Norwegian Nynorsk|Norwegian nynorsk]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the past participle must agree in gender, number and definiteness when the participle is in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] or [[Predicative adjective|predicative]] position. In Icelandic and Faroese, past participles would also have to agree in grammatical case.\n\nIn [[Bokm\u00e5l|Norwegian bokm\u00e5l]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] it is only required to decline past participles in number and definiteness when in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] position. \n\n===Slavic languages===\n\nMost [[Slavic languages]] are highly inflected, except for [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. The agreement is similar to Latin, for instance between adjectives and nouns in gender, number, case and [[animacy]] (if counted as a separate category). The following examples are from [[Serbo-Croatian]]:\n\n: ''\u017eivim u <u>malom</u> stanu'' \"I live in a small apartment\" (masculine inanimate, singular, locative)\n: ''\u017eivim u <u>maloj</u> ku\u0107i'' \"I live in a small house\" (feminine, singular, locative)\n: ''imam <u>mali</u> stan'' \"I have a small apartment\" (masculine inanimate, singular, accusative)\n: ''imam <u>malu</u> ku\u0107u'' \"I have a small house\" (feminine, singular, accusative)\n: ''imam <u>malog</u> psa'' \"I have a small dog\" (masculine animate, singular, accusative)\n\nVerbs have 6 different forms in the present tense, for three persons in singular and plural. As in Latin, subject is frequently dropped.\n\nAnother characteristic is agreement in participles, which have different forms for different genders:\n\n: ''ja sam <u>jela</u>'' \"I was eating\" (female speaking)\n: ''ja sam <u>jeo</u>'' \"I was eating\" (male speaking)\n\n===Swahili===\n[[Swahili language|Swahili]], like all other [[Bantu languages]], has numerous [[noun class]]es. Verbs must agree in class with their subjects and objects, and adjectives with the nouns that they qualify. For example: '''''Ki'''tabu '''ki'''moja '''ki'''tatosha'' (One book will be enough)'', '''M'''chungwa '''m'''moja '''u'''tatosha'' (One orange-tree will be enough), ''Chungwa moja '''li'''tatosha'' (One orange will be enough).\n \nThere is also agreement in number. For example: '''''Vi'''tabu '''vi'''wili '''vi'''tatosha'' (Two books will be enough), '''''Mi'''chungwa '''mi'''wili '''i'''tatosha'' (Two orange-trees will be enough), '''''Ma'''chungwa '''ma'''wili '''ya'''tatosha'' (Two oranges will be enough).\n \nClass and number are indicated with prefixes (or sometimes their absence), which are not always the same for nouns, adjectives and verbs, as illustrated by the examples.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Attraction (grammar)]]\n*[[Case government]]\n*[[Declension]]\n*[[Inflection]]\n*[[Redundancy (linguistics)]]\n*[[Sequence of tenses]] &mdash; sometimes called '''agreement of tenses'''\n*[[Synthetic language]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |first1=Greville G. |last1=Corbett |chapter=Agreement |editor1-last=Asher|editor1-first=R.

Other descendants are fusional, including [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Slavic languages]], as well as [[Latin]] and the [[Romance languages]] and certain [[Germanic languages]].\n\nSome languages shift over time from agglutinative to fusional. For example, while most [[Uralic language]]s are predominantly agglutinative, [[Estonian language|Estonian]] is markedly evolving in the direction of a fusional language. On the other hand, [[Finnish language|Finnish]], its close relative, exhibits fewer fusional traits, thereby keeping closer to the mainstream Uralic type.\n\n==Declension==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}\nOne feature of many fusional languages is their systems of [[declension]]s. Here nouns and adjectives have a suffix attached to them to specify [[grammatical case]] (their uses in the clause), [[Number (grammar)|number]], and [[grammatical gender]]; pronouns may alter their forms entirely to encode this information. In most [[Romance languages]] and modern [[English language|English]], encoding for case is merely vestigial; this is because it no longer encompasses nouns and adjectives, but only pronouns. Compare the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''egli'' (masculine singular [[nominative]]), ''gli'' (masculine singular [[dative]], or indirect object), ''lo'' (masculine singular [[accusative]]) and ''lui'' (also masculine singular accusative, but emphatic and [[indirect object|indirect case]] to be used with prepositions), corresponding to the single vestigial pair ''he, him'' in English.\n\n==Conjugation==\n\n[[Grammatical conjugation|Conjugation]] is the alteration of the form of a [[verb]] to encode information about some or all of [[grammatical mood]], [[grammatical voice|voice]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical gender]], and [[grammatical number|number]]. In a fusional language, two or more of these pieces of information may be conveyed in a single morpheme, typically a suffix.\n\nFor example, in [[French language|French]], the verbal suffix depends on the mood, tense, and aspect of the verb, as well as on the person and number (but not the gender) of its subject. This gives rise to typically [[French conjugation#First group verbs (-er verbs)|forty-five different single-word forms]] of the verb, each conveying some or all of a mood (one of [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]], or [[imperative mood|imperative]]), a tense ([[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]] or [[future tense|future]]), an aspect ([[perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]), a person, (first, second, or third) and a number (singular or plural). To change any one of these pieces of information without changing the others requires using a different suffix, the key characteristic of fusionality.\n\nEnglish has two examples of conjugational fusion. The verbal suffix ''-s'' indicates a combination of present tense with both third person and singularity of the associated subject, and the verbal suffix ''-ed'', used in a verb with no auxiliary verb, conveys both [[progressive aspect|non-progressive aspect]] and past tense.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Inflection]]\n* [[Synthetic language]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Fusional languages| ]]\n[[Category:Synthetic languages]]\n\n[[eo:Lingva tipologio#Aglutinaj kaj fandaj lingvoj]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Language where one kind of inflection indicates multiple changes of aspect}}{{Linguistic typology topics}}\n\n'''Fusional languages''' or '''inflected languages''' are a type of [[synthetic language]], distinguished from [[agglutinative language]]s by their tendency to use a single [[inflection]]al [[morpheme]] to denote multiple [[grammar|grammatical]], [[syntactic]], or [[semantic]] features.

Changing any one of these features requires replacing the suffix {{lang|la|-us}} with a different one. In the form {{lang|la|bonum}}, the ending {{lang|la|-um}} denotes masculine [[accusative case|accusative]] singular, neuter accusative singular, or neuter nominative singular.\n\n== History ==\nFusional languages generally tend to lose their inflection over the centuries{{snd}}some languages much more quickly than others.<ref name=\"unfolding\">{{cite book | last = Deutscher | first = Guy | authorlink = Guy Deutscher (linguist) |title = The unfolding of language: an evolutionary tour of mankind's greatest invention | publisher = Holt Paperbacks | location = New York | year = 2006 | edition = reprint | isbn = 978-0-8050-8012-4 |page= }}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}</ref> While [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] was fusional, some of its descendants have shifted to a more [[analytic language|analytic]] structure, such as [[Modern English]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Afrikaans]], or [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]], such as [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Other descendants are fusional, including [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Slavic languages]], as well as [[Latin]] and the [[Romance languages]] and certain [[Germanic languages]].\n\nSome languages shift over time from agglutinative to fusional. For example, while most [[Uralic language]]s are predominantly agglutinative, [[Estonian language|Estonian]] is markedly evolving in the direction of a fusional language. On the other hand, [[Finnish language|Finnish]], its close relative, exhibits fewer fusional traits, thereby keeping closer to the mainstream Uralic type.\n\n==Declension==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}\nOne feature of many fusional languages is their systems of [[declension]]s. Here nouns and adjectives have a suffix attached to them to specify [[grammatical case]] (their uses in the clause), [[Number (grammar)|number]], and [[grammatical gender]]; pronouns may alter their forms entirely to encode this information. In most [[Romance languages]] and modern [[English language|English]], encoding for case is merely vestigial; this is because it no longer encompasses nouns and adjectives, but only pronouns. Compare the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''egli'' (masculine singular [[nominative]]), ''gli'' (masculine singular [[dative]], or indirect object), ''lo'' (masculine singular [[accusative]]) and ''lui'' (also masculine singular accusative, but emphatic and [[indirect object|indirect case]] to be used with prepositions), corresponding to the single vestigial pair ''he, him'' in English.\n\n==Conjugation==\n\n[[Grammatical conjugation|Conjugation]] is the alteration of the form of a [[verb]] to encode information about some or all of [[grammatical mood]], [[grammatical voice|voice]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical gender]], and [[grammatical number|number]]. In a fusional language, two or more of these pieces of information may be conveyed in a single morpheme, typically a suffix.\n\nFor example, in [[French language|French]], the verbal suffix depends on the mood, tense, and aspect of the verb, as well as on the person and number (but not the gender) of its subject. This gives rise to typically [[French conjugation#First group verbs (-er verbs)|forty-five different single-word forms]] of the verb, each conveying some or all of a mood (one of [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]], or [[imperative mood|imperative]]), a tense ([[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]] or [[future tense|future]]), an aspect ([[perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]), a person, (first, second, or third) and a number (singular or plural). To change any one of these pieces of information without changing the others requires using a different suffix, the key characteristic of fusionality.\n\nEnglish has two examples of conjugational fusion. The verbal suffix ''-s'' indicates a combination of present tense with both third person and singularity of the associated subject, and the verbal suffix ''-ed'', used in a verb with no auxiliary verb, conveys both [[progressive aspect|non-progressive aspect]] and past tense.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Inflection]]\n* [[Synthetic language]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Fusional languages| ]]\n[[Category:Synthetic languages]]\n\n[[eo:Lingva tipologio#Aglutinaj kaj fandaj lingvoj]]\n", "name_user": "Joovier", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusional_language"}

Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.\n\nIn modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a [[proper noun]] such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist [[Thomas Drummond (botanist)|Thomas Drummond]]) is now written as ''[[Phlox drummondii]]''.\n\nIn scientific works, the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authority|authority]] for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified.\n*In [[zoology]]\n** \"''[[Patella vulgata]]'' Linnaeus, 1758\".

The original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; the parentheses indicate that the species is now considered to belong in a different genus. The ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made, although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information.\n*In [[botany]]\n**\"''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation used in botany for \"Linnaeus\".\n**\"''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.)

It can have one of a number of forms:\n* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The [[house sparrow]] has the binomial name ''Passer domesticus''. Here ''domesticus'' (\"domestic\") simply means \"associated with the house\". The [[Nandina|sacred bamboo]] is ''Nandina domestic<u>a</u>''<ref>{{Harvnb|Hyam|Pankhurst|1995|p=334}}</ref> rather than ''Nandina domestic<u>us</u>'', since ''Nandina'' is feminine whereas ''Passer'' is masculine. The tropical fruit [[Lansium parasiticum|langsat]] is a product of the plant ''Lansium parasitic<u>um</u>'', since ''Lansium'' is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' (as in the previous example of ''domesticus''); ''-is'', ''-is'', ''-e'' (e.g. ''tristis'', meaning \"sad\"); and ''-or'', ''-or'', ''-us'' (e.g. ''minor'', meaning \"smaller\"). For further information, see [[Latin declension#Adjectives|Latin declension: Adjectives]].\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is ''Panthera leo''. Grammatically the noun is said to be in [[apposition]] to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, ''Panthera'' is feminine and ''leo'' is masculine.\n[[File:Talauma hodgsonii.jpg|thumb|''Magnolia hodgsonii'']]\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the [[Latin declension|declension]] of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are ''-ii'' or ''-i'' in the singular and ''-orum'' in the plural, and for feminine nouns ''-ae'' in the singular and ''-arum'' in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the [[Tibetan antelope]] (''Pantholops hodgsonii''), the shrub ''[[Magnolia hodgsonii]]'', or the [[olive-backed pipit]] (''Anthus hodgsoni''). The meaning is \"of the person named\", so that ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' means \"Hodgson's magnolia\". The ''-ii'' or ''-i'' endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, ''hodgsonae'' would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example ''Anthus hodgsoni'' was named by [[Charles Wallace Richmond]], in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'', meaning \"of the [[Chalumna River]]\". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', where ''coli'' means \"of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]\". This formation is common in parasites, as in ''[[Xenos vesparum]]'', where ''vesparum'' means \"of the wasps\", since ''Xenos vesparum'' is a parasite of wasps.\n\nWhereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of ''hodgsonii'' above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom.\n\n==Codes==\n\nFrom the early 19th century<!--Strickland code was 1841--> onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names.<!--CITATION--> In the course of time these became [[nomenclature codes]]. The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') governs the naming of animals,<ref name=ICZN>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}</ref> the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp'') that of plants (including [[cyanobacteria]]), and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]'' (''ICNB'') that of [[bacteria]] (including [[Archaea]]). [[Virus]] names are governed by the ''[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'' (''ICTV''), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.:\n* \"Binomial nomenclature\" is the correct term for botany,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 23</ref> although it is also used by zoologists.<ref>{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Diane |year=2003 |title=Guide to reference and information sources in the zoological sciences |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=978-1-56308-977-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoreference0000schm }}, [//books.google.com/books?id=EqJrbvJU4uwC&pg=PA4 p. 4]</ref> Since 1953, \"binomi<u>n</u>al nomenclature\" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina).<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 2, Article 5</ref>\n* Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the \"generic name\". In the zoological code (''ICZN''), the second part of the name is a \"specific name\". In the botanical code (''ICNafp''), it is a \"specific epithet\". Together, these two parts are referred to as a \"species name\" or \"binomen\" in the zoological code; or \"species name\", \"binomial\", or \"binary combination\" in the botanical code. \"Species name\" is the only term common to the two codes.\n* The ''ICNafp'', the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a [[tautonym]]), whereas the ''ICZN'', the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomial ''Bison bison''; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant.\n* The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In [[botany]] the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published ''[[Species Plantarum]]''). In [[zoology]] the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', 10th Edition, and also [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Clerck's]] ''Aranei Svecici''). [[Bacteriology]] started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980.<ref>{{Citation |last=Sneath |first=P.H.A. |year=2003 |publisher=International Union of Microbiological Societies |url=http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |accessdate=20 June 2013 |title=A short history of the Bacteriological Code |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070542/http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of terminology for the names of species in the ICZN and ICNafp\n!

(There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names [[clade]]s. This is called the ''[[PhyloCode]]''.)\n\n===Differences in handling personal names===\nAs noted above, there are some differences between the codes in the way in which binomials can be formed; for example the ''ICZN'' allows both parts to be the same, while the ''ICNafp'' does not. Another difference is in the way in which personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The ''ICNafp'' sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not \"er\") are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding \"-ius\" (for a man) or \"-ia\" (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning \"of that person or persons\"). This produces specific epithets like ''lecardii'' for Lecard (male), ''wilsoniae'' for Wilson (female), and ''brauniarum'' for the Braun sisters.<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Recommendation 60C</ref> By contrast the ''ICZN'' does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name, allowing the genitive ending to added directly to the personal name.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 3.1.2</ref> This explains the difference between the names of  the plant ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' and the bird ''Anthus hodgsoni''. Furthermore, the ''ICNafp'' requires names not published in the form required by the code to be corrected to conform to it,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 60.12</ref> whereas the ''ICZN'' is more protective of the form used by the original author.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 32.3</ref>\n\n== Writing binomial names ==\nBy tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref name=\"howto\">{{Citation |title=How to Write Scientific Names of Organisms |journal=Competition Science Vision |url = http://www.journal.au.edu/au_techno/2001/oct2001/howto.pdf |access-date=20 June 2011 |postscript=. }}</ref> Generally, the binomial should be printed in a [[font|font style]] different from that used in the normal text; for example, \"''Several more ''Homo sapiens'' fossils were discovered''.\" When handwritten, a binomial name should be underlined; for example, <u>Homo sapiens</u>.<ref name=\"tan\">{{citation |url=http://www.cdtl.nus.edu.sg/success/sl43.htm |title=Understanding and Learning Scientific Names of Species |author1=Hugh T.W.

The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the ''ICZN'' the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. The ''ICZN'' recommends that the \"original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name.\"{{sfn|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |1999|loc=Recommendation 51a}} For names governed by the ''ICNafp'' the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The [[International Plant Names Index]] maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too.\n\nWhen the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ''ICNafp'' also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the ''ICNafp'', the original name is then called the [[basionym]]. Some examples:\n*(Plant) ''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation for \"Linnaeus\"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name.\n*(Plant) ''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.) Rothm.&nbsp;\u2013 Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell ''Scilla italica''; that is the basionym. [[Werner Hugo Paul Rothmaler|Rothmaler]] later transferred it to the genus ''Hyacinthoides''.\n*(Animal) ''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)&nbsp;\u2013 the original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; unlike the ''ICNafp'', the ''ICZN'' does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.\n\n==Other ranks==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\n{{main|Biological nomenclature|Trinomial nomenclature|Infraspecific name (botany)}}\n\nBinomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, ''Passer domesticus'', belongs to the family [[Passeridae]]. Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany.\n\nRanks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ''ICZN'' and the ''ICNafp''. In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the [[olive-backed pipit]] is ''Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii''. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a \"connecting term\" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is ''Sambucus nigra'' subsp. ''canadensis''; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' f. ''albiflorum''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Botanical name]]\n* [[Hybrid name (botany)]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]]\n* [[List of zoologists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[Scientific terminology]]\n* [[Species description]]\n* [[Undescribed taxon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes }}\n*{{Citation |last=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ''online'' |edition=4th |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |isbn=978-0-85301-006-7 |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ |accessdate=20 June 2011 }}\n*{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.\n\nIn modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a [[proper noun]] such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist [[Thomas Drummond (botanist)|Thomas Drummond]]) is now written as ''[[Phlox drummondii]]''.\n\nIn scientific works, the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authority|authority]] for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified.\n*In [[zoology]]\n** \"''[[Patella vulgata]]'' Linnaeus, 1758\".

The original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; the parentheses indicate that the species is now considered to belong in a different genus. The ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made, although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information.\n*In [[botany]]\n**\"''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation used in botany for \"Linnaeus\".\n**\"''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.)

This is not the case for binomial names, since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed. Above the rank of genus, binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent; for example, a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another, unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family, or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus. The independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]] includes both nomenclature and classification.

However, the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources, of which Latin is only one. These include:\n* Latin, either [[Latin|classical]] or [[New Latin|medieval]]. Thus, both parts of the binomial name ''Homo sapiens'' are Latin words, meaning \"wise\" (''sapiens'') \"human/man\" (''Homo'').\n* [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]]. The genus ''[[Rhododendron]]'' was named by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, itself derived from ''rhodon'', \"rose\", and ''dendron'', \"tree\".<ref>{{OEtymD|rhododendron}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|r(odo/dendron|\u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, {{LSJ|r(o/don|\u1fe5\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd}}, {{LSJ|de/ndreon|\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|ref}}.</ref> Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form.

It can have one of a number of forms:\n* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The [[house sparrow]] has the binomial name ''Passer domesticus''. Here ''domesticus'' (\"domestic\") simply means \"associated with the house\". The [[Nandina|sacred bamboo]] is ''Nandina domestic<u>a</u>''<ref>{{Harvnb|Hyam|Pankhurst|1995|p=334}}</ref> rather than ''Nandina domestic<u>us</u>'', since ''Nandina'' is feminine whereas ''Passer'' is masculine. The tropical fruit [[Lansium parasiticum|langsat]] is a product of the plant ''Lansium parasitic<u>um</u>'', since ''Lansium'' is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' (as in the previous example of ''domesticus''); ''-is'', ''-is'', ''-e'' (e.g. ''tristis'', meaning \"sad\"); and ''-or'', ''-or'', ''-us'' (e.g. ''minor'', meaning \"smaller\"). For further information, see [[Latin declension#Adjectives|Latin declension: Adjectives]].\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is ''Panthera leo''. Grammatically the noun is said to be in [[apposition]] to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, ''Panthera'' is feminine and ''leo'' is masculine.\n[[File:Talauma hodgsonii.jpg|thumb|''Magnolia hodgsonii'']]\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the [[Latin declension|declension]] of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are ''-ii'' or ''-i'' in the singular and ''-orum'' in the plural, and for feminine nouns ''-ae'' in the singular and ''-arum'' in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the [[Tibetan antelope]] (''Pantholops hodgsonii''), the shrub ''[[Magnolia hodgsonii]]'', or the [[olive-backed pipit]] (''Anthus hodgsoni''). The meaning is \"of the person named\", so that ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' means \"Hodgson's magnolia\". The ''-ii'' or ''-i'' endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, ''hodgsonae'' would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example ''Anthus hodgsoni'' was named by [[Charles Wallace Richmond]], in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'', meaning \"of the [[Chalumna River]]\". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', where ''coli'' means \"of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]\". This formation is common in parasites, as in ''[[Xenos vesparum]]'', where ''vesparum'' means \"of the wasps\", since ''Xenos vesparum'' is a parasite of wasps.\n\nWhereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of ''hodgsonii'' above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom.\n\n==Codes==\n\nFrom the early 19th century<!--Strickland code was 1841--> onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names.<!--CITATION--> In the course of time these became [[nomenclature codes]]. The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') governs the naming of animals,<ref name=ICZN>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}</ref> the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp'') that of plants (including [[cyanobacteria]]), and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]'' (''ICNB'') that of [[bacteria]] (including [[Archaea]]). [[Virus]] names are governed by the ''[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'' (''ICTV''), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.:\n* \"Binomial nomenclature\" is the correct term for botany,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 23</ref> although it is also used by zoologists.<ref>{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Diane |year=2003 |title=Guide to reference and information sources in the zoological sciences |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=978-1-56308-977-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoreference0000schm }}, [//books.google.com/books?id=EqJrbvJU4uwC&pg=PA4 p. 4]</ref> Since 1953, \"binomi<u>n</u>al nomenclature\" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina).<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 2, Article 5</ref>\n* Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the \"generic name\". In the zoological code (''ICZN''), the second part of the name is a \"specific name\". In the botanical code (''ICNafp''), it is a \"specific epithet\". Together, these two parts are referred to as a \"species name\" or \"binomen\" in the zoological code; or \"species name\", \"binomial\", or \"binary combination\" in the botanical code. \"Species name\" is the only term common to the two codes.\n* The ''ICNafp'', the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a [[tautonym]]), whereas the ''ICZN'', the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomial ''Bison bison''; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant.\n* The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In [[botany]] the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published ''[[Species Plantarum]]''). In [[zoology]] the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', 10th Edition, and also [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Clerck's]] ''Aranei Svecici''). [[Bacteriology]] started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980.<ref>{{Citation |last=Sneath |first=P.H.A. |year=2003 |publisher=International Union of Microbiological Societies |url=http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |accessdate=20 June 2013 |title=A short history of the Bacteriological Code |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070542/http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of terminology for the names of species in the ICZN and ICNafp\n!

(There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names [[clade]]s. This is called the ''[[PhyloCode]]''.)\n\n===Differences in handling personal names===\nAs noted above, there are some differences between the codes in the way in which binomials can be formed; for example the ''ICZN'' allows both parts to be the same, while the ''ICNafp'' does not. Another difference is in the way in which personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The ''ICNafp'' sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not \"er\") are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding \"-ius\" (for a man) or \"-ia\" (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning \"of that person or persons\").

The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the ''ICZN'' the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. The ''ICZN'' recommends that the \"original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name.\"{{sfn|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |1999|loc=Recommendation 51a}} For names governed by the ''ICNafp'' the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The [[International Plant Names Index]] maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too.\n\nWhen the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ''ICNafp'' also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the ''ICNafp'', the original name is then called the [[basionym]]. Some examples:\n*(Plant) ''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation for \"Linnaeus\"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name.\n*(Plant) ''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.) Rothm.&nbsp;\u2013 Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell ''Scilla italica''; that is the basionym. [[Werner Hugo Paul Rothmaler|Rothmaler]] later transferred it to the genus ''Hyacinthoides''.\n*(Animal) ''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)&nbsp;\u2013 the original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; unlike the ''ICNafp'', the ''ICZN'' does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.\n\n==Other ranks==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\n{{main|Biological nomenclature|Trinomial nomenclature|Infraspecific name (botany)}}\n\nBinomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, ''Passer domesticus'', belongs to the family [[Passeridae]]. Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany.\n\nRanks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ''ICZN'' and the ''ICNafp''. In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the [[olive-backed pipit]] is ''Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii''. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a \"connecting term\" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is ''Sambucus nigra'' subsp. ''canadensis''; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' f. ''albiflorum''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Botanical name]]\n* [[Hybrid name (botany)]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]]\n* [[List of zoologists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[Scientific terminology]]\n* [[Species description]]\n* [[Undescribed taxon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes }}\n*{{Citation |last=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ''online'' |edition=4th |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |isbn=978-0-85301-006-7 |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ |accessdate=20 June 2011 }}\n*{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

It plays a fundamental role in [[binomial nomenclature]], the system of naming [[organisms]], where it is combined with the scientific name of a [[species]]: see [[Specific name (botany)]] and [[Specific name (zoology)]].\n\n=== Use in nomenclature ===\n{{Main|Binomial nomenclature|Taxonomy (biology)|Author citation (zoology)|Author citation (botany)}}\nThe rules for the [[scientific name]]s of [[organisms]] are laid down in the [[Nomenclature Codes]], which allow each species a single unique name that, for \"[[animals]]\" (including [[protists]]), \"[[plants]]\" (also including [[algae]] and [[fungi]]) and [[prokaryotes]] ([[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]), is [[Latin]] and binomial in form; this contrasts with [[common name|common]] or [[vernacular]] names, which are non-standardized, can be non-unique, and typically also vary by country and language of usage. \n\nExcept for [[Virus classification|viruses]], the standard format for a [[species]] name comprises the generic name, indicating the genus to which the species belongs, followed by the specific epithet, which (within that genus) is unique to the species. For example, the [[gray wolf]]'s scientific name is {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus}}'',}} with ''[[Canis]]'' (Lat. \"dog\") being the generic name shared by the wolf's close relatives and ''lupus'' (Lat. \"wolf\") being the specific name particular to the wolf. A botanical example would be ''[[Hibiscus arnottianus]]'', a particular species of the genus ''[[Hibiscus]]'' native to Hawaii. The specific name is written in lower-case and may be followed by [[subspecies]] names in [[zoology]] or a variety of [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific names]] in [[botany]]. \n\nWhen the generic name is already known from [[Context (language use)|context]], it may be shortened to its initial letter, for example ''C. lupus'' in place of ''Canis lupus''. Where species are further subdivided, the generic name (or its abbreviated form) still forms the leading portion of the scientific name, for example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus familiaris}}''}} for the domestic dog (when considered a subspecies of the gray wolf) in zoology, or as a botanical example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Hibiscus arnottianus}}'' ssp. ''{{lang|la|immaculatus}}''}}. Also, as visible in the above examples, the Latinised portions of the scientific names of genera and their included species (and infraspecies, where applicable) are, by convention, written in [[Italic type|italics]].\n\nThe scientific names of [[virus]] species are descriptive, not binomial in form, and may or may not incorporate an indication of their containing genus; for example, the virus species \"Salmonid herpesvirus 1\", \"Salmonid herpesvirus 2\" and \"Salmonid herpesvirus 3\" are all within the genus ''[[Salmonivirus]]'', however, the genus to which the species with the formal names \"[[Everglades virus]]\" and \"[[Ross River virus]]\" are assigned is ''[[Alphavirus]]''.\n\nAs with scientific names at other ranks, in all groups other than viruses, names of genera may be cited with their authorities, typically in the form \"author, year\" in zoology, and \"standard abbreviated author name\" in botany. Thus in the examples above, the genus ''Canis'' would be cited in full as \"''Canis'' Linnaeus, 1758\" (zoological usage), while ''Hibiscus'', also first established by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] but in 1753, is simply \"''Hibiscus'' L.\" (botanical usage).\n\n=== The type concept===\n{{see also|Type genus|Type species|Type specimen}}\nEach genus should have a designated [[type (biology)|type]], although in practice there is a backlog of older names without one. In zoology, this is the [[type species]] and the generic name is permanently associated with the [[type specimen]] of its type species. Should the specimen turn out to be assignable to another genus, the generic name linked to it becomes a [[junior synonym]] and the remaining [[taxon|taxa]] in the former genus need to be reassessed.\n\n===Categories of generic name===\nIn zoological usage, taxonomic names, including those of genera, are classified as \"[[available name|available]]\" or \"unavailable\". Available names are those published in accordance with the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and not otherwise suppressed by subsequent decisions of the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN); the earliest such name for any taxon (for example, a genus) should then be selected as the \"[[valid name (zoology)|valid]]\" (i.e., current or accepted) name for the taxon in question. \n\nConsequently, there will be more available names than valid names at any point in time, which names are currently in use depending on the judgement of taxonomists in either combining taxa described under multiple names, or splitting taxa which may bring available names previously treated as synonyms back into use. \"Unavailable\" names in zoology comprise names that either were not published according to the provisions of the ICZN Code, or have subsequently been suppressed, e.g., incorrect original or subsequent spellings, names published only in a thesis, and generic names published after 1930 with no type species indicated.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\">{{cite book|author=D.

An invalidly published name is a ''nomen invalidum'' or ''nom. inval.''; a rejected name is a ''nomen rejiciendum'' or ''nom. rej.''; a later homonym of a validly published name is a ''nomen illegitimum'' or ''nom. illeg.''; for a full list refer the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICNafp) and the work cited above by Hawksworth, 2010.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\" /> In place of the \"valid taxon\" in zoology, the nearest equivalent in botany is \"[[correct name]]\" or \"current name\" which can, again, differ or change with alternative taxonomic treatments or new information that results in previously accepted genera being combined or split.\n\n[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|Prokaryote]] and [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|virus]] Codes of Nomenclature also exist which serve as a reference for designating currently accepted genus names as opposed to others which may be either reduced to synonymy, or, in the case of prokaryotes, relegated to a status of \"names without standing in prokaryotic nomenclature\".\n\nAn '''available''' (zoological) or '''validly published''' (botanical) name that has been historically applied to a genus but is not regarded as the accepted (current/valid) name for the taxon is termed a '''[[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]'''; some authors also include unavailable names in lists of synonyms as well as available names, such as misspellings, names previously published without fulfilling all of the requirements of the relevant nomenclatural Code, and rejected or suppressed names. \n\nA particular genus name may have zero to many synonyms, the latter case generally if the genus has been known for a long time and redescribed as new by a range of subsequent workers, or if a range of genera previously considered separate taxa have subsequently been consolidated into one. For example, the [[World Register of Marine Species]] presently lists 8 genus-level synonyms for the sperm whale genus ''[[Physeter]]'' Linnaeus, 1758,<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=137032 World Register of Marine Species: ''Physeter'' Linnaeus, 1758 ]</ref> and 13 for the bivalve genus ''[[Pecten (bivalve)|Pecten]]'' O.F. M\u00fcller, 1776.<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=138323 World Register of Marine Species: ''Pecten'' O. F. M\u00fcller, 1776]</ref>\n\n===Identical names (homonyms)===\nWithin the same kingdom, one generic name can apply to one genus only.  However, many names have been assigned (usually unintentionally) to two or more different genera. For example, the [[platypus]] belongs to the genus ''Ornithorhynchus'' although [[George Shaw]] named it ''Platypus'' in 1799 (these two names are thus '''''synonyms'')'''. However, the name ''Platypus'' had already been given to a group of [[ambrosia beetle]]s by [[Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst]] in 1793. A name that means two different things is a '''''homonym'''''. Since beetles and platypuses are both members of the kingdom Animalia, the name could not be used for both. [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] published the replacement name ''Ornithorhynchus'' in 1800.\n\nHowever, a genus in one [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] is allowed to bear a scientific name that is in use as a generic name (or the name of a taxon in another rank) in a kingdom that is governed by a different nomenclature code. Names with the same form but applying to different taxa are called \"homonyms\". Although this is discouraged by both the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], there are some five thousand such names in use in more than one kingdom. For instance, \n* ''[[Anura (frog)|Anura]]'' is the name of the [[order (biology)|order]] of [[frog]]s but also is the name of a [[synonym (botany)|non-current]] genus of plants; \n* ''Aotus'' is the generic name of both [[Aotus (pea)|golden peas]] and [[night monkey]]s; \n* ''Oenanthe'' is the generic name of both [[wheatear]]s and [[water dropwort]]s; \n* ''Prunella'' is the generic name of both [[accentor]]s and [[self-heal]]; and \n* ''Proboscidea'' is the order of [[elephant]]s and the genus of [[Proboscidea (plant)|devil's claws]].\n* The name of the genus ''[[Paramecia (alga)|Paramecia]]'' (an extinct red alga) is also the plural of the name of the genus ''[[Paramecium]]'' (which is in the SAR supergroup), which can also lead to confusion.\nA list of generic homonyms (with their authorities), including both available (validly published) and selected unavailable names, has been compiled by the [[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]] (IRMNG).<ref name =\"IRMNG\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.irmng.org/homonyms.php|title=IRMNG: Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera|website=www.irmng.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Use in higher classifications===\nThe [[type genus]] forms the base for higher [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] ranks, such as the family name {{lang|la|[[Canidae]]}} (\"Canids\") based on ''Canis''. However, this does not typically ascend more than one or two levels: the [[order (biology)|order]] to which dogs and wolves belong is {{lang|la|[[Carnivora]]}} (\"Carnivores\").\n\n==Numbers of accepted genera==\nThe numbers of either accepted, or all published genus names is not known precisely; Rees et al., 2020 estimate that approximately 310,000 accepted names (valid taxa) may exist, out of a total of c. 520,000 published names (including synonyms) as at end 2019, increasing at some 2,500 published generic names per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=Tony |last2=Vandepitte |first2=Leen |last3=Vanhoorne |first3=Bart |last4=Decock |first4=Wim |title=All genera of the world: an overview and estimates based on the March 2020 release of the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) |journal=Megataxa |volume=1 |pages=123-140 |year=2020 |url=https://www.mapress.com/j/mt/article/view/megataxa.1.2.3/39250 |doi=10.11646/megataxa.1.2.3|doi-access=free }}</ref>  \"Official\" registers of taxon names at all ranks, including genera, exist for a few groups only such as viruses<ref name = \"ICTV\" /> and prokaryotes,<ref>[http://www.bacterio.net/ List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]</ref> while for others there are compendia with no \"official\" standing such as ''Index Fungorum'' for Fungi,<ref>[http://www.indexfungorum.org/ ''Index Fungorum'']</ref> ''Index Nominum Algarum''<ref>[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/ina/ ''Index Nominum Algarum'']</ref> and AlgaeBase<ref>[http://www.algaebase.org/ AlgaeBase]</ref> for algae, ''Index Nominum Genericorum''<ref>[http://botany.si.edu/ing/ ''Index Nominum Genericorum'']</ref> and the International Plant Names Index<ref>[http://www.ipni.org/ The International Plant Names Index]</ref> for plants in general, and ferns through angiosperms, respectively, and ''[[Nomenclator Zoologicus]]''<ref>[http://ubio.org/NomenclatorZoologicus/ ''Nomenclator Zoologicus'']</ref> and the [[Index to Organism Names]] (http://www.organismnames.com/) for zoological names.\n\nTotals for both \"all names\" and estimates for \"accepted names\" as held in the ''[[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]]'' (IRMNG) are broken down further in the publication by Rees et al., 2020 cited above. The accepted names estimates are as follows, broken down by kingdom:\n[[File:Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al 2020.jpg|thumb|Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al., 2020]]\n* [[Animalia]]: 239,093 accepted genus names (\u00b1 55,350)\n* [[Plantae]]: 28,724 accepted genus names (\u00b1 7,721)\n* [[Fungi]]: 10,468 accepted genus names (\u00b1 182)\n* [[Chromista]]: 11,114 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,268)\n* [[Protozoa]]: 3,109 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,206)\n* [[Bacteria]]: 3,433 accepted genus names (\u00b1 115)\n* [[Archaea]]: 140 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n* [[Virus]]es: 851 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n\nThe cited ranges of uncertainty arise because IRMNG lists \"uncertain\" names (not researched therein) in addition to known \"accepted\" names; the values quoted are the mean of \"accepted\" names alone (all \"uncertain\" names treated as unaccepted) and \"accepted + uncertain\" names (all \"uncertain\" names treated as accepted), with the associated range of uncertainty indicating these two extremes.\n\nWithin Animalia, the largest phylum is [[Arthropoda]], with 151,697 \u00b1 33,160 accepted genus names, of which 114,387 \u00b1 27,654 are [[insects]] (class Insecta). Within Plantae, [[Tracheophya]] (vascular plants) make up the largest component, with 23,236 \u00b1 5,379 accepted genus names, of which 20,845 \u00b1 4,494 are [[angiosperms]] (superclass Angiospermae).\n\nBy comparison, the 2018 annual edition of the [[Catalogue of Life]] (estimated >90% complete, for extant species in the main) contains currently 175,363 \"accepted\" genus names for 1,744,204 living and 59,284 extinct species,<ref>[http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2018/info/ac Information: Catalogue of Life: 2018 Annual Checklist]</ref> also including genus names only (no species) for some groups.\n\n==Genus size==\n[[File:Number of reptile genera with a given number of species.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Number of reptile genera with a given number of species. Most genera have only one or a few species but a few may have hundreds. Based on data from the [[Reptile Database]] (as of May 2015).]]\n\nThe number of species in genera varies considerably among taxonomic groups. For instance, among (non-avian) [[reptile]]s, which have about 1180 genera, the most (>300) have only 1 species, ~360 have between 2 and 4 species, 260 have 5-10 species, ~200 have 11-50 species, and only 27 genera have more than 50 species (see figure).<ref>[[The Reptile Database]]</ref> However, some insect genera such as the bee genera ''[[Lasioglossum]]'' and ''[[Andrena]]'' have over 1000 species each.

Although all species within a genus are supposed to be \"similar\" there are no objective criteria for grouping species into genera. There is much debate among zoologists whether large, species-rich genera should be maintained, as it is extremely difficult to come up with identification keys or even character sets that distinguish all species. Hence, many taxonomists argue in favor of breaking down large genera. For instance, the lizard genus ''[[Anolis]]'' has been suggested to be broken down into 8 or so different genera which would bring its ~400 species to smaller, more manageable subsets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=K.

It plays a fundamental role in [[binomial nomenclature]], the system of naming [[organisms]], where it is combined with the scientific name of a [[species]]: see [[Specific name (botany)]] and [[Specific name (zoology)]].\n\n=== Use in nomenclature ===\n{{Main|Binomial nomenclature|Taxonomy (biology)|Author citation (zoology)|Author citation (botany)}}\nThe rules for the [[scientific name]]s of [[organisms]] are laid down in the [[Nomenclature Codes]], which allow each species a single unique name that, for \"[[animals]]\" (including [[protists]]), \"[[plants]]\" (also including [[algae]] and [[fungi]]) and [[prokaryotes]] ([[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]), is [[Latin]] and binomial in form; this contrasts with [[common name|common]] or [[vernacular]] names, which are non-standardized, can be non-unique, and typically also vary by country and language of usage. \n\nExcept for [[Virus classification|viruses]], the standard format for a [[species]] name comprises the generic name, indicating the genus to which the species belongs, followed by the specific epithet, which (within that genus) is unique to the species. For example, the [[gray wolf]]'s scientific name is {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus}}'',}} with ''[[Canis]]'' (Lat. \"dog\") being the generic name shared by the wolf's close relatives and ''lupus'' (Lat. \"wolf\") being the specific name particular to the wolf. A botanical example would be ''[[Hibiscus arnottianus]]'', a particular species of the genus ''[[Hibiscus]]'' native to Hawaii. The specific name is written in lower-case and may be followed by [[subspecies]] names in [[zoology]] or a variety of [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific names]] in [[botany]]. \n\nWhen the generic name is already known from [[Context (language use)|context]], it may be shortened to its initial letter, for example ''C. lupus'' in place of ''Canis lupus''. Where species are further subdivided, the generic name (or its abbreviated form) still forms the leading portion of the scientific name, for example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus familiaris}}''}} for the domestic dog (when considered a subspecies of the gray wolf) in zoology, or as a botanical example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Hibiscus arnottianus}}'' ssp. ''{{lang|la|immaculatus}}''}}. Also, as visible in the above examples, the Latinised portions of the scientific names of genera and their included species (and infraspecies, where applicable) are, by convention, written in [[Italic type|italics]].\n\nThe scientific names of [[virus]] species are descriptive, not binomial in form, and may or may not incorporate an indication of their containing genus; for example, the virus species \"Salmonid herpesvirus 1\", \"Salmonid herpesvirus 2\" and \"Salmonid herpesvirus 3\" are all within the genus ''[[Salmonivirus]]'', however, the genus to which the species with the formal names \"[[Everglades virus]]\" and \"[[Ross River virus]]\" are assigned is ''[[Alphavirus]]''.\n\nAs with scientific names at other ranks, in all groups other than viruses, names of genera may be cited with their authorities, typically in the form \"author, year\" in zoology, and \"standard abbreviated author name\" in botany. Thus in the examples above, the genus ''Canis'' would be cited in full as \"''Canis'' Linnaeus, 1758\" (zoological usage), while ''Hibiscus'', also first established by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] but in 1753, is simply \"''Hibiscus'' L.\" (botanical usage).\n\n=== The type concept===\n{{see also|Type genus|Type species|Type specimen}}\nEach genus should have a designated [[type (biology)|type]], although in practice there is a backlog of older names without one. In zoology, this is the [[type species]] and the generic name is permanently associated with the [[type specimen]] of its type species. Should the specimen turn out to be assignable to another genus, the generic name linked to it becomes a [[junior synonym]] and the remaining [[taxon|taxa]] in the former genus need to be reassessed.\n\n===Categories of generic name===\nIn zoological usage, taxonomic names, including those of genera, are classified as \"[[available name|available]]\" or \"unavailable\". Available names are those published in accordance with the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and not otherwise suppressed by subsequent decisions of the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN); the earliest such name for any taxon (for example, a genus) should then be selected as the \"[[valid name (zoology)|valid]]\" (i.e., current or accepted) name for the taxon in question. \n\nConsequently, there will be more available names than valid names at any point in time, which names are currently in use depending on the judgement of taxonomists in either combining taxa described under multiple names, or splitting taxa which may bring available names previously treated as synonyms back into use. \"Unavailable\" names in zoology comprise names that either were not published according to the provisions of the ICZN Code, or have subsequently been suppressed, e.g., incorrect original or subsequent spellings, names published only in a thesis, and generic names published after 1930 with no type species indicated.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\">{{cite book|author=D.

The botanical equivalent of zoology's \"available name\" is a [[validly published name]]. An invalidly published name is a ''nomen invalidum'' or ''nom. inval.''; a rejected name is a ''nomen rejiciendum'' or ''nom. rej.''; a later homonym of a validly published name is a ''nomen illegitimum'' or ''nom. illeg.''; for a full list refer the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICNafp) and the work cited above by Hawksworth, 2010.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\" /> In place of the \"valid taxon\" in zoology, the nearest equivalent in botany is \"[[correct name]]\" or \"current name\" which can, again, differ or change with alternative taxonomic treatments or new information that results in previously accepted genera being combined or split.\n\n[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|Prokaryote]] and [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|virus]] Codes of Nomenclature also exist which serve as a reference for designating currently accepted genus names as opposed to others which may be either reduced to synonymy, or, in the case of prokaryotes, relegated to a status of \"names without standing in prokaryotic nomenclature\".\n\nAn '''available''' (zoological) or '''validly published''' (botanical) name that has been historically applied to a genus but is not regarded as the accepted (current/valid) name for the taxon is termed a '''[[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]'''; some authors also include unavailable names in lists of synonyms as well as available names, such as misspellings, names previously published without fulfilling all of the requirements of the relevant nomenclatural Code, and rejected or suppressed names. \n\nA particular genus name may have zero to many synonyms, the latter case generally if the genus has been known for a long time and redescribed as new by a range of subsequent workers, or if a range of genera previously considered separate taxa have subsequently been consolidated into one. For example, the [[World Register of Marine Species]] presently lists 8 genus-level synonyms for the sperm whale genus ''[[Physeter]]'' Linnaeus, 1758,<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=137032 World Register of Marine Species: ''Physeter'' Linnaeus, 1758 ]</ref> and 13 for the bivalve genus ''[[Pecten (bivalve)|Pecten]]'' O.F.

M\u00fcller, 1776]</ref>\n\n===Identical names (homonyms)===\nWithin the same kingdom, one generic name can apply to one genus only.  However, many names have been assigned (usually unintentionally) to two or more different genera. For example, the [[platypus]] belongs to the genus ''Ornithorhynchus'' although [[George Shaw]] named it ''Platypus'' in 1799 (these two names are thus '''''synonyms'')'''. However, the name ''Platypus'' had already been given to a group of [[ambrosia beetle]]s by [[Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst]] in 1793. A name that means two different things is a '''''homonym'''''. Since beetles and platypuses are both members of the kingdom Animalia, the name could not be used for both. [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] published the replacement name ''Ornithorhynchus'' in 1800.\n\nHowever, a genus in one [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] is allowed to bear a scientific name that is in use as a generic name (or the name of a taxon in another rank) in a kingdom that is governed by a different nomenclature code. Names with the same form but applying to different taxa are called \"homonyms\". Although this is discouraged by both the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], there are some five thousand such names in use in more than one kingdom. For instance, \n* ''[[Anura (frog)|Anura]]'' is the name of the [[order (biology)|order]] of [[frog]]s but also is the name of a [[synonym (botany)|non-current]] genus of plants; \n* ''Aotus'' is the generic name of both [[Aotus (pea)|golden peas]] and [[night monkey]]s; \n* ''Oenanthe'' is the generic name of both [[wheatear]]s and [[water dropwort]]s; \n* ''Prunella'' is the generic name of both [[accentor]]s and [[self-heal]]; and \n* ''Proboscidea'' is the order of [[elephant]]s and the genus of [[Proboscidea (plant)|devil's claws]].\n* The name of the genus ''[[Paramecia (alga)|Paramecia]]'' (an extinct red alga) is also the plural of the name of the genus ''[[Paramecium]]'' (which is in the SAR supergroup), which can also lead to confusion.\nA list of generic homonyms (with their authorities), including both available (validly published) and selected unavailable names, has been compiled by the [[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]] (IRMNG).<ref name =\"IRMNG\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.irmng.org/homonyms.php|title=IRMNG: Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera|website=www.irmng.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Use in higher classifications===\nThe [[type genus]] forms the base for higher [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] ranks, such as the family name {{lang|la|[[Canidae]]}} (\"Canids\") based on ''Canis''. However, this does not typically ascend more than one or two levels: the [[order (biology)|order]] to which dogs and wolves belong is {{lang|la|[[Carnivora]]}} (\"Carnivores\").\n\n==Numbers of accepted genera==\nThe numbers of either accepted, or all published genus names is not known precisely; Rees et al., 2020 estimate that approximately 310,000 accepted names (valid taxa) may exist, out of a total of c. 520,000 published names (including synonyms) as at end 2019, increasing at some 2,500 published generic names per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=Tony |last2=Vandepitte |first2=Leen |last3=Vanhoorne |first3=Bart |last4=Decock |first4=Wim |title=All genera of the world: an overview and estimates based on the March 2020 release of the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) |journal=Megataxa |volume=1 |pages=123-140 |year=2020 |url=https://www.mapress.com/j/mt/article/view/megataxa.1.2.3/39250 |doi=10.11646/megataxa.1.2.3|doi-access=free }}</ref>  \"Official\" registers of taxon names at all ranks, including genera, exist for a few groups only such as viruses<ref name = \"ICTV\" /> and prokaryotes,<ref>[http://www.bacterio.net/ List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]</ref> while for others there are compendia with no \"official\" standing such as ''Index Fungorum'' for Fungi,<ref>[http://www.indexfungorum.org/ ''Index Fungorum'']</ref> ''Index Nominum Algarum''<ref>[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/ina/ ''Index Nominum Algarum'']</ref> and AlgaeBase<ref>[http://www.algaebase.org/ AlgaeBase]</ref> for algae, ''Index Nominum Genericorum''<ref>[http://botany.si.edu/ing/ ''Index Nominum Genericorum'']</ref> and the International Plant Names Index<ref>[http://www.ipni.org/ The International Plant Names Index]</ref> for plants in general, and ferns through angiosperms, respectively, and ''[[Nomenclator Zoologicus]]''<ref>[http://ubio.org/NomenclatorZoologicus/ ''Nomenclator Zoologicus'']</ref> and the [[Index to Organism Names]] (http://www.organismnames.com/) for zoological names.\n\nTotals for both \"all names\" and estimates for \"accepted names\" as held in the ''[[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]]'' (IRMNG) are broken down further in the publication by Rees et al., 2020 cited above. The accepted names estimates are as follows, broken down by kingdom:\n[[File:Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al 2020.jpg|thumb|Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al., 2020]]\n* [[Animalia]]: 239,093 accepted genus names (\u00b1 55,350)\n* [[Plantae]]: 28,724 accepted genus names (\u00b1 7,721)\n* [[Fungi]]: 10,468 accepted genus names (\u00b1 182)\n* [[Chromista]]: 11,114 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,268)\n* [[Protozoa]]: 3,109 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,206)\n* [[Bacteria]]: 3,433 accepted genus names (\u00b1 115)\n* [[Archaea]]: 140 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n* [[Virus]]es: 851 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n\nThe cited ranges of uncertainty arise because IRMNG lists \"uncertain\" names (not researched therein) in addition to known \"accepted\" names; the values quoted are the mean of \"accepted\" names alone (all \"uncertain\" names treated as unaccepted) and \"accepted + uncertain\" names (all \"uncertain\" names treated as accepted), with the associated range of uncertainty indicating these two extremes.\n\nWithin Animalia, the largest phylum is [[Arthropoda]], with 151,697 \u00b1 33,160 accepted genus names, of which 114,387 \u00b1 27,654 are [[insects]] (class Insecta). Within Plantae, [[Tracheophya]] (vascular plants) make up the largest component, with 23,236 \u00b1 5,379 accepted genus names, of which 20,845 \u00b1 4,494 are [[angiosperms]] (superclass Angiospermae).\n\nBy comparison, the 2018 annual edition of the [[Catalogue of Life]] (estimated >90% complete, for extant species in the main) contains currently 175,363 \"accepted\" genus names for 1,744,204 living and 59,284 extinct species,<ref>[http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2018/info/ac Information: Catalogue of Life: 2018 Annual Checklist]</ref> also including genus names only (no species) for some groups.\n\n==Genus size==\n[[File:Number of reptile genera with a given number of species.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Number of reptile genera with a given number of species. Most genera have only one or a few species but a few may have hundreds. Based on data from the [[Reptile Database]] (as of May 2015).]]\n\nThe number of species in genera varies considerably among taxonomic groups. For instance, among (non-avian) [[reptile]]s, which have about 1180 genera, the most (>300) have only 1 species, ~360 have between 2 and 4 species, 260 have 5-10 species, ~200 have 11-50 species, and only 27 genera have more than 50 species (see figure).<ref>[[The Reptile Database]]</ref> However, some insect genera such as the bee genera ''[[Lasioglossum]]'' and ''[[Andrena]]'' have over 1000 species each. The largest flowering plant genus, ''[[Astragalus]]'', contains over 3,000 species.<ref name=\"Frodin\">{{cite journal |last=Frodin |first=David G. |year=2004 |title=History and concepts of big plant genera |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=753\u2013776 |jstor=4135449 |doi=10.2307/4135449}}</ref>\n\nWhich species are assigned to a genus is somewhat arbitrary. Although all species within a genus are supposed to be \"similar\" there are no objective criteria for grouping species into genera. There is much debate among zoologists whether large, species-rich genera should be maintained, as it is extremely difficult to come up with identification keys or even character sets that distinguish all species. Hence, many taxonomists argue in favor of breaking down large genera. For instance, the lizard genus ''[[Anolis]]'' has been suggested to be broken down into 8 or so different genera which would bring its ~400 species to smaller, more manageable subsets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=K.
