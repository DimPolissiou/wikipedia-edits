The Master releases Gallifrey from its time lock. However, Gallifrey's reemergence is eventually stopped and reversed after it is made clear that the release of Gallifrey would lead to the Time Lords destroying time \u2014 in effect destroying the universe \u2014 in order to defeat the Daleks and ultimately to preserve the Time Lords at the expense of all creation. Lord President [[Rassilon]] also believes that this action would elevate them to a higher form of existence, becoming \"creatures of consciousness\". Upon realising the scope of Rassilon's plan for self-preservation, the Tenth Doctor recalls that [[War Doctor|the Doctor that fought in the Time War]] had attempted to stop them during the war.

However, this message inadvertently attracts various races, including the [[Daleks]] and [[Cybermen]], to lay siege to Trenzalore; the Eleventh Doctor remaining to protect the inhabitants, but not wanting to release the Time Lords as this would mean the destruction of Trenzalore and the initiation of another Time War. Hundreds of years later, Clara convinces the Time Lords to help the Doctor, dying from old age in his final regeneration, and the crack closes, before reopening in the sky above Trenzalore.

In the Dark Times (occasionally mentioned in the televised serials such as ''[[The Five Doctors]]''), Gallifrey was at the centre of an empire covering dozens of worlds and continually being extended by heroes such as Prydonius (whom the Time Lord chapter is named after). Ancient Gallifreyans are all telepathic and were ruled by a female cult centred on a figure called the Pythia, who controlled the population through mysticism and prophecies. When the prophetic powers of the last of the Pythias failed her, Rassilion, Omega and a shadowy figure known as The Other seized power in the name of science and rationality. Seeing this, the Pythia committed suicide and cursed Gallifrey, killing all children in their wombs and making the world sterile. To combat this, Rassilion restructured society and used genetic looms to create new generations of Gallifreyans, who emerge from the looms as fully grown adults. Each of the Great Houses is allotted a total of forty-five cousins and given a regeneration cycle of thirteen lives. The Houses themselves are to some degree alive, in the same way TARDISes are, and the furniture can move about, occasionally growing into 'Drudges' who function as servants for the family. [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] was loomed in the House of Lungbarrow in the mountains of South Gallifrey, but unique among the house's cousins, he has a belly button.<ref name=\"times crucible\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Platt |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Platt (writer) |date=20 March 1997 |title=Lungbarrow |titlelink=Lungbarrow |series=[[Virgin New Adventures]] |url= |location= |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |page= |isbn=0-426-20502-2 |access-date= }}</ref> This sterility backstory is contradicted by on screen depictions and descriptions of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] and the Doctor as children,<ref name=\"drums\"/><ref name=\"time monster\"/><ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Girl in the Fireplace |episode-link=The Girl in the Fireplace |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Euros (director) |last2=Lyn |author-link2=Euros Lyn |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=6 May 2006 |season= |series-no=2 |number=4 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote='''Reinette:''' You're in my memories.

The Master releases Gallifrey from its time lock. However, Gallifrey's reemergence is eventually stopped and reversed after it is made clear that the release of Gallifrey would lead to the Time Lords destroying time \u2014 in effect destroying the universe \u2014 in order to defeat the Daleks and ultimately to preserve the Time Lords at the expense of all creation. Lord President [[Rassilon]] also believes that this action would elevate them to a higher form of existence, becoming \"creatures of consciousness\". Upon realising the scope of Rassilon's plan for self-preservation, the Tenth Doctor recalls that [[War Doctor|the Doctor that fought in the Time War]] had attempted to stop them during the war. Eventually, the Master comes to the aid of the Tenth Doctor and prevents Rassilon and the rest of Gallifrey from coming through, breaking the link that held Gallifrey in relative time to 21st-century Earth.<ref name=\"end of time two\"/>\n\nIt is stated by the Tenth Doctor in \"The End of Time\" that Gallifrey is not how he and the Master knew it in their youth.

However, this message inadvertently attracts various races, including the [[Daleks]] and [[Cybermen]], to lay siege to Trenzalore; the Eleventh Doctor remaining to protect the inhabitants, but not wanting to release the Time Lords as this would mean the destruction of Trenzalore and the initiation of another Time War. Hundreds of years later, Clara convinces the Time Lords to help the Doctor, dying from old age in his final regeneration, and the crack closes, before reopening in the sky above Trenzalore.

In the Dark Times (occasionally mentioned in the televised serials such as ''[[The Five Doctors]]''), Gallifrey was at the centre of an empire covering dozens of worlds and continually being extended by heroes such as Prydonius (whom the Time Lord chapter is named after). Ancient Gallifreyans are all telepathic and were ruled by a female cult centred on a figure called the Pythia, who controlled the population through mysticism and prophecies. When the prophetic powers of the last of the Pythias failed her, Rassilion, Omega and a shadowy figure known as The Other seized power in the name of science and rationality. Seeing this, the Pythia committed suicide and cursed Gallifrey, killing all children in their wombs and making the world sterile. To combat this, Rassilion restructured society and used genetic looms to create new generations of Gallifreyans, who emerge from the looms as fully grown adults. Each of the Great Houses is allotted a total of forty-five cousins and given a regeneration cycle of thirteen lives. The Houses themselves are to some degree alive, in the same way TARDISes are, and the furniture can move about, occasionally growing into 'Drudges' who function as servants for the family. [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] was loomed in the House of Lungbarrow in the mountains of South Gallifrey, but unique among the house's cousins, he has a belly button.<ref name=\"times crucible\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Platt |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Platt (writer) |date=20 March 1997 |title=Lungbarrow |titlelink=Lungbarrow |series=[[Virgin New Adventures]] |url= |location= |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |page= |isbn=0-426-20502-2 |access-date= }}</ref> This sterility backstory is contradicted by on screen depictions and descriptions of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] and the Doctor as children,<ref name=\"drums\"/><ref name=\"time monster\"/><ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Girl in the Fireplace |episode-link=The Girl in the Fireplace |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Euros (director) |last2=Lyn |author-link2=Euros Lyn |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=6 May 2006 |season= |series-no=2 |number=4 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote='''Reinette:''' You're in my memories.

It is on a low plateau above flood level. The geological foundation comprises [[Norwich Crag Formation]] and [[Red Crag Formation]] bedrock of [[Pleistocene]] age above [[Eocene]] [[London Clay]].  The Crag deposits predominantly consist of medium dense and dense sands with thin layers of clay and silt and fossiliferous shelly horizons. The Crag strata extend to a depth of 200 feet (60 metres) below ground level. In 1972/73 Sizewell A was awarded the [[Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside|Christopher Hinton]] trophy in recognition of good [[housekeeping]][[File:Hinton Cup.JPG|thumb|Hinton Cup]]\n\nThe site is reached by road, with the nearest railhead about one mile inland at Sizewell Halt.  Sidings were installed at the railhead primarily to transport irradiated elements to the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] plant at [[Sellafield]], [[Cumbria]]. Nuclear fuel was handled by a crane loading facility at the end of the five mile Leiston/Sizewell branch railway. This is connected to the [[East Suffolk line|East Suffolk Line]] via a south-facing junction to the north of [[Saxmundham railway station|Saxmundham station]]. The line was extended and used for the delivery of construction materials for Sizewell B power station in the 1980s. The line is now only rarely used for transportation of spent fuels from Sizewell B since the completion of decommissioning of Sizewell A in 2006. A new branch line off the Leiston branch has been proposed for rail terminals for the construction of Sizewell C power station to the north of the existing B power station.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scotchman|first=Iain C.|date=February 2019|title=Sizewell-C could generate freight|url=|journal=Modern Railways|volume=76|pages=17|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe Midlands Project Group of the Central Electricity Generating Board ([[CEGB]]) planned and managed the project.

These supplied heat to eight boiler units, four associated with each reactor. The steam produced by the boilers was fed to two turbo-generators each rated at 325&nbsp;MW, but which operated at a reduced capacity of 250&nbsp;MW from 1969.\n\nThe reactors and turbines were both supplied by English Electric.<ref name=plants>[http://www.industcards.com/nuclear-uk.htm Nuclear Power Plants in the UK] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090719150823/http://www.industcards.com/nuclear%2Duk.htm |date=2009-07-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Building specification===\nThe foundations for the reactors and associated boilers are provided by a reinforced concrete raft 8 feet (2.4 metres) thick, founded on the sand with a designed net bearing pressure of 3.5 tons per square foot.  The biological shields are 100 feet (30.5 metres) high and vary between 10 and 14 feet (3 and 4.3 metres) thick.  The composite steel and reinforced concrete cap above each reactor is 12 feet (3.7 metres) thick.  Both reactors were housed in a single building to achieve savings in building costs.\n\nThe turbine house is a steel framed, aluminium clad building 380 feet (115.8 metres) long, 160 feet (48.8 metres) wide and 90 feet (27.4 metres) high, with a reinforced concrete basement 26 feet (7.9 metres) deep.  The foundations are provided by isolated bases and strip footings with a designed maximum bearing pressure of 3 tons per square foot.\n\nThe pumphouse which supplied the main turbines with 27 million gallons of cooling water per hour drew sea water from an intake structure about 1,350 feet (410 metres) offshore via twin 10 feet (3 metres) diameter tunnels.  This water was returned to the sea through similar tunnels discharging 350 feet (107 metres) offshore.\n\n=== Electricity output ===\nElectricity output from Sizewell A power station over the period 1966-84 was as follows.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Sizewell A annual electricity output GWh.'''<graph>{\n\t\"version\": 2,\n\t\"width\": 700,\n\t\"height\": 300,\n\t\"data\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1966,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 28\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1967,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 1655\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1968,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2764\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1969,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3100\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1970,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2886\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1971,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3126\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1972,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3348\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1973,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2708\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1974,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2906\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1975,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3157\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1976,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3444\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1977,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3327\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1978,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3354\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1979,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3382\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1980,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3270\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1981,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2748\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1982,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 1745\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1983,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2154\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1984,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2946\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"scales\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"ordinal\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"width\",\n\t\t\t\"zero\": false,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"linear\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"height\",\n\t\t\t\"nice\": true,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"axes\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"marks\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"rect\",\n\t\t\t\"from\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"enter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y2\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": 0\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"fill\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"steelblue\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"width\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"band\": \"true\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"offset\": -1\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}</graph>\n\n===Decommissioning===\nThe power station was shut down on 31 December 2006.<ref name=nei/> The [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] (NDA) is responsible for placing contracts for the decommissioning of Sizewell A, at a budgeted cost of \u00a31.2&nbsp;billion.

The containment design was not based on SNUPPS however, but was designed by NNC (National Nuclear Corporation - bought by [[AMEC]] in 2005) in conjunction with Bechtel.\n\nThe Wolf Creek and Callaway plants each have single half speed, 1,800&nbsp;RPM (60&nbsp;Hz), steam turbine-alternator sets which use the steam produced from the heat generated in the reactor to produce about 1,200&nbsp;MW of electricity at the US grid frequency of 60&nbsp;Hz. Such large turbo-alternator sets were not available in the UK at the time Sizewell B was designed. So that orders could be given to UK manufacturers, and to avoid project risk in dealing with what were at the time newly designed very large turbo-alternator sets, Sizewell B uses two full-speed, 3,000&nbsp;RPM (50&nbsp;Hz), nominal 660&nbsp;MW turbo-alternator sets similar to those used at [[Drax power station|Drax]] coal-fired power station, and at the last of the AGRs [[Heysham Power Station#Heysham 2|Heysham 2]], but adapted to cope with the wetter steam conditions produced by the PWR steam supply system. PWR steam supply systems produce saturated steam at lower temperature and pressure than the dry superheated steam produced by AGR reactors or coal-fired power stations, and the high- and intermediate-pressure stages of the steam turbines have to be designed cope with this<ref>Wet-steam Turbines for Nuclear Power Plants By Alexander Leyzerovich, PennWell Books, 2005, pp 23, 24</ref> Sizewell B can run at half power using one turbo-alternator.<ref name=eadt20111117>\n{{cite web\n | title= Sizewell: Nuclear station running at half power after turbine taken offline\n | work= East Anglian Daily Times\n | url= http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/sizewell_nuclear_station_running_at_half_power_after_turbine_taken_offline_1_1128043?ot=archant.PrintFriendlyPageLayout.ot\n | accessdate= 13 November 2011\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe major components were supplied by:<ref name=bnfl-20040609>\n{{cite web\n |first      = Malcolm\n |last       = Pick\n |title      = United Kingdom LWR Activities (IAEA Vienna presentation)\n |work       = BNFL\n |date       = 9 June 2004\n |url        = http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NE/NENP/NPTDS/Downloads/TWG2004_LWRHWR/uk.pdf\n |accessdate = 2 August 2011\n}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n</ref>\n* Reactor System: [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]]\n* Reactor Vessel: [[Framatome]] (main shell: [[Japan Steel Works]], domes and other components: Le Creusot Forge)<ref name=large-2016>{{cite report |page=24 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/france/PageFiles/266171/Note_LargeAndAssociates_EN_26092016.pdf |title=Irregularities and Anomalies Relating to the Forged Components of Le Creusot Forge |author=John Large |work=Large Associates |publisher=Greenpeace France |date=26 September 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n* Core Internals: Westinghouse\n* Steam Raising: [[Doosan Babcock]]\n* Turbines: [[GEC Alsthom]]\n* Civil works: [[John Laing plc|Laing]]\n* Fuel: [[Springfields]] Nuclear Fuel\n* Architect: YRM\n\nA distinctive white hemisphere envelopes the outer shell of the twin-walled containment building that protects the pressurised water reactor and its [[Steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]].\n\n===History===\nFirst announced in 1969 as an [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] (AGR) based power station,<ref>The Times Thursday, 30 Oct. 1969; pg. 5; Issue 57704; col A</ref> and then in 1974 as a [[SGHWR|steam-generating heavy water reactor]] (SGHWR), Sizewell B was eventually announced as a PWR power station in 1980.<ref>The Times, Thursday, 2 Oct. 1980; pg. 5; Issue 60739; col A</ref> The initial design submissions to the CEGB and NII were based on the design of the [[Trojan Nuclear Power Plant|Trojan]] plant at Portland, Oregon.<ref>The Times, Saturday, Jul 30, 1977</ref><ref>The Times, Thursday, Apr 23, 1981</ref> Designed by Westinghouse, construction of Trojan began in 1970 and was completed in 1975.

The Pre-Construction Safety Case was submitted to the NII in August 1981. The public inquiry was held between 1982 and 1985, and took over 16 million words of evidence, a record at the time. The chairman of the inquiry, Sir Frank Layfield, reported in early 1987 that, subject to a satisfactory safety case, there were no substantive reasons why the project should not proceed. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate accepted the Pre-Construction Safety Case and issued a licence to proceed with construction in August 1987.\n\nSizewell B was calculated to be economically viable at a 5% discount rate and was approved financially on that basis. The project was managed by the CEGB Sizewell B Project Management Team, which declared that it was completed on time and to budget, the final out-turn cost being \u00a32,030&nbsp;million. A 2000 post-startup evaluation estimated generating cost at around 6p/kWh (1.7p/MJ), excluding first-of-kind costs but using an 8% discount rate for the cost of capital, or about 8p/kWh (2.2p/MJ) including first-of-kind costs.<ref name=cabinet-office-2002>{{Cite document|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/pii.pdf|title=The Economics of Nuclear Power|author=Performance and Innovation Unit|publisher=[[Cabinet Office]]|date=February 2002|accessdate=2009-06-02|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081229193356/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/pii.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sizewell B reactor dome - geograph.org.uk - 1396226.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Sizewell B reactor dome]]\nSizewell B was built and commissioned between 1987 and 1995, and first synchronised with the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]] on 14 Feb 1995.\n\nThe original rating was for a thermal power of 3,444&nbsp;MW and gross electrical output of 1,250&nbsp;MW,<ref name=pris-b/> which after house load of 62&nbsp;MW gave a net output to the grid of 1,188&nbsp;MWe, equivalent to {{convert|8.7|TWh|PJ|abbr=on}} in the year of 2005.

It is on a low plateau above flood level. The geological foundation comprises [[Norwich Crag Formation]] and [[Red Crag Formation]] bedrock of [[Pleistocene]] age above [[Eocene]] [[London Clay]].  The Crag deposits predominantly consist of medium dense and dense sands with thin layers of clay and silt and fossiliferous shelly horizons. The Crag strata extend to a depth of 200 feet (60 metres) below ground level. In 1972/73 Sizewell A was awarded the [[Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside|Christopher Hinton]] trophy in recognition of good [[housekeeping]][[File:Hinton Cup.JPG|thumb|Hinton Cup]]\n\nThe site is reached by road, with the nearest railhead about one mile inland at Sizewell Halt.  Sidings were installed at the railhead primarily to transport irradiated elements to the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] plant at [[Sellafield]], [[Cumbria]]. Nuclear fuel was handled by a crane loading facility at the end of the five mile Leiston/Sizewell branch railway. This is connected to the [[East Suffolk line|East Suffolk Line]] via a south-facing junction to the north of [[Saxmundham railway station|Saxmundham station]]. The line was extended and used for the delivery of construction materials for Sizewell B power station in the 1980s. The line is now only rarely used for transportation of spent fuels from Sizewell B since the completion of decommissioning of Sizewell A in 2006.

The containment design was not based on SNUPPS however, but was designed by NNC (National Nuclear Corporation - bought by [[AMEC]] in 2005) in conjunction with Bechtel.\n\nThe Wolf Creek and Callaway plants each have single half speed, 1,800&nbsp;RPM (60&nbsp;Hz), steam turbine-alternator sets which use the steam produced from the heat generated in the reactor to produce about 1,200&nbsp;MW of electricity at the US grid frequency of 60&nbsp;Hz. Such large turbo-alternator sets were not available in the UK at the time Sizewell B was designed. So that orders could be given to UK manufacturers, and to avoid project risk in dealing with what were at the time newly designed very large turbo-alternator sets, Sizewell B uses two full-speed, 3,000&nbsp;RPM (50&nbsp;Hz), nominal 660&nbsp;MW turbo-alternator sets similar to those used at [[Drax power station|Drax]] coal-fired power station, and at the last of the AGRs [[Heysham Power Station#Heysham 2|Heysham 2]], but adapted to cope with the wetter steam conditions produced by the PWR steam supply system. PWR steam supply systems produce saturated steam at lower temperature and pressure than the dry superheated steam produced by AGR reactors or coal-fired power stations, and the high- and intermediate-pressure stages of the steam turbines have to be designed cope with this<ref>Wet-steam Turbines for Nuclear Power Plants By Alexander Leyzerovich, PennWell Books, 2005, pp 23, 24</ref> Sizewell B can run at half power using one turbo-alternator.<ref name=eadt20111117>\n{{cite web\n | title= Sizewell: Nuclear station running at half power after turbine taken offline\n | work= East Anglian Daily Times\n | url= http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/sizewell_nuclear_station_running_at_half_power_after_turbine_taken_offline_1_1128043?ot=archant.PrintFriendlyPageLayout.ot\n | accessdate= 13 November 2011\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe major components were supplied by:<ref name=bnfl-20040609>\n{{cite web\n |first      = Malcolm\n |last       = Pick\n |title      = United Kingdom LWR Activities (IAEA Vienna presentation)\n |work       = BNFL\n |date       = 9 June 2004\n |url        = http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NE/NENP/NPTDS/Downloads/TWG2004_LWRHWR/uk.pdf\n |accessdate = 2 August 2011\n}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n</ref>\n* Reactor System: [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]]\n* Reactor Vessel: [[Framatome]] (main shell: [[Japan Steel Works]], domes and other components: Le Creusot Forge)<ref name=large-2016>{{cite report |page=24 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/france/PageFiles/266171/Note_LargeAndAssociates_EN_26092016.pdf |title=Irregularities and Anomalies Relating to the Forged Components of Le Creusot Forge |author=John Large |work=Large Associates |publisher=Greenpeace France |date=26 September 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n* Core Internals: Westinghouse\n* Steam Raising: [[Doosan Babcock]]\n* Turbines: [[GEC Alsthom]]\n* Civil works: [[John Laing plc|Laing]]\n* Fuel: [[Springfields]] Nuclear Fuel\n* Architect: YRM\n\nA distinctive white hemisphere envelopes the outer shell of the twin-walled containment building that protects the pressurised water reactor and its [[Steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]].\n\n===History===\nFirst announced in 1969 as an [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] (AGR) based power station,<ref>The Times Thursday, 30 Oct. 1969; pg. 5; Issue 57704; col A</ref> and then in 1974 as a [[SGHWR|steam-generating heavy water reactor]] (SGHWR), Sizewell B was eventually announced as a PWR power station in 1980.<ref>The Times, Thursday, 2 Oct. 1980; pg. 5; Issue 60739; col A</ref> The initial design submissions to the CEGB and NII were based on the design of the [[Trojan Nuclear Power Plant|Trojan]] plant at Portland, Oregon.<ref>The Times, Saturday, Jul 30, 1977</ref><ref>The Times, Thursday, Apr 23, 1981</ref> Designed by Westinghouse, construction of Trojan began in 1970 and was completed in 1975.

The Pre-Construction Safety Case was submitted to the NII in August 1981. The public inquiry was held between 1982 and 1985, and took over 16 million words of evidence, a record at the time. The chairman of the inquiry, Sir Frank Layfield, reported in early 1987 that, subject to a satisfactory safety case, there were no substantive reasons why the project should not proceed. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate accepted the Pre-Construction Safety Case and issued a licence to proceed with construction in August 1987.\n\nSizewell B was calculated to be economically viable at a 5% discount rate and was approved financially on that basis. The project was managed by the CEGB Sizewell B Project Management Team, which declared that it was completed on time and to budget, the final out-turn cost being \u00a32,030&nbsp;million. A 2000 post-startup evaluation estimated generating cost at around 6p/kWh (1.7p/MJ), excluding first-of-kind costs but using an 8% discount rate for the cost of capital, or about 8p/kWh (2.2p/MJ) including first-of-kind costs.<ref name=cabinet-office-2002>{{Cite document|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/pii.pdf|title=The Economics of Nuclear Power|author=Performance and Innovation Unit|publisher=[[Cabinet Office]]|date=February 2002|accessdate=2009-06-02|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081229193356/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/pii.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sizewell B reactor dome - geograph.org.uk - 1396226.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Sizewell B reactor dome]]\nSizewell B was built and commissioned between 1987 and 1995, and first synchronised with the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]] on 14 Feb 1995.\n\nThe original rating was for a thermal power of 3,444&nbsp;MW and gross electrical output of 1,250&nbsp;MW,<ref name=pris-b/> which after house load of 62&nbsp;MW gave a net output to the grid of 1,188&nbsp;MWe, equivalent to {{convert|8.7|TWh|PJ|abbr=on}} in the year of 2005.

Many attempts have been made to group the superfamilies of the Lepidoptera into natural groups, most of which fail because one of the two groups is not monophyletic: [[Microlepidoptera]] and [[Macrolepidoptera]], [[Heterocera]] and [[Rhopalocera]], [[Jugatae]] and [[Frenatae]], [[Monotrysia]] and [[Ditrysia]].<ref name=\"scoble\">Scoble, MJ 1995. The Lepidoptera: Form, function and diversity. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; 404 p.</ref>\n\nAlthough the rules for distinguishing moths from butterflies are not well established, one very good guiding principle is that butterflies have thin antennae and (with the exception of the family [[Hedylidae]]) have small balls or clubs at the end of their antennae. Moth antennae are usually feathery with no ball on the end. The divisions are named by this principle: \"club-antennae\" (Rhopalocera) or \"varied-antennae\" (Heterocera).\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe [[modern English]] word \"moth\" comes from [[Old English]] \"''mo\u00f0\u00f0e''\" (cf. Northumbrian \"''moh\u00f0e''\") from [[Common Germanic]] (compare [[Old Norse]] \"''motti''\", [[Dutch language|Dutch]] \"''mot''\", and [[German language|German]] \"''Motte''\" all meaning \"moth\"). Its origins are possibly related to the Old English \"''ma\u00f0a''\" meaning \"[[maggot]]\" or from the root of \"[[midge]]\" which until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the [[larva]], usually in reference to devouring clothes.\n\n== Caterpillar ==\n\n[[File:Poplar hawk-moth.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Laothoe populi|Poplar hawk-moth caterpillar]] (''Laothoe populi'')]]\n\nMoth larvae, or [[caterpillar]]s, make [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s from which they emerge as fully grown moths with wings.

Both types of Lepidoptera are thought to have evolved along with [[flowering plants]], mainly because most modern species feed on flowering plants, both as adults and larvae. One of the earliest species thought to be a moth-ancestor is [[Archaeolepis|''Archaeolepis mane'']], whose fossil fragments show scaled wings similar to [[caddisflies]] in their veining.<ref>Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center<br/>\n[http://cdri.org/publications/nature-notes/evolution-ecology/evolution-of-moths-and-butterflies/ Evolution of Moths and Butterflies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106184057/http://cdri.org/publications/nature-notes/evolution-ecology/evolution-of-moths-and-butterflies/ |date=2014-01-06 }}<br/>\nStudying the evolution of butterflies and moths is challenging, since fossils are so rare. But the few Lepidopteran fossils that exist, captured in amber or compressed in fine-grained rocks, show great detail. The earliest Lepidopteran fossils appear in rocks that are about 190 million years old. These tiny fragments of scaled wings and bodies clearly indicate that moths evolved before butterflies.</ref>\n[[File:Moth kerala.jpg|thumb|Moth from Kerala, India]]\n\n== Economics ==\nMoths do not make any money as they do not have jobs.\n\n=== Significance to humans ===\n\n[[File:Moth September 2008-3.jpg|thumb|200px|An adult male pine processionary moth (''[[Thaumetopoea pityocampa]]'').

One hypothesis is called celestial or transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in the upper part of the visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon.

Many attempts have been made to group the superfamilies of the Lepidoptera into natural groups, most of which fail because one of the two groups is not monophyletic: [[Microlepidoptera]] and [[Macrolepidoptera]], [[Heterocera]] and [[Rhopalocera]], [[Jugatae]] and [[Frenatae]], [[Monotrysia]] and [[Ditrysia]].<ref name=\"scoble\">Scoble, MJ 1995. The Lepidoptera: Form, function and diversity. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; 404 p.</ref>\n\nAlthough the rules for distinguishing moths from butterflies are not well established, one very good guiding principle is that butterflies have thin antennae and (with the exception of the family [[Hedylidae]]) have small balls or clubs at the end of their antennae. Moth antennae are usually feathery with no ball on the end. The divisions are named by this principle: \"club-antennae\" (Rhopalocera) or \"varied-antennae\" (Heterocera).\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe [[modern English]] word \"moth\" comes from [[Old English]] \"''mo\u00f0\u00f0e''\" (cf. Northumbrian \"''moh\u00f0e''\") from [[Common Germanic]] (compare [[Old Norse]] \"''motti''\", [[Dutch language|Dutch]] \"''mot''\", and [[German language|German]] \"''Motte''\" all meaning \"moth\"). Its origins are possibly related to the Old English \"''ma\u00f0a''\" meaning \"[[maggot]]\" or from the root of \"[[midge]]\" which until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the [[larva]], usually in reference to devouring clothes.\n\n== Caterpillar ==\n\n[[File:Poplar hawk-moth.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Laothoe populi|Poplar hawk-moth caterpillar]] (''Laothoe populi'')]]\n\nMoth larvae, or [[caterpillar]]s, make [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s from which they emerge as fully grown moths with wings.

Both types of Lepidoptera are thought to have evolved along with [[flowering plants]], mainly because most modern species feed on flowering plants, both as adults and larvae. One of the earliest species thought to be a moth-ancestor is [[Archaeolepis|''Archaeolepis mane'']], whose fossil fragments show scaled wings similar to [[caddisflies]] in their veining.<ref>Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center<br/>\n[http://cdri.org/publications/nature-notes/evolution-ecology/evolution-of-moths-and-butterflies/ Evolution of Moths and Butterflies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106184057/http://cdri.org/publications/nature-notes/evolution-ecology/evolution-of-moths-and-butterflies/ |date=2014-01-06 }}<br/>\nStudying the evolution of butterflies and moths is challenging, since fossils are so rare. But the few Lepidopteran fossils that exist, captured in amber or compressed in fine-grained rocks, show great detail. The earliest Lepidopteran fossils appear in rocks that are about 190 million years old. These tiny fragments of scaled wings and bodies clearly indicate that moths evolved before butterflies.</ref>\n[[File:Moth kerala.jpg|thumb|Moth from Kerala, India]]\n\n== Economics ==\n\n=== Significance to humans ===\n\n[[File:Moth September 2008-3.jpg|thumb|200px|An adult male pine processionary moth (''[[Thaumetopoea pityocampa]]'').

One hypothesis is called celestial or transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in the upper part of the visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon.
