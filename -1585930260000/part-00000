They used their lands for hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Anishinabe knew no borders at the time and their land ranged both north and south of the US\u2013Canada border, and both east and west of the [[Red River (Canada)|Red River]]. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinabe people signed [[Treaty 1]] and moved onto reserves such as the [[Brokenhead Ojibway Nation|Brokenhead Indian Reserve]] and [[Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation]] Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|title=History and Heritage of Roseau River First Nation|accessdate=1 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205813/http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|archivedate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the government began surveying and staking out the land for the [[East Reserve]] (now the [[Hanover, Manitoba|R.M. of Hanover]]).\n\n===Early history===\nSteinbach was founded in 1874 by [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]-speaking [[Russian Mennonites]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title=City of Steinbach |access-date=25 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Many of Steinbach's 18 original settler families came directly from the Borosenko colony in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], now [[Ukraine]].<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\">{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Between Earth and Sky: Steinbach, The First 50 Years |publisher = Derksen Printers |date =September 2009}}</ref>\nThey took the name \"Steinbach\" from the village they lived in there. At the time they left for Canada, Borosenko was just ten years old, an off-shoot of the larger [[Molotschna]] (or Milk River) colony. However, Russia was not their ancestral homeland. Originating in [[Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking [[Flanders]] region of [[Belgium]] during the 16th century, the ancestors of Steinbach's Mennonite settlers also lived in [[Prussia]] for two centuries before their time in Ukraine.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\">{{cite web |url= http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title= Steinbach History 1874 - 1990 |date= 1 May 1990 |accessdate= 14 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date= 9 May 2008 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Within the settlement of Molotschna were a group of people following the [[Kleine Gemeinde]], known for practise of the New Testament teachings of non-resistance, community of sharing and the publication of the first inspirational books. This group was a small minority in Molotschna but its farmers were known as the best in the community.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1873, Mennonites from Russia became dissatisfied with increasing [[Russification]] and the removal of their military exemption, and sent delegates to Canada to investigate and negotiate terms of immigration. Many of the delegates decided to move their people to [[Kansas]], however, the more conservative groups, such as the Kleine Gemeinde, were persuaded to settle in Canada because the Canadian government was more generous in their guarantees of religious freedom. In 1873 a [[Privilegium of 1873 (Canada)|Privilegium]] was signed, and a year later Mennonites started to arrive in the region. The document guaranteed, among other things, military exemption, freedom of religion, private schools, and land, known as the [[East Reserve]].<ref name=\"Francis, E.K. 1955\">{{cite book |author = Francis, E.K. |title = In Search of Utopia |publisher = D.W. Friesens and Sons |date =1955}}</ref>\n\nTwo Mennonite groups settled in the East Reserve, the [[Bergthal Colony|Bergthalers]] and [[Kleine Gemeinde]]. Most of Steinbach's settlers were from Kleine Gemeinde families, who arrived late in the summer of 1874. When they arrived, they found that much of the better land in the reserve had already been settled a few months earlier by the Bergthaler and earlier Kleine Gemeinde families. The earlier settlers had come to realize the area suffered from excessive moisture and settled upon much of the higher lands and gravel ridges. So Steinbach's earliest Mennonite settlers settled in the northeast corner of the East Reserve. The 20 homesteads were laid out on the northeast side of present-day Main Street along the Steinbach Creek.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n[[File:Wind mill in Mennonite Heritage Village Steinbach Manitoba Canada 1 (5).JPG|thumb|upright|Windmill at [[Mennonite Heritage Village]] in Steinbach]]\n\nContrary to the preferences of the Canadian government, the early settlers of Steinbach, like other Mennonite villages, organized the village into a Strassendorf, or street village, with each family occupying a long narrow strip known as a ''Wirtschaft''.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Most of the settlers were farmers, but in a somewhat urban setting, who lived, to some degree, communally, and shared a common pasture at the end of the village. They started a school in the first year, and in the following year of 1875 built a school and teacherage.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's Main Street was hacked out of thick [[Populus \u00d7 canadensis|poplar]] bush along the creek, where a [[bison]] trail ran, a trail that was still used by Indigenous people during Steinbach's early years.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|title=Dad, God, and Me|author=Ralph Friesen|publisher=FriesenPress|date=2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1875, Steinbach's spiritual leader Jakob Barkman, who had led the Kleine Gemeinde to Canada, drowned in the Red River, along with Jakob K. Friesen on a trip to Winnipeg for supplies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jakob M. Barkman|publisher=GAMEO|url=https://www.gameo.org/index.php?title=Barkman,_Jakob_M._(1824-1875)|accessdate=February 17, 2002}}</ref> The absence of religious leadership in Steinbach created a vacuum that made the villagers receptive to [[John Holdeman]] when he visited in 1881. After Holdeman's visit many locals from the Kleine Gemeinde joined his new church, [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]]. This was the first of many [[schisms]] and revivals in Steinbach and eventually the town would be known for having dozens of churches, many of them different variations of Mennonite, a dynamic that has shaped the city's character.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/>\n\nIn 1877, [[Lord Dufferin]] toured Manitoba's new Mennonite settlements and stopped just west of Steinbach where he could see \"half a dozen villages\" in the distance. A crowd of 1000 people greeted his arrival.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> That same year, the first and original windmill in the town was built by Abraham S. Friesen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siamandas.com/time_machine/PAGES/more%20stories/STEINBACH.htm|title= History of Steinbach |publisher= |year= |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> After a period of eight years, in 1882, Mayor Gerhard Giesbrecht said that the village had grown to 28 families with a population of 128.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nVarious epidemics swept the area in the late 1800s, including [[scarlet fever]], [[whooping cough]], and [[diphtheria]]. In the spring of 1884 alone, more than seventy people died, mostly children. Another whooping cough epidemic took place in 1900.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy 1900 the settlers had drained the swamps and cleared the land making it more suitable for the farming of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. In the 1901 census, Steinbach had a population of 366, and almost the entire population still spoke Plautdietsch, with only a few reporting a knowledge of English.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===End of the Strassendorf===\nIn 1910, the [[linear settlement]] village design, or Strassendorf, for the community ended.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Prior to this time, the settlers of Steinbach lived in long narrow strips, called wirtschafts, along the Steinbach Creek. Following the lead of the neighbouring Mennonite village of [[Blumenort, Manitoba|Blumenort]], who had abandoned their Strassendorf system a year earlier, the village of Steinbach was surveyed and land was redistributed with individual titles to open-field properties. Those who were given inferior land were financially compensated by the others. Although a communal pasture for cattle was maintained for some decades after this, the end of the linear settlement meant the end of the traditional communal lifestyle of the Mennonites in this area, but also opened the area up to greater capitalist enterprise.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1911, the Kleine Gemeinde church, who had met in the village school up until this point, constructing a building on the south end of the village.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1912, J.R. Friesen opened a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] auto dealership in town, which was the first Ford dealership in Western Canada. At the time, Friesen was excommunicated from the [[Kleine Gemeinde]] for adopting the modern technology, but within a few years, many Steinbachers accepted the automobile as an acceptable mode of transportation.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nBy this time, Steinbach had a third Mennonite church, the [[Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches|Bruderthaler]], who, unlike the Kleine Gemeinde and Holdeman Mennonites, taught that being successful in business was not a sin and, in fact, was to be encouraged. The new theology moved Steinbach from a more traditional and agriculturally-based economy to one that emphasized capitalist endeavour.<ref>{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Revive Us Again: A Brief History of Revivalism in Steinbach |publisher = Preservings |date =December 2018}}</ref> Entrepreneurs took advantage of the business opportunities at the time and several small businesses sprang up. Many other important and large businesses developed as well, helping to establish Steinbach as a regional service centre for the area.\n\nBy 1915, Steinbach had grown to a population of 463 and continued to attract immigrants from Europe.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Many of the new immigrants were Bergthaler Mennonites, but Steinbach also was the destination for new German and Lutheran settlers, as well as some British families who had previously settled in the Clearspring Settlement slightly to the north.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's first bank, the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Bank]], opened in 1915.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], most Steinbach Mennonites were given an exemption from military service, as promised in the Privilegium they had agreed to upon immigration in the 1870s.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\" /> Mistakenly considered \"ethnic Germans\", even though they were actually primarily of Dutch ancestry, the Mennonites were caught up in the anti-German sentiment of the time and [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867-1942)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] banned Mennonites from Steinbach and other areas from voting in 1917.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\" />\n\nA year later in 1918, as soldiers returned to North America, [[Spanish flu]] struck the village, killing many. Mennonites in the region were particularly affected by the outbreak, dying at a rate nearly twice that of other ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=Local History and Coronavirus: 5 Questions with Glen Klassen|publisher=Mennotoba|accessdate=April 2, 2020|url=https://www.mennotoba.com/local-history-and-coronavirus-5-questions-with-glen-klassen/|author=Erin Unger}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Why Mennonte Death Rate Was Double The Average During Spanish Flu|author=Wesley Peters|publisher=Pembina Valley Online|url=https://pembinavalleyonline.com/local/why-mennonite-death-rate-was-double-average-during-spanish-flu|accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Borden banned Mennonites and other pacifists from immigrating to Canada for three years from 1919 to 1922.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> At the same time, there was the out-migration of the more conservative Mennonites, who left the area for [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]], after the Canadian government required them to learn English and attend public schools, issues which seemed to be in violation of the Privilegium signed in 1873.<ref name=\"Francis, E.K. 1955\"/>\n\nAfter the Mennonite immigration ban was lifted in 1922 by [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], a second wave of Mennonite immigration occurred due to the Russian Revolution, and many of the \"Russlander\" Mennonites took over farms and land left unoccupied by the Mennonites leaving for Latin America.

The same year, the last traditional Mennonite [[housebarn]] in Steinbach was torn down by car dealer (and later mayor) A.D. Penner.<ref name=reflections /> Partially in response to the destruction of heritage buildings in the area, such as the historic housebarn destroyed by A.D.

In 1967 the [[Mennonite Heritage Village]] museum in Steinbach was opened.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/>\n\nIn 1970, the year of Manitoba's centennial, Steinbach was visited by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Charles]].<ref name=reflections/> A crowd of 10,000 waited along the streets of Steinbach as the royals visited, coming from the east along Highway 52 after their visit to [[La Broquerie, Manitoba|La Brouqerie]].

They used their lands for hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Anishinabe knew no borders at the time and their land ranged both north and south of the US\u2013Canada border, and both east and west of the [[Red River (Canada)|Red River]]. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinabe people signed [[Treaty 1]] and moved onto reserves such as the [[Brokenhead Ojibway Nation|Brokenhead Indian Reserve]] and [[Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation]] Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|title=History and Heritage of Roseau River First Nation|accessdate=1 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205813/http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|archivedate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the government began surveying and staking out the land for the [[East Reserve]] (now the [[Hanover, Manitoba|R.M. of Hanover]]).\n\n===Early history===\nSteinbach was founded in 1874 by [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]-speaking [[Russian Mennonites]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title=City of Steinbach |access-date=25 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Many of Steinbach's 18 original settler families came directly from the Borosenko colony in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], now [[Ukraine]].<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\">{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Between Earth and Sky: Steinbach, The First 50 Years |publisher = Derksen Printers |date =September 2009}}</ref>\nThey took the name \"Steinbach\" from the village they lived in there. At the time they left for Canada, Borosenko was just ten years old, an off-shoot of the larger [[Molotschna]] (or Milk River) colony. However, Russia was not their ancestral homeland. Originating in [[Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking [[Flanders]] region of [[Belgium]] during the 16th century, the ancestors of Steinbach's Mennonite settlers also lived in [[Prussia]] for two centuries before their time in Ukraine.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\">{{cite web |url= http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title= Steinbach History 1874 - 1990 |date= 1 May 1990 |accessdate= 14 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date= 9 May 2008 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Within the settlement of Molotschna were a group of people following the [[Kleine Gemeinde]], known for practise of the New Testament teachings of non-resistance, community of sharing and the publication of the first inspirational books. This group was a small minority in Molotschna but its farmers were known as the best in the community.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1873, Mennonites from Russia became dissatisfied with increasing [[Russification]] and the removal of their military exemption, and sent delegates to Canada to investigate and negotiate terms of immigration. Many of the delegates decided to move their people to [[Kansas]], however, the more conservative groups, such as the Kleine Gemeinde, were persuaded to settle in Canada because the Canadian government was more generous in their guarantees of religious freedom. In 1873 a [[Privilegium of 1873 (Canada)|Privilegium]] was signed, and a year later Mennonites started to arrive in the region. The document guaranteed, among other things, military exemption, freedom of religion, private schools, and land, known as the [[East Reserve]].<ref name=\"Francis, E.K. 1955\">{{cite book |author = Francis, E.K. |title = In Search of Utopia |publisher = D.W. Friesens and Sons |date =1955}}</ref>\n\nTwo Mennonite groups settled in the East Reserve, the [[Bergthal Colony|Bergthalers]] and [[Kleine Gemeinde]]. Most of Steinbach's settlers were from Kleine Gemeinde families, who arrived late in the summer of 1874. When they arrived, they found that much of the better land in the reserve had already been settled a few months earlier by the Bergthaler and earlier Kleine Gemeinde families. The earlier settlers had come to realize the area suffered from excessive moisture and settled upon much of the higher lands and gravel ridges. So Steinbach's earliest Mennonite settlers settled in the northeast corner of the East Reserve. The 20 homesteads were laid out on the northeast side of present-day Main Street along the Steinbach Creek.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n[[File:Wind mill in Mennonite Heritage Village Steinbach Manitoba Canada 1 (5).JPG|thumb|upright|Windmill at [[Mennonite Heritage Village]] in Steinbach]]\n\nContrary to the preferences of the Canadian government, the early settlers of Steinbach, like other Mennonite villages, organized the village into a Strassendorf, or street village, with each family occupying a long narrow strip known as a ''Wirtschaft''.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Most of the settlers were farmers, but in a somewhat urban setting, who lived, to some degree, communally, and shared a common pasture at the end of the village. They started a school in the first year, and in the following year of 1875 built a school and teacherage.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's Main Street was hacked out of thick [[Populus \u00d7 canadensis|poplar]] bush along the creek, where a [[bison]] trail ran, a trail that was still used by Indigenous people during Steinbach's early years.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|title=Dad, God, and Me|author=Ralph Friesen|publisher=FriesenPress|date=2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1875, Steinbach's spiritual leader Jakob Barkman, who had led the Kleine Gemeinde to Canada, drowned in the Red River, along with Jakob K. Friesen on a trip to Winnipeg for supplies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jakob M. Barkman|publisher=GAMEO|url=https://www.gameo.org/index.php?title=Barkman,_Jakob_M._(1824-1875)|accessdate=February 17, 2002}}</ref> The absence of religious leadership in Steinbach created a vacuum that made the villagers receptive to [[John Holdeman]] when he visited in 1881. After Holdeman's visit many locals from the Kleine Gemeinde joined his new church, [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]]. This was the first of many [[schisms]] and revivals in Steinbach and eventually the town would be known for having dozens of churches, many of them different variations of Mennonite, a dynamic that has shaped the city's character.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/>\n\nIn 1877, [[Lord Dufferin]] toured Manitoba's new Mennonite settlements and stopped just west of Steinbach where he could see \"half a dozen villages\" in the distance. A crowd of 1000 people greeted his arrival.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> That same year, the first and original windmill in the town was built by Abraham S. Friesen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siamandas.com/time_machine/PAGES/more%20stories/STEINBACH.htm|title= History of Steinbach |publisher= |year= |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> After a period of eight years, in 1882, Mayor Gerhard Giesbrecht said that the village had grown to 28 families with a population of 128.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nVarious epidemics swept the area in the late 1800s, including [[scarlet fever]], [[whooping cough]], and [[diphtheria]]. In the spring of 1884 alone, more than seventy people died, mostly children. Another whooping cough epidemic took place in 1900.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy 1900 the settlers had drained the swamps and cleared the land making it more suitable for the farming of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. In the 1901 census, Steinbach had a population of 366, and almost the entire population still spoke Plautdietsch, with only a few reporting a knowledge of English.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===End of the Strassendorf===\nIn 1910, the [[linear settlement]] village design, or Strassendorf, for the community ended.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Prior to this time, the settlers of Steinbach lived in long narrow strips, called wirtschafts, along the Steinbach Creek. Following the lead of the neighbouring Mennonite village of [[Blumenort, Manitoba|Blumenort]], who had abandoned their Strassendorf system a year earlier, the village of Steinbach was surveyed and land was redistributed with individual titles to open-field properties. Those who were given inferior land were financially compensated by the others. Although a communal pasture for cattle was maintained for some decades after this, the end of the linear settlement meant the end of the traditional communal lifestyle of the Mennonites in this area, but also opened the area up to greater capitalist enterprise.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1911, the Kleine Gemeinde church, who had met in the village school up until this point, constructing a building on the south end of the village.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1912, J.R. Friesen opened a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] auto dealership in town, which was the first Ford dealership in Western Canada. At the time, Friesen was excommunicated from the [[Kleine Gemeinde]] for adopting the modern technology, but within a few years, many Steinbachers accepted the automobile as an acceptable mode of transportation.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nBy this time, Steinbach had a third Mennonite church, the [[Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches|Bruderthaler]], who, unlike the Kleine Gemeinde and Holdeman Mennonites, taught that being successful in business was not a sin and, in fact, was to be encouraged. The new theology moved Steinbach from a more traditional and agriculturally-based economy to one that emphasized capitalist endeavour.<ref>{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Revive Us Again: A Brief History of Revivalism in Steinbach |publisher = Preservings |date =December 2018}}</ref> Entrepreneurs took advantage of the business opportunities at the time and several small businesses sprang up.

In the past her name was Lisa and she worked with \u00c1lex ([[Mike Amigorena]]), who recruited her for this type of tasks and became her first love, and with Ciro (Luis Ziembrowski) with whom he planned and financed the scams. A robbery failed and the group disbanded. Mercedes, with a changed identity, began a new life away from scams. She married Rafael ([[Diego Torres (singer)|Diego Torres]]) and they had 3 children, Paloma ([[Candela Vetrano]]), Teo (Rom\u00e1n Almaraz) and Juana, who know absolutely nothing about their past, while living a normal life. One morning that seemed to be like any other, they discover that a new family, the Mayorga, moves to the most luxurious and sought-after house in the neighborhood. Mercedes, seeing them, is shocked and discovers that the family man is neither more nor less than \u00c1lex, her former love and partner in the thefts whom she believed dead. Ciro leaves prison after 20 years, and begins serving house arrest. He seeks revenge from his former partners for the crime he blames for having been imprisoned from his residence. The return of \u00c1lex to the life of Mercedes aims to conquer it again and to achieve its purpose he is in charge of hiring a group of actors to pretend to be a normal family and thus, be able to be close to Mercedes without attracting attention. One morning, Rafael is summoned to the office of his boss, Alberto Mercado ([[Antonio Gasalla]]) and inform him that he is fired. When he leave the company, Rafael is in a car crash with Carolina ([[Marcela Kloosterboer]]) and she offers him help and a job in her father's company. Carolina suffers from a mental illness, so she begins to become obsessed with Rafael to the point of approaching his family. After some problems with Carolina, Rafael is sincere with his wife and tells her the whole truth, so she gets upset. But Rafael later becomes angry when Mercedes reveals that \u00c1lex was her partner. From then on, the rivalry between him and \u00c1lex Mayorga grows even more. At that time, Paloma had started a relationship with Alex's supposed son, Lucas ([[Gast\u00f3n Soffritti]]) and becomes pregnant with Lucas. That was undoubtedly the hardest blow for Rafael. \u00c1lex goes to a place to face Rafael face to face, but apparently he is killed in his car and when Rafael arrives he is not there.\n\n=== Second stage: chapters 64-90===\nInvestigating, police and prosecutor Eduardo Germano (Guillermo Pfening) they discover a shirt with Alex's blood in Rafael's car and he is accused as the murderer. To help him, Fernando ([[Marco Antonio Caponi]]) his cousin hires a lawyer, Mariano S\u00e1nchez Ginastera ([[Juan Gil Navarro]]), who manages to release him from the case. He falls in love with Mercedes and tries to conquer her, but discovers that she was a scammer, through the information that Gasparini ([[Alejandro Fiore]]) gets him. Some time later, \u00c1lex's lifeless body appears, but the time he has been dead, according to the autopsy, does not coincide with the time he has been missing, since it appeared that he had died 48 hours ago and Alex had been missing for 2 months. Fernando begins to suspect and then, through Roque's ([[Chang Sung Kim]]) mouth he discovers that \u00c1lex's crime was just a planned staging by these last two, since \u00c1lex had many debts and threatened to kill him, so he simulates his own murder in order to escape to Greece and make Rafa look like the murderer . But only two months later \u00c1lex returned to [[Argentina]] to be close to Mercedes, but at that time he met Mariano and was later killed by the latter, which Roque would discover later and immediately alerted Fernando of this. Meanwhile, Fernando and Ivana (M\u00f3nica Anton\u00f3pulos), they decide to investigate Mariano. Ivana finds a photo of Mariano and \u00c1lex as partners in adolescence and that increases her suspicions that Mariano may have something to do with the death of \u00c1lex, so he decides to make the complaint, but the lawyer, after discovering that she has that photo in his possession, sends Gasparini to bring her by force to his house and takes her to a room with him. Mariano confesses that he murdered Alex and burns the photograph, fearing for his life, Ivana tries to escape, but is caught by Mariano and in the midst of a hard struggle he leaves her unconscious by hitting her head against the railing of the stairs, the takes to the ground floor and once there and in a desperate situation he murders her.\n\n=== Third stage: chapters 91-135 ===\nFernando is convinced that Mariano is responsible for the death of his girlfriend and begins to seek evidence that incriminate him with the former partner of \u00c1lex, Roque, and later also with the prosecutor Gerardo Rosales (Ariel Staltari). Soon Mariano begins to borrow from Gasparini for the information he provided and that is why he threatens to tell Fernando the truth of Ivana's death, he even quotes him, but when Fernando arrives at his house he finds him dead, now that Mariano killed him to prevent him from speaking. Everyone in the neighborhood has a bad feeling about Mariano, but Mercedes thinks otherwise, until, when she was alone in his house, she finds a shoe in a drawer and she thinks she saw it before. Mariano comes to suspect that Mercedes lost confidence in him and decides to commit suicide, but she stops him. Since then, Mercedes understands that everyone was right about Mariano. When she goes to Ivana's house, in her belongings, she finds the other shoe that was in Mariano's house and confirms her suspicions, he murdered Ivana. She apologizes to Fernando for not believing him and makes a pact with Rosales, if he help her catch Mariano, she will not assume the charges for the scams she made in the past. But this brings her a complication, since not being able to say anything to Rafael and her friends, everyone thinks that Mariano it more important than her own family, Rafael reaching the point of not letting her see her children. After Mercedes managed to get what she needed, Mariano discovers that it was she who stole that information and handed it to Rosales. Then he goes crazier than ever and forces Meredes to go home and tells her that he already knows what she did, then he drug her and then knocks her out. While they go to his house, Fernando tells Rafael the truth and when they arrive, Mariano threatens to kill Mercedes, in that he shoots Rafael, but Fernando gets in the middle to protect his cousin and receives the shot, but being on the ground manages to shoot Mariano twice, in the leg and chest respectively, and falls collapsed in the pool, later, both Fernando and Mariano are rushed to the hospital, Fernando enters a coma and Mariano kills a nurse and manages to circumvent the safety of the clinic and escape. Once released, he calls Mercedes threatening to kill her children and Rafael. On the other hand, Fernando, after having awakened from the coma is still hospitalized, and again Mariano mocks the security to enter the clinic, once in Fernando's room, Mariano drugs Silvina with chloroform to sleep her and then tries to kill Fernando by suffocating him with a pillow, but Reina gets in the middle and manages to save Fernando but is almost hanged by Mariano, at that moment Silvina reacts and starts screaming, Mariano manages to escape again and when the police arrive it's late. That same night, Rafael decides that it is best for him and his family to move to other home for security reasons. The next day Mercedes receives a call from Mariano, telling her that he has Rafael as a prisoner in an abandoned factory and that unless he wants to kill him she must go to that place alone, before leaving she puts up a knife and leaves to the place, Once there, she finds Rafael tied to a pole and all hurt, when she is going to untie him Mariano appears pointing her with a gun, he is sure that she is armed so he asks her to take off all the weapons she may have, a Once done, at the request of Mariano, she kneels, and manages to take the weapon away from him and this time it is Rafael who takes it, points it and threatens to kill him, this time in a distraction from Rafael, Mariano pounces on him trying to remove the weapon, but in the middle of the struggle he turns his back against an iron tube, it crosses his chest and ends his life.\n\n=== Fourth Stage: chapters 136-146 ===\nAfter Mariano's death, Mercede's family returns to peace, Paloma gives birth to her son Pedro while Mimi and Helen's brother have their big wedding. But later the peace of mind ends when the prosecutor appears again informing that there is no agreement with Mecha and this will have to go to prison for the scams he made in the past. Mercedes is a fugitive from justice and misses her family in her endless escape. Then, Fernando returns to his police position and is face to face with Mercedes about to arrest her but finally does not do it. Finally, Rafael launches a plan taking his family to a beach in [[Brazil]] to wait for Mercedes. A year later, Sonia lives in the neighborhood with Ram\u00f3n, Reina sells the Mayorga mansion and begins a tour in a mobile home with Roque. Meanwhile, Rafael has a restaurant in [[Brazil]] called Mecha and lives in [[Brazil]] with his children, son-in-law and grandson.

In the past her name was Lisa and she worked with \u00c1lex ([[Mike Amigorena]]), who recruited her for this type of tasks and became her first love, and with Ciro (Luis Ziembrowski) with whom he planned and financed the scams. A robbery failed and the group disbanded. Mercedes, with a changed identity, began a new life away from scams. She married Rafael ([[Diego Torres (singer)|Diego Torres]]) and they had 3 children, Paloma ([[Candela Vetrano]]), Teo (Rom\u00e1n Almaraz) and Juana, who know absolutely nothing about their past, while living a normal life. One morning that seemed to be like any other, they discover that a new family, the Mayorga, moves to the most luxurious and sought-after house in the neighborhood. Mercedes, seeing them, is shocked and discovers that the family man is neither more nor less than \u00c1lex, her former love and partner in the thefts whom she believed dead. Ciro leaves prison after 20 years, and begins serving house arrest. He seeks revenge from his former partners for the crime he blames for having been imprisoned from his residence. The return of \u00c1lex to the life of Mercedes aims to conquer it again and to achieve its purpose he is in charge of hiring a group of actors to pretend to be a normal family and thus, be able to be close to Mercedes without attracting attention. One morning, Rafael is summoned to the office of his boss, Alberto Mercado ([[Antonio Gasalla]]) and inform him that he is fired. When he leave the company, Rafael is in a car crash with Carolina ([[Marcela Kloosterboer]]) and she offers him help and a job in her father's company. Carolina suffers from a mental illness, so she begins to become obsessed with Rafael to the point of approaching his family. After some problems with Carolina, Rafael is sincere with his wife and tells her the whole truth, so she gets upset. But Rafael later becomes angry when Mercedes reveals that \u00c1lex was her partner. From then on, the rivalry between him and \u00c1lex Mayorga grows even more. At that time, Paloma had started a relationship with Alex's supposed son, Lucas ([[Gast\u00f3n Soffritti]]) and becomes pregnant with Lucas. That was undoubtedly the hardest blow for Rafael. \u00c1lex goes to a place to face Rafael face to face, but apparently he is killed in his car and when Rafael arrives he is not there.\n\n=== Second stage: chapters 64-90===\nInvestigating, police and prosecutor Eduardo Germano (Guillermo Pfening) they discover a shirt with Alex's blood in Rafael's car and he is accused as the murderer. To help him, Fernando ([[Marco Antonio Caponi]]) his cousin hires a lawyer, Mariano S\u00e1nchez Ginastera ([[Juan Gil Navarro]]), who manages to release him from the case. He falls in love with Mercedes and tries to conquer her, but discovers that she was a scammer, through the information that Gasparini ([[Alejandro Fiore]]) gets him. Some time later, \u00c1lex's lifeless body appears, but the time he has been dead, according to the autopsy, does not coincide with the time he has been missing, since it appeared that he had died 48 hours ago and Alex had been missing for 2 months. Fernando begins to suspect and then, through Roque's ([[Chang Sung Kim]]) mouth he discovers that \u00c1lex's crime was just a planned staging by these last two, since \u00c1lex had many debts and threatened to kill him, so he simulates his own murder in order to escape to Greece and make Rafa look like the murderer . But only two months later \u00c1lex returned to [[Argentina]] to be close to Mercedes, but at that time he met Mariano and was later killed by the latter, which Roque would discover later and immediately alerted Fernando of this. Meanwhile, Fernando and Ivana (M\u00f3nica Anton\u00f3pulos), they decide to investigate Mariano. Ivana finds a photo of Mariano and \u00c1lex as partners in adolescence and that increases her suspicions that Mariano may have something to do with the death of \u00c1lex, so he decides to make the complaint, but the lawyer, after discovering that she has that photo in his possession, sends Gasparini to bring her by force to his house and takes her to a room with him. Mariano confesses that he murdered Alex and burns the photograph, fearing for his life, Ivana tries to escape, but is caught by Mariano and in the midst of a hard struggle he leaves her unconscious by hitting her head against the railing of the stairs, the takes to the ground floor and once there and in a desperate situation he murders her.\n\n=== Third stage: chapters 91-135 ===\nFernando is convinced that Mariano is responsible for the death of his girlfriend and begins to seek evidence that incriminate him with the former partner of \u00c1lex, Roque, and later also with the prosecutor Gerardo Rosales (Ariel Staltari). Soon Mariano begins to borrow from Gasparini for the information he provided and that is why he threatens to tell Fernando the truth of Ivana's death, he even quotes him, but when Fernando arrives at his house he finds him dead, now that Mariano killed him to prevent him from speaking. Everyone in the neighborhood has a bad feeling about Mariano, but Mercedes thinks otherwise, until, when she was alone in his house, she finds a shoe in a drawer and she thinks she saw it before. Mariano comes to suspect that Mercedes lost confidence in him and decides to commit suicide, but she stops him. Since then, Mercedes understands that everyone was right about Mariano. When she goes to Ivana's house, in her belongings, she finds the other shoe that was in Mariano's house and confirms her suspicions, he murdered Ivana. She apologizes to Fernando for not believing him and makes a pact with Rosales, if he help her catch Mariano, she will not assume the charges for the scams she made in the past. But this brings her a complication, since not being able to say anything to Rafael and her friends, everyone thinks that Mariano it more important than her own family, Rafael reaching the point of not letting her see her children. After Mercedes managed to get what she needed, Mariano discovers that it was she who stole that information and handed it to Rosales. Then he goes crazier than ever and forces Meredes to go home and tells her that he already knows what she did, then he drug her and then knocks her out. While they go to his house, Fernando tells Rafael the truth and when they arrive, Mariano threatens to kill Mercedes, in that he shoots Rafael, but Fernando gets in the middle to protect his cousin and receives the shot, but being on the ground manages to shoot Mariano twice, in the leg and chest respectively, and falls collapsed in the pool, later, both Fernando and Mariano are rushed to the hospital, Fernando enters a coma and Mariano kills a nurse and manages to circumvent the safety of the clinic and escape. Once released, he calls Mercedes threatening to kill her children and Rafael. On the other hand, Fernando, after having awakened from the coma is still hospitalized, and again Mariano mocks the security to enter the clinic, once in Fernando's room, Mariano drugs Silvina with chloroform to sleep her and then tries to kill Fernando by suffocating him with a pillow, but Reina gets in the middle and manages to save Fernando but is almost hanged by Mariano, at that moment Silvina reacts and starts screaming, Mariano manages to escape again and when the police arrive it's late. That same night, Rafael decides that it is best for him and his family to move to other home for security reasons. The next day Meercedes receives a call from Mariano, telling her that he has Rafael as a prisoner in an abandoned factory and that unless he wants to kill him she must go to that place alone, before leaving she puts up a knife and leaves to the place, Once there, she finds Rafael tied to a pole and all hurt, when she is going to untie him Mariano appears pointing her with a gun, he is sure that she is armed so he asks her to take off all the weapons she may have, a Once done, at the request of Mariano, she kneels, and manages to take the weapon away from him and this time it is Rafael who takes it, points it and threatens to kill him, this time in a distraction from Rafael, Mariano pounces on him trying to remove the weapon, but in the middle of the struggle he turns his back against an iron tube, it crosses his chest and ends his life.\n\n=== Fourth Stage: chapters 136-146 ===\nAfter Mariano's death, Mercede's family returns to peace, Paloma gives birth to her son Pedro while Mimi and Helen's brother have their big wedding.
