The top four teams on the [[Standings|ladder]] at the conclusion of the [[Season (sports)#Regular season|regular season]] qualify for the [[Playoffs|finals series]]. In the first week of the finals series, the 1st ranked team hosts the 2nd ranked team in the major semi-final (with the winner of that match to qualify for the [[Grand Final]]) and the 3rd ranked team hosts the 4th ranked team in the minor semi-final (with the loser of that match eliminated). The loser of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the minor semi-final in the preliminary final. The winner of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the preliminary final in the Grand Final.\n\n===Rule changes===\nThe Super Netball commission announced changes to the league structure in February. Rolling [[Substitution (sport)|substitutions]] during play will be permitted, as well as during stoppages and intervals, with no limit to the number of substitutions that can be made, and multiple substitutions allowed to be made at any one time. The substitute must tag hands with the player leaving the court before entering the field of play. Extra time in the event of draws will be introduced, after six matches were tied throughout the [[2019 Suncorp Super Netball season|previous season]]. The match will enter one 5-minute period of extra time. If at the end of this period teams remain tied, the match will be declared a draw. If a team has a one-goal or greater advantage at the end of the period, they will be declared the winner. The bonus point system in place for the past two seasons will remain, though no bonus points will be awarded for goals scored in extra time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-rule-changes|title=Suncorp Super Netball Rule Changes|work=Super Netball|date=7 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/6619737/harten-backs-extra-time-in-super-netball/?cs=2512|title=Harten backs extra time in Super Netball|date=6 February 2020|work=Bendigo Advertiser}}</ref>\n\n==Player transfers==\nThe league unveiled the list of non-contracted athletes on 14 August 2019, two weeks before that season's finals series were scheduled to commence.<ref name=firstlist>{{cite web|url=https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-releases-list-uncontracted-players|work=Super Netball|date=14 August 2019|title=Suncorp Super Netball Releases List Of Uncontracted Players|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815081204/https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-releases-list-uncontracted-players|archivedate=15 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Teams had the exclusive right to re-sign any of their existing contracted players, their permanent/temporary replacement players or training partners, on single year or multi-year contracts for the 2020 and 2021 seasons.

The top four teams on the [[Standings|ladder]] at the conclusion of the [[Season (sports)#Regular season|regular season]] qualify for the [[Playoffs|finals series]]. In the first week of the finals series, the 1st ranked team hosts the 2nd ranked team in the major semi-final (with the winner of that match to qualify for the [[Grand Final]]) and the 3rd ranked team hosts the 4th ranked team in the minor semi-final (with the loser of that match eliminated). The loser of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the minor semi-final in the preliminary final. The winner of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the preliminary final in the Grand Final.\n\n===Rule changes===\nThe Super Netball commission announced changes to the league structure in February. Rolling [[Substitution (sport)|substitutions]] during play will be permitted, as well as during stoppages and intervals, with no limit to the number of substitutions that can be made, and multiple substitutions allowed to be made at any one time. The substitute must tag hands with the player leaving the court before entering the field of play. Extra time in the event of draws will be introduced, after six matches were tied throughout the [[2019 Suncorp Super Netball season|previous season]]. The match will enter one 5-minute period of extra time. If at the end of this period teams remain tied, the match will be declared a draw. If a team has a one-goal or greater advantage at the end of the period, they will be declared the winner. The bonus point system in place for the past two seasons will remain, though no bonus points will be awarded for goals scored in extra time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-rule-changes|title=Suncorp Super Netball Rule Changes|work=Super Netball|date=7 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/6619737/harten-backs-extra-time-in-super-netball/?cs=2512|title=Harten backs extra time in Super Netball|date=6 February 2020|work=Bendigo Advertiser}}</ref>\n\n==Player transfers==\nThe league unveiled the list of non-contracted athletes on 14 August 2019, two weeks before that season's finals series were scheduled to commence.<ref name=firstlist>{{cite web|url=https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-releases-list-uncontracted-players|work=Super Netball|date=14 August 2019|title=Suncorp Super Netball Releases List Of Uncontracted Players|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815081204/https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-releases-list-uncontracted-players|archivedate=15 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Teams had the exclusive right to re-sign any of their existing contracted players, their permanent/temporary replacement players or training partners, on single year or multi-year contracts for the 2020 and 2021 seasons.

In neither of the mentioned writings does Goldziher say anything amounting to what Mawdudi attributed to him in his above-cited claim. What Goldziher did write was the following:\n\n''\" In his writings he [i.e. Ibn Taymiyyah] is a zealous adversary of Greek philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity. By way of inciting the Muslims against them, he pointed to the Mongol invasion which had just swept over Syria, asserting that the visitation was in part due to the laxity of his co-religionists. He issued a fatwa demanding\nthat the Jewish synagogues in Cairo should be destroyed, and urging his people not to allow the chapels of other faiths to exist in their midst...\"''\n\n== Views ==\n=== God's Attributes ===\nIbn Taymiyyah said that God should be described as he has described himself in the Qur'an and the way Prophet Muhammad has described God in the Hadith.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":24\" /> He rejected; the [[Ta'tili]]'s who denied these attributes, those who compare God with the creation ([[Tashbih]]) and those who engage in [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric interpretations]] (ta'wil) of the Qur'an or use symbolic exegesis.<ref name=\":2\" /> Ibn Taymiyyah said that those attributes which we know about from the two above mentioned sources, should be ascribed to God.<ref name=\":2\" /> Anything regarding God's attributes which people have no knowledge of, should be approached in a manner, according to Ibn Taymiyyah, where the mystery of the unknown is left to God (called tafwid) and the Muslims submit themselves to the word of God and the Prophet (called taslim).<ref name=\":2\" /> Henri Laoust says that through this framework, this doctrine, \"provides authority for the widest possible scope in personal internationalization of religion.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1299, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote the book Al-Aqida al-hamawiyya al-kubra, which dealt with, among other topics, theology and creed.

The closing was in violation of a 600-year-old covenant with Christian ''[[dhimmi]]'' known as the [[Pact of Umar]].

He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, blindly giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset in light of the Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in [[Sharia|Islamic Law]]. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of ''[[Taqlid]]'' (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] who took their [[rabbi]]s and [[ecclesiastic]]s as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources.<ref name=\":17\" /> The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nIbn Taymiyyah believed that the best role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam ([[Salaf]]); which constitute Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]], referred to in Arabic as Sahaba (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the [[Tabi'un]] (second generation) which is then followed lastly by the next generation after the Tabi'un known as [[Tabi' al-Tabi'in|Tabi' Al-Tabi'in]] (third generation). Ibn Taymiyyah gave precedence to the ideas of the Sahaba and early generations, over the founders of the Islamic schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=\":2\" /> For Ibn Taymiyyah it was the Qur'an, the sayings and practices of Muhammad and the ideas of the early generations of Muslims that constituted the best understanding of Islam. Any deviation from their practice was viewed as bid'ah, or innovation, and to be forbidden.

On the contrary, he explicitly states: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars.

In neither of the mentioned writings does Goldziher say anything amounting to what Mawdudi attributed to him in his above-cited claim. What Goldziher did write was the following:\n\n''\" In his writings he [i.e. Ibn Taymiyyah] is a zealous adversary of Greek philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity. By way of inciting the Muslims against them, he pointed to the Mongol invasion which had just swept over Syria, asserting that the visitation was in part due to the laxity of his co-religionists. He issued a fatwa demanding\nthat the Jewish synagogues in Cairo should be destroyed, and urging his people not to allow the chapels of other faiths to exist in their midst...\"''\n\n== Views ==\n=== God's Attributes ===\nIbn Taymiyyah said that God should be described as he has described himself in the Qur'an and the way Prophet Muhammad has described God in the Hadith.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":24\" /> He rejected; the [[Ta'tili]]'s who denied these attributes, those who compare God with the creation ([[Tashbih]]) and those who engage in [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric interpretations]] (ta'wil) of the Qur'an or use symbolic exegesis.<ref name=\":2\" /> Ibn Taymiyyah said that those attributes which we know about from the two above mentioned sources, should be ascribed to God.<ref name=\":2\" /> Anything regarding God's attributes which people have no knowledge of, should be approached in a manner, according to Ibn Taymiyyah, where the mystery of the unknown is left to God (called tafwid) and the Muslims submit themselves to the word of God and the Prophet (called taslim).<ref name=\":2\" /> Henri Laoust says that through this framework, this doctrine, \"provides authority for the widest possible scope in personal internationalization of religion.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1299, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote the book Al-Aqida al-hamawiyya al-kubra, which dealt with, among other topics, theology and creed.

The closing was in violation of a 600-year-old covenant with Christian ''[[dhimmi]]'' known as the [[Pact of Umar]].

He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, blindly giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset in light of the Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in [[Sharia|Islamic Law]]. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of ''[[Taqlid]]'' (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] who took their [[rabbi]]s and [[ecclesiastic]]s as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources.<ref name=\":17\" /> The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nIbn Taymiyyah believed that the best role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam ([[Salaf]]); which constitute Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]], referred to in Arabic as Sahaba (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the [[Tabi'un]] (second generation) which is then followed lastly by the next generation after the Tabi'un known as [[Tabi' al-Tabi'in|Tabi' Al-Tabi'in]] (third generation). Ibn Taymiyyah gave precedence to the ideas of the Sahaba and early generations, over the founders of the Islamic schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=\":2\" /> For Ibn Taymiyyah it was the Qur'an, the sayings and practices of Muhammad and the ideas of the early generations of Muslims that constituted the best understanding of Islam. Any deviation from their practice was viewed as bid'ah, or innovation, and to be forbidden.

On the contrary, he explicitly states: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars.
