The [[US]] government, on the other hand, maintains that cannabis is dangerous enough to merit [[Schedule I controlled substance|Schedule I]] status. The dispute is based on differing views on both how the Act should be interpreted and what kinds of scientific evidence are most relevant to the rescheduling decision.\n\nThe Act provides a process for rescheduling controlled substances by petitioning the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. The first petition under this process was filed in 1972 to allow cannabis to be legally prescribed by physicians. The petition was ultimately denied after 22 years of court challenges, but a [[Dronabinol|synthetic pill form]] of cannabis's [[psychoactive]] ingredient, [[THC]], was rescheduled in 1986 to allow prescription under schedule II.<ref>{{cite book |title=DEA 51 FR 17476-78}}</ref> In 1999, it was again rescheduled to allow prescription under schedule III.\n\nA second petition, based on claims related to clinical studies, was denied in 2001. The most recent rescheduling petition filed by [[medical cannabis]] advocates was in 2002, but it was denied by the DEA in July 2011.

Under ''{{UnitedStatesCode|21|812}}'', drugs must meet three criteria in order to be placed in Schedule I:\n# The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.\n# The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\n# There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.\n\nIn 1970, Congress placed cannabis into Schedule I on the advice of [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Assistant Secretary of Health]] [[Roger O. Egeberg]]. His letter to [[Harley Orrin Staggers|Harley O. Staggers]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce|House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce]], indicates that the classification was intended to be provisional:\n\n<blockquote>\nDear Mr. Chairman: In a prior communication, comments requested by your committee on the scientific aspects of the drug classification scheme incorporated in H.R. 18583 were provided. This communication is concerned with the proposed classification of marijuana.\n</p>\nIt is presently classed in schedule I(C) along with its active constituents, the tetrahydrocannibinols and other [[psychoactive drug|psychotropic]] drugs.\n</p>\nSome question has been raised whether the use of the plant itself produces \"severe psychological or physical dependence\" as required by a schedule I or even schedule II criterion. Since there is still a considerable void in our knowledge of the plant and effects of the active drug contained in it, our recommendation is that marijuana be retained within schedule I at least until the completion of certain studies now underway to resolve the issue.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cannabinologist.org/Documents/Aggarwal-Macroed1.pdf | title=Cannabis: A Commonwealth Medicinal Plant, Long Suppressed, Now at Risk of Monopolization | work=Denver University Law Review | date=2010 | accessdate=13 December 2015 | author=Aggarwal, Sunil}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1972, the [[National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse]] released a report favoring decriminalization of cannabis.

Gettman believes that \"high potential for abuse\" means that a drug has a potential for abuse similar to that of [[heroin]] or [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"Getman-mmm\"/> Gettman argues further that since laboratory animals do not self-administer cannabis, and because cannabis' [[toxicity]] is virtually non-existent compared to that of heroin or cocaine, cannabis lacks the high abuse potential required for inclusion in Schedule I or II.{{Citation needed|reason=No where in the previous citation you use regarding Gettman does it talk about animals not self-administering marijuana.

This study provided conclusive evidence that medical marijuana provided a safer and alternative application to many current pharmaceutical products available for patients, especially those with cancer and HIV/AIDS.

Judicial deference to agency decisions is what has kept them in effect, despite the difference between these and the statutory criteria.  Cannabis is one of several plants with unproven abuse potential and toxicity that Congress placed in Schedule I. The DEA interprets the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to mean that if a drug with even a low potential for abuse \u2014 say, equivalent to a Schedule V drug \u2014 has no accepted medical use, then it must remain in Schedule I:<ref name=\"frwebgate\"/>\n\n<blockquote>When it comes to a drug that is currently listed in Schedule I, if it is undisputed that such drug has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and it is further undisputed that the drug has at least some potential for abuse sufficient to warrant control under the CSA, the drug must remain in schedule I. In such circumstances, placement of the drug in schedules II through V would conflict with the CSA since such drug would not meet the criterion of \"a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\" 21 USC 812(b).\n\nTherefore, even if one were to assume, theoretically, that your assertions about marijuana's potential for abuse were correct (i.e., that marijuana had some potential for abuse but less than the \"high potential for abuse\" commensurate with schedules I and II), marijuana would not meet the criteria for placement in schedules III through V since it has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States\u2014a determination that is reaffirmed by HHS in the attached medical and scientific evaluation.</blockquote>\n\nThis argument silently rejects the concept that if a drug does not meet the criteria for any schedule, it should not be in any schedule.\n\n[[Image:Mouse.jpeg|frame|right|The U.S. Government argues that human studies are more relevant than studies showing animals do not self-administer cannabis.]]\nThe [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] rejects the argument that laboratory animals' failure to self-administer cannabis is conclusive proof of its low potential for abuse:<ref name=\"frwebgate\"/>\n\n<blockquote>The Secretary disagrees with Mr. Gettman's assertion that \"[t]he accepted contemporary legal convention for evaluating the abuse potential of a drug or substance is the relative degree of self-administration the drug induces in animal subjects.\" As discussed above, self-administration tests that identify whether a substance is reinforcing in animals are but one component of the scientific assessment of the abuse potential of a substance. Positive indicators of human abuse liability for a particular substance, whether from laboratory studies or epidemiological data, are given greater weight than animal studies suggesting the same compound has no abuse potential.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] elaborates on this, arguing that the widespread use of cannabis, and the existence of some heavy users, is evidence of its \"high potential for abuse,\" despite the drug's lack of physiological addictiveness:<ref name=\"frwebgate\"/>\n\n<blockquote>[P]hysical dependence and toxicity are not the only factors to consider in determining a substance's abuse potential. The large number of individuals using marijuana on a regular basis and the vast amount of marijuana that is available for illicit use are indicative of widespread use. In addition, there is evidence that marijuana use can result in [[psychological dependence]] in a certain proportion of the population.</blockquote>\n\nThe Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse:<ref name=\"frwebgate\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Throughout his petition, Mr. Gettman argues that while many people \"use\" cannabis, few \"abuse\" it. He appears to equate abuse with the level of physical dependence and toxicity resulting from cannabis use. Thus, he appears to be arguing that a substance that causes only low levels of physical dependence and toxicity must be considered to have a low potential for abuse. The Secretary does not agree with this argument. Physical dependence and toxicity are not the only factors that are considered in determining a substance's abuse potential. The actual use and frequency of use of a substance, especially when that use may result in harmful consequences such as failure to fulfill major obligations at work or school, physical risk-taking, or even substance-related legal problems, are indicative of a substance's abuse potential.</blockquote>\n\n==Process==\nCannabis could be rescheduled either [[legislature|legislatively]], through Congress, or through the [[United States Federal Executive Departments|executive branch]]. Congress has so far rejected all bills to reschedule cannabis. However, it is not unheard of for Congress to intervene in the drug scheduling process; in February 2000, for instance, the 105th Congress, in its second official session, passed ''Public Law 106-172'', also known as the ''Hillory J.

The BNDD declined to initiate proceedings on the basis of their interpretation of U.S. treaty commitments.\n\nIn 1974, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] ruled against the government and ordered them to process the petition ([[Case citation|''NORML v.

In 1977, the Court issued a decision clarifying that the Controlled Substances Act requires a full scientific and medical evaluation and the fulfillment of the rescheduling process before treaty commitments can be evaluated (''NORML v. DEA 559 F.2d 735'').\n\nThe court also noted, \"At the hearing before ALJ Parker DEA's Chief Counsel, Donald Miller . . . acknowledged that marihuana could be rescheduled to Schedule II without a currently accepted medical use\" in accordance with precedent set by the placing of other substances, such as [[poppy straw]], in that schedule.

He declared that cannabis in its natural form is \"one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.

Lawn|John Lawn]] overruled Young's determination. Lawn said he decided against rescheduling cannabis based on testimony and comments from numerous medical doctors who had conducted detailed research and were widely considered experts in their respective fields. Later Administrators agreed. \"Those who insist that marijuana has medical uses would serve society better by promoting or sponsoring more legitimate research,\" former DEA Administrator [[Robert C.

They based their claims on studies of the brain's [[cannabinoid receptor]] system conducted by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) between 1988 and 1994.

Under ''{{UnitedStatesCode|21|812}}'', drugs must meet three criteria in order to be placed in Schedule I:\n# The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.\n# The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\n# There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.\n\nIn 1970, Congress placed cannabis into Schedule I on the advice of [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Assistant Secretary of Health]] [[Roger O. Egeberg]]. His letter to [[Harley Orrin Staggers|Harley O. Staggers]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce|House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce]], indicates that the classification was intended to be provisional:\n\n<blockquote>\nDear Mr. Chairman: In a prior communication, comments requested by your committee on the scientific aspects of the drug classification scheme incorporated in H.R. 18583 were provided. This communication is concerned with the proposed classification of marijuana.\n</p>\nIt is presently classed in schedule I(C) along with its active constituents, the tetrahydrocannibinols and other [[psychoactive drug|psychotropic]] drugs.\n</p>\nSome question has been raised whether the use of the plant itself produces \"severe psychological or physical dependence\" as required by a schedule I or even schedule II criterion. Since there is still a considerable void in our knowledge of the plant and effects of the active drug contained in it, our recommendation is that marijuana be retained within schedule I at least until the completion of certain studies now underway to resolve the issue.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cannabinologist.org/Documents/Aggarwal-Macroed1.pdf | title=Cannabis: A Commonwealth Medicinal Plant, Long Suppressed, Now at Risk of Monopolization | work=Denver University Law Review | date=2010 | accessdate=13 December 2015 | author=Aggarwal, Sunil}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1972, the [[National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse]] released a report favoring decriminalization of cannabis.

This study provided conclusive evidence that medical marijuana provided a safer and alternative application to many current pharmaceutical products available for patients, especially those with cancer and HIV/AIDS.

Judicial deference to agency decisions is what has kept them in effect, despite the difference between these and the statutory criteria.  Cannabis is one of several plants with unproven abuse potential and toxicity that Congress placed in Schedule I. The DEA interprets the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to mean that if a drug with even a low potential for abuse \u2014 say, equivalent to a Schedule V drug \u2014 has no accepted medical use, then it must remain in Schedule I:<ref name=\"frwebgate\"/>\n\n<blockquote>When it comes to a drug that is currently listed in Schedule I, if it is undisputed that such drug has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and it is further undisputed that the drug has at least some potential for abuse sufficient to warrant control under the CSA, the drug must remain in schedule I. In such circumstances, placement of the drug in schedules II through V would conflict with the CSA since such drug would not meet the criterion of \"a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\" 21 USC 812(b).\n\nTherefore, even if one were to assume, theoretically, that your assertions about marijuana's potential for abuse were correct (i.e., that marijuana had some potential for abuse but less than the \"high potential for abuse\" commensurate with schedules I and II), marijuana would not meet the criteria for placement in schedules III through V since it has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States\u2014a determination that is reaffirmed by HHS in the attached medical and scientific evaluation.</blockquote>\n\nThis argument silently rejects the concept that if a drug does not meet the criteria for any schedule, it should not be in any schedule.\n\n[[Image:Mouse.jpeg|frame|right|The U.S. Government argues that human studies are more relevant than studies showing animals do not self-administer cannabis.]]\nThe [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] rejects the argument that laboratory animals' failure to self-administer cannabis is conclusive proof of its low potential for abuse:<ref name=\"frwebgate\"/>\n\n<blockquote>The Secretary disagrees with Mr. Gettman's assertion that \"[t]he accepted contemporary legal convention for evaluating the abuse potential of a drug or substance is the relative degree of self-administration the drug induces in animal subjects.\" As discussed above, self-administration tests that identify whether a substance is reinforcing in animals are but one component of the scientific assessment of the abuse potential of a substance. Positive indicators of human abuse liability for a particular substance, whether from laboratory studies or epidemiological data, are given greater weight than animal studies suggesting the same compound has no abuse potential.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] elaborates on this, arguing that the widespread use of cannabis, and the existence of some heavy users, is evidence of its \"high potential for abuse,\" despite the drug's lack of physiological addictiveness:<ref name=\"frwebgate\"/>\n\n<blockquote>[P]hysical dependence and toxicity are not the only factors to consider in determining a substance's abuse potential. The large number of individuals using marijuana on a regular basis and the vast amount of marijuana that is available for illicit use are indicative of widespread use. In addition, there is evidence that marijuana use can result in [[psychological dependence]] in a certain proportion of the population.</blockquote>\n\nThe Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse:<ref name=\"frwebgate\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Throughout his petition, Mr. Gettman argues that while many people \"use\" cannabis, few \"abuse\" it. He appears to equate abuse with the level of physical dependence and toxicity resulting from cannabis use. Thus, he appears to be arguing that a substance that causes only low levels of physical dependence and toxicity must be considered to have a low potential for abuse. The Secretary does not agree with this argument. Physical dependence and toxicity are not the only factors that are considered in determining a substance's abuse potential. The actual use and frequency of use of a substance, especially when that use may result in harmful consequences such as failure to fulfill major obligations at work or school, physical risk-taking, or even substance-related legal problems, are indicative of a substance's abuse potential.</blockquote>\n\n==Process==\nCannabis could be rescheduled either [[legislature|legislatively]], through Congress, or through the [[United States Federal Executive Departments|executive branch]]. Congress has so far rejected all bills to reschedule cannabis. However, it is not unheard of for Congress to intervene in the drug scheduling process; in February 2000, for instance, the 105th Congress, in its second official session, passed ''Public Law 106-172'', also known as the ''Hillory J.

In 1977, the Court issued a decision clarifying that the Controlled Substances Act requires a full scientific and medical evaluation and the fulfillment of the rescheduling process before treaty commitments can be evaluated (''NORML v. DEA 559 F.2d 735''). On October 16, 1980, the Court ordered the government to start the scientific and medical evaluations required by the NORML petition (''NORML v.

The DEA publication ''Exposing the Myth of Smoked Medical Marijuana'' interpreted the IOM's statement, \"While we see a future in the development of chemically defined cannabinoid drugs, we see little future in smoked marijuana as a medicine,\" as meaning that smoking cannabis is not recommended for the treatment of any disease condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/ongoing/marijuana.html |title=Exposing the Myth of Smoked Medical Marijuana |author=U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration |accessdate=2007-04-28 |publisher=United States Department of Justice |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417155648/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/ongoing/marijuana.html |archivedate=April 17, 2007 }}</ref> Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizers]], devices which, by heating cannabis to 185&nbsp;\u00b0C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various [[carcinogen]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v06n3/06359mj1.html | title = Marijuana Water Pipe and Vaporizer Study | last = Gieringer | first = Dale | journal = Newsletter of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | year = 1996 | accessdate = 2007-04-28}}</ref>\n\nOn July 2, 1999, Marinol was again rescheduled, this time from Schedule II to the even less-restrictive Schedule III, while cannabis remained in Schedule I (''64 FR 35928'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marijuananews.com/marijuananews/cowan/jon_gettman_comments_on_the_resc.htm |title=Jon Gettman Comments On The Rescheduling of Marinol |author=Jon Gettman |date=July 27, 1999 |accessdate=2007-04-28 |publisher=MarijuanaNews.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608190509/http://marijuananews.com/marijuananews/cowan/jon_gettman_comments_on_the_resc.htm |archivedate=June 8, 2007 }}</ref> The petitioners argued that the distinction between the two drugs was arbitrary, and that cannabis should be rescheduled as well.

For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise) and that [[Socrates]] is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal. Syllogistic arguments are usually represented in a three-line form:\n\t\n<blockquote><poem>All men are mortal.\nSocrates is a man.\nTherefore, Socrates is mortal.</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Early history==\n\n{{Main|History of logic}}\nIn antiquity, two rival theories of the syllogism existed: Aristotelian syllogistic and Stoic syllogistic.<ref>Michael Fredy, \"Stoic vs. Peripatetic Syllogistic\", Archive for the History of Philosophy 56, 1975, 99-124.</ref> [[Aristotle]] defines the syllogism as \"a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so\".<ref>[[Aristotle]], \"Prior Analytics\", 24b18\u201320</ref> Despite this very general definition, in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms that consist of three [[categorical proposition]]s.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#SynSemSen Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Ancient Logic'': Aristotle: Non-Modal Syllogistic]</ref> These include categorical [[modal logic|modal]] syllogisms.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#ModLog Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Ancient Logic'': Aristotle: Modal Logic]</ref>\n\nFrom the Middle Ages onwards, ''categorical syllogism'' and ''syllogism'' were usually used interchangeably. This article is concerned only with this traditional use. The syllogism was at the core of traditional [[deductive reasoning]], where facts are determined by combining existing statements, in contrast to [[inductive reasoning]] where facts are determined by repeated observations.\n\nWithin academic contexts, the syllogism was superseded by [[First-order logic|first-order predicate logic]] following the work of [[Gottlob Frege]], in particular his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (''Concept Script'') (1879), but syllogisms remain useful in some circumstances, and for general-audience introductions to logic.<ref>Hurley, Patrick J (2011). ''A Concise Introduction to Logic'', Cengage Learning, {{ISBN|9780840034175}}</ref><ref>Zegarelli, Mark (2010). ''Logic for Dummies'', John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|9781118053072}}</ref>\n\n===Aristotle===\n{{main|Term logic}}\nThe use of syllogisms as a tool for understanding can be dated back to the logical reasoning discussions of [[Aristotle]].  Prior to the mid-twelfth century, medieval logicians were only familiar with a portion of Aristotle's works, including titles such as ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' and ''[[On Interpretation]]'', works that contributed heavily to the prevailing Old Logic, or \"[[logica vetus]]\".  The onset of a New Logic, or \"[[logica nova]]\", arose alongside the reappearance of ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', the work in which Aristotle develops his theory of the syllogism.\n\n''Prior Analytics'', upon re-discovery, was instantly regarded by logicians as \"a closed and complete body of doctrine\", leaving very little for thinkers of the day to debate and re-organize.  Aristotle's theory on the syllogism for ''[[assertoric]]'' sentences was considered especially remarkable, with only small systematic changes occurring to the concept over time.  This theory of the syllogism would not enter the context of the more comprehensive logic of consequence until logic began to be reworked in general in the mid-fourteenth century by the likes of [[John Buridan]].\n\nAristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' did not, however, incorporate such a comprehensive theory on the \"modal syllogism\"\u2014a syllogism that has at least one modalized premise (that is, a premise containing the modal words 'necessarily', 'possibly', or 'contingently').  Aristotle's terminology in this aspect of his theory was deemed vague and in many cases unclear, even contradicting some of his statements from ''[[On Interpretation]]''.  His original assertions on this specific component of the theory were left up to a considerable amount of conversation, resulting in a wide array of solutions put forth by commentators of the day.  The system for modal syllogisms laid forth by Aristotle would ultimately be deemed unfit for practical use, and would be replaced by new distinctions and new theories altogether.\n\n===Medieval===\n\n====Boethius====\n\n[[Boethius]] (c. 475&nbsp;\u2013 526) contributed an effort to make the ancient Aristotelian logic more accessible.  While his Latin translation of ''Prior Analytics'' went primarily unused before the twelfth century, his textbooks on the categorical syllogism were central to expanding the syllogistic discussion.  Boethius' logical legacy lay not in any addition he personally made to the field, but  in his effective transmission of prior theories to later logicians, as well as his clear and primarily accurate presentations of Aristotle's contributions.\n\n====Peter Abelard====\n\nAnother of medieval logic's first contributors from the Latin West, [[Peter Abelard]] (1079\u20131142), gave his own thorough evaluation of the syllogism concept and accompanying theory in the ''Dialectica'' - a discussion of logic based on Boethius' commentaries and monographs.  His perspective on syllogisms can be found in other works as well, such as ''Logica Ingredientibus''.  With the help of Abelard's distinction between ''[[de dicto]]'' modal sentences and ''[[de re]]'' modal sentences, medieval logicians began to shape a more coherent concept of Aristotle's modal syllogism model.\n\n====John Buridan====\n\n[[John Buridan]] (c. 1300&nbsp;\u2013 1361), whom some consider the foremost logician of the later Middle Ages, contributed two significant works: ''Treatise on Consequence'' and ''Summulae de Dialectica'', in which he discussed the concept of the syllogism, its components and distinctions, and ways to use the tool to expand its logical capability. For two hundred years after Buridan's discussions, little was said about syllogistic logic. Historians of logic have assessed that the primary changes in the post-Middle Age era were changes in respect to the public's awareness of original sources, a lessening of appreciation for the logic's sophistication and complexity, and an increase in logical ignorance\u2014so that logicians of the early twentieth century came to view the whole system as ridiculous.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lagerlund|first=Henrik|title=Medieval Theories of the Syllogism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/medieval-syllogism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Edward N. Zalta|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Modern history==\n\nThe Aristotelian syllogism dominated Western philosophical thought for many centuries. Syllogism itself is about how to get valid conclusion from assumptions (axioms) and not about verifying the assumptions.  However, people over time focused on the logic part and forgot the importance of verifying the assumptions.  In the 17th century, [[Francis Bacon]] emphasized that experimental verification of the assumptions must be carried out rigorously and cannot take syllogism itself as the best way to draw conclusions in nature.<ref name=instauration>See Francis Bacon, ''The Great Instauration,'' 1620. This text can be found (as of the access date of 11/12/13) at the ''Constitution Society'' website at the following URL: http://www.constitution.org/bacon/instauration.htm.</ref> Bacon proposed a more inductive approach to the observation of nature, which involves experimentation and leads to discovering and building on axioms to create a more general conclusion.<ref name=instauration />  Yet, a full method to come to conclusions in nature is not the scope of logic or syllogism.\n\nIn the 19th century, modifications to syllogism were incorporated to deal with disjunctive (\"A or B\") and conditional (\"if A then B\") statements.  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] famously claimed, in ''Logic'' (1800), that logic was the one completed science, and that Aristotelian logic more or less included everything about logic there was to know. (This work is not necessarily representative of Kant's mature philosophy, which is often regarded as an innovation to logic itself.) Though there were alternative systems of logic, such as [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Avicennian logic]] or [[Indian logic]] elsewhere, Kant's opinion stood unchallenged in the West until 1879 when [[Frege]] published his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (''Concept Script'').  This introduced a calculus, a method of representing categorical statements (and statements that are not provided for in syllogism as well) by the use of quantifiers and variables.\n\nA noteworthy exception is the logic developed in [[Bernard Bolzano]]'s work ''[[Bernard Bolzano#Wissenschaftslehre (Theory of Science)|Wissenschaftslehre]]'' (''Theory of Science'', 1837), the principles of which were applied as a direct critique of Kant, in the posthumously published work ''New Anti-Kant'' (1850). The work of Bolzano had been largely overlooked until the late 20th century, among other reasons, due to the intellectual environment at the time in [[Bohemia]], which was then part of the Austrian empire. In the last 20 years, Bolzano's work has resurfaced and become subject of both translation and contemporary study.\n\nThis led to the rapid development of [[sentential logic]] and first-order [[predicate logic]], subsuming syllogistic reasoning, which was, therefore, after 2000 years, suddenly considered obsolete by many.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}} The Aristotelian system is explicated in modern fora of academia primarily in introductory material and historical study.\n\nOne notable exception, to this modern relegation, is the continued application of Aristotelian logic  by officials of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], and the Apostolic Tribunal of the [[Roman Rota]], which still requires that any arguments crafted by Advocates be presented in syllogistic format.\n\n[[Judiciary of France|French courts]], both judicial and administrative, traditionally issue their decisions as one-sentence syllogisms consisting of one or several [[main clause]]s and various [[subordinate clause]]s, with each premise being prefaced by \"''[[Judgment_(French_law)#Motifs|attendu que]]''\" (whereas). The judgment moves logically from the applicable statutory provisions (the major premise), followed by an outline of the relevant facts (the minor premise), to a final part that constitutes an inescapable conclusion. For example, the ruling in ''Goutaillier v Epoux Jacob'' (1974), Bull. civ. III, no. 330, in which the plaintiffs sought a refund of the money they had paid for a house after they found out the seller had purposefully not revealed to them the existence of a plan to set up a pig farm nearby, reads as follows:\n{{quotation|Whereas, intentional failure to disclose a fact which, if known by the other party, would have dissuaded the latter from entering into a contract, amounts to dishonest dealing; and\n\nWhereas, the seller of a house has intentionally failed to disclose to the purchasers a plan to set up a pig farm nearby which if known to them, would have resulted in their being unwilling to enter into a contract;\n\nTherefore, the seller's failure to disclose this fact was dishonest dealing (and the sum paid on account by the purchasers must be reimbursed by the seller).}}\n{{ill|French avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|fr|Avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (France)}} [[Raymond Lindon]] praised this mandatory framework:<ref>{{cite book|title=French Law: A Comparative Approach|author=Eva Steiner|chapter=The Judicial Syllogism|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2018}}</ref>\n{{quotation|The phrase ''attendu que'' does not, in fact, constitute a rigid vice, but on the contrary a flexible corset whose strictures are actually its main virtue. With respect to the judicial prose writer, it plays a similar [[French alexandrine|Alexandrine]] role (of rhyming [[Metre_(poetry)#French|meter]]) as in poetry. Just as the greatest poets who, under the constraint of writing within a framework of twelve-foot rhyming verses, have managed to achieve perfection in the expression of their thoughts and in the elegance of their forms, so with judges, who must give reasons for their decisions in the form of ''attendus'', thereby succeeding in incorporating logic and order into the presentation of their ideas.}}\nThe idea that, in order to promote objectivity and certainty in the law, judgments should be made by a process of deduction, is known as [[legal formalism]]. [[Cesare Beccaria]], an advocate of formalism, writes, \"In every criminal case, a judge should come to a perfect syllogism: the major premise should be the general law; the minor premise, the act which does or does not conform to the law; and the conclusion, acquittal or condemnation.\"\n\nFormalism does not provide a basis for resolving \"hard cases\" in which, because the law contains vague concepts such as \"reasonableness\" or conflicting principles from which arise different legal arguments yielding different answers as to what the law is, the proper interpretation of the law cannot be deduced. Thus, other methods, such as the use of analogy to other cases (inference), or the balancing of policy goals ([[legal realism]]), may be used.\n <!--\nWhat follows is at best *very* obscure and desultory.

''The Laws of Thought'', facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in ''Philosophy in Review'' '''24''' (2004). pp. 167\u2013169.</ref> Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of ''Prior Analytics'' and ''Laws of Thought''.<ref>John Corcoran. \"Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' and Boole's ''Laws of Thought''. ''History and Philosophy of Logic''. vol. 24 (2003), pp. 261\u2013288.</ref> According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole's goals were \"to go under, over, and beyond\" Aristotle's logic by: (1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations, (2) extending the class of problems it could treat, as solving equations was added to assessing [[Validity (logic)|validity]], and (3) expanding the range of applications it could handle, such as expanding propositions of only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.\n\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole's 'disagreements', if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say.\nFirst, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle's four propositional forms to one form, the form of equations, which by itself was a revolutionary idea.\nSecond, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic\u2014another revolutionary idea\u2014involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the \"perfect syllogisms\") must be supplemented by rules for equation solving.\nThird, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments, whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce: \"No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus\" from \"No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle\" or from \"No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle\".\n\n==Basic structure==\nA categorical syllogism consists of three parts:\n* Major premise\n* Minor premise\n* Conclusion\n\nEach part is a [[categorical proposition]], and each categorical proposition  contains two categorical terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/c.htm#capro |title=Philosophical Dictionary: Caird-Catharsis |publisher=Philosophypages.com |date=2002-08-08 |accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> In Aristotle, each of the premises is in the form \"All A are B,\" \"Some A are B\", \"No A are B\" or \"Some A are not B\", where \"A\" is one term and \"B\" is another. \"All A are B,\" and \"No A are B\" are termed ''universal'' propositions; \"Some A are B\" and \"Some A are not B\" are termed ''particular'' propositions.  More modern logicians allow some variation. Each of the premises has one term in common with the conclusion: in a major premise, this is the ''major term'' (''i.e.,'' the predicate of the conclusion); in a minor premise, this is the ''minor term'' (''i.e.,'' the subject of the conclusion). For example:\n\n:Major premise: All humans are mortal.\n:Minor premise: All Greeks are humans.\n:Conclusion: All Greeks are mortal.\n\nEach of the three distinct terms represents a category. In the above example, ''humans'', ''mortal'', and ''Greeks''.  ''Mortal'' is the major term, ''Greeks'' the minor term. The premises also have one term in common with each other, which is known as the ''middle term''; in this example, ''humans''. Both of the premises are universal, as is the conclusion.\n\n:Major premise: All mortals die.\n:Minor premise: All men are mortals.\n:Conclusion: All men die.\n\nHere, the major term is ''die'', the minor term is ''men'', and the middle term is ''mortals''. Again, both premises are universal, hence so is the conclusion.\n\nA [[Polysyllogism|sorites]] is a form of argument in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. For example, one might argue that all lions are big cats, all big cats are predators, and all predators are carnivores. To conclude that therefore all lions are carnivores is to construct a sorites argument.\n\n==Types<!--linked from 'Term logic'-->==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Square of opposition, set diagrams.svg|thumb|Relationships between the four types of propositions in the [[square of opposition]]<br /><br />(Black areas are empty,<br />red areas are nonempty.)]]\n{{further|List of valid argument forms}}\n\nThere are infinitely many possible syllogisms, but only 256 logically distinct types and only 24 valid types (enumerated below). A syllogism takes the form:\n\n:Major premise: All M are P.\n:Minor premise: All S are M.\n:Conclusion: All S are P.\n\n(Note: M&nbsp;\u2013 Middle, S&nbsp;\u2013 subject, P&nbsp;\u2013 predicate. See below for more detailed explanation.)\n\nThe premises and conclusion of a syllogism can be any of four types, which are labeled by letters<ref>According to [[Copi]], p. 127: 'The letter names are presumed to come from the Latin words \"'''''A'''''ff'''''I'''''rmo\" and \"n'''''E'''''g'''''O''''',\" which mean \"I affirm\" and \"I deny,\" respectively; the first capitalized letter of each word is for universal, the second for particular'</ref> as follows. The meaning of the letters is given by the table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''code''\n! ''quantifier''\n! ''subject''\n! ''copula''\n! ''predicate''\n! ''type''\n! ''example''\n|-\n| A\n| All\n| S\n| are\n| P\n| universal affirmative\n| All humans are mortal.\n|-\n| E\n| No\n| S\n| are\n| P\n| universal negative\n| No humans are perfect.\n|-\n| I\n| Some\n| S\n| are\n| P\n| particular affirmative\n| Some humans are healthy.\n|-\n| O\n| Some\n| S\n| are not\n| P\n| particular negative\n| Some humans are not clever.\n|}\n\nIn ''Analytics'', Aristotle mostly uses the letters A, B, and C (the Greek letters [[alpha]], [[beta]], and [[gamma]] in the original) as term place holders, rather than  giving concrete examples. It is traditional to use ''is'' rather than ''are'' as the copula, hence ''All A is B'' rather than ''All As are Bs''. It is traditional and convenient practice to use  a, e, i, o as [[Infix notation|infix operators]] so the categorical statements can be written succinctly.  The following table shows the longer form, the succinct shorthand, and equivalent expressions in predicate logic:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Form\n! Shorthand\n! Predicate logic\n|-\n| All A is B\n| AaB\n| <math>\\forall x (A(x) \\rightarrow B(x))</math>&nbsp; ''or'' &nbsp;<math>\\neg \\exist x (A(x) \\land \\neg B(x))</math>\n|-\n|No A is B\n|AeB\n| <math>\\neg \\exist x (A(x) \\land B(x))</math>&nbsp; ''or'' &nbsp;<math>\\forall x (A(x) \\rightarrow \\neg B(x))</math>\n|-\n|Some A is B\n|AiB\n| <math>\\exist x (A(x) \\land B(x))</math>\n|-\n|Some A is not B\n|AoB\n| <math>\\exist x (A(x) \\land \\neg B(x))</math>\n|}\n\nThe convention here is that the letter S is the subject of the conclusion, P is the predicate of the conclusion, and M is the middle term.  The major premise links M with P and the minor premise links M with S.  However, the middle term can be either the subject or the predicate of each premise where it appears.  The differing positions of the major, minor, and middle terms gives rise to another classification of syllogisms known as the ''figure''.  Given that in each case the conclusion is S-P, the four figures are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n! ''Figure 1''\n! ''Figure 2''\n! ''Figure 3''\n! ''Figure 4''\n|-\n! Major premise\n| M\u2013P\n| P\u2013M\n| M\u2013P\n| P\u2013M\n|-\n! Minor premise\n| S\u2013M\n| S\u2013M\n| M\u2013S\n| M\u2013S\n|}\n\n(Note, however, that, following Aristotle's treatment of the figures, some logicians\u2014e.g., [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]\u2014reject the fourth figure as a figure distinct from the first. See entry on the [[Prior Analytics]].)\n\nPutting it all together, there are 256 possible types of syllogisms (or 512 if the order of the major and minor premises is changed, though this makes no difference logically).  Each premise and the conclusion can be of type A, E, I or O, and the syllogism can be any of the four figures.  A syllogism can be described briefly by giving the letters for the premises and conclusion followed by the number for the figure.  For example, the syllogism BARBARA below is AAA-1, or \"A-A-A in the first figure\".\n\nThe vast majority of the 256 possible forms of syllogism are invalid (the conclusion does not [[logical consequence|follow logically]] from the premises).  The table below shows the valid forms. Even some of these are sometimes considered to commit the [[existential fallacy]], meaning they are invalid if they mention an empty category. These controversial patterns are marked in ''italics''. All but four of the patterns in italics (felapton, darapti, fesapo and bamalip) are weakened moods, i.e. it is possible to draw a stronger conclusion from the premises.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So in AAI-3, the premise \"All squares are rectangles\" becomes \"MaP\"; the symbols mean that the first term (\"square\") is the middle term, the second term (\"rectangle\") is the predicate of the conclusion, and the relationship between the two terms is labeled \"a\" (All M are P).\n\nThe following table shows all syllogisms that are essentially different. The similar syllogisms share the same premises, just written in a different way. For example \"Some pets are kittens\" (SiM in [[Syllogism#Darii (AII-1)|Darii]]) could also be written as \"Some kittens are pets\" (MiS in Datisi).\n\nIn the Venn diagrams, the black areas indicate no elements, and the red areas indicate at least one element.  In the predicate logic expressions, a horizontal bar over an expression means to negate (\"logical not\") the result of that expression.\n\nIt is also possible to use [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] (consisting of vertices and edges) to evaluate syllogisms.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXRwmOpgqLw</ref>\n\n===Examples===\n\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Modus_Barbara.svg|thumb|right|150px|\n{| style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n| M:Men<br />S:Greeks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P:mortal\n|}\n]]\n\n====Barbara (AAA-1){{anchor|Modus Barbara}}====\n\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All men are mortal.

Aristotle further distinguished (a) terms that could be the subject of predication, and (b) terms that could be predicated of others by the use of the copula (\"is a\").  (Such a predication is known as a distributive as opposed to non-distributive as in ''Greeks are numerous''. It is clear that Aristotle's syllogism works only for distributive predication for we cannot reason ''All Greeks are animals, animals are numerous, therefore All Greeks are numerous''.) In Aristotle's view singular terms were of type (a) and general terms of type (b).  Thus ''Men'' can be predicated of ''Socrates'' but ''Socrates'' cannot be predicated of anything.  Therefore, for a term to be interchangeable\u2014to be either in the subject or predicate position of a proposition in a syllogism\u2014the terms must be general terms, or ''categorical terms'' as they came to be called.  Consequently, the propositions of a syllogism should be categorical propositions (both terms general) and syllogisms that employ only categorical terms came to be called ''categorical syllogisms''.\n\nIt is clear that nothing would prevent a singular term occurring in a syllogism\u2014so long as it was always in the subject position\u2014however, such a syllogism, even if valid, is not a categorical syllogism. An example is ''Socrates is a man, all men are mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal.'' Intuitively this is as valid as ''All Greeks are men, all men are mortal therefore all Greeks are mortals''. To argue that its validity can be explained by the theory of syllogism would require that we show that ''Socrates is a man'' is the equivalent of a categorical proposition.  It can be argued ''Socrates is a man'' is equivalent to ''All that are identical to Socrates are men'', so our non-categorical syllogism can be justified by use of the equivalence above and then citing BARBARA.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Existential import==\nIf a statement includes a term such that the statement is false if the term has no instances, then the statement is said to have existential import with respect to that term. It is ambiguous whether or not a universal statement of the form ''All A is B'' is to be considered as true, false, or even meaningless if there are no As. If it is considered as false in such cases, then the statement ''All A is B'' has existential import with respect to A.\n\nIt is claimed Aristotle's logic system does not cover cases where there are no instances.\nAristotle's goal was to develop \"a companion-logic for science.\nHe relegates fictions, such as mermaids and unicorns, to\nthe realms of poetry and literature. In his mind, they exist outside the\nambit of science. This is why he leaves no room for such non-existent\nentities in his logic.  This is a thoughtful choice, not an inadvertent\nomission. Technically, Aristotelian science is a search for definitions,\nwhere a definition is 'a phrase signifying a thing's essence.'...\nBecause non-existent entities cannot be anything, they do not, in\nAristotle's mind, possess an essence...  This is why he leaves\nno place for fictional entities like goat-stags (or unicorns).\"\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/ |title=Groarke, Louis F., \"Aristotle: Logic\", section 7.

Further, if it is accepted that AiB entails BiA, then AiB and AaB have existential import with respect to B as well. Similarly, if AoB is false if there are no As, and AeB entails AoB, and AeB entails BeA (which in turn entails BoA) then both AeB and AoB have existential import with respect to both A and B.  It follows immediately that all universal categorical statements have existential import with respect to both terms.  If AaB and AeB is a fair representation of the use of statements in normal natural language of  All A is B and No A is B respectively, then the following example consequences arise:\n\n:\"All flying horses are mythological\" is false if there are no flying horses.\n\n:If \"No men are fire-eating rabbits\" is true, then \"There are fire-eating rabbits\" is true.\n\nand so on.\n\nIf it is ruled that no universal statement has existential import then the square of opposition fails in several respects (e.g. AaB does not entail AiB) and a number of syllogisms are no longer valid (e.g. BaC,AaB->AiC).\n\nThese problems and paradoxes arise in both natural language statements and statements in syllogism form because of ambiguity, in particular ambiguity with respect to All.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} If \"Fred claims all his books were Pulitzer Prize winners\", is Fred claiming that he wrote any books? If not, then is what he claims true? Suppose Jane says none of her friends are poor; is that true if she has no friends?\n\nThe first-order predicate calculus avoids such ambiguity by using formulae that carry no existential import with respect to universal statements. Existential claims must be explicitly stated. Thus, natural language statements\u2014of the forms ''All A is B, No A is B'', ''Some A is B'', and ''Some A is not B''\u2014can be represented in first order predicate calculus in which any existential import with respect to terms A and/or B is either explicit or not made at all. Consequently, the four forms ''AaB, AeB, AiB'', and ''AoB'' can be represented in first order predicate in every combination of existential import\u2014so it can establish which construal, if any, preserves the square of opposition and the validity of the traditionally valid syllogism.  Strawson claims such a construal is possible, but the results are such that, in his view, the answer to question (e) above is ''no''.\n\nOn the other hand, in modern [[mathematical logic]], however, statements containing words \"all\", \"some\" and \"no\", can be stated in terms of [[set theory]]. If the set of all A's is labeled as s(A) and the set of all B's as s(B), then:\n* \"All A is B\" (AaB) is equivalent to \"s(A) is a [[subset]] of s(B)\", or s(A) \u2286 s(B)\n* \"No A is B\" (AeB) is equivalent to \"The [[intersection]] of s(A) and s(B) is [[empty set|empty]]\", or <math>s(A) \\cap s(B) = \\empty</math>\n* \"Some A is B\" (AiB) is equivalent to \"the intersection of s(A) and s(B) is not empty\", or <math>s(A) \\cap s(B) \\neq \\empty</math>\n* \"Some A is not B\" (AoB) is equivalent to \"s(A) is not a subset of s(B)\" <!--, or <math>s(A) \\nonsubset s(B)</math>-->\n\nBy definition, the [[empty set]] is a subset of all sets. From this it follows that, according to this mathematical convention, if there are no A's, then the statements \"All A is B\" and \"No A is B\" are always true whereas the statements \"Some A is B\" and \"Some A is not B\" are always false.  This, however, implies that AaB does not entail AiB, and some of the syllogisms mentioned above are not valid when there are no A's.\n\n==Syllogistic fallacies==\n{{See also|Syllogistic fallacy}}\nPeople often make mistakes when reasoning syllogistically.<ref>See, e.g., Evans, J. St. B. T (1989).  ''Bias in human reasoning''. London: LEA.</ref>\n\nFor instance, from the premises some A are B, some B are C, people tend to come to a definitive conclusion that therefore some A are C.<ref>See the meta-analysis by Khemlani, S. & Johnson-Laird, P.N.

For instance, while some cats (A) are black things (B), and some black things (B) are televisions (C), it does not follow from the parameters that some cats (A) are televisions (C). This is because in the structure of the syllogism invoked (i.e. III-1) the middle term is not distributed in either the major premise or in the minor premise, a pattern called the \"fallacy of the undistributed middle\".\n\nDetermining the validity of a syllogism involves determining the [[distribution of terms|distribution]] of each term in each statement, meaning whether all members of that term are accounted for.\n\nIn simple syllogistic patterns, the fallacies of invalid patterns are:\n\n*[[Fallacy of the undistributed middle|Undistributed middle]]: Neither of the premises accounts for all members of the middle term, which consequently fails to link the major and minor term.\n*[[Illicit major|Illicit treatment of the major term]]: The conclusion implicates all members of the major term (P&nbsp;\u2013 meaning the proposition is negative); however, the major premise does not account for them all (i.e., P is either an affirmative predicate or a particular subject there).\n*[[Illicit minor|Illicit treatment of the minor term]]: Same as above, but for the minor term (S&nbsp;\u2013 meaning the proposition is universal) and minor premise (where S is either a particular subject or an affirmative predicate).\n*[[Fallacy of exclusive premises|Exclusive premises]]: Both premises are negative, meaning no link is established between the major and minor terms.\n*[[Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise]]: If either premise is negative, the conclusion must also be.\n*[[Negative conclusion from affirmative premises]]: If both premises are affirmative, the conclusion must also be.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n* [[Argumentation theory#Psychological aspects|Argumentation theory]]\n* [[Legal syllogism]]\n* [[Buddhist logic]]\n* [[Enthymeme]]\n* Other types of syllogism:\n** [[Disjunctive syllogism]]\n** [[Hypothetical syllogism]]\n** [[Legal syllogism]]\n** [[Polysyllogism]]\n** [[Prosleptic syllogism]]\n** [[Quasi-syllogism]]\n** [[Statistical syllogism]]\n* [[Formal fallacy]]\n* [[Logical fallacy]]\n* [[Syllogistic fallacy]]\n* [[The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures]]\n* [[Tautology (logic)]]\n* [[Venn diagram]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Aristotle]], ''[[Prior Analytics]]''. transl.

For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise) and that [[Socrates]] is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal.

This article is concerned only with this traditional use. The syllogism was at the core of traditional [[deductive reasoning]], where facts are determined by combining existing statements, in contrast to [[inductive reasoning]] where facts are determined by repeated observations.\n\nWithin academic contexts, the syllogism was superseded by [[First-order logic|first-order predicate logic]] following the work of [[Gottlob Frege]], in particular his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (''Concept Script'') (1879), but syllogisms remain useful in some circumstances, and for general-audience introductions to logic.<ref>Hurley, Patrick J (2011).

''Logic for Dummies'', John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|9781118053072}}</ref>\n\n===Aristotle===\n{{main|Term logic}}\nThe use of syllogisms as a tool for understanding can be dated back to the logical reasoning discussions of [[Aristotle]].  Prior to the mid-twelfth century, medieval logicians were only familiar with a portion of Aristotle's works, including titles such as ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' and ''[[On Interpretation]]'', works that contributed heavily to the prevailing Old Logic, or \"[[logica vetus]]\".  The onset of a New Logic, or \"[[logica nova]]\", arose alongside the reappearance of ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', the work in which Aristotle develops his theory of the syllogism.\n\n''Prior Analytics'', upon re-discovery, was instantly regarded by logicians as \"a closed and complete body of doctrine\", leaving very little for thinkers of the day to debate and re-organize.  Aristotle's theory on the syllogism for ''[[assertoric]]'' sentences was considered especially remarkable, with only small systematic changes occurring to the concept over time.  This theory of the syllogism would not enter the context of the more comprehensive logic of consequence until logic began to be reworked in general in the mid-fourteenth century by the likes of [[John Buridan]].\n\nAristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' did not, however, incorporate such a comprehensive theory on the \"modal syllogism\"\u2014a syllogism that has at least one modalized premise (that is, a premise containing the modal words 'necessarily', 'possibly', or 'contingently').  Aristotle's terminology in this aspect of his theory was deemed vague and in many cases unclear, even contradicting some of his statements from ''[[On Interpretation]]''.  His original assertions on this specific component of the theory were left up to a considerable amount of conversation, resulting in a wide array of solutions put forth by commentators of the day.  The system for modal syllogisms laid forth by Aristotle would ultimately be deemed unfit for practical use, and would be replaced by new distinctions and new theories altogether.\n\n===Medieval===\n\n====Boethius====\n\n[[Boethius]] (c. 475&nbsp;\u2013 526) contributed an effort to make the ancient Aristotelian logic more accessible.  While his Latin translation of ''Prior Analytics'' went primarily unused before the twelfth century, his textbooks on the categorical syllogism were central to expanding the syllogistic discussion.  Boethius' logical legacy lay not in any addition he personally made to the field, but  in his effective transmission of prior theories to later logicians, as well as his clear and primarily accurate presentations of Aristotle's contributions.\n\n====Peter Abelard====\n\nAnother of medieval logic's first contributors from the Latin West, [[Peter Abelard]] (1079\u20131142), gave his own thorough evaluation of the syllogism concept and accompanying theory in the ''Dialectica'' - a discussion of logic based on Boethius' commentaries and monographs.  His perspective on syllogisms can be found in other works as well, such as ''Logica Ingredientibus''.  With the help of Abelard's distinction between ''[[de dicto]]'' modal sentences and ''[[de re]]'' modal sentences, medieval logicians began to shape a more coherent concept of Aristotle's modal syllogism model.\n\n====John Buridan====\n\n[[John Buridan]] (c. 1300&nbsp;\u2013 1361), whom some consider the foremost logician of the later Middle Ages, contributed two significant works: ''Treatise on Consequence'' and ''Summulae de Dialectica'', in which he discussed the concept of the syllogism, its components and distinctions, and ways to use the tool to expand its logical capability. For two hundred years after Buridan's discussions, little was said about syllogistic logic. Historians of logic have assessed that the primary changes in the post-Middle Age era were changes in respect to the public's awareness of original sources, a lessening of appreciation for the logic's sophistication and complexity, and an increase in logical ignorance\u2014so that logicians of the early twentieth century came to view the whole system as ridiculous.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lagerlund|first=Henrik|title=Medieval Theories of the Syllogism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/medieval-syllogism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Edward N. Zalta|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Modern history==\n\nThe Aristotelian syllogism dominated Western philosophical thought for many centuries. Syllogism itself is about how to get valid conclusion from assumptions (axioms) and not about verifying the assumptions.  However, people over time focused on the logic part and forgot the importance of verifying the assumptions.  In the 17th century, [[Francis Bacon]] emphasized that experimental verification of the assumptions must be carried out rigorously and cannot take syllogism itself as the best way to draw conclusions in nature.<ref name=instauration>See Francis Bacon, ''The Great Instauration,'' 1620. This text can be found (as of the access date of 11/12/13) at the ''Constitution Society'' website at the following URL: http://www.constitution.org/bacon/instauration.htm.</ref> Bacon proposed a more inductive approach to the observation of nature, which involves experimentation and leads to discovering and building on axioms to create a more general conclusion.<ref name=instauration />  Yet, a full method to come to conclusions in nature is not the scope of logic or syllogism.\n\nIn the 19th century, modifications to syllogism were incorporated to deal with disjunctive (\"A or B\") and conditional (\"if A then B\") statements.  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] famously claimed, in ''Logic'' (1800), that logic was the one completed science, and that Aristotelian logic more or less included everything about logic there was to know. (This work is not necessarily representative of Kant's mature philosophy, which is often regarded as an innovation to logic itself.) Though there were alternative systems of logic, such as [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Avicennian logic]] or [[Indian logic]] elsewhere, Kant's opinion stood unchallenged in the West until 1879 when [[Frege]] published his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (''Concept Script'').  This introduced a calculus, a method of representing categorical statements (and statements that are not provided for in syllogism as well) by the use of quantifiers and variables.\n\nA noteworthy exception is the logic developed in [[Bernard Bolzano]]'s work ''[[Bernard Bolzano#Wissenschaftslehre (Theory of Science)|Wissenschaftslehre]]'' (''Theory of Science'', 1837), the principles of which were applied as a direct critique of Kant, in the posthumously published work ''New Anti-Kant'' (1850). The work of Bolzano had been largely overlooked until the late 20th century, among other reasons, due to the intellectual environment at the time in [[Bohemia]], which was then part of the Austrian empire. In the last 20 years, Bolzano's work has resurfaced and become subject of both translation and contemporary study.\n\nThis led to the rapid development of [[sentential logic]] and first-order [[predicate logic]], subsuming syllogistic reasoning, which was, therefore, after 2000 years, suddenly considered obsolete by many.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}} The Aristotelian system is explicated in modern fora of academia primarily in introductory material and historical study.\n\nOne notable exception, to this modern relegation, is the continued application of Aristotelian logic  by officials of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], and the Apostolic Tribunal of the [[Roman Rota]], which still requires that any arguments crafted by Advocates be presented in syllogistic format.\n <!--\nWhat follows is at best *very* obscure and desultory.  I'll have a go at rewriting it when I can.\nYou can simply put list of rules for validity&nbsp;\u2014 as in Russian wp -->\n\n===Boole's acceptance of Aristotle===\n[[George Boole]]'s unwavering acceptance of Aristotle's logic is emphasized by the historian of logic [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] in an accessible introduction to ''[[Laws of Thought]]''.<ref>[[George Boole]] (1854/2003). ''The Laws of Thought'', facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in ''Philosophy in Review'' '''24''' (2004). pp. 167\u2013169.</ref> Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of ''Prior Analytics'' and ''Laws of Thought''.<ref>John Corcoran. \"Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' and Boole's ''Laws of Thought''. ''History and Philosophy of Logic''. vol. 24 (2003), pp. 261\u2013288.</ref> According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole's goals were \"to go under, over, and beyond\" Aristotle's logic by: (1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations, (2) extending the class of problems it could treat, as solving equations was added to assessing [[Validity (logic)|validity]], and (3) expanding the range of applications it could handle, such as expanding propositions of only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.\n\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole's 'disagreements', if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say.\nFirst, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle's four propositional forms to one form, the form of equations, which by itself was a revolutionary idea.\nSecond, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic\u2014another revolutionary idea\u2014involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the \"perfect syllogisms\") must be supplemented by rules for equation solving.\nThird, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments, whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce: \"No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus\" from \"No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle\" or from \"No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle\".\n\n==Basic structure==\nA categorical syllogism consists of three parts:\n* Major premise\n* Minor premise\n* Conclusion\n\nEach part is a [[categorical proposition]], and each categorical proposition  contains two categorical terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/c.htm#capro |title=Philosophical Dictionary: Caird-Catharsis |publisher=Philosophypages.com |date=2002-08-08 |accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> In Aristotle, each of the premises is in the form \"All A are B,\" \"Some A are B\", \"No A are B\" or \"Some A are not B\", where \"A\" is one term and \"B\" is another. \"All A are B,\" and \"No A are B\" are termed ''universal'' propositions; \"Some A are B\" and \"Some A are not B\" are termed ''particular'' propositions.  More modern logicians allow some variation. Each of the premises has one term in common with the conclusion: in a major premise, this is the ''major term'' (''i.e.,'' the predicate of the conclusion); in a minor premise, this is the ''minor term'' (''i.e.,'' the subject of the conclusion). For example:\n\n:Major premise: All humans are mortal.\n:Minor premise: All Greeks are humans.\n:Conclusion: All Greeks are mortal.\n\nEach of the three distinct terms represents a category. In the above example, ''humans'', ''mortal'', and ''Greeks''.  ''Mortal'' is the major term, ''Greeks'' the minor term. The premises also have one term in common with each other, which is known as the ''middle term''; in this example, ''humans''. Both of the premises are universal, as is the conclusion.\n\n:Major premise: All mortals die.\n:Minor premise: All men are mortals.\n:Conclusion: All men die.\n\nHere, the major term is ''die'', the minor term is ''men'', and the middle term is ''mortals''. Again, both premises are universal, hence so is the conclusion.\n\nA [[Polysyllogism|sorites]] is a form of argument in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. For example, one might argue that all lions are big cats, all big cats are predators, and all predators are carnivores. To conclude that therefore all lions are carnivores is to construct a sorites argument.\n\n==Types<!--linked from 'Term logic'-->==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Square of opposition, set diagrams.svg|thumb|Relationships between the four types of propositions in the [[square of opposition]]<br /><br />(Black areas are empty,<br />red areas are nonempty.)]]\n{{further|List of valid argument forms}}\n\nThere are infinitely many possible syllogisms, but only 256 logically distinct types and only 24 valid types (enumerated below). A syllogism takes the form:\n\n:Major premise: All M are P.\n:Minor premise: All S are M.\n:Conclusion: All S are P.\n\n(Note: M&nbsp;\u2013 Middle, S&nbsp;\u2013 subject, P&nbsp;\u2013 predicate. See below for more detailed explanation.)\n\nThe premises and conclusion of a syllogism can be any of four types, which are labeled by letters<ref>According to [[Copi]], p. 127: 'The letter names are presumed to come from the Latin words \"'''''A'''''ff'''''I'''''rmo\" and \"n'''''E'''''g'''''O''''',\" which mean \"I affirm\" and \"I deny,\" respectively; the first capitalized letter of each word is for universal, the second for particular'</ref> as follows. The meaning of the letters is given by the table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''code''\n! ''quantifier''\n! ''subject''\n! ''copula''\n! ''predicate''\n! ''type''\n!

It is traditional to use ''is'' rather than ''are'' as the copula, hence ''All A is B'' rather than ''All As are Bs''. It is traditional and convenient practice to use  a, e, i, o as [[Infix notation|infix operators]] so the categorical statements can be written succinctly.  The following table shows the longer form, the succinct shorthand, and equivalent expressions in predicate logic:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Form\n! Shorthand\n! Predicate logic\n|-\n| All A is B\n| AaB\n| <math>\\forall x (A(x) \\rightarrow B(x))</math>&nbsp; ''or'' &nbsp;<math>\\neg \\exist x (A(x) \\land \\neg B(x))</math>\n|-\n|No A is B\n|AeB\n| <math>\\neg \\exist x (A(x) \\land B(x))</math>&nbsp; ''or'' &nbsp;<math>\\forall x (A(x) \\rightarrow \\neg B(x))</math>\n|-\n|Some A is B\n|AiB\n| <math>\\exist x (A(x) \\land B(x))</math>\n|-\n|Some A is not B\n|AoB\n| <math>\\exist x (A(x) \\land \\neg B(x))</math>\n|}\n\nThe convention here is that the letter S is the subject of the conclusion, P is the predicate of the conclusion, and M is the middle term.  The major premise links M with P and the minor premise links M with S.  However, the middle term can be either the subject or the predicate of each premise where it appears.  The differing positions of the major, minor, and middle terms gives rise to another classification of syllogisms known as the ''figure''.  Given that in each case the conclusion is S-P, the four figures are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n! ''Figure 1''\n! ''Figure 2''\n! ''Figure 3''\n! ''Figure 4''\n|-\n! Major premise\n| M\u2013P\n| P\u2013M\n| M\u2013P\n| P\u2013M\n|-\n! Minor premise\n| S\u2013M\n| S\u2013M\n| M\u2013S\n| M\u2013S\n|}\n\n(Note, however, that, following Aristotle's treatment of the figures, some logicians\u2014e.g., [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]\u2014reject the fourth figure as a figure distinct from the first. See entry on the [[Prior Analytics]].)\n\nPutting it all together, there are 256 possible types of syllogisms (or 512 if the order of the major and minor premises is changed, though this makes no difference logically).  Each premise and the conclusion can be of type A, E, I or O, and the syllogism can be any of the four figures.  A syllogism can be described briefly by giving the letters for the premises and conclusion followed by the number for the figure.  For example, the syllogism BARBARA below is AAA-1, or \"A-A-A in the first figure\".\n\nThe vast majority of the 256 possible forms of syllogism are invalid (the conclusion does not [[logical consequence|follow logically]] from the premises).  The table below shows the valid forms. Even some of these are sometimes considered to commit the [[existential fallacy]], meaning they are invalid if they mention an empty category. These controversial patterns are marked in ''italics''. All but four of the patterns in italics (felapton, darapti, fesapo and bamalip) are weakened moods, i.e. it is possible to draw a stronger conclusion from the premises.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So in AAI-3, the premise \"All squares are rectangles\" becomes \"MaP\"; the symbols mean that the first term (\"square\") is the middle term, the second term (\"rectangle\") is the predicate of the conclusion, and the relationship between the two terms is labeled \"a\" (All M are P).\n\nThe following table shows all syllogisms that are essentially different. The similar syllogisms share the same premises, just written in a different way. For example \"Some pets are kittens\" (SiM in [[Syllogism#Darii (AII-1)|Darii]]) could also be written as \"Some kittens are pets\" (MiS in Datisi).\n\nIn the Venn diagrams, the black areas indicate no elements, and the red areas indicate at least one element.  In the predicate logic expressions, a horizontal bar over an expression means to negate (\"logical not\") the result of that expression.\n\nIt is also possible to use [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] (consisting of vertices and edges) to evaluate syllogisms.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXRwmOpgqLw</ref>\n\n===Examples===\n\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Modus_Barbara.svg|thumb|right|150px|\n{| style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n| M:Men<br />S:Greeks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P:mortal\n|}\n]]\n\n====Barbara (AAA-1){{anchor|Modus Barbara}}====\n\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All men are mortal.

Aristotle further distinguished (a) terms that could be the subject of predication, and (b) terms that could be predicated of others by the use of the copula (\"is a\").  (Such a predication is known as a distributive as opposed to non-distributive as in ''Greeks are numerous''. It is clear that Aristotle's syllogism works only for distributive predication for we cannot reason ''All Greeks are animals, animals are numerous, therefore All Greeks are numerous''.) In Aristotle's view singular terms were of type (a) and general terms of type (b).  Thus ''Men'' can be predicated of ''Socrates'' but ''Socrates'' cannot be predicated of anything.  Therefore, for a term to be interchangeable\u2014to be either in the subject or predicate position of a proposition in a syllogism\u2014the terms must be general terms, or ''categorical terms'' as they came to be called.  Consequently, the propositions of a syllogism should be categorical propositions (both terms general) and syllogisms that employ only categorical terms came to be called ''categorical syllogisms''.\n\nIt is clear that nothing would prevent a singular term occurring in a syllogism\u2014so long as it was always in the subject position\u2014however, such a syllogism, even if valid, is not a categorical syllogism. An example is ''Socrates is a man, all men are mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal.'' Intuitively this is as valid as ''All Greeks are men, all men are mortal therefore all Greeks are mortals''. To argue that its validity can be explained by the theory of syllogism would require that we show that ''Socrates is a man'' is the equivalent of a categorical proposition.  It can be argued ''Socrates is a man'' is equivalent to ''All that are identical to Socrates are men'', so our non-categorical syllogism can be justified by use of the equivalence above and then citing BARBARA.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Existential import==\nIf a statement includes a term such that the statement is false if the term has no instances, then the statement is said to have existential import with respect to that term. It is ambiguous whether or not a universal statement of the form ''All A is B'' is to be considered as true, false, or even meaningless if there are no As. If it is considered as false in such cases, then the statement ''All A is B'' has existential import with respect to A.\n\nIt is claimed Aristotle's logic system does not cover cases where there are no instances.\nAristotle's goal was to develop \"a companion-logic for science.\nHe relegates fictions, such as mermaids and unicorns, to\nthe realms of poetry and literature. In his mind, they exist outside the\nambit of science. This is why he leaves no room for such non-existent\nentities in his logic.  This is a thoughtful choice, not an inadvertent\nomission. Technically, Aristotelian science is a search for definitions,\nwhere a definition is 'a phrase signifying a thing's essence.'...\nBecause non-existent entities cannot be anything, they do not, in\nAristotle's mind, possess an essence...  This is why he leaves\nno place for fictional entities like goat-stags (or unicorns).\"\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/ |title=Groarke, Louis F., \"Aristotle: Logic\", section 7. (Existential Assumptions), Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2017-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204235013/http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/ |archive-date=2017-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nHowever, many logic systems developed since ''do'' consider the case where there may be no instances.\n\nHowever, medieval logicians were aware of the problem of existential import and maintained that negative propositions do not carry existential import, and that positive propositions with subjects that do not [[supposition theory|supposit]] are false.\n\nThe following problems arise:\n: (a) In natural language and normal use, which statements of the forms All A is B, No A is B, Some A is B and Some A is not B have existential import and with respect to which terms?\n: (b) In the four forms of categorical statements used in syllogism, which statements of the form AaB, AeB, AiB and AoB have existential import and with respect to which terms?\n: (c) What existential imports must the forms AaB, AeB, AiB and AoB have for the square of opposition to be valid?\n: (d) What existential imports must the forms AaB, AeB, AiB and AoB have to preserve the validity of the traditionally valid forms of syllogisms?\n: (e) Are the existential imports required to satisfy (d) above such that the normal uses in natural languages of the forms All A is B, No A is B, Some A is B and Some A is not B are intuitively and fairly reflected by the categorical statements of forms AaB, AeB, AiB and AoB?\n\nFor example, if it is accepted that AiB is false if there are no As and AaB entails AiB, then AiB has existential import with respect to A, and so does AaB.  Further, if it is accepted that AiB entails BiA, then AiB and AaB have existential import with respect to B as well. Similarly, if AoB is false if there are no As, and AeB entails AoB, and AeB entails BeA (which in turn entails BoA) then both AeB and AoB have existential import with respect to both A and B.  It follows immediately that all universal categorical statements have existential import with respect to both terms.  If AaB and AeB is a fair representation of the use of statements in normal natural language of  All A is B and No A is B respectively, then the following example consequences arise:\n\n:\"All flying horses are mythological\" is false if there are no flying horses.\n\n:If \"No men are fire-eating rabbits\" is true, then \"There are fire-eating rabbits\" is true.\n\nand so on.\n\nIf it is ruled that no universal statement has existential import then the square of opposition fails in several respects (e.g. AaB does not entail AiB) and a number of syllogisms are no longer valid (e.g. BaC,AaB->AiC).\n\nThese problems and paradoxes arise in both natural language statements and statements in syllogism form because of ambiguity, in particular ambiguity with respect to All.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} If \"Fred claims all his books were Pulitzer Prize winners\", is Fred claiming that he wrote any books? If not, then is what he claims true? Suppose Jane says none of her friends are poor; is that true if she has no friends?\n\nThe first-order predicate calculus avoids such ambiguity by using formulae that carry no existential import with respect to universal statements. Existential claims must be explicitly stated. Thus, natural language statements\u2014of the forms ''All A is B, No A is B'', ''Some A is B'', and ''Some A is not B''\u2014can be represented in first order predicate calculus in which any existential import with respect to terms A and/or B is either explicit or not made at all. Consequently, the four forms ''AaB, AeB, AiB'', and ''AoB'' can be represented in first order predicate in every combination of existential import\u2014so it can establish which construal, if any, preserves the square of opposition and the validity of the traditionally valid syllogism.  Strawson claims such a construal is possible, but the results are such that, in his view, the answer to question (e) above is ''no''.\n\nOn the other hand, in modern [[mathematical logic]], however, statements containing words \"all\", \"some\" and \"no\", can be stated in terms of [[set theory]]. If the set of all A's is labeled as s(A) and the set of all B's as s(B), then:\n* \"All A is B\" (AaB) is equivalent to \"s(A) is a [[subset]] of s(B)\", or s(A) \u2286 s(B)\n* \"No A is B\" (AeB) is equivalent to \"The [[intersection]] of s(A) and s(B) is [[empty set|empty]]\", or <math>s(A) \\cap s(B) = \\empty</math>\n* \"Some A is B\" (AiB) is equivalent to \"the intersection of s(A) and s(B) is not empty\", or <math>s(A) \\cap s(B) \\neq \\empty</math>\n* \"Some A is not B\" (AoB) is equivalent to \"s(A) is not a subset of s(B)\" <!--, or <math>s(A) \\nonsubset s(B)</math>-->\n\nBy definition, the [[empty set]] is a subset of all sets. From this it follows that, according to this mathematical convention, if there are no A's, then the statements \"All A is B\" and \"No A is B\" are always true whereas the statements \"Some A is B\" and \"Some A is not B\" are always false.  This, however, implies that AaB does not entail AiB, and some of the syllogisms mentioned above are not valid when there are no A's.\n\n==Syllogistic fallacies==\n{{See also|Syllogistic fallacy}}\nPeople often make mistakes when reasoning syllogistically.<ref>See, e.g., Evans, J. St. B. T (1989).  ''Bias in human reasoning''. London: LEA.</ref>\n\nFor instance, from the premises some A are B, some B are C, people tend to come to a definitive conclusion that therefore some A are C.<ref>See the meta-analysis by Khemlani, S. & Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2012). Theories of the syllogism: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin'', ''138'', 427-457.</ref><ref>See the meta-analysis by Chater, N. & Oaksford, M. (1999). The Probability Heuristics Model of Syllogistic Reasoning. ''Cognitive Psychology'', ''38'', 191\u2013258.</ref> However, this does not follow according to the rules of classical logic. For instance, while some cats (A) are black things (B), and some black things (B) are televisions (C), it does not follow from the parameters that some cats (A) are televisions (C). This is because in the structure of the syllogism invoked (i.e. III-1) the middle term is not distributed in either the major premise or in the minor premise, a pattern called the \"fallacy of the undistributed middle\".\n\nDetermining the validity of a syllogism involves determining the [[distribution of terms|distribution]] of each term in each statement, meaning whether all members of that term are accounted for.\n\nIn simple syllogistic patterns, the fallacies of invalid patterns are:\n\n*[[Fallacy of the undistributed middle|Undistributed middle]]: Neither of the premises accounts for all members of the middle term, which consequently fails to link the major and minor term.\n*[[Illicit major|Illicit treatment of the major term]]: The conclusion implicates all members of the major term (P&nbsp;\u2013 meaning the proposition is negative); however, the major premise does not account for them all (i.e., P is either an affirmative predicate or a particular subject there).\n*[[Illicit minor|Illicit treatment of the minor term]]: Same as above, but for the minor term (S&nbsp;\u2013 meaning the proposition is universal) and minor premise (where S is either a particular subject or an affirmative predicate).\n*[[Fallacy of exclusive premises|Exclusive premises]]: Both premises are negative, meaning no link is established between the major and minor terms.\n*[[Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise]]: If either premise is negative, the conclusion must also be.\n*[[Negative conclusion from affirmative premises]]: If both premises are affirmative, the conclusion must also be.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n* [[Argumentation theory#Psychological aspects|Argumentation theory]]\n* [[Legal syllogism]]\n* [[Buddhist logic]]\n* [[Enthymeme]]\n* Other types of syllogism:\n** [[Disjunctive syllogism]]\n** [[Hypothetical syllogism]]\n** [[Legal syllogism]]\n** [[Polysyllogism]]\n** [[Prosleptic syllogism]]\n** [[Quasi-syllogism]]\n** [[Statistical syllogism]]\n* [[Formal fallacy]]\n* [[Logical fallacy]]\n* [[Syllogistic fallacy]]\n* [[The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures]]\n* [[Tautology (logic)]]\n* [[Venn diagram]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Aristotle]], ''[[Prior Analytics]]''. transl.

{"title_page": "Court of Cassation (France)", "text_new": "[[File:Court of cassation.jpg|thumb|The Court of Cassation building]]\n{{Politics of France}}\nThe '''Court of Cassation''' ({{lang-fr|Cour de cassation}}; {{IPA-fr|ku\u0281.d\u0259.k\u0251.sa\u02c8sj\u0254\u0303}}) is one of the four [[Court of last resort|courts of last resort]] in [[France]]. It has [[jurisdiction]] over all civil and criminal matters triable in the [[Judiciary of France#Judicial Stream|judicial system]], and is the supreme [[court of appeal]] in these cases. It has jurisdiction to review the law, and to certify questions of law, to determine miscarriages of justice. The Court is located in the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palace of Justice]] in [[Paris]].\n\nThe Court does not have jurisdiction over cases involving claims against administrators or public bodies, which fall within the jurisdiction of [[administrative court]]s, for which the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] acts as the supreme court of appeal; nor over cases involving constitutional issues, which fall within the jurisdiction of the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]; nor over cases involving disputes about which of these  courts has jurisdiction, which are heard by the [[Judiciary of France#Jurisdictional court|Jurisdictional Disputes Tribunal]]. Collectively, these four courts form the topmost tier of the French court system.\n\nThe Court was established in 1790 under the name ''Tribunal de cassation'' during the [[French Revolution]], and its original purpose was to act as a court of error with revisory jurisdiction over lower provincial [[prerogative court]]s (''[[Parlement]]s'').<ref>[[Serge Guinchard]], Andr\u00e9 Varinard and Thierry Debard, ''Institutions juridictionnelles'' (= Judicials institutions), 11th edn., (Paris: Dalloz, 2011).</ref> However, much about the Court continues the earlier [[Parlement|Paris Parlement]].\n\nThe Court is the seat of the [[Network of the Presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union]].\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Cour de Cassation, Paris 140320 1.jpg|thumb|The building of the Court of Cassation]]\nThe Court is made up of justices, the [[Minist\u00e8re public (France)|Office of the Prosecutor]], and an Administrative Office of Courts. In addition, a separate bar of specially certified [[barrister]]s exists for trying cases at the French Court.\n\n===Judges and divisions===\nOverall, the Court consists of nearly 85 trial judges (''conseillers'') and about 40 deputy judges<ref>A Canadian term; known as an associate judge in Australia and a magistrate judge in America.</ref> (''conseillers r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaires''), each divided among six different divisions (''chambres''):\n*First Civil Division (''premi\u00e8re chambre civile'') deals with family law, successions (wills), child custody, professional discipline, individual rights, contractual liability\n*Second Civil Division (''deuxi\u00e8me chambre civile'') handles divorce, [[tort]]s, and electoral matters\n*Third Civil Division (''troisi\u00e8me chambre civile'') (or \"Land Court\") for immovable property (real estate), housing, city planning, leases, foreclosures\n*Commercial Division (''chambre commerciale, financi\u00e8re et \u00e9conomique'') handles companies, bankruptcy, business, banking and intellectual property\n*Labor Division (''chambre sociale'') handles labor disputes, worker compensation, and welfare\n*Criminal Division (''chambre criminelle'') deals with criminal cases\n\nEach division is headed by a presiding justice<ref>A presiding judge may be the judge trying the case or the senior-most justice on a Bench. In Canada, this position is referred to as \"senior judge.\" In most English-speaking countries, \"presiding justice\" refers to any high-level judge. In the United States, it refers to a semi-retired, elderly judge. In France this is the highest-ranking judge in the division</ref> referred to in French as a ''pr\u00e9sident'', or President of Division. The Chief Justice bears the title of the ''premier pr\u00e9sident'', or President of the Court, who supervises the presiding justices of the various divisions. The Chief Justice is the highest-ranking judicial officer in the country and is responsible for administration of the Court and the discipline of justices. The current Chief Justice is {{Interlanguage link multi|Bertrand Louvel|fr}}. The Court also includes 12 [[Master (judiciary)|masters]] (''auditeurs''), the lowest rank of justice, who are primarily concerned with administration.\n\nThere is, in addition to the abovementioned six divisions, a separate organization known as the Divisional Court (''chambre mixte''). The Divisional Court adjudicates where the subject matter of an appeal falls within the purview of multiple divisions. The Bench of the Divisional Court seats the Chief Justice and a number of other judges from at least three other divisions relevant to a given case. Any participating division is represented by its Presiding Justice and two [[puisne]] judges.\n\nFinally, a [[Full Court]] (''[[:wikt:assembl\u00e9e|Assembl\u00e9e]] [[:wikt:fr:pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re|pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re]]'') is called, presided over by the Chief Justice or, if he is absent, by the most senior presiding justice. It also seats all divisional presiding justices and senior justices, assisted by a ''puisne'' judge from each division. The Full Court is the highest level of the Court.<ref>Serge Braudo and Alexis Baumann, ''Dictionnaire juridique'', s.v. \"Assembl\u00e9e pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re\" (2008): [http://www.dictionnaire-juridique.com/definition/assemblee-pleniere.php]. Retrieved 3 February 2009.</ref>\n\n===Office of the Prosecutor===\nThe [[Minist\u00e8re public (France)|prosecution]], or ''[[Parquet (legal)|parquet]] g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'', is headed by the Chief Prosecutor (''[[procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]'').<ref>Not completely analogous to prosecutor in [[common law]] jurisdictions, as investigations in France are carried out by the ''[[juge d'instruction]]'' (magistrate judge) in cooperation with police. Both work with the prosecutor, who is in charge of presenting the state's case against a defendant.</ref> The Chief Prosecutor is a judicial officer, but does not prosecute cases; instead, his function is to advise the Court on how to proceed, analogous to the Commissioner-in-Council's<ref>appears to be a Canadian advisor to the Governor-General, in Canada, i.e., a common law jurisdiction, so the analogy should possibly be taken with a grain of salt</ref> role within the [[Conseil d'\u00c9tat (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]] (lit. Council of State, but function may vary). Duties include filing motions to bring cases before the Court \"in the name of the law\" and bringing cases before the French Court of Justice (''Cour de justice de la R\u00e9publique''), which tries government officials for crimes committed while in office. The Chief Prosecutor is assisted by two Chief Deputy Prosecutors (''premiers avocats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'') and a staff of about 22 deputy prosecutors (''avocats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux''), and two assistant prosecutors (''substituts'').\n\n===Supreme Court bar===\n[[Barristers]] (''avocats''), though not technically officers of the Court, play an integral role in the justice system. Except for a few types of actions, advocate counsel in the form of a barrister is mandatory for any case heard at the Court or Council of State. Barristers with exclusive rights of audience and admitted to practice law in either senior court are titled ''avocat au Conseil d'\u00c9tat et \u00e0 la Cour de Cassation'', or ''avocats aux Conseils'' (\"Counsel at Senior Court\") for short. Admission to the Supreme Court bar<ref>For more (in French): [http://www.ordre-avocats-cassation.fr].</ref> is particularly difficult, requiring special training and passing a notoriously stringent examination. Once admitted, bar members can advise litigants on whether their actions are justiciable, that is, issuable and exceeding [[de minimis]] requirements\u2014an important service since the Court hears appeals only on points of law and not issues of fact. Membership is restricted to 60 total positions and is considered a public office.\n\n==Proceedings==\nThe Court's main purpose is to review lower court rulings on the grounds of legal or procedural error. As the highest court of law in France, it also has other duties.\n\n===Appeals===\nThe Court has inherent appellate jurisdiction for appeals (called ''pourvois en cassation'') from courts of appeal or, for certain types of small claims cases not appealable to appellate courts, from courts of record. The Supreme Court reviews the appeal on the record and may affirm or set aside lower court rulings; if set aside, the ruling is said to be ''cass\u00e9'' (French for \"quashed\"), hence the French name of ''Cour de cassation'', or \"Quashing Court\". The Court adjudicates by strict appeal, or appeal ''stricto sensu'', which is limited to review of the decision and of the decision-making process on a point of law, and may only allow the appeal in cases of serious error; fresh evidence is not admissible. The typical outcome of a successful appeal is setting aside of the lower court's decision and remittal for reconsideration.\n\nAn intermediate [[appellate court]], the [[Court of Appeal (France)|Cour d'appel]], hears general appeals ''de novo'' on points of law and procedure as well as errors of fact and reasoning. The Court of Cassation only decides matters of points of law or procedure on the record, as opposed to factual errors. Lower courts may petition the Court for an [[interlocutory]] order during the proceedings on any new and complex point of law; any such order, however, is not final or conclusive.\n\n===Appeal procedure===\nA case is heard by a bench of three or five relevant divisional justices. For either civil or criminal appeals, the bench seats by three judges unless the Chief Justice or the divisional presiding justice orders a Full Bench of five judges. Furthermore, any one of the three judges originally assigned to the Bench may order it expanded to five. If the case falls in the legal areas handled by more than one division, the Chief Justice may order the Divisional Court, rather than a Bench, to consider the case.\n\nThe Court can affirm a decision from below by dismissing the appeal (''rejet du pourvoi'') or overturn or amend the decision by allowing the appeal (''accueil du pourvoi'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionnaire-juridique.com/definition/pourvoi.php|title=D\u00e9finition de Pourvoi|work=Dictionnaire du droit priv\u00e9|author=Serge Braudo}}</ref> If it finds that the lower court erred, it sets aside the lower court decision and remits the case with its opinion to an appellate court for reconsideration (''cassation avec renvoi''). If only a portion of a ruling is overturned, it is called ''cassation partielle'', or partial setting aside. Sometimes, the Court may overturn a lower court ruling and judge the case ''ex proprio motu'' without being petitioned (''cassation sans renvoi''), as long as the merits and facts of the case are on record.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nWhen overturned, the case is remanded to a second appellate court, in other words not the appellate court whose decision is being appealed; never to the same judges. The decision of the Bench of the Court of Cassation or Divisional Court is not binding on the lower court, and the appellate court has full discretion to decide the case, but the higher court's ruling has persuasive authority. The appellate court's ruling may again be appealed to the Court of Cassation. If so, the Full Court hears and judges the case. It may, again, uphold an earlier decision or reverse it and remand the case to another appellate court. In the latter case, the determination of the Full Court is binding; the facts, however, may be reviewed by the court retrying the case.\n\nPublished [[judgment (French law)|judgments]] are quite brief, averaging 30 lines and typically fitting on one typewritten page. They begin with a capitulation, usually in a couple sentences, of the facts and the previous proceedings. This is followed by a citation of statutory authorities or other relevant legal principles (the so-called ''visa'').<ref>{{cite book|title=French Law: A Comparative Approach|author=Eva Steiner|chapter=The Judicial Syllogism|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2018}}</ref> This may be followed by an interpretation, clarification, or otherwise more specific statement of the legal principles the Court will apply (the ''chapeau'', in the case of an ''[[arr\u00eat de principe]]'', set forth in the form of a ''attendu'' or \"whereas\" clause that is formulated with a certain degree of generality so that it can be quoted as precedent). This is followed by a rendering of the decision of the lower court. Next comes the solution given by the Court, which will either reject a legal argument or a premise stated in the appeal, or else find the lower court misapplied the law. Lastly, the result is given, either finding the appeal legally unfounded due to an error in logic, or lacking in factual basis because it is based on premises that are unsupported by the evidentiary findings of the lower court, or otherwise unacceptable because of a misinterpretation of the law; or else quashing the lower court's decision.<ref>{{citation|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&context=mjs|title=A Comparison of the American and French(-Inspired) Appellate Model|author=Blockx, Frederic}}</ref>\n\nThe ruling does not contain a detailed [[ratio decidendi]] in the style of [[common law|common-law]] jurisdictions.<ref>The ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', which largely lays out judicial interpretation of law, is important for common-law jurisdictions because rulings are determined largely through case law whereas in civil law countries like France, procedurally speaking, courts are formally forbidden to interpret law and do not rule based on case law.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}</ref><ref>[[Serge Guinchard]], C\u00e9cile Chainais, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ferrand, ''Civil procedure'', Paris, Dalloz editor, 30th edition, 2010.</ref> Instead, it is left to legal experts to explain the importance of rulings. The Court often drastically changes the way the [[Civil Code]] or other statutory laws are interpreted. Legal digests, such as the ''[[Recueil Dalloz]]'', and treatises written by legal scholars analyze and explain rulings through precedents. Much of this information is available through online databases.\n\nUnlike common-law jurisdictions, there is no doctrine of binding precedent ([[stare decisis]]) in France. Therefore, previous decisions of higher courts do not bind lower courts in the same hierarchy, though they are often followed and have persuasive authority. Instead, the French legal system subscribes to the legal doctrine of ''[[jurisprudence constante]]'' according to which courts should follow a series of decisions that are in accord with each other and judges should rule on their own interpretation of the law.\n\n====Criminal appeals====\nMajor [[felony|felonies]] ([[indictable offence]]s), called ''crimes'' in French, are tried by jury in a [[Departments of France|county]] [[Cour d'assises|Court of Assizes]]. In the past, their decisions were not open to appeal in an intermediate appellate court, and before 2001, could only be appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court would review the case on points of procedure and law only, and when handing down a reversal, which was uncommon except for capital punishment cases, vested a second [[Cour d'assises|Court of Assizes]] to retry the case. An argument in favor of this system was that allowing appeals to be tried by active judges after having been decided by a jury would in essence deny [[popular sovereignty]]. Since 2001, Assize court rulings may be appealed on points of fact to a Court of Assizes in another county, vested by the Court, and before a larger jury. The case is then fully retried. For procedural issues, appeals to the Supreme Court are still possible since assize courts, which operate by jury trial, would not be competent to hear them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n====Certified questions====\nWhere no appeal has been made but the government disagrees with the lower court's interpretation of the law, it may order the Chief Prosecutor to \"lay an appeal before the Court in the interest of law\" (''former un pourvoi dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la loi''), i.e., appeal to [[Certified question|certify a question]] of general public importance. The Chief Prosecutor may do so ''[[sua sponte]]'' or at the Court's behest in either civil or criminal cases. The Court will then issue an [[advisory opinion]] which has no bearing on the lower court's ruling since it was satisfactory to all parties involved and no motion was made to appeal. If the government is dissatisfied with the law as stated by the courts, it may ask Parliament to rewrite the law, as long as no constitutional issue is involved.\n\n===Other duties===\nThe Court publishes an annual report on the French court system. The report includes a section with suggested changes to laws concerning the legal system, including [[criminal procedure]]. The Court awards [[damages]] to defendants exonerated after [[incarceration]]. Some high-level members of the court are [[ex officio]] members of special ad hoc courts; the investigatory commission of the High Court of Justice (''Haute Cour de Justice''), which may be convened to try the [[President of France|French President]] for [[high treason]]; the [[Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique|French Court of Justice]] (''Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique''), which may be convened to try current or former cabinet [[Minister (government)|ministers]] for crimes committed while in office; and the National Judicial Council (''Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de la magistrature''), which serves as a court of judicial discipline and disciplinary counsel. The High Court of Justice has never been convened during the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] and the French Court of Justice, only rarely.\n\n==Other related courts==\nThe Court is not the only court of last resort in France. Cases involving claims against government bodies, local authorities, or the central government, including all [[delegated legislation]] (e.g., [[statutory instrument]]s, ministerial orders), are heard by the administrative courts, for which the court of last resort is the [[Conseil d'\u00c9tat (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]]. In cases where there appears to be concurrent jurisdiction or a conflict of laws between the judicial and administrative courts, whether both retain jurisdiction (\"positive dispute\") or decline jurisdiction (\"negative dispute\"), the Jurisdictional Disputes Court (''Tribunal des Conflits'') decides the issue. The Court is composed of 4 members from both senior courts and occasionally, to break a tie, the justice minister who, if present, presides.\n\nNeither court has the [[judicial review|power]] to strike down [[primary legislation]] such as acts of Parliament). The courts can, however, refuse to apply any statutory provision they consider inconsistent with France's international [[treaty]] obligations. Constitutional review lies in the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which can strike down any law that it deems [[Constitution of France|unconstitutional]]. Before a law is enacted, the [[President of France|French President]], the speaker of either house of Parliament, or, more commonly, 60 parliamentarians from the same house may petition the Council for review. Some laws, mostly constitutional laws (''loi organique''), come before the Constitutional Council for review without first being petitioned. Courts may adopt a restrictive approach to applying statute. A 2009 reform, effective on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial to question the constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as ''question prioritaire de constitutionnalit\u00e9'', is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, it is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, Cour de Cassation for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law is unconstitutional, the law is struck down and no longer has legal force; this decision applies to everybody and not just the appelant in the case at hand.<ref>http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/en_ordinance_58_1067.pdf</ref>\n\nThe [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has jurisdiction over claims of government violations in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in any ECHR member country, which includes all [[European Union|EU]] member countries.

It has [[jurisdiction]] over all civil and criminal matters triable in the [[Judiciary of France#Judicial Stream|judicial system]], and is the supreme [[court of appeal]] in these cases. It has jurisdiction to review the law, and to certify questions of law, to determine miscarriages of justice. The Court is located in the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palace of Justice]] in [[Paris]].\n\nThe Court does not have jurisdiction over cases involving claims against administrators or public bodies, which fall within the jurisdiction of [[administrative court]]s, for which the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] acts as the supreme court of appeal; nor over cases involving constitutional issues, which fall within the jurisdiction of the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]; nor over cases involving disputes about which of these  courts has jurisdiction, which are heard by the [[Judiciary of France#Jurisdictional court|Jurisdictional Disputes Tribunal]]. Collectively, these four courts form the topmost tier of the French court system.\n\nThe Court was established in 1790 under the name ''Tribunal de cassation'' during the [[French Revolution]], and its original purpose was to act as a court of error with revisory jurisdiction over lower provincial [[prerogative court]]s (''[[Parlement]]s'').<ref>[[Serge Guinchard]], Andr\u00e9 Varinard and Thierry Debard, ''Institutions juridictionnelles'' (= Judicials institutions), 11th edn., (Paris: Dalloz, 2011).</ref> However, much about the Court continues the earlier [[Parlement|Paris Parlement]].\n\nThe Court is the seat of the [[Network of the Presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union]].\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Cour de Cassation, Paris 140320 1.jpg|thumb|The building of the Court of Cassation]]\nThe Court is made up of justices, the [[Minist\u00e8re public (France)|Office of the Prosecutor]], and an Administrative Office of Courts. In addition, a separate bar of specially certified [[barrister]]s exists for trying cases at the French Court.\n\n===Judges and divisions===\nOverall, the Court consists of nearly 85 trial judges (''conseillers'') and about 40 deputy judges<ref>A Canadian term; known as an associate judge in Australia and a magistrate judge in America.</ref> (''conseillers r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaires''), each divided among six different divisions (''chambres''):\n*First Civil Division (''premi\u00e8re chambre civile'') deals with family law, successions (wills), child custody, professional discipline, individual rights, contractual liability\n*Second Civil Division (''deuxi\u00e8me chambre civile'') handles divorce, [[tort]]s, and electoral matters\n*Third Civil Division (''troisi\u00e8me chambre civile'') (or \"Land Court\") for immovable property (real estate), housing, city planning, leases, foreclosures\n*Commercial Division (''chambre commerciale, financi\u00e8re et \u00e9conomique'') handles companies, bankruptcy, business, banking and intellectual property\n*Labor Division (''chambre sociale'') handles labor disputes, worker compensation, and welfare\n*Criminal Division (''chambre criminelle'') deals with criminal cases\n\nEach division is headed by a presiding justice<ref>A presiding judge may be the judge trying the case or the senior-most justice on a Bench. In Canada, this position is referred to as \"senior judge.\" In most English-speaking countries, \"presiding justice\" refers to any high-level judge. In the United States, it refers to a semi-retired, elderly judge. In France this is the highest-ranking judge in the division</ref> referred to in French as a ''pr\u00e9sident'', or President of Division. The Chief Justice bears the title of the ''premier pr\u00e9sident'', or President of the Court, who supervises the presiding justices of the various divisions. The Chief Justice is the highest-ranking judicial officer in the country and is responsible for administration of the Court and the discipline of justices. The current Chief Justice is {{Interlanguage link multi|Bertrand Louvel|fr}}. The Court also includes 12 [[Master (judiciary)|masters]] (''auditeurs''), the lowest rank of justice, who are primarily concerned with administration.\n\nThere is, in addition to the abovementioned six divisions, a separate organization known as the Divisional Court (''chambre mixte''). The Divisional Court adjudicates where the subject matter of an appeal falls within the purview of multiple divisions. The Bench of the Divisional Court seats the Chief Justice and a number of other judges from at least three other divisions relevant to a given case. Any participating division is represented by its Presiding Justice and two [[puisne]] judges.\n\nFinally, a [[Full Court]] (''[[:wikt:assembl\u00e9e|Assembl\u00e9e]] [[:wikt:fr:pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re|pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re]]'') is called, presided over by the Chief Justice or, if he is absent, by the most senior presiding justice. It also seats all divisional presiding justices and senior justices, assisted by a ''puisne'' judge from each division. The Full Court is the highest level of the Court.<ref>Serge Braudo and Alexis Baumann, ''Dictionnaire juridique'', s.v. \"Assembl\u00e9e pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re\" (2008): [http://www.dictionnaire-juridique.com/definition/assemblee-pleniere.php]. Retrieved 3 February 2009.</ref>\n\n===Office of the Prosecutor===\nThe [[Minist\u00e8re public (France)|prosecution]], or ''[[Parquet (legal)|parquet]] g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'', is headed by the Chief Prosecutor (''[[procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]'').<ref>Not completely analogous to prosecutor in [[common law]] jurisdictions, as investigations in France are carried out by the ''[[juge d'instruction]]'' (magistrate judge) in cooperation with police. Both work with the prosecutor, who is in charge of presenting the state's case against a defendant.</ref> The Chief Prosecutor is a judicial officer, but does not prosecute cases; instead, his function is to advise the Court on how to proceed, analogous to the Commissioner-in-Council's<ref>appears to be a Canadian advisor to the Governor-General, in Canada, i.e., a common law jurisdiction, so the analogy should possibly be taken with a grain of salt</ref> role within the [[Conseil d'\u00c9tat (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]] (lit. Council of State, but function may vary). Duties include filing motions to bring cases before the Court \"in the name of the law\" and bringing cases before the French Court of Justice (''Cour de justice de la R\u00e9publique''), which tries government officials for crimes committed while in office. The Chief Prosecutor is assisted by two Chief Deputy Prosecutors (''premiers avocats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'') and a staff of about 22 deputy prosecutors (''avocats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux''), and two assistant prosecutors (''substituts'').\n\n===Supreme Court bar===\n[[Barristers]] (''avocats''), though not technically officers of the Court, play an integral role in the justice system. Except for a few types of actions, advocate counsel in the form of a barrister is mandatory for any case heard at the Court or Council of State. Barristers with exclusive rights of audience and admitted to practice law in either senior court are titled ''avocat au Conseil d'\u00c9tat et \u00e0 la Cour de Cassation'', or ''avocats aux Conseils'' (\"Counsel at Senior Court\") for short. Admission to the Supreme Court bar<ref>For more (in French): [http://www.ordre-avocats-cassation.fr].</ref> is particularly difficult, requiring special training and passing a notoriously stringent examination. Once admitted, bar members can advise litigants on whether their actions are justiciable, that is, issuable and exceeding [[de minimis]] requirements\u2014an important service since the Court hears appeals only on points of law and not issues of fact. Membership is restricted to 60 total positions and is considered a public office.\n\n==Proceedings==\nThe Court's main purpose is to review lower court rulings on the grounds of legal or procedural error. As the highest court of law in France, it also has other duties.\n\n===Appeals===\nThe Court has inherent appellate jurisdiction for appeals (called ''pourvois en cassation'') from courts of appeal or, for certain types of small claims cases not appealable to appellate courts, from courts of record. The Supreme Court reviews the appeal on the record and may affirm or set aside lower court rulings; if set aside, the ruling is said to be ''cass\u00e9'' (French for \"quashed\"), hence the French name of ''Cour de cassation'', or \"Quashing Court\". The Court adjudicates by strict appeal, or appeal ''stricto sensu'', which is limited to review of the decision and of the decision-making process on a point of law, and may only allow the appeal in cases of serious error; fresh evidence is not admissible. The typical outcome of a successful appeal is setting aside of the lower court's decision and remittal for reconsideration.\n\nAn intermediate [[appellate court]], the [[Court of Appeal (France)|Cour d'appel]], hears general appeals ''de novo'' on points of law and procedure as well as errors of fact and reasoning. The Court of Cassation only decides matters of points of law or procedure on the record, as opposed to factual errors. Lower courts may petition the Court for an [[interlocutory]] order during the proceedings on any new and complex point of law; any such order, however, is not final or conclusive.\n\n===Appeal procedure===\nA case is heard by a bench of three or five relevant divisional justices. For either civil or criminal appeals, the bench seats by three judges unless the Chief Justice or the divisional presiding justice orders a Full Bench of five judges. Furthermore, any one of the three judges originally assigned to the Bench may order it expanded to five. If the case falls in the legal areas handled by more than one division, the Chief Justice may order the Divisional Court, rather than a Bench, to consider the case.\n\nThe Court can affirm a decision from below by dismissing the appeal (''rejet du pourvoi'') or overturn or amend the decision by allowing the appeal (''accueil du pourvoi'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionnaire-juridique.com/definition/pourvoi.php|title=D\u00e9finition de Pourvoi|work=Dictionnaire du droit priv\u00e9|author=Serge Braudo}}</ref> If it finds that the lower court erred, it sets aside the lower court decision and remits the case with its opinion to an appellate court for reconsideration (''cassation avec renvoi''). If only a portion of a ruling is overturned, it is called ''cassation partielle'', or partial setting aside. Sometimes, the Court may overturn a lower court ruling and judge the case ''ex proprio motu'' without being petitioned (''cassation sans renvoi''), as long as the merits and facts of the case are on record.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nWhen overturned, the case is remanded to a second appellate court, in other words not the appellate court whose decision is being appealed; never to the same judges. The decision of the Bench of the Court of Cassation or Divisional Court is not binding on the lower court, and the appellate court has full discretion to decide the case, but the higher court's ruling has persuasive authority. The appellate court's ruling may again be appealed to the Court of Cassation. If so, the Full Court hears and judges the case. It may, again, uphold an earlier decision or reverse it and remand the case to another appellate court. In the latter case, the determination of the Full Court is binding; the facts, however, may be reviewed by the court retrying the case.\n\nPublished judgments are extremely brief, containing a statement of the case\u2014citing relevant statutory authorities\u2014and a summary of ruling. The ruling does not contain a [[ratio decidendi]] in the style of [[common law|common-law]] jurisdictions.<ref>The ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', which largely lays out judicial interpretation of law, is important for common-law jurisdictions because rulings are determined largely through case law whereas in civil law countries like France, procedurally speaking, courts are formally forbidden to interpret law and do not rule based on case law.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}</ref><ref>[[Serge Guinchard]], C\u00e9cile Chainais, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ferrand, ''Civil procedure'', Paris, Dalloz editor, 30th edition, 2010.</ref> Instead, it is left to legal experts to explain the importance of rulings. The Court often drastically changes the way the [[Civil Code]] or other statutory laws are interpreted. Legal digests, such as the ''[[Recueil Dalloz]]'', and treatises written by legal scholars analyze and explain rulings through precedents. Much of this information is available through online databases.\n\nUnlike common-law jurisdictions, there is no doctrine of binding precedent ([[stare decisis]]) in France. Therefore, previous decisions of higher courts do not bind lower courts in the same hierarchy, though they are often followed and have persuasive authority. Instead, the French legal system subscribes to the legal doctrine of ''[[jurisprudence constante]]'' according to which courts should follow a series of decisions that are in accord with each other and judges should rule on their own interpretation of the law.\n\n====Criminal appeals====\nMajor [[felony|felonies]] ([[indictable offence]]s), called ''crimes'' in French, are tried by jury in a [[Departments of France|county]] [[Cour d'assises|Court of Assizes]]. In the past, their decisions were not open to appeal in an intermediate appellate court, and before 2001, could only be appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court would review the case on points of procedure and law only, and when handing down a reversal, which was uncommon except for capital punishment cases, vested a second [[Cour d'assises|Court of Assizes]] to retry the case. An argument in favor of this system was that allowing appeals to be tried by active judges after having been decided by a jury would in essence deny [[popular sovereignty]]. Since 2001, Assize court rulings may be appealed on points of fact to a Court of Assizes in another county, vested by the Court, and before a larger jury. The case is then fully retried. For procedural issues, appeals to the Supreme Court are still possible since assize courts, which operate by jury trial, would not be competent to hear them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n====Certified questions====\nWhere no appeal has been made but the government disagrees with the lower court's interpretation of the law, it may order the Chief Prosecutor to \"lay an appeal before the Court in the interest of law\" (''former un pourvoi dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la loi''), i.e., appeal to [[Certified question|certify a question]] of general public importance. The Chief Prosecutor may do so ''[[sua sponte]]'' or at the Court's behest in either civil or criminal cases. The Court will then issue an [[advisory opinion]] which has no bearing on the lower court's ruling since it was satisfactory to all parties involved and no motion was made to appeal. If the government is dissatisfied with the law as stated by the courts, it may ask Parliament to rewrite the law, as long as no constitutional issue is involved.\n\n===Other duties===\nThe Court publishes an annual report on the French court system. The report includes a section with suggested changes to laws concerning the legal system, including [[criminal procedure]]. The Court awards [[damages]] to defendants exonerated after [[incarceration]]. Some high-level members of the court are [[ex officio]] members of special ad hoc courts; the investigatory commission of the High Court of Justice (''Haute Cour de Justice''), which may be convened to try the [[President of France|French President]] for [[high treason]]; the [[Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique|French Court of Justice]] (''Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique''), which may be convened to try current or former cabinet [[Minister (government)|ministers]] for crimes committed while in office; and the National Judicial Council (''Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de la magistrature''), which serves as a court of judicial discipline and disciplinary counsel. The High Court of Justice has never been convened during the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] and the French Court of Justice, only rarely.\n\n==Other related courts==\nThe Court is not the only court of last resort in France. Cases involving claims against government bodies, local authorities, or the central government, including all [[delegated legislation]] (e.g., [[statutory instrument]]s, ministerial orders), are heard by the administrative courts, for which the court of last resort is the [[Conseil d'\u00c9tat (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]]. In cases where there appears to be concurrent jurisdiction or a conflict of laws between the judicial and administrative courts, whether both retain jurisdiction (\"positive dispute\") or decline jurisdiction (\"negative dispute\"), the Jurisdictional Disputes Court (''Tribunal des Conflits'') decides the issue. The Court is composed of 4 members from both senior courts and occasionally, to break a tie, the justice minister who, if present, presides.\n\nNeither court has the [[judicial review|power]] to strike down [[primary legislation]] such as acts of Parliament). The courts can, however, refuse to apply any statutory provision they consider inconsistent with France's international [[treaty]] obligations. Constitutional review lies in the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which can strike down any law that it deems [[Constitution of France|unconstitutional]]. Before a law is enacted, the [[President of France|French President]], the speaker of either house of Parliament, or, more commonly, 60 parliamentarians from the same house may petition the Council for review. Some laws, mostly constitutional laws (''loi organique''), come before the Constitutional Council for review without first being petitioned. Courts may adopt a restrictive approach to applying statute. A 2009 reform, effective on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial to question the constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as ''question prioritaire de constitutionnalit\u00e9'', is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, it is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, Cour de Cassation for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law is unconstitutional, the law is struck down and no longer has legal force; this decision applies to everybody and not just the appelant in the case at hand.<ref>http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/en_ordinance_58_1067.pdf</ref>\n\nThe [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has jurisdiction over claims of government violations in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in any ECHR member country, which includes all [[European Union|EU]] member countries. Before the ECtHR grants appeal, a claimant must have exhausted all available judicial recourse in the violating country; in France this means following the appeals process to either of the senior courts. Even so, the ECtHR has [[original jurisdiction]], not [[appellate jurisdiction]].\n\nAdditionally, French courts may petition the [[European Court of Justice]] to  [[European Court of Justice#References for a preliminary ruling|certify]] a question of law concerning [[European Union|EU]] law.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Judiciary of France|Jurisdictional organization (France)]]\n* [[Private law]]\n* [[Law in France]]\n* [[Labor Court (France)]]\n* ''[[Cour d'assises]]'' in modern law exists only in the French judiciary and other [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, i.e. \n** [[Corte d'Assise]] Italian Cour d'assises\n** [[Court of assizes (Belgium)|Belgian Cour d'assises]]\n** it may also refer to obsolete courts in a number of common law jurisdictions, for example: \n*** [[Assizes]]\n*** [[Assizes (Ireland)]]\n** or royal writs, for example:\n*** [[Assize of Clarendon]]\n*** [[Assize of Northampton]] \n* [[Court of Appeal (France)]] - Court of Appeal in France.

{"title_page": "Big bath", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}\n{{Accounting|February 2007}}\n'''Big Bath''' in [[accounting]] is an earnings management technique whereby a [[one-time charge]] is taken against income in order to reduce [[asset]]s, which results in lower expenses in the future.<ref name=\"account\">{{cite book|author1=Loren A. Nikolai|author2=John D. Bazley|author3=Jefferson P. Jones|title=Intermediate Accounting |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ouCLUeCvKwC&pg=PA513|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-324-65913-X|pages=513}}</ref> The write-off removes or reduces the asset from the financial books and results in lower [[net income]] for that year. The objective is to \u2018take one big bath\u2019 in a single year so future years will show increased net income.\n\nThis technique is often employed in a year when sales are down from other external factors and the company would report a loss in any event. For example, [[inventory]] valued on the books at $100 per item is written down to $50 per item resulting in a net loss of $50 per item in the current year. Note there is no cash impact to this write-down. When that same inventory is sold in later years for $75 per item, the company reports an income of $25 per item in the future period.  This process takes an inventory loss and turns it into a \u2018profit\u2019.  Corporations will often wait until a bad year to employ this \u2018big bath\u2019 technique to \u2018clean up\u2019 the balance sheet. Although the process is discouraged by [[auditor]]s, it is still used. In recent times, General Motors and other US Corporations have taken huge write downs on balance sheet assets resulting in massive losses. The same result can be achieved by recording in one year the future cash costs of expected plant closing or employee layoffs. The objective is to take these losses all at once, so future periods can show positive net income.\n\n== Incentives ==\nThe incentives behind this earnings management technique varies. A widespread belief of why companies utilize this technique is to improve external reputation and appeal to investors and creditors. In most large corporations, managers are in charge of financial reporting. This gives managers the incentive of bias reporting to increase the reputation of their company and to attribute those gains to their own ability.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nieken|first1=Petra|last2=Sliwka|first2=Dirk|title=Management changes, reputation, and \"big bath\"-earnings management|journal=Journal of Economics & Management Strategy|date=September 2015|volume=24|issue=3|pages=501\u2013522|doi=10.1111/jems.12101}}</ref> Other possible reasons why some managers have the incentive to tamper with their company financial reporting is for higher salary and recognition of their abilities to increase profit. \nIt is often believed that earning management activities are common before and after management changes.

Nikolai|author2=John D. Bazley|author3=Jefferson P. Jones|title=Intermediate Accounting |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ouCLUeCvKwC&pg=PA513|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-324-65913-X|pages=513}}</ref> The write-off removes or reduces the asset from the financial books and results in lower [[net income]] for that year. The objective is to \u2018take one big bath\u2019 in a single year so future years will show increased net income.\n\nThis technique is often employed in a year when sales are down from other external factors and the company would report a loss in any event. For example, [[inventory]] valued on the books at $100 per item is written down to $50 per item resulting in a net loss of $50 per item in the current year. Note there is no cash impact to this write-down. When that same inventory is sold in later years for $75 per item, the company reports an income of $25 per item in the future period.  This process takes an inventory loss and turns it into a \u2018profit\u2019.  Corporations will often wait until a bad year to employ this \u2018big bath\u2019 technique to \u2018clean up\u2019 the balance sheet. Although the process is discouraged by [[auditor]]s, it is still used. In recent times, General Motors and other US Corporations have taken huge write downs on balance sheet assets resulting in massive losses. The same result can be achieved by recording in one year the future cash costs of expected plant closing or employee layoffs. The objective is to take these losses all at once, so future periods can show positive net income.\n\n== Incentives ==\nThe incentives behind this earnings management technique varies. A widespread belief of why companies utilize this technique is to improve external reputation and appeal to investors and creditors. In most large corporations, managers are in charge of financial reporting. This gives managers the incentive of bias reporting to increase the reputation of their company and to attribute those gains to their own ability.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nieken|first1=Petra|last2=Sliwka|first2=Dirk|title=Management changes, reputation, and \"big bath\"-earnings management|journal=Journal of Economics & Management Strategy|date=September 2015|volume=24|issue=3|pages=501\u2013522|doi=10.1111/jems.12101}}</ref> Other possible reasons why some managers have the incentive to tamper with their company financial reporting is for higher salary and recognition of their abilities to increase profit. \nIt is often believed that earning management activities are common before and after management changes. Thus, other incentives may possibly be led by management turnovers.\n\n== Earnings Management ==\nOften time Managers use reporting strategies regardless if the external users are naive and ignore management's ability to manipulate earnings or if users are sophisticated and can accurately deduce the management's disclosure strategy.
