Although Hawkins and Drake both escaped on their respective ships, many of the English were killed.\n\n[[Richard Hakluyt]]'s book, ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' (1598\u20131600), claims Drake and Hawkins were on a private venture, peacefully trading with the local Spanish colonists in violation of Spanish law, when the Spanish naval fleet arrived. Despite suspicion of treachery, they allowed the Spaniards to take shelter under truce, between San Juan de Ul\u00faa island, on an otherwise open coastline. The attack by the Spanish was a surprise.\n\nHistorians{{who|date=July 2019}}(those who have read John Hawkins's letters and memoranda; see also the article [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]]) know that Drake and Hawkins likely had raided Spanish settlements elsewhere on that voyage. The trade was in [[African slaves]], who had been captured and taken earlier from [[West Africa]]. On that occasion, it appears the English were in fact trading at Vera Cruz. Historians{{who|date=July 2019}}(those who have read John Hawkins's letters and memoranda; see also the article [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]]) have speculated that the Spanish colonists traded with them illegally under their threat of raids and attacks.<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/186/000101880/? Sir John Hawkins], The National Names Database, Last accessed July 17, 2008.</ref>\n\nHawkins and Drake escaped in the ships ''Minion'' and ''Judith'', and their larger ships were taken or destroyed. The attack and subsequent hardships were instrumental in hardening Drake's attitude against Spain and Catholicism. Earlier in his life, he and his family had been forced to live in poverty after they were displaced by a Catholic rebellion in England.\n\n==Post-Spanish era==\n{{See also|Bombardment of San Juan de Ul\u00faa}}\n\nAfter [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico's independence]] in 1821, a large number of Spanish troops continued to occupy San Juan de Ul\u00faa as late as 1825. It was the last site in the former New Spain to be held by Spain and was surrendered to General [[Miguel Barrag\u00e1n]] in November 1825. The Spanish forces were expelled by President [[Vicente Guerrero]] after the failed attempt at re-conquering the country.\n\nSince then, San Juan de Ul\u00faa served as a military and political symbol of Mexican resistance to foreign invasions and occupations, several of which took place during the nineteenth century. In 1836 the French invaded and occupied to put pressure on the national government; during the Mexican\u2013American War, in 1847-48 the U.S. occupied the fort and Veracruz, and in 1863 the French briefly occupied the city when installing Maximilian I as emperor. For much of the nineteenth century, the fort served as a [[prison]], especially for [[political prisoner]]s judged to be opposition to the government. Many prominent Mexican politicians spent time here while they were not in power.\n\nFinally in 1914, the last U.S. invasion, attack and occupation of the port of Veracruz took place as part of the [[Tampico Affair]], against the background of the Mexican Revolution which threatened the regional oil industry, in which Americans were heavily invested. The national legislature awarded the port and city of Veracruz the title of ''Heroic'' for the fourth time following this incident.\n\nA portion of San Juan de Ul\u00faa also served several times as the [[presidential palace]], housing presidents such as [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. The citadel was also used as a prison, especially during the early 20th-century regime of President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]. It is popularly said that in order to prevent prisoners from escaping, [[sharks]] were put into the waters surrounding the island, so that they would kill anyone attempting to escape.\n\n==Modern times==\nThe fortress complex was ultimately closed when it was no longer needed for sea defense. After several years of decay, renovations were begun on the complex in the late 20th century. Some projects are continuing.\n\nSan Juan de Ul\u00faa has been preserved and adapted as a museum. The prisons and the fortresses are all open to the public, with the exception of the former presidential palace, which suffered severe decay and is still undergoing renovations. The complex is a very popular tourist attraction.\n\nSan Juan de Ul\u00faa was used to depict the fortress in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], in the climax of the 1984 film ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[San Carlos Fortress]]\n*[[Military of New Spain]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|San Juan de Ulua Fort, Veracruz}}\n*[http://www.sanjuandeulua.com.mx Official San Juan de Ulua website]\n\n{{coord|19|12|33|N|96|07|53|W|region:MX_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}{{Castles in Mexico}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:San Juan De Ulua}}\n[[Category:Forts in Mexico]]\n[[Category:History museums in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Museums in Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Prison museums in North America]]\n[[Category:Defunct prisons in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Veracruz (city)]]\n[[Category:Gulf Coast of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Military history of Mexico]]\n[[Category:1565 establishments in New Spain]]\n[[Category:1560s establishments in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Castles in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Spanish colonial fortifications in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1769]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:San juan ulua1.JPG|thumb|San Juan de Ul\u00faa]]\n[[File:Plan du fort de Saint Jean d'Ulloa et vue panoramique 1838.jpg|thumb|Plan and panoramic view of the fort in 1838 from French map during the war between France and Mexico]]\n\n'''San Juan de Ul\u00faa''', also known as '''Castle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa''', is a large complex of [[fortresses]], prisons and one former palace on an island of the same name in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] overlooking the [[seaport]] of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], Mexico.

The attack by the Spanish was a surprise.\n\nHistorians{{who|date=July 2019}}(those who have read John Hawkins's letters and memoranda) know that Drake and Hawkins likely had raided Spanish settlements elsewhere on that voyage. The trade was in [[African slaves]], who had been captured and taken earlier from [[West Africa]]. On that occasion, it appears the English were in fact trading at Vera Cruz. Historians{{who|date=July 2019}}(those who have read John Hawkins's letters and memoranda) have speculated that the Spanish colonists traded with them illegally under their threat of raids and attacks.<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/186/000101880/? Sir John Hawkins], The National Names Database, Last accessed July 17, 2008.</ref>\n\nHawkins and Drake escaped in the ships ''Minion'' and ''Judith'', and their larger ships were taken or destroyed. The attack and subsequent hardships were instrumental in hardening Drake's attitude against Spain and Catholicism. Earlier in his life, he and his family had been forced to live in poverty after they were displaced by a Catholic rebellion in England.\n\n==Post-Spanish era==\n{{See also|Bombardment of San Juan de Ul\u00faa}}\n\nAfter [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico's independence]] in 1821, a large number of Spanish troops continued to occupy San Juan de Ul\u00faa as late as 1825. It was the last site in the former New Spain to be held by Spain and was surrendered to General [[Miguel Barrag\u00e1n]] in November 1825. The Spanish forces were expelled by President [[Vicente Guerrero]] after the failed attempt at re-conquering the country.\n\nSince then, San Juan de Ul\u00faa served as a military and political symbol of Mexican resistance to foreign invasions and occupations, several of which took place during the nineteenth century. In 1836 the French invaded and occupied to put pressure on the national government; during the Mexican\u2013American War, in 1847-48 the U.S. occupied the fort and Veracruz, and in 1863 the French briefly occupied the city when installing Maximilian I as emperor. For much of the nineteenth century, the fort served as a [[prison]], especially for [[political prisoner]]s judged to be opposition to the government. Many prominent Mexican politicians spent time here while they were not in power.\n\nFinally in 1914, the last U.S. invasion, attack and occupation of the port of Veracruz took place as part of the [[Tampico Affair]], against the background of the Mexican Revolution which threatened the regional oil industry, in which Americans were heavily invested. The national legislature awarded the port and city of Veracruz the title of ''Heroic'' for the fourth time following this incident.\n\nA portion of San Juan de Ul\u00faa also served several times as the [[presidential palace]], housing presidents such as [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. The citadel was also used as a prison, especially during the early 20th-century regime of President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]. It is popularly said that in order to prevent prisoners from escaping, [[sharks]] were put into the waters surrounding the island, so that they would kill anyone attempting to escape.\n\n==Modern times==\nThe fortress complex was ultimately closed when it was no longer needed for sea defense. After several years of decay, renovations were begun on the complex in the late 20th century. Some projects are continuing.\n\nSan Juan de Ul\u00faa has been preserved and adapted as a museum. The prisons and the fortresses are all open to the public, with the exception of the former presidential palace, which suffered severe decay and is still undergoing renovations. The complex is a very popular tourist attraction.\n\nSan Juan de Ul\u00faa was used to depict the fortress in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], in the climax of the 1984 film ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[San Carlos Fortress]]\n*[[Military of New Spain]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|San Juan de Ulua Fort, Veracruz}}\n*[http://www.sanjuandeulua.com.mx Official San Juan de Ulua website]\n\n{{coord|19|12|33|N|96|07|53|W|region:MX_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}{{Castles in Mexico}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:San Juan De Ulua}}\n[[Category:Forts in Mexico]]\n[[Category:History museums in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Museums in Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Prison museums in North America]]\n[[Category:Defunct prisons in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Veracruz (city)]]\n[[Category:Gulf Coast of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Military history of Mexico]]\n[[Category:1565 establishments in New Spain]]\n[[Category:1560s establishments in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Castles in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Spanish colonial fortifications in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1769]]\n", "name_user": "Johnbtarrphd", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_de_Ul%C3%BAa"}

Research of the artifact, in addition to providing new technologies for humanity, led to the discovery that [[Pluto]]'s moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] was really a \"mass relay\", an alien construct that is capable of transporting any ships [[faster than light]] to a nearby mass relay on the galactic scale. The mass relays work by creating a \"mass effect\", the production of [[dark energy]] from a reaction with Element Zero to slingshot spacecraft to the next relay; Element Zero is found to also react with biological entities to give them \"biotics\", limited powers that evoke the mass effect on a much smaller scale.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /><ref name=\"kotaku lore\" />\n\nOn Earth, the Systems Alliance was formed to safeguard's humanity as it expanded to new colonies through the mass relay.<ref name=\"polygon lore\">{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/mass-effect-andromeda-guide-walkthrough/2017/3/21/14311292/mass-effect-lore-story-beginners-guide-explainer-recap |title=The lore of Mass Effect: A complete guide |first=Susano |last=Polo |date=March 21, 2017 |accessdate=October 5, 2017 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> Roughly ten years later, humanity made its first contact with one of the alien races, the Turians, which erupted into the First Contact War. Though casualties were small on both sides, the war was interrupted by the Citadel Council, members of three races that oversaw peacekeeping in the galaxy. Humanity was then welcomed into the collective community of extraterrestrial species, and learn that the artifacts, mass relays, and the giant station that serves as the seat of power in the galaxy, the Citadel, are all that remains of the Protheans, believed to be the pre-eminent civilization in the Milky Way galaxy but have since disappeared tens of thousands of years ago.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /> The Citadel Council welcomes humanity into the Citadel community, providing them with a Systems Alliance embassy and allowing individual members to join C-Sec, the Citadel Security forces, despite other races having waited for such a privilege for some time. As the newest race to join the Citadel community, humanity tends to be underestimated or looked down upon, but the Citadel Council soon invites a human to join the Spectres, elite enforcers that use both espionage and force to complete their assignments. On Earth, there is concern about how humanity is treated by these other species, and [[Anthropocentrism|pro-human]] groups advocating for a humanity-first supremacist agenda begin to appear.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" />\n\nThe three species that make up the Council include the asari, a [[femininity|feminine]] mono-gendered species who favor diplomacy, biotic abilities and [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics over raw military power; the salarians, an amphibious species who have an aptitude for technological research, espionage and [[unconventional warfare]]; and the turians, a proud avian-like species known for their disciplined culture and military capability. Besides humanity, the associate races on the Citadel include the volus, a client race of the turians who mostly make their influence felt through trade and commerce to compensate for their small and fragile suit-covered bodies; the hanar, an overly polite and philosophically inclined race of jellyfish-like entities who worship the Protheans as their progenitors with religious fervor; the reptilian drell, who loyally serve the hanar as part of a symbiotic relationship which they call the Compact; and the elcor, a species of hulking elephantine quadrupeds who preface everything they say with the intended emotion due to their lack of vocal inflection and discernible facial expressions.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /><ref name=\"kotaku lore\" /> \n\nOther species include the krogan, a hardy and warlike reptilian race in decline due to the Genophage, a [[terraforming]] [[retrovirus|viral-weapon]] designed to [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilize]] the krogan species and their homeworld Tuchanka; the batarians, an isolationist four-eyed species infamous for piracy and other disreputable activities; and the quarians, nomads who were forced to flee their homeworld Rannoch when their development of [[Swarm robotic platforms|advanced networked]] [[artificial intelligence]] created the geth, who warred with their creators.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /> Due to this, the rest of the species in Citadel-controlled space limit their reliance on artificial intelligence, using \"virtual intelligence\" (VI) that lack self-awareness.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" />\n\n===''Mass Effect'' Trilogy===\nThe original ''Mass Effect'' trilogy takes place in the 22nd century. Over the course of the trilogy, membership of the Citadel Council is expanded to include a human representative, and the galactic community come to learn that the Protheans were mostly wiped out over 50,000 years prior by the Reapers, sentient starships that normally occupy the void between the Milky Way and the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], but appear every 50,000 years with the sole purpose of wiping out emergent organic species as well as any evidence of their own existence. Unlike their predecessors in previous cycles, the Protheans had learned of the Reapers and prepared for their arrival, though they were unable to prevent their own extermination by the Reapers. Their preparations survive into the next cycle, in the form of the Crucible.<ref name=\"PCGamer lore\"/> The ''Mass Effect'' series starts as the nascent appearances of the Reapers in this cycle have occurred, beginning with the indoctrination of a rogue turian Spectre, an influential asari Matriarch, and a \"heretic\" faction of geth who broke away from the true Geth Consensus to further their plans of return.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /> \n\nThe Collectors, a strange four-eyed insectoid race, began abducting entire human colonies by the events of ''Mass Effect 2''. Shepard, who had been killed in action during a surprise attack by Collector forces at the beginning of ''Mass Effect 2'', is reconstructed and revived by Cerberus in the year 2185, following a complex cybernetic engineering process which lasted two years. Shepard sets out to gather a team of individuals from across the galaxy for a suicide mission into the mysterious Omega Four mass relay to stop the Collectors from harvesting more human colonies.\n\nImmediately after the defeat of the Collectors and the destruction of the incomplete Proto-Reaper they were constructing,<ref>''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 89.</ref> the Reapers are shown traveling to the Milky Way galaxy from dark space at the ending of ''Mass Effect 2''. The Reaper invasion have commenced by the beginning of ''Mass Effect 3'', with the war's earliest fronts taking place in batarian and human space.<ref>''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 147.</ref> Shepard is present on Earth when the Reapers first arrived, and later escapes the human homeworld on the ''Normandy'' SR-2 in order to rally the rest of the galactic community against the Reaper threat, and find a solution that will break the Reaper-imposed cycle of harvesting organic species forever.\n\n===''Mass Effect: Andromeda''===\nThe fourth ''Mass Effect'' game is set in the same universe as the original trilogy, and focuses on the Andromeda Initiative. Founded in 2176, the Andromeda Initiative is a civilian multi-species project created to send scientists, explorers and colonists placed in cryosleep within massive intergalactic arkships on a one-way trip from the Milky Way Galaxy to settle in the Andromeda Galaxy. The Initiative's main objective is to establish a permanent presence in the Heleus Cluster, a seemingly resource-rich frontier of Andromeda, and eventually create a reliable route between both galaxies. Alec Ryder is a Pathfinder, the title for leader of each of the arkships, and is responsible for the human-majority population aboard his ship ''Hyperion''.<ref name=\"MEA Setting\"/> ''Mass Effect: Andromeda'' introduces the angara, an emotionally expressive species who are dependent on sunlight for sustenance, and the kett, a hostile militaristic species with dense formations of bone growing externally as armor protrusions on their bodies.<ref name=\"PCGAND\"/> \n\n==Player characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align        = right\n| direction    = vertical\n| image1       = Mass Effect characters.png\n| width1       = 350\n| image2       = FemShepandCo.jpg\n| width2       = 350\n| footer       = Two posters illustrating some of the major characters of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy, which are nearly identical except for the player character's gender.

EDI assists in doing so, and in the process, struggled with the synthetic entity, and seizes control of its platform in the process, allowing her to accompany Shepard as a squad mate on missions. Now possessing a physical body and with her sentience and humanlike characteristics, her relationship with [[#Jeff \"Joker Moreau\"|Joker]] develops further, and, if Shepard supports the idea, the two may start a romantic relationship.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> She also will converse with Shepard several times, asking them about human behaviors so that she can better understand human psychology and, in a sense, become more human herself. If Shepard chooses to control the Reapers or the synthesis of all organic and synthetic life, EDI will be present in the ending cutscene.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> \n\nEDI is voiced by [[Tricia Helfer]].\n\n''PC Gamer'' commented that EDI \"might have had some fine dialogue and ruminations on what it means to be human\", ranking her the 10th best ''Mass Effect'' companion.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> EDI is also included in ''PC Gamer's'' definitive list of the best squad mates around, citing her utility as a solid fighter and being an actual spaceship.<ref name=\"RPGDream\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-rpg-dream-team|date=June 9, 2017 |title=The RPG dream teams|website=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref> On the other hand, Wes Fenlon indicated in his articles written for ''PC Gamer'' and ''Gamesradar'' that he was disturbed by BioWare's decision to give EDI a sexy robot body, and involving the character in a romance subplot with Joker.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/><ref name=Unsexy>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-uncomfortably-sexy-video-game-ai/|title=The Top 7 Uncomfortably sexy video game AI characters|date=February 10, 2014|work=Gamesradar |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> \n\n==== Mordin Solus ====\n{{Main|Mordin Solus}}\nMordin Solus is a salarian scientist, brilliant yet also a competent soldier due to his membership in the salarian Special Tasks Group earlier in his life, Mordin Solus possesses a hyperactive and [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] personality, a rapid and stilted manner of speaking, and (as with all salarians) a flawless [[autobiographical memory|autobiographical]] and [[eidetic memory]]. He was a key member in the science team that researched the remodification of the Krogan Genophage, an action that he feels guilty about but considers the best possible solution to a once growing problem. Mordin believes in acting in the best interests of the galaxy; his scientific work is governed by strong moral standards and unquestionable respect for all forms of life.\n\nThe character returns in ''Mass Effect 3'', providing he survived the suicide mission in the previous game. After defeating the Collectors, Mordin returned to STG as a special consultant, whilst also working as an inside source for Clan Urdnot. If Maelon's research data was saved, he uses it to aid in the treatment of the surviving female krogan codenamed Eve, the only survivor of his student's experiments. He is encountered on the salarian homeworld, Sur'Kesh, when Shepard is sent there to aid in the evacuation of the female.\n\nMordin Solus is voiced by Michael Beattie in ''Mass Effect 2'', and by [[William Salyers]] in ''Mass Effect 3''.\n\nMordin has received a positive reception, receiving nominations for three \"Best New Character\" awards, and placing high in numerous ''Mass Effect'' character lists.\n\n==== Jack ====\n{{Main|Jack (Mass Effect)}}\nJack, also known \"Subject Zero\", is the powerful product of unethical Cerberus experiments to enhance human biotic ability, which molded her antisocial and psychopathic temperament. Shepard may recruit Jack from the prison facility that she is confined in to join the suicide mission against the Collectors, in exchange for files aboard the ''Normandy'' about the science facility where Cerberus scientists tortured and abused her.<ref name=PCGamer/> She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard in ''Mass Effect 2''. Jack will reappear in ''Mass Effect 3'' if a save game is imported where she survives the events of the suicide mission, with the option to continue their relationship from ''2'' if she was Shepard's paramour. \n\nJack is voiced by [[Courtenay Taylor]].\n\n====Grunt====\nGrunt is a tank-bred genetically engineered super-krogan that can be recruited as a squad member.<ref name=\"kotaku lore\" /> Grunt's design is intended to be youthful but also tough, invoking the look of a [[linebacker]] with large shoulder pads and exposed muscular arms.<ref name=\"art 70\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 70.</ref> Compared to [[#Urdnot_Wrex|Wrex]] who is a much older krogan, Grunt's crest is smaller and does not fully cover his entire skull due to his age.<ref name=\"art 70\"/>  Early designs for Grunt's armor varied widely, which eventually settled into a polished and sleek look, almost like a \"show-room finish\" on a brand new car.<ref name=\"art 70\"/>\n\nInitially in ''Mass Effect 2'', Shepard is meant to recruit Okeer, a krogan warlord and radical scientist who has been developing a small army of krogan to weather the Genophage. When Shepard arrives to recruit him, Okeer is working for the Blue Suns mercenary group, but was betrayed by the latter. Though Shepard and crew defeat the Blue Suns leader, it is too late to save Okeer, who leaves Shepard with a tank containing his \"legacy\", his \"perfect krogan\". If and when Shepard decides to awaken him, the krogan recalls Okeer's last words and chooses one of them, \"grunt\", as his name. While initially hostile towards Shepard, Grunt may be recruited as a squad mate for Shepard. If the player imports a save game where Grunt survives the suicide mission in ''2'', he appears in ''Mass Effect 3'' in a small role.\n\nGrunt is voiced by [[Steve Blum]].\n\nGrunt showing Shepard his strength in ''Mass Effect 2'' is considered to be one of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy's most iconic moments by ''Kotaku's'' Gergo Vas.<ref name=\"Iconic\">{{Cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/the-most-iconic-moments-of-the-mass-effect-trilogy-471605422|title=The Most Iconic Moments of the Mass Effect Trilogy|author=Gergo Vas |date=April 13, 2019 |accessdate=April 4, 2020 |work=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref>''PC Gamer'' staff noted that while there is not much to the character \"beyond punching things and talking about fighting\", dealing with Grunt could be a \"refreshing change from the philosophizing and soul-searching of the rest of the crew.\"<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> \n\n====Thane Krios====\n{{Main|Thane Krios}}\nThane is a mysterious drell assassin who is terminally ill from a disease known as Kepral's Syndrome, which is exclusive to drell due to their physiology.<ref name=\"kotaku lore\" /> While a coldblooded killer, Thane possesses a conscience that struggles against his own profession.<ref name=PCGamer/> Shepard may recruit him on the asari-dominated world of Ilium for the suicide mission in ''Mass Effect 2''. At the time of his recruitment, Thane states he has nothing left to lose, and he hopes to right many wrongs he has found in the galaxy before his death.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Thane Krios is a possible romantic interest for a female Shepard. \n\nThane returns in ''Mass Effect 3'' provided he survived the suicide mission in ''Mass Effect 2''. Thane may play a role in the narrative depending on the player's prior decisions, but will ultimately succumb to his wounds from Kai Leng if he plays a role in preventing the assassination of a Citadel councilor,<ref name=\"Thirteen\"/> or to Kepral's Syndrome.<ref name=\"Deaths\">{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/25/mass-effect-3-deaths/ |title=Mass Effect 3: Character deaths |author=Sebastian Haley |date=March 25, 2012 |work=VentureBeat |accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThane Krios is voiced by [[Keythe Farley]].\n\n====Samara====\nA nearly thousand-year-old Asari Justicar, Samara is a member of a highly respected and feared ascetic order of mystic warriors. She is noted by BioWare staff as one of the most difficult characters to nail down design-wise; a trial-and-error approach was used where the character artists would try to get as many rough ideas and sketches onto a page as possible to figure out what makes Samara iconic and stand out as a character, and the final design would be polished until the team has reached a consensus.<ref name=\"art 81\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 81.</ref> Variations for her head accessory have been considered, including religious headgear and regal-looking crown-like adornments.<ref name=\"art 80\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 80.</ref> For airless or toxic environments, the team decided to go with a small breather device to allow for more facial expression after various designs were considered.<ref name=\"art 81\"/> Samara's revealing clothing in her final design indicates that her primary method of defense is her uniform's \"near-invisible kinetic-barrier technology\".<ref name=\"art 80\"/>\n\nSamara is on a quest to track down her fugitive daughter Morinth; if Shepard chooses to participate in her quest, they will have to make the decision between Samara dying or killing Morinth.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Shepard meets Samara on Illium, where she is found investigating the Eclipse mercenary group who smuggled her daughter off-world. Samara will join Shepard for the suicide mission at the conclusion of the investigation.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Shepard will acknowledge Shepard if flirted with, though she will not reciprocate. If the player imports a save game where Samara survives the events of ''Mass Effect 2'', she returns in a small role in ''Mass Effect 3''. In ''Mass Effect 3'' he attempts to fulfill her oath by executing her only living daughter, who is also Ardat-Yakshi like Morinth and forbidden from leaving an asari monastery, and if she fails to do so she may attempt to commit suicide.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/>  \n\nSamara is voiced by Maggie Baird. Her face was modeled after Rana McAnear.<ref name=\"Rana\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rana_mary?lang=en|title=Rana McAnear on Twitter|work=Twitter}}</ref> \n\nEvan Lahti of ''PC Gamer'' called her \"Judge Dredd with a serial killer daughter\" who makes ''Mass Effect'' more interesting with her extremist stances. She is noted as the only character who deals with moral absolutes in the ''Mass Effect'' series, due to her strictly rigid adherence to the Justicar Code, and is one of ''Mass Effect's'' most tragic characters in the Shakespearean manner<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> \n\n====Morinth====\nMorinth is the fugitive daughter of Samara. She is an Ardat-Yakshi, asari who are born with an inherited trait which kills their mates during sexual encounters by burning out their nervous systems. Morinth joins Shepard if she is assisted with trapping Samara so that Morinth can execute her.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> She will then disguise herself as her mother and takes her place in Shepard's plans squad, so that only Shepard knows of Samara's death. Shepard may choose to mate with Morinth, although it will result in his or her death.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> If the player imports a save game where Morinth is recruited and survives the events of ''Mass Effect 2'', she will appear in ''Mass Effect'' as an indoctrinated husk-like enemy type known as a banshee. \n\nMorinth is voiced by [[Natalia Cigliuti]]. Her face was modeled after Rana McAnear.<ref name=\"Rana\"/>\n\n''PC Gamer'' staff considers Morinth to be a poor replacement for her mother, \"the more interesting and conflicted justicar\". She is rated better as an antagonist instead, the \"cat-and-mouse game of catching Morinth\" being lauded as one of ''Mass Effect 2's'' most exciting moments.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Andr\u00e1s Neltz from ''Kotaku'' commented that \"the sheer audacity of a scam this huge\u2014setting out to recruit a virtuous Asari Justicar, and coming back with her black widow of a daughter instead, passing her off as the real thing\u2014is truly amazing.\"<ref name=\"Characters\"/>\n\n==== Legion ====\n{{Main|Legion (Mass Effect)}}\nLegion is the name given to the gestalt consciousness hosted within a geth mobile unit eleven times more powerful than standard geth mobile platforms. Legion belongs to the true Geth Consensus, and is designed to operate outside of geth space and interact diplomatically with organic lifeforms. The name is given by EDI based on the \"''[[Gospel of Mark]] 5:9 \u2013 [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac]]''\". Legion investigates the worlds Shepard have visited in the first game, eventually locating the SSV ''Normandy's'' wreckage on the planet Alchera and learns of Shepard's death. Legion is a skilled [[security hacker]] and [[marksman]], generally preferring long-range combat. In contrast to other Geth, Legion is capable of independent thought and demonstrates emotional attachment, and is particularly fascinated with Shepard.\n\nLegion is voiced by [[D. C. Douglas]].\n\n==== Zaeed Massani ====\nZaeed is a human bounty hunter who is available through the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Zaeed - The Price of Revenge''. He holds the reputation as the galaxy's most feared bounty hunter and co-founder of the Blue Suns mercenary group. Zaeed had a mechanic leg and a dog companion during early concept stages.<ref name=\"art 82\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 82.</ref> Head models for the character went through various iterations, which included scarring, tattoos with the Blue Suns insignia, and potential breathers inspired by hocket masks and welding helmets for intimidation purposes.<ref name=\"art 82\"/> He joins Shepherd for the suicide mission if recruited, and asks that Shepard help him deal with the mercenary group he co-founded as a favour. If the player imports a save game where Zaeed survives the events of ''2'', Zaeed returns in ''Mass Effect 3'' with a small role. \n\nZaeed is voiced by Robin Sachs. \n\n''PC Gamer'' staff member Wes complained about Zaeed's characterization and his ineffectiveness as a squad mate, calling him a \"less interesting retread of [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|KotOR's Mandalorian Canderous Ordo]]\".<ref name=PCGamer/>\n\n==== Kasumi Goto ====\nKasumi is a master thief who is made available through the DLC, ''[[Mass Effect 2: Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory]]''. Kasumi's concepts drew inspiration from Middle Eastern culture; her outfit echoes that of a typical thief from the European [[Middle Ages]], the hood in particular gives her a mysterious and stealthy look.<ref>''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 83.</ref> She joins Shepherd for the suicide mission in ''Mass Effect 2'' and requests his help in retrieving the memory box of her lover.  Kasumi returns in ''Mass Effect 3'' with a small role, provided a save game is imported where her eponymous DLC was played and she survives the suicide mission.\n \nKasumi Goto is voiced by Kim Hoy.\n\n''PC Gamer'' staff member Samuel called Kasumi one of more visually interesting ''Mass Effect'' squad mates, and praised ''Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory'' as his favorite ''Mass Effect'' series DLC.<ref name=PCGamer/> IGN's Steven Hopper ranked Kasumi #9 in his list of best ''Mass Effect'' teammates.<ref name=\"10 Teammates\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/01/05/10-best-mass-effect-teammates |title=10 Best Mass Effect Teammates |last=Hopper |first=Steven |date=January 5, 2012 |work=IGN |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====James Vega====\nLieutenant James Vega is a human Systems Alliance Marine and Shepard's squad member in ''Mass Effect 3''. The basic concept behind Vega is a heavily muscled tank of a man who happens to be a blue collar military officer, and his armor is given a lot of heft to imply that he is \"an unstoppable force\". His rugged look with tattoos, scars and a beard help distinguish him from the clean-cut Alliance characters.<ref>''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 130.</ref> The character was known early in ''Mass Effect 3's'' development as \"James Sanders\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-18-new-mass-effect-3-team-mate-james-vega#comments|title=New Mass Effect 3 team-mate James Vega, formerly known as James Sanders|work=Eurogamer |date= July 18, 2011|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref> Sanders is revealed to be the character's birth surname in the first issue of the comic series, ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''. In ''Mass Effect 3'' James Vega was tasked to escort Shepard to an Alliance defense committee hearing, however the hearing is interrupted when the Reapers attack Earth. Vega and Ashley or Kaidan, depending on who survived Virmire, retrieve the ''Normandy'' SR-2 and pick Shepard up from Earth.\n\nJames Vega is the main focus of the ''Mass Effect'' anime movie, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. Early in his career, Vega was stationed on the remote colony of Fehl Prime with Delta Squad, an Alliance special forces unit. When the Collectors attack, determined to capture the population, Vega and his squad were tasked with protecting the civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://masseffectparagonlost.com/ |title=Mass Effect: Paragon Lost |work=Masseffectparagonlost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> \n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/03/28/mass-effect-paragon-lost-anime-video |title='Mass Effect: Paragon Lost' Anime Gets a Name, More Art (Video) |work=Comics Alliance |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2013-10-14 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228014904/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/03/28/mass-effect-paragon-lost-anime-video/ |archivedate=2013-02-28 |df= }}</ref>\n\nJames Vega is voiced by actor [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] in ''Mass Effect 3'' and ''Mass Effect: Paragon Lost''.\n\nWes Fenlon from ''PC Gamer'' found Vega boring as he is \"just a normal human dude\", though he did find the character likeable.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Samuel Roberts, also from ''PC Gamer'', praised Freddie Prinze Jr's performance as Vega, but does not recall enjoying his company \"aside from beating him up in the shuttle bay of the Normandy\".<ref name=\"Best and worst\"/>  \n\n====Javik====\nJavik is the [[endling]] of the Prothean race, and is only available if the ''From Ashes'' DLC is installed. The Protheans were first depicted in the form of visually ambiguous statues on the planet Ilos in the first game, as at the time BioWare was unsure as to the extent of the role the Protheans would play over the course of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.<ref name=\"art 136\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 136.</ref> Javik's final design is based on the look of the Collectors from ''Mass Effect 2'', particularly the shell shape of the head which is a signature feature of the Colletors, along with multiple pupils to the eyes and secondary nostrils to evoke a very alien feel.<ref name=\"art 138\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 138.</ref> As the Protheans of his time were known for their highly advanced technological capabilities, Javik is intended to look more intelligent then a mindless Collector drone.<ref name=\"art 136\"/> Javik's armor, which is influenced by the aesthetics of [[samurai]] armor, is intended to be technologically advanced yet with an ancient feel, thematically appropriate for a being who had been placed in stasis for over 50,000 years.<ref name=\"art 138\"/>\n\nJavik's pod is uncovered and opened by Commander Shepard and Liara T'Soni during his recruitment mission, who were investigating Cerberus activity on Eden Prime. Flashbacks of Javik's memories happen during the mission which reveals insights on the Prothean's struggle against the Reapers.

She has developed an obsessive interest in studying the Remnant, an umbrella term coined for technology, structures, and autonomous bots that have been sighted across the Heleus Cluster. She is considered to be an atypical member of asari culture, \u201cpathologically independent\u201d, and has little regard for rules or teamwork.

The Reapers reside in dark space: the vast, mostly starless space between galaxies.

The mass relays work by creating a \"mass effect\", the production of [[dark energy]] from a reaction with Element Zero to slingshot spacecraft to the next relay; Element Zero is found to also react with biological entities to give them \"biotics\", limited powers that evoke the mass effect on a much smaller scale.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /><ref name=\"kotaku lore\" />\n\nOn Earth, the Systems Alliance was formed to safeguard's humanity as it expanded to new colonies through the mass relay.<ref name=\"polygon lore\">{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/mass-effect-andromeda-guide-walkthrough/2017/3/21/14311292/mass-effect-lore-story-beginners-guide-explainer-recap |title=The lore of Mass Effect: A complete guide |first=Susano |last=Polo |date=March 21, 2017 |accessdate=October 5, 2017 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> Roughly ten years later, humanity made its first contact with one of the alien races, the Turians, which erupted into the First Contact War. Though casualties were small on both sides, the war was interrupted by the Citadel Council, members of three races that oversaw peacekeeping in the galaxy. Humanity was then welcomed into the collective community of extraterrestrial species, and learn that the artifacts, mass relays, and the giant station that serves as the seat of power in the galaxy, the Citadel, are all that remains of the Protheans, believed to be the pre-eminent civilization in the Milky Way galaxy but have since disappeared tens of thousands of years ago.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /> The Citadel Council welcomes humanity into the Citadel community, providing them with a Systems Alliance embassy and allowing individual members to join C-Sec, the Citadel Security forces, despite other races having waited for such a privilege for some time. As the newest race to join the Citadel community, humanity tends to be underestimated or looked down upon, but the Citadel Council soon invites a human to join the Spectres, elite enforcers that use both espionage and force to complete their assignments. On Earth, there is concern about how humanity is treated by these other species, and [[Anthropocentrism|pro-human]] groups advocating for a humanity-first supremacist agenda begin to appear.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" />\n\nThe three species that make up the Council include the asari, a [[femininity|feminine]] mono-gendered species who favor diplomacy, biotic abilities and [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics over raw military power; the salarians, an amphibious species who have an aptitude for technological research, espionage and [[unconventional warfare]]; and the turians, a proud avian-like species known for their disciplined culture and military capability. Besides humanity, the associate races on the Citadel include the volus, a client race of the turians who mostly make their influence felt through trade and commerce to compensate for their small and fragile suit-covered bodies; the hanar, an overly polite and philosophically inclined race of jellyfish-like entities who worship the Protheans as their progenitors with religious fervor; the reptilian drell, who loyally serve the hanar as part of a symbiotic relationship which they call the Compact; and the elcor, a species of hulking elephantine quadrupeds who preface everything they say with the intended emotion due to their lack of vocal inflection and discernible facial expressions.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /><ref name=\"kotaku lore\" /> \n\nOther species include the krogan, a hardy and warlike reptilian race in decline due to the Genophage, a [[terraforming]] [[retrovirus|viral-weapon]] designed to [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilize]] the krogan species and their homeworld Tuchanka; the batarians, an isolationist four-eyed species infamous for piracy and other disreputable activities; and the quarians, nomads who were forced to flee their homeworld Rannoch when their development of [[Swarm robotic platforms|advanced networked]] [[artificial intelligence]] created the geth, who warred with their creators.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /> Due to this, the rest of the species in Citadel-controlled space limit their reliance on artificial intelligence, using \"virtual intelligence\" (VI) that lack self-awareness.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" />\n\n===''Mass Effect'' Trilogy===\nThe original ''Mass Effect'' trilogy takes place in the 22nd century. Over the course of the trilogy, membership of the Citadel Council is expanded to include a human representative, and the galactic community come to learn that the Protheans were mostly wiped out over 50,000 years prior by the Reapers, sentient starships that normally occupy the void between the Milky Way and the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], but appear every 50,000 years with the sole purpose of wiping out emergent organic species as well as any evidence of their own existence. Unlike their predecessors in previous cycles, the Protheans had learned of the Reapers and prepared for their arrival, though they were unable to prevent their own extermination by the Reapers. Their preparations survive into the next cycle, in the form of the Crucible.<ref name=\"PCGamer lore\"/> The ''Mass Effect'' series starts as the nascent appearances of the Reapers in this cycle have occurred, beginning with the indoctrination of a rogue turian Spectre, an influential asari Matriarch, and a \"heretic\" faction of geth who broke away from the true Geth Consensus to further their plans of return.<ref name=\"polygon lore\" /> \n\nThe Collectors, a strange four-eyed insectoid race, began abducting entire human colonies by the events of ''Mass Effect 2''. Shepard, who had been killed in action during a surprise attack by Collector forces at the beginning of ''Mass Effect 2'', is reconstructed and revived by Cerberus in the year 2185, following a complex cybernetic engineering process which lasted two years. Shepard sets out to gather a team of individuals from across the galaxy for a suicide mission into the mysterious Omega Four mass relay to stop the Collectors from harvesting more human colonies.\n\nImmediately after the defeat of the Collectors and the destruction of the incomplete Proto-Reaper they were constructing,<ref>''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 89.</ref> the Reapers are shown traveling to the Milky Way galaxy from dark space at the ending of ''Mass Effect 2''. The Reaper invasion have commenced by the beginning of ''Mass Effect 3'', with the war's earliest fronts taking place in batarian and human space.<ref>''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 147.</ref> Shepard is present on Earth when the Reapers first arrived, and later escapes the human homeworld on the ''Normandy'' SR-2 in order to rally the rest of the galactic community against the Reaper threat, and find a solution that will break the Reaper-imposed cycle of harvesting organic species forever.\n\n===''Mass Effect: Andromeda''===\nThe fourth ''Mass Effect'' game is set in the same universe as the original trilogy, and focuses on the Andromeda Initiative. Founded in 2176, the Andromeda Initiative is a civilian multi-species project created to send scientists, explorers and colonists placed in cryosleep within massive intergalactic arkships on a one-way trip from the Milky Way Galaxy to settle in the Andromeda Galaxy. The Initiative's main objective is to establish a permanent presence in the Heleus Cluster, a seemingly resource-rich frontier of Andromeda, and eventually create a reliable route between both galaxies. Alec Ryder is a Pathfinder, the title for leader of each of the arkships, and is responsible for the human-majority population aboard his ship ''Hyperion''.<ref name=\"MEA Setting\"/> ''Mass Effect: Andromeda'' introduces the angara, an emotionally expressive species who are dependent on sunlight for sustenance, and the kett, a hostile militaristic species with dense formations of bone growing externally as armor protrusions on their bodies.<ref name=\"PCGAND\"/> \n\n==Player characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align        = right\n| direction    = vertical\n| image1       = Mass Effect characters.png\n| width1       = 350\n| image2       = FemShepandCo.jpg\n| width2       = 350\n| footer       = Two posters illustrating some of the major characters of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy, which are nearly identical except for the player character's gender.

In addition to these, the character also makes an appearance in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' comic series and in ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' (provided the player does not import a save where she dies). She is revealed to have been genetically designed by her father to be perfect and ran away from home to join Cerberus. Lawson is leader of Cerberus' Lazarus Cell, tasked with reviving Commander Shepard.

EDI assists in doing so, and in the process, struggled with the synthetic entity, and seizes control of its platform in the process, allowing her to accompany Shepard as a squad mate on missions. Now possessing a physical body and with her sentience and humanlike characteristics, her relationship with [[#Jeff \"Joker Moreau\"|Joker]] develops further, and, if Shepard supports the idea, the two may start a romantic relationship.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> She also will converse with Shepard several times, asking them about human behaviors so that she can better understand human psychology and, in a sense, become more human herself.

He was a key member in the science team that researched the remodification of the Krogan Genophage, an action that he feels guilty about but considers the best possible solution to a once growing problem. Mordin believes in acting in the best interests of the galaxy; his scientific work is governed by strong moral standards and unquestionable respect for all forms of life.\n\nThe character returns in ''Mass Effect 3'', providing he survived the suicide mission in the previous game. After defeating the Collectors, Mordin returned to STG as a special consultant, whilst also working as an inside source for Clan Urdnot. If Maelon's research data was saved, he uses it to aid in the treatment of the surviving female krogan codenamed Eve, the only survivor of his student's experiments. He is encountered on the salarian homeworld, Sur'Kesh, when Shepard is sent there to aid in the evacuation of the female.\n\nMordin Solus is voiced by Michael Beattie in ''Mass Effect 2'', and by [[William Salyers]] in ''Mass Effect 3''.\n\nMordin has received a positive reception, receiving nominations for three \"Best New Character\" awards, and placing high in numerous ''Mass Effect'' character lists.\n\n==== Jack ====\n{{Main|Jack (Mass Effect)}}\nJack, also known \"Subject Zero\", is the powerful product of unethical Cerberus experiments to enhance human biotic ability, which molded her antisocial and psychopathic temperament. Shepard may recruit Jack from the prison facility that she is confined in to join the suicide mission against the Collectors, in exchange for files aboard the ''Normandy'' about the science facility where Cerberus scientists tortured and abused her.<ref name=PCGamer/> She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard in ''Mass Effect 2''. Jack will reappear in ''Mass Effect 3'' if a save game is imported where she survives the events of the suicide mission, with the option to continue their relationship from ''2'' if she was Shepard's paramour. \n\nJack is voiced by [[Courtenay Taylor]].\n\n====Grunt====\nGrunt is a tank-bred genetically engineered super-krogan that can be recruited as a squad member.<ref name=\"kotaku lore\" /> Grunt's design is intended to be youthful but also tough, invoking the look of a [[linebacker]] with large shoulder pads and exposed muscular arms.<ref name=\"art 70\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 70.</ref> Compared to [[#Urdnot_Wrex|Wrex]] who is a much older krogan, Grunt's crest is smaller and does not fully cover his entire skull due to his age.<ref name=\"art 70\"/>  Early designs for Grunt's armor varied widely, which eventually settled into a polished and sleek look, almost like a \"show-room finish\" on a brand new car.<ref name=\"art 70\"/>\n\nInitially in ''Mass Effect 2'', Shepard is meant to recruit Okeer, a krogan warlord and radical scientist who has been developing a small army of krogan to weather the Genophage. When Shepard arrives to recruit him, Okeer is working for the Blue Suns mercenary group, but was betrayed by the latter. Though Shepard and crew defeat the Blue Suns leader, it is too late to save Okeer, who leaves Shepard with a tank containing his \"legacy\", his \"perfect krogan\". If and when Shepard decides to awaken him, the krogan recalls Okeer's last words and chooses one of them, \"grunt\", as his name. While initially hostile towards Shepard, Grunt may be recruited as a squad mate for Shepard. If the player imports a save game where Grunt survives the suicide mission in ''2'', he appears in ''Mass Effect 3'' in a small role.\n\nGrunt is voiced by [[Steve Blum]].\n\nGrunt showing Shepard his strength in ''Mass Effect 2'' is considered to be one of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy's most iconic moments by ''Kotaku's'' Gergo Vas.<ref name=\"Iconic\">{{Cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/the-most-iconic-moments-of-the-mass-effect-trilogy-471605422|title=The Most Iconic Moments of the Mass Effect Trilogy|author=Gergo Vas |date=April 13, 2019 |accessdate=April 4, 2020 |work=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref>''PC Gamer'' staff noted that while there is not much to the character \"beyond punching things and talking about fighting\", dealing with Grunt could be a \"refreshing change from the philosophizing and soul-searching of the rest of the crew.\"<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> \n\n====Thane Krios====\n{{Main|Thane Krios}}\nThane is a mysterious drell assassin who is terminally ill from a disease known as Kepral's Syndrome, which is exclusive to drell due to their physiology.<ref name=\"kotaku lore\" /> While a coldblooded killer, Thane possesses a conscience that struggles against his own profession.<ref name=PCGamer/> Shepard may recruit him on the asari-dominated world of Ilium for the suicide mission in ''Mass Effect 2''.

She is noted by BioWare staff as one of the most difficult characters to nail down design-wise; a trial-and-error approach was used where the character artists would try to get as many rough ideas and sketches onto a page as possible to figure out what makes Samara iconic and stand out as a character, and the final design would be polished until the team has reached a consensus.<ref name=\"art 81\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 81.</ref> Variations for her head accessory have been considered, including religious headgear and regal-looking crown-like adornments.<ref name=\"art 80\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 80.</ref> For airless or toxic environments, the team decided to go with a small breather device to allow for more facial expression after various designs were considered.<ref name=\"art 81\"/> Samara's revealing clothing in her final design indicates that her primary method of defense is her uniform's \"near-invisible kinetic-barrier technology\".<ref name=\"art 80\"/>\n\nSamara is on a quest to track down her fugitive daughter Morinth; if Shepard chooses to participate in her quest, they will have to make the decision between Samara dying or killing Morinth.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Shepard meets Samara on Illium, where she is found investigating the Eclipse mercenary group who smuggled her daughter off-world. Samara will join Shepard for the suicide mission at the conclusion of the investigation.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Shepard will acknowledge Shepard if flirted with, though she will not reciprocate. If the player imports a save game where Samara survives the events of ''Mass Effect 2'', she returns in a small role in ''Mass Effect 3''. In ''Mass Effect 3'' he attempts to fulfill her oath by executing her only living daughter, who is also Ardat-Yakshi like Morinth and forbidden from leaving an asari monastery, and if she fails to do so she may attempt to commit suicide.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/>  \n\nSamara is voiced by Maggie Baird. Her face was modeled after Rana McAnear.<ref name=\"Rana\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rana_mary?lang=en|title=Rana McAnear on Twitter|work=Twitter}}</ref> \n\nEvan Lahti of ''PC Gamer'' called her \"Judge Dredd with a serial killer daughter\" who makes ''Mass Effect'' more interesting with her extremist stances. She is noted as the only character who deals with moral absolutes in the ''Mass Effect'' series, due to her strictly rigid adherence to the Justicar Code, and is one of ''Mass Effect's'' most tragic characters in the Shakespearean manner<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> \n\n====Morinth====\nMorinth is the fugitive daughter of Samara. She is an Ardat-Yakshi, asari who are born with an inherited trait which kills their mates during sexual encounters by burning out their nervous systems. Morinth joins Shepard if she is assisted with trapping Samara so that Morinth can execute her.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> She will then disguise herself as her mother and takes her place in Shepard's plans squad, so that only Shepard knows of Samara's death. Shepard may choose to mate with Morinth, although it will result in his or her death.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> If the player imports a save game where Morinth is recruited and survives the events of ''Mass Effect 2'', she will appear in ''Mass Effect'' as an indoctrinated husk-like enemy type known as a banshee. \n\nMorinth is voiced by [[Natalia Cigliuti]]. Her face was modeled after Rana McAnear.<ref name=\"Rana\"/>\n\n''PC Gamer'' staff considers Morinth to be a poor replacement for her mother, \"the more interesting and conflicted justicar\". She is rated better as an antagonist instead, the \"cat-and-mouse game of catching Morinth\" being lauded as one of ''Mass Effect 2's'' most exciting moments.<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Andr\u00e1s Neltz from ''Kotaku'' commented that \"the sheer audacity of a scam this huge\u2014setting out to recruit a virtuous Asari Justicar, and coming back with her black widow of a daughter instead, passing her off as the real thing\u2014is truly amazing.\"<ref name=\"Characters\"/>\n\n==== Legion ====\n{{Main|Legion (Mass Effect)}}\nLegion is the name given to the gestalt consciousness hosted within a geth mobile unit eleven times more powerful than standard geth mobile platforms. Legion belongs to the true Geth Consensus, and is designed to operate outside of geth space and interact diplomatically with organic lifeforms. The name is given by EDI based on the \"''[[Gospel of Mark]] 5:9 \u2013 [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac]]''\". Legion investigates the worlds Shepard have visited in the first game, eventually locating the SSV ''Normandy's'' wreckage on the planet Alchera and learns of Shepard's death. Legion is a skilled [[security hacker]] and [[marksman]], generally preferring long-range combat. In contrast to other Geth, Legion is capable of independent thought and demonstrates emotional attachment, and is particularly fascinated with Shepard.\n\nLegion is voiced by [[D. C. Douglas]].\n\n==== Zaeed Massani ====\nZaeed is a human bounty hunter who is available through the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Zaeed - The Price of Revenge''. He holds the reputation as the galaxy's most feared bounty hunter and co-founder of the Blue Suns mercenary group. Zaeed had a mechanic leg and a dog companion during early concept stages.<ref name=\"art 82\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 82.</ref> Head models for the character went through various iterations, which included scarring, tattoos with the Blue Suns insignia, and potential breathers inspired by hocket masks and welding helmets for intimidation purposes.<ref name=\"art 82\"/> He joins Shepherd for the suicide mission if recruited, and asks that Shepard help him deal with the mercenary group he co-founded as a favour. If the player imports a save game where Zaeed survives the events of ''2'', Zaeed returns in ''Mass Effect 3'' with a small role. \n\nZaeed is voiced by Robin Sachs. \n\n''PC Gamer'' staff member Wes complained about Zaeed's characterization and his ineffectiveness as a squad mate, calling him a \"less interesting retread of [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|KotOR's Mandalorian Canderous Ordo]]\".<ref name=PCGamer/>\n\n==== Kasumi Goto ====\nKasumi is a master thief who is made available through the DLC, ''[[Mass Effect 2: Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory]]''. Kasumi's concepts drew inspiration from Middle Eastern culture; her outfit echoes that of a typical thief from the European [[Middle Ages]], the hood in particular gives her a mysterious and stealthy look.<ref>''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 83.</ref> She joins Shepherd for the suicide mission in ''Mass Effect 2'' and requests his help in retrieving the memory box of her lover.  Kasumi returns in ''Mass Effect 3'' with a small role, provided a save game is imported where her eponymous DLC was played and she survives the suicide mission.\n \nKasumi Goto is voiced by Kim Hoy.\n\n''PC Gamer'' staff member Samuel called Kasumi one of more visually interesting ''Mass Effect'' squad mates, and praised ''Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory'' as his favorite ''Mass Effect'' series DLC.<ref name=PCGamer/> IGN's Steven Hopper ranked Kasumi #9 in his list of best ''Mass Effect'' teammates.<ref name=\"10 Teammates\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/01/05/10-best-mass-effect-teammates |title=10 Best Mass Effect Teammates |last=Hopper |first=Steven |date=January 5, 2012 |work=IGN |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====James Vega====\nLieutenant James Vega is a human Systems Alliance Marine and Shepard's squad member in ''Mass Effect 3''. The basic concept behind Vega is a heavily muscled tank of a man who happens to be a blue collar military officer, and his armor is given a lot of heft to imply that he is \"an unstoppable force\". His rugged look with tattoos, scars and a beard help distinguish him from the clean-cut Alliance characters.<ref>''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 130.</ref> The character was known early in ''Mass Effect 3's'' development as \"James Sanders\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-18-new-mass-effect-3-team-mate-james-vega#comments|title=New Mass Effect 3 team-mate James Vega, formerly known as James Sanders|work=Eurogamer |date= July 18, 2011|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref> Sanders is revealed to be the character's birth surname in the first issue of the comic series, ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''.

Vega and Ashley or Kaidan, depending on who survived Virmire, retrieve the ''Normandy'' SR-2 and pick Shepard up from Earth.\n\nJames Vega is the main focus of the ''Mass Effect'' anime movie, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. Early in his career, Vega was stationed on the remote colony of Fehl Prime with Delta Squad, an Alliance special forces unit.

The Protheans were first depicted in the form of visually ambiguous statues on the planet Ilos in the first game, as at the time BioWare was unsure as to the extent of the role the Protheans would play over the course of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.<ref name=\"art 136\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 136.</ref> Javik's final design is based on the look of the Collectors from ''Mass Effect 2'', particularly the shell shape of the head which is a signature feature of the Colletors, along with multiple pupils to the eyes and secondary nostrils to evoke a very alien feel.<ref name=\"art 138\">''The Art of the Mass Effect Universe'', p. 138.</ref> As the Protheans of his time were known for their highly advanced technological capabilities, Javik is intended to look more intelligent then a mindless Collector drone.<ref name=\"art 136\"/> Javik's armor, which is influenced by the aesthetics of [[samurai]] armor, is intended to be technologically advanced yet with an ancient feel, thematically appropriate for a being who had been placed in stasis for over 50,000 years.<ref name=\"art 138\"/>\n\nJavik's pod is uncovered and opened by Commander Shepard and Liara T'Soni during his recruitment mission, who were investigating Cerberus activity on Eden Prime. Flashbacks of Javik's memories happen during the mission which reveals insights on the Prothean's struggle against the Reapers.

She has developed an obsessive interest in studying the Remnant, an umbrella term coined for technology, structures, and autonomous bots that have been sighted across the Heleus Cluster. She is considered to be an atypical member of asari culture, \u201cpathologically independent\u201d, and has little regard for rules or teamwork.
