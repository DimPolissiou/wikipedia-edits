Various cell types metabolize arachidonic acid to 15(''S'')-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(''S'')-HpETE). This initial [[peroxide#Organic peroxides|hydroperoxide]] product is extremely short-lived in cells: if not otherwise metabolized, it is rapidly reduced to 15''(S)''-HETE. Both of these metabolites, depending on the cell type which forms them, can be further metabolized to 15-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-oxo-ETE), 5''S'',15''S''-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(''S''),15(''S'')-diHETE), 5-oxo-15(''S'')-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-15(''S'')-HETE, a subset of [[specialized pro-resolving mediators]] viz., the [[lipoxins]], a class of pro-inflammatory mediators, the [[eoxin]]s, and other products that have less well-defined activities and functions. Thus, 15(''S'')-HETE and 15(''S'')-HpETE, in addition to having intrinsic biological activities, are key precursors to numerous biologically active derivatives.<ref name=\"New aspects of the role of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids in cell growth and cancer development\">{{cite journal | pmid = 18761324 | year = 2009 | author1 = Moreno | first1 = J.

In this terminology ''S'' refers to the [[absolute configuration]] of the [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] of the hydroxy [[functional group]] at carbon position 15. Its 15(''R'') [[enantiomer]] is designated 15(''R'')-hydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',13''E''-eicosatetraenoic acid. ''Z'' and ''E'' give the [[cis\u2013trans isomerism]] about each [[double bond]] [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] at carbon positions 5, 8, 11, and 13 with Z indicating cis and E indicating trans isomerism. Both stereoisomers are produced from their corresponding ''S'' and ''R'' 15-HpETE stereoisomers, i.e. 15(''S'')-hydroperoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',13''E''-eicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HpETE) and (15''R'')-hydroperoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',13''E''-eicosatetraenoic acid (15(R)-HpETE).\n\n== Production ==\nHuman cells release [[arachidonic acid]] (i.e. 5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid) from its storage site in [[phospholipids]] by reactions that involve [[phospholipase C]] and/or [[lipase]] enzymes.

The Eastern Ghats run from the northern [[Odisha]] through [[Andhra Pradesh]] to [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south passing some parts of [[Karnataka]] as well as Telangana. They are eroded and cut through by four major rivers of peninsular India, viz. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Mahanadi]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], and [[Kaveri]].\nThe cradle of Eastern Ghats is Villupuram district in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe mountain ranges run parallel to the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The [[Deccan Plateau]] lies to the west of the range, between the Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats. The [[coastal plain]]s, including the [[Coromandel Coast]] region, lie between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. The Eastern Ghats are not as high as the [[Western Ghats]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe Eastern Ghats are older than the Western Ghats, and have a complex geologic history related to the assembly and breakup of the ancient [[supercontinent]] of [[Rodinia]] and the assembly of the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent.\n\nThe Eastern Ghats are made up of [[charnockite]]s, [[granite]] [[gneiss]], [[khondalite]]s, [[metamorphic]] [[gneiss]]es and [[quartzite]] rock formations.

The climate of the higher hill ranges is generally cooler and wetter than the surrounding plains, and the hills are home to [[coffee]] plantations and enclaves of dry forest.\n\nThe [[hill station]] of [[Yercaud]] is located in the [[Shevaroy Hills]]. The [[Biligiriranga Hills]], which run east from the Western Ghats to the River Kaveri, form a forested ecological corridor that connects the Eastern and Western Ghats, and allows the second-largest wild [[Asian elephant]] population in India to range between the South Eastern Ghats, the [[Biligiriranga Hills]] and [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiri Hills]], and the South [[Western Ghats]].\n\nThe [[Male Mahadeshwara Hills]] Temple is situated in [[Chamarajanagar district]] in [[Karnataka]] state in the Eastern Ghats.\n\nThe [[Ponnaiyar River|Ponnaiyar]] and [[Palar River|Palar]] rivers flow from headwaters on the [[Kolar Plateau]] eastward through gaps in the Ghats to empty into the Bay of Bengal; the [[Javadi Hills|Javadhu Hills]] lie between the two rivers.

They run in a nearly north-south alignment, parallel to the [[Coromandel Coast]] for close to 430&nbsp;km between the [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Penna River|Pennar]] rivers. Its northern boundaries are marked by the flat Palnadu basin, while in the south it merges with the [[Tirupati]] hills. An extremely old system, the hills have been extensively weathered and eroded over the years. The average elevation today is about 520&nbsp;m, but reaches 1,100&nbsp;m at Bhairani Konda and 1,048&nbsp;m at Gundla Brahmeswara.\n\nThe Tirumala Hills are located along the [[Seshachalam Hills|Seshachalam]]-Velikonda Range of the Eastern Ghats. The Palar River cuts through the ranges. The [[Velikonda Range]] eventually descends to the coastal plain in northern [[Nellore district]], while the Nallamalla Range in Kurnool continues to the River Krishna.\n\nThe Kondapalli Hills are a range of low hills which lie between the Krishna and the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] rivers. These hills are located in the Guntur, Krishna, West Godavari and Khammam districts of Andhra Pradesh. The Krishna River bisects these hills of the Eastern Ghats. The main hill range starts from Nandigrama to [[Vijayawada]] known as [[Kondapalli]].\n\nThe Papi Hills (Papi Kondalu) are distributed among the Khammam, East Godavari and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh and lie in the Eastern Ghats and ends at [[Rajamahendravaram]].\n\n[[Madhurawada]] Dome in the Eastern Ghats mobile belt is formed by a tectonic arrangement with the khondalite suite and quartz Archean rocks along the Eastern Ghats north of [[Visakhapatnam]].<ref>{{cite journal| first1=P.| last1=Jagadeeswara Rao| last2=Harikrishna| first2=P.| last3=Srivastav| first3=S.K.| last4=Satyanarayana| first4=P.V.V.| last5=Vasu Deva Rao| first5=B.| title=Selection of groundwater potential zones in and around Madhurawada Dome, Visakhapatnam District - A GIS approach| journal=J.

The Eastern Ghats run from the northern [[Odisha]] through [[Andhra Pradesh]] to [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south passing some parts of [[Karnataka]] as well as Telangana. They are eroded and cut through by four major rivers of peninsular India, viz. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Mahanadi]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], and [[Kaveri]].\nThe cradle of Eastern Ghats is Villupuram district in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe mountain ranges run parallel to the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The [[Deccan Plateau]] lies to the west of the range, between the Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats. The [[coastal plain]]s, including the [[Coromandel Coast]] region, lie between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. The Eastern Ghats are not as high as the [[Western Ghats]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe Eastern Ghats are older than the Western Ghats, and have a complex geologic history related to the assembly and breakup of the ancient [[supercontinent]] of [[Rodinia]] and the assembly of the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent.\n\nThe Eastern Ghats are made up of [[charnockite]]s, [[granite]] [[gneiss]], [[khondalite]]s, [[metamorphic]] [[gneiss]]es and [[quartzite]] rock formations.

The southernmost of the Eastern Ghats are the low [[Sirumalai]] and Karanthamalai Hills of southern Tamil Nadu.\n\nNorth of the [[Kaveri River]] are the higher [[Kolli Hills|Kollimalai]], [[Pachaimalai Hills|Pachaimalai]], [[Shevaroy Hills|Shevaroy]] (Servarayan), [[Kalrayan Hills]], [[Chitteri]], Javadhu Hills, Palamalai and [[Mettur]] Hills in northern Tamil Nadu state. The climate of the higher hill ranges is generally cooler and wetter than the surrounding plains, and the hills are home to [[coffee]] plantations and enclaves of dry forest.\n\nThe [[hill station]] of [[Yercaud]] is located in the [[Shevaroy Hills]]. The [[Biligiriranga Hills]], which run east from the Western Ghats to the River Kaveri, form a forested ecological corridor that connects the Eastern and Western Ghats, and allows the second-largest wild [[Asian elephant]] population in India to range between the South Eastern Ghats, the [[Biligiriranga Hills]] and [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiri Hills]], and the South [[Western Ghats]].\n\nThe [[Male Mahadeshwara Hills]] Temple is situated in [[Chamarajanagar district]] in [[Karnataka]] state in the Eastern Ghats.\n\nThe [[Ponnaiyar River|Ponnaiyar]] and [[Palar River|Palar]] rivers flow from headwaters on the [[Kolar Plateau]] eastward through gaps in the Ghats to empty into the Bay of Bengal; the [[Javadi Hills|Javadhu Hills]] lie between the two rivers.

The lower [[Velikonda Range]] lies to the east, and the higher Palikonda-Lankamalla-[[Nallamalai Hills|Nallamala Ranges]] lie to the west. They run in a nearly north-south alignment, parallel to the [[Coromandel Coast]] for close to 430&nbsp;km between the [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Penna River|Pennar]] rivers. Its northern boundaries are marked by the flat Palnadu basin, while in the south it merges with the [[Tirupati]] hills. An extremely old system, the hills have been extensively weathered and eroded over the years. The average elevation today is about 520&nbsp;m, but reaches 1,100&nbsp;m at Bhairani Konda and 1,048&nbsp;m at Gundla Brahmeswara.\n\nThe Tirumala Hills are located along the [[Seshachalam Hills|Seshachalam]]-Velikonda Range of the Eastern Ghats. The Palar River cuts through the ranges. The [[Velikonda Range]] eventually descends to the coastal plain in northern [[Nellore district]], while the Nallamalla Range in Kurnool continues to the River Krishna.\n\nThe Kondapalli Hills are a range of low hills which lie between the Krishna and the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] rivers. These hills are located in the Guntur, Krishna, West Godavari and Khammam districts of Andhra Pradesh. The Krishna River bisects these hills of the Eastern Ghats. The main hill range starts from Nandigrama to [[Vijayawada]] known as [[Kondapalli]].\n\nThe Papi Hills (Papi Kondalu) are distributed among the Khammam, East Godavari and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh and lie in the Eastern Ghats and ends at [[Rajamahendravaram]].\n\n[[Madhurawada]] Dome in the Eastern Ghats mobile belt is formed by a tectonic arrangement with the khondalite suite and quartz Archean rocks along the Eastern Ghats north of [[Visakhapatnam]].<ref>{{cite journal| first1=P.| last1=Jagadeeswara Rao| last2=Harikrishna| first2=P.| last3=Srivastav| first3=S.K.| last4=Satyanarayana| first4=P.V.V.| last5=Vasu Deva Rao| first5=B.| title=Selection of groundwater potential zones in and around Madhurawada Dome, Visakhapatnam District - A GIS approach| journal=J.

The series features contestants who are instructed to go [[Fugitive|on the run]] for a period of 25 to 28 days in mainland Great Britain, whilst avoiding a team of Hunters composed of former and serving police, intelligence personnel, and on-foot teams. During their time, the Hunters have access to contestants personal information and use \"powers of the state\" such as [[Automatic number-plate recognition|ANPR]], [[CCTV]] and [[call tracing]] to locate contestants. At times, the Hunters will use [[social media]] and monetary rewards to members of the public (and captured contestants) for information leading to a successful capture. On the final day, any remaining contestants must reach a designated \"extraction\" point before being captured, winning a share of \u00a3100,000.\n\nA celebrity adaptation, ''Celebrity Hunted'', is also produced in aid of [[Stand Up To Cancer]], where contestants compete for a shorter time period of 14 days.\n\n==Format and rules==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nIn both the civilian and celebrity series, the contestants, now regarded as [[Fugitives]], voluntarily go on the run in mainland Great Britain and must avoid detection from the Hunters, a group of current and former police and intelligence officials for 25 days (28 in the first two series and 14 for the celebrity series). From series 2, the contestants are escorted to a public area and given a head start before the Hunters begin their search and are given the names of their targets. Fugitives are given a [[debit card]] with a small amount of money provided by the production team, and a rucksack containing essential and personal items (though in [[Hunted_(2015_TV_series)#Series_5_(2020)|series 5]], the fugitives began with only the clothes on their back) During their time on the run the Fugitives can use any existing connections, or ask members of the general public, to assist them in avoiding capture.\n\nWhilst the Fugitives attempt to avoid using technology and thus detection, the Hunters use a vast array of different \"powers of the state\", such as closed surveillance, phone records and number plate recognition to pinpoint their chosen target. If one (or more) Fugitives have become difficult to locate, the Hunters use [[social media]] to encourage members of the public to reveal any information, and post content specifically for a Fugitive to reveal their location without realizing. Hunters may also be directly contacted by the public with any leads by telephone. Any member of the public with information leading to capture is compensated for their effort. Hunters additionally operate throughout the country through use of two-person ground teams that can deploy immediately under order of the Chief, the ground teams also perform [[reconnaissance]] at Fugitives' homes and attempt to goad family members and/or loved ones for information and may be observed to determine any irregularities in their daily routines.\n\nWhen a Fugitive is caught, they're told their time on the run is over and are escorted to a vehicle for debrief back at the Hunters headquarters.\n\nIn the final few days of the game, any Fugitives still on the run are given instructions of their 'extraction point' and a finite amount of time to get there. The Hunters are told of the last-known locations of the Fugitives and extend their efforts to figure out where the extraction is taking place. When a Fugitive successfully reaches the extraction point within the time-frame, they can no longer be caught by the Hunters are deemed as the Winner. Due to the nature of the show, there are two possible outcomes to the hunt. One or more Fugitives can reach the extraction point and win whilst the opposite can occur where every Fugitive is caught and the hunt prematurely ends (known as a \"clean sweep\").\n\n==Regular series==\n\n===Series 1 (2015)===\nFourteen contestants were chosen and began in their respective hometowns.

While filming, the production team was split so that the team working with the hunters was separate from the team working with the fugitives, to prevent information passing between the groups and to provide a more realistic experience. In preparing for production, over 800 [[Freedom of Information]] requests were submitted to find the location of state-owned [[CCTV cameras]] positioned throughout the British mainland. When real footage could not be obtained, Channel 4 cameras captured footage that would have been available to the state, which was stored on a central database for the hunters to access if they wished. However, they had to \"officially\" request the information as if it were a real fugitive hunt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hunted: The Makings of a Manhunt|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/hunted/articles/all/hunted-the-makings-of-a-manhunt/3664|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref> The hunters were overseen by an independent adjudicator, former Head of Covert Operations for the [[Metropolitan Police]], Kevin O\u2019Leary, whose job was to make sure that the information requested and gathered by the hunters reflected the information that would be available to them in real life and within the appropriate time frame.

The series features contestants who are instructed to go [[Fugitive|on the run]] for a period of 25 to 28 days in mainland Great Britain, whilst avoiding a team of Hunters composed of former and serving police, intelligence personnel, and on-foot teams. During their time, the Hunters have access to contestants personal information and use \"powers of the state\" such as [[Automatic number-plate recognition|ANPR]], [[CCTV]] and [[call tracing]] to locate contestants. At times, the Hunters will use [[social media]] and monetary rewards to members of the public (and captured contestants) for information leading to a successful capture. On the final day, any remaining contestants must reach a designated \"extraction\" point before being captured, winning a share of \u00a3100,000.\n\nA celebrity adaptation, ''Celebrity Hunted'', is also produced in aid of [[Stand Up To Cancer]], where contestants compete for a shorter time period of 14 days.\n\n==Format and rules==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nIn both the civilian and celebrity series, the contestants, now regarded as [[Fugitives]], voluntarily go on the run in mainland Great Britain and must avoid detection from the Hunters, a group of current and former police and intelligence officials for 25 days (28 in the first two series and 14 for the celebrity series). From series 2, the contestants are escorted to a public area and given a head start before the Hunters begin their search and are given the names of their targets. Fugitives are given a [[debit card]] with a small amount of money provided by the production team, and a rucksack containing essential and personal items (though in [[Hunted_(2015_TV_series)#Series_5_(2020)|series 5]], the fugitives began with only the clothes on their back) During their time on the run the Fugitives can use any existing connections, or ask members of the general public, to assist them in avoiding capture.\n\nWhilst the Fugitives attempt to avoid using technology and thus detection, the Hunters use a vast array of different \"powers of the state\", such as closed surveillance, phone records and number plate recognition to pinpoint their chosen target. If one (or more) Fugitives have become difficult to locate, the Hunters use [[social media]] to encourage members of the public to reveal any information, and post content specifically for a Fugitive to reveal their location without realizing. Hunters may also be directly contacted by the public with any leads by telephone. Any member of the public with information leading to capture is compensated for their effort. Hunters additionally operate throughout the country through use of two-person ground teams that can deploy immediately under order of the Chief, the ground teams also perform [[reconnaissance]] at Fugitives' homes and attempt to goad family members and/or loved ones for information and may be observed to determine any irregularities in their daily routines.\n\nWhen a Fugitive is caught, they're told their time on the run is over and are escorted to a vehicle for debrief back at the Hunters headquarters.\n\nIn the final few days of the game, any Fugitives still on the run are given instructions of their 'extraction point' and a finite amount of time to get there. The Hunters are told of the last-known locations of the Fugitives and extend their efforts to figure out where the extraction is taking place. When a Fugitive successfully reaches the extraction point within the time-frame, they can no longer be caught by the Hunters are deemed as the Winner. Due to the nature of the show, there are two possible outcomes to the hunt. One or more Fugitives can reach the extraction point and win whilst the opposite can occur where every Fugitive is caught and the hunt prematurely ends (known as a \"clean sweep\").\n\n==Regular series==\n\n===Series 1 (2015)===\nFourteen contestants were chosen and began in their respective hometowns.

Before starting, all the fugitives gave permission to be tracked in the same way as the state might track a fugitive \u2013 their cash cards and phones are monitored, their houses searched and their friends and family questioned.

While filming, the production team was split so that the team working with the hunters was separate from the team working with the fugitives, to prevent information passing between the groups and to provide a more realistic experience. In preparing for production, over 800 [[Freedom of Information]] requests were submitted to find the location of state-owned [[CCTV cameras]] positioned throughout the British mainland. When real footage could not be obtained, Channel 4 cameras captured footage that would have been available to the state, which was stored on a central database for the hunters to access if they wished. However, they had to \"officially\" request the information as if it were a real fugitive hunt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hunted: The Makings of a Manhunt|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/hunted/articles/all/hunted-the-makings-of-a-manhunt/3664|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref> The hunters were overseen by an independent adjudicator, former Head of Covert Operations for the [[Metropolitan Police]], Kevin O\u2019Leary, whose job was to make sure that the information requested and gathered by the hunters reflected the information that would be available to them in real life and within the appropriate time frame. He was the only person who had the power to release information to the hunters and would only do so when he considered that the hunters had done sufficient detective work to justify access to the information.<ref>{{cite web|title=Series 2 Guide|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/hunted/articles/all/series-2-guide/4836|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Ratings==\nEpisode ratings are taken from BARB and include Channel 4 +1.<ref name=\"BARB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-10|title=Weekly Viewing Summary (see relevant week)|publisher=[[BARB]]}}</ref>\n\n===''Hunted''===\n====Series 1 (2015)====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
