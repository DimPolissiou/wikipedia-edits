It was designed to hold 500 students of all grades.  That year, Marvin D. Losley was named the first superintendent of the Northport East Northport School District.  In 1938 two elementary schools were constructed, Ocean Avenue School in Northport and Larkfield School in East Northport.\n\nIn the 1950s, tremendous population growth caused the construction  of Dickinson Avenue Elementary School, as well as Fifth Avenue and Norwood Avenue Elementary schools, and East Northport Junior High School.  In Addition, the Senior High School moved into a campus style school on Middleville Road, and the Laurel Avenue building became a Junior High School.  The distance between the East Northport community and the high school caused difficulty for students.  The high school became a three year high school with ninth grade moving down to the junior high schools.  In 1962 Pulaski Road Elementary School opened its doors.  Later, due to overcrowding, a new high school was constructed on Laurel Hill Road, which opened in 1966.  Consequently, the Middleville Road building also became a middle school.  This year, Bellerose Avenue School was also opened.\n\nIn 1970, a fire destroyed the upper floor of Ocean Avenue School.  In 1982, Larkfield School closed, and the property was sold.   In 1988, 9th graders were moved back to the high school, as part of an extensive grade restructuring.  In 1991 Middleville Road Middle School Was closed, and in 1997 Northport Middle School relocated to the Middleville Road facility.\n\nIn 2003\u20132004, additions were made to Northport High School, Northport Middle School, and East Northport Middle School.  More recently, in 2010, the school district has been threatened with potential budget cuts in the 2010-11 budget, potentially causing a loss of 40 teachers, and of the districtwide summer music program.  However, the school budget has not yet been finalized.  Most of the cuts are related to a significant decrease in state aid.\n\nDue to ongoing investigations regarding public safety concerns at Northport Middle School, as of January 23rd 2020, the school has been closed to non-staff members.<ref>http://northport.k12.ny.us/Assets/Buildings_and_Grounds_Documents/Northport_Middle_011820_final.pdf?t=637149609678900000</ref>\n\n==Location==\nThe school district is situated on the north shore of [[Long Island]] in western [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], Northport-East Northport is approximately 50 miles from the United States' largest city, [[New York City|New York]]. The district serves the communities of [[Northport, New York|Northport]], [[Eatons Neck, New York|Eatons Neck]], [[Asharoken, New York|Asharoken]] and much of [[East Northport, New York|East Northport]], all located in the Town of [[Huntington, New York]].\n\n==Education==\nEducational offerings in the schools are broad in scope. A basic education program is offered at all levels, and augmenting it is a wide range of elective programs to meet the interests, abilities, needs and career goals of district pupils. Special services are provided by district staff and the [[Board of Cooperative Educational Services]] (BOCES). [[Northport High School]] is the only high school in the nation to offer an [[International Baccalaureate]] program, two National Academy Programs ([[Academy of Finance|Finance]] & [[Academy of Information Technology (USA)|Information Technology]]), more than 20 AP/IB courses, a science research program, Project Lead the Way, and a state model law program.\n\nThe school district also offers acceleration programs, of a one to two year acceleration in math, and of a one-year acceleration in science.  The high school has a large range of challenging programs available for students.  The high school's art and music department are highly recognized. Pupils perform well above the norm on state and national examinations and graduating seniors receive a large number of scholarships and awards. Over 95% of high school graduates continue their education.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe district includes one [[high school]], [[Northport High School]], two [[middle schools]], East Northport Middle School and Northport Middle School, and six [[elementary schools]]: Bellerose Elementary School, Dickinson Avenue Elementary School, Fifth Avenue Elementary School, Norwood Avenue School, Ocean Avenue School, and Pulaski Road School.  The district office is at William J. Bronsan School (previously known as Laurel Avenue School), named after the retired Superintendent of Schools William J. Bronsan\n\nStudents K-5 will either attend Bellerose, Dickinson Avenue, Fifth Avenue, Norwood, Ocean, or Pulaski Elementary Schools, depending on where they live.  Students from Dickinson, Norwood, and Ocean Avenue attend Northport Middle School for Grades 6\u20138, whereas students from Pulaski and Fifth Avenue attend East Northport Middle School for grades 6\u20138.  Half of the Bellerose population goes to Northport, and half goes to East Northport.  All students in the district attend Northport High School, which offers a large variety of elective programs and the IB and AP programs.\n\nAt one time, the district contained seven elementary schools, three middle schools, and one high school.  However, Larkfield School and Middleville Road Middle School were eventually closed (although the Middleville Road Campus was still used, whereas the Larkfield Campus was sold).  The Larkfield School was closed due to declining enrollment, and has been subsequently made into a retirement home.<ref>Schoen, Molly: ''East Northport, An Incomplete History'', page 49.

King with her husband, William Cutfield King and their elder daughter, Alice Mary King]]Eliza Mary Richardson was the third child of Thomas Watkin Richardson, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-educated lawyer of the [[Inner Temple]], and Mary Anne Richardson (Whittington).  Like her elder siblings, Katherine (de Vouex) and William, who died young, Eliza was born in [[Offenbach am Main]], Germany. In 1852, some years after their return from Germany to England, the family migrated to New Zealand and settled at [[New Plymouth]] in the [[Taranaki]] region. Eliza married [[William Cutfield King]] (1829\u20131861) and by him had two daughters, Constance Ada (1859\u20131955) and Alice Mary (1855\u20131932). Her father, Thomas Richardson died in January 1861 and William King, a captain in the Taranaki Rifle Volunteers and newly elected to the [[New Zealand Parliament]], was ambushed and killed in the [[Second Taranaki War]] a month later. After this double bereavement, and with New Plymouth under siege from the Maori forces, Eliza, her daughters and the remaining members of her family sought refuge in [[Tasmania]].\n\nShe was not long in Tasmania. Early in 1863, Eliza, Constance and Alice returned to New Plymouth where she wrote ''Truth. Love. Joy. or the Fruits of the Garden of Eden'',<ref>''Truth. Love. Joy. or The Garden of Eden and its Fruits'', Melbourne, 1864, (i\u2013xi, 1\u2013416) published in Melbourne by the author, printed by Clarson, Shallard & Co.</ref> a polemical feminist critique of the [[Old Testament]] and the gospel of [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]]. The theologian [[John Colenso]] was an important influence. The book was published in 1864 in Australia and England where it was promoted by the atheist [[George Holyoake]].<ref>The Trial of Theism, undated edition, 'Religion in the Antipodes', promotional para by F Farrar, publisher, The Strand, London</ref>  Her name is shown on the title page as E. M. King, an authorial designation that she preserved in all subsequent publications. In the preface she revealed, after some hesitation, that she was a woman and that she had taken [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] as her inspiration for independent thought.\n\n==Campaigns and polemics==\nIn 1870 Mrs E M King, as she was thereafter known, returned to England with her daughters, where she almost immediately joined [[Josephine Butler]] in the campaign against the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], which regulated prostitution in the English port cities.<ref>Judith Walkowitz, ''Prostitution and Victorian Society: Women, Class and the State'', 1980, Cambridge University Press. Walkowitz provides an extended account of Mrs E M King\u2019s participation in the early stages of the repeal campaign from 1871\u201372. See, ibid, Part III \u2018Two Case Studies: Plymouth and Southampton Under the Contagious Diseases Acts\u2019</ref>  In 1870\u201372 King was active as a street protest organiser, speechmaker, polemicist and member of the Executive Committee of the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]].\n\nDuring 1872\u20131875, King became a familiar figure in English public debate.  In 1872 she established the short-lived Women's International Peace Society' and delivered public lectures the role of women in the peace movement,<ref>For an account of King's involvement with the peace movement, see: Heloise Brown, ''The Truest Form of Patriotism: Pacifist Feminism in Britain, 1870\u20131902'' Manchester University Press, 2003. pp63-5, p181.

An extended version was published in December 1873 as, 'Cooperative Housekeeping', (1873) 23 ''Contemporary Review'', 66. See also, Lynn F Pearson, ''The Architectural and Social History of Cooperative Living'', London, Macmillan, 1988, ch 3,  'Mrs E M King and the English Response'.</ref> Her lectures and publications advocating cooperative houses drew on the work of the American feminist, [[Melusina Fay Peirce]]. In 1873 King commissioned the architect, [[Edward William Godwin]], to draw plans for an associated living complex that would provide accommodation for 100 or more residents.<ref>See: Aileen Reid, 'The Architectural Career of E W Godwin', in E W Godwin: ''Aesthetic Movement Architect and Designer'', Yale University Press, 1999, edited Susan Weber Soros (Bard Graduate Center For Studies in the Decorative Arts, New York, 1999) 172, 182. Aileen Reid notes that 'Godwin was to receive shares in the company formed to build and run the co-operative home, in lieu of a fee'.</ref>\n\nThe scheme failed, however, to secure financial backing. With the exception of a lecture in Dublin in 1878 on equal suffrage, King appears to have withdrawn from public life between 1875 and 1881. For part of this time she was resident in Dresden, Germany with her daughters.  While there she wrote to Florence Pomeroy, Viscountess Harberton in support of her views on dress reform and, on  her return to England in 1882, they established the [[Rational Dress Society]] with Lady Harberton as president and King as honorary secretary. King resumed her public role with addresses and publications on dress reform and announced that the Rational Dress Society would stage an exhibition in 1883.  As a consequence of dissension within the Society, King established a rival organisation, the Rational Dress Association, which staged a Rational Dress Exhibition in [[Princes Hall]] at 190\u2013196 Piccadilly,<ref>''The Exhibition of the Rational Dress Association'', (London, Wyman 1883).  Reprinted in ''Catalogue of Exhibits and Gazette, The Rational Dress Association'', (New York, Garland Publishing 1978)</ref> The Rational Dress Exhibition opened with a speech by King and ran from 18 May to 12 June 1883, before touring provincial cities.\n\nIn 1884 King left England with her companion Elizabeth, \u2018Nellie\u2019 Glen (1848?\u20131900), for Canada and the United States, where they continued the campaign for rational dress reform.  In 1886 King and Nellie Glen bought an orange grove in [[Melrose, Florida|Melrose]] in northern [[Florida]], where she soon became involved in the agrarian reform movement of the Farmers Alliance as a newspaper editor, columnist and \u2018county lecturer\u2019.<ref>On the role of 'county lecturers' , see: Theodore R Mitchell, ''Political Education in the Southern Farmers\u2019 Alliance, 1887\u20131900'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987, 57.</ref>  In 1890 King and Nellie Glen established the Melrose Ladies Literary and Debating Society, one of the first women\u2019s clubs in Florida, now known as the 'Melrose Women\u2019s Club'.<ref>Jessie Hamm Meyer, ''Leading The Way: A Century Of Service: the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs, 1895\u20131995'', Lakeland, Florida Federation of Women\u2019s Clubs, 1994, p5.</ref> King delivered her last public lecture in Melrose in 1907 on \u2018Scandal: its Right and its Wrong Side\u2019.<ref>'Scandal: Its Right and its Wrong Side' ''Gainesville Daily Sun'', 2 May 1907. Public lecture in Melrose, Florida.</ref>  She returned to New Zealand later in that year to live with her daughters and died in 1911 in [[Omata]] not far from her marital home in New Plymouth.  She was buried in a railed enclosure in the grounds of the Taranaki Cathedral Church of St Mary, with her husband, William Cutfield King and her father, Thomas Watkin Richardson.\n\n==Beliefs, principles and philosophy==\nKing believed the similarities between men and women were more significant than their differences.  She argued that the differences were amplified, to the disadvantage of both sexes, by the prevailing political, theological and domestic conventions and prejudices of British and American society. In her public addresses, publications and campaigns for cooperative housekeeping and rational dress reform she was particularly influenced by the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]].\n\n==Selected publications==\n===Books and pamphlets===\n\n*''Truth.

King with her husband, William Cutfield King and their elder daughter, Alice Mary King]]Eliza Mary Richardson was the third child of Thomas Watkin Richardson, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-educated lawyer of the [[Inner Temple]], and Mary Anne Richardson (Whittington).  Like her elder siblings, Katherine (de Vouex) and William, who died young, Eliza was born in [[Offenbach am Main]], Germany. In 1852, some years after their return from Germany to England, the family migrated to New Zealand and settled at [[New Plymouth]] in the [[Taranaki]] region. Eliza married [[William Cutfield King]] (1829\u20131861) and by him had two daughters, Constance Ada (1859\u20131955) and Alice Mary (1855\u20131932). Her father, Thomas Richardson died in January 1861 and William King, a captain in the Taranaki Rifle Volunteers and newly elected to the [[New Zealand Parliament]], was ambushed and killed in the [[Second Taranaki War]] a month later. After this double bereavement, and with New Plymouth under siege from the Maori forces, Eliza, her daughters and the remaining members of her family sought refuge in [[Tasmania]].\n\nShe was not long in Tasmania. Early in 1863, Eliza, Constance and Alice returned to New Plymouth where she wrote ''Truth. Love. Joy. or the Fruits of the Garden of Eden'',<ref>''Truth. Love. Joy. or The Garden of Eden and its Fruits'', Melbourne, 1864, (i\u2013xi, 1\u2013416) published in Melbourne by the author, printed by Clarson, Shallard & Co.</ref> a polemical feminist critique of the [[Old Testament]] and the gospel of [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]]. The theologian [[John Colenso]] was an important influence. The book was published in 1864 in Australia and England where it was promoted by the atheist [[George Holyoake]].<ref>The Trial of Theism, undated edition, 'Religion in the Antipodes', promotional para by F Farrar, publisher, The Strand, London</ref>  Her name is shown on the title page as E. M. King, an authorial designation that she preserved in all subsequent publications. In the preface she revealed, after some hesitation, that she was a woman and that she had taken [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] as her inspiration for independent thought.\n\n==Campaigns and polemics==\nIn 1870 Mrs E M King, as she was thereafter known, returned to England with her daughters, where she almost immediately joined [[Josephine Butler]] in the campaign against the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], which regulated prostitution in the English port cities.<ref>Judith Walkowitz, ''Prostitution and Victorian Society: Women, Class and the State'', 1980, Cambridge University Press. Walkowitz provides an extended account of Mrs E M King\u2019s participation in the early stages of the repeal campaign from 1871\u201372. See, ibid, Part III \u2018Two Case Studies: Plymouth and Southampton Under the Contagious Diseases Acts\u2019</ref>  In 1870\u201372 King was active as a street protest organiser, speechmaker, polemicist and member of the Executive Committee of the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]].\n\nDuring 1872\u20131875, King became a familiar figure in English public debate.  In 1872 she established the short-lived Women's International Peace Society' and delivered public lectures the role of women in the peace movement,<ref>For an account of King's involvement with the peace movement, see: Heloise Brown, ''The Truest Form of Patriotism: Pacifist Feminism in Britain, 1870\u20131902'' Manchester University Press, 2003. pp63-5, p181.

An extended version was published in December 1873 as, 'Cooperative Housekeeping', (1873) 23 ''Contemporary Review'', 66. See also, Lynn F Pearson, ''The Architectural and Social History of Cooperative Living'', London, Macmillan, 1988, ch 3,  'Mrs E M King and the English Response'.</ref> Her lectures and publications advocating cooperative houses drew on the work of the American feminist, [[Melusina Fay Peirce]]. In 1873 King commissioned the architect, [[Edward William Godwin]], to draw plans for an associated living complex that would provide accommodation for 100 or more residents.<ref>See: Aileen Reid, 'The Architectural Career of E W Godwin', in E W Godwin: ''Aesthetic Movement Architect and Designer'', Yale University Press, 1999, edited Susan Weber Soros (Bard Graduate Center For Studies in the Decorative Arts, New York, 1999) 172, 182. Aileen Reid notes that 'Godwin was to receive shares in the company formed to build and run the co-operative home, in lieu of a fee'.</ref>\n\nThe scheme failed, however, to secure financial backing. With the exception of a lecture in Dublin in 1878 on equal suffrage, King appears to have withdrawn from public life between 1875 and 1881. For part of this time she was resident in Dresden, Germany with her daughters.  While there she wrote to Florence Pomeroy, Viscountess Harberton in support of her views on dress reform and, on  her return to England in 1882, they established the [[Rational Dress Society]] with Lady Harberton as president and King as honorary secretary. King resumed her public role with addresses and publications on dress reform and announced that the Rational Dress Society would stage an exhibition in 1883.  As a consequence of dissension within the Society, King established a rival organisation, the Rational Dress Association, which staged a Rational Dress Exhibition in [[Princes Hall]] at 190\u2013196 Piccadilly,<ref>''The Exhibition of the Rational Dress Association'', (London, Wyman 1883).  Reprinted in ''Catalogue of Exhibits and Gazette, The Rational Dress Association'', (New York, Garland Publishing 1978)</ref> The Rational Dress Exhibition opened with a speech by King and ran from 18 May to 12 June 1883, before touring provincial cities.\n\nIn 1884 King left England with her companion Elizabeth, \u2018Nellie\u2019 Glen (1848?\u20131900), for Canada and the United States, where they continued the campaign for rational dress reform.  In 1886 King and Nellie Glen bought an orange grove in [[Melrose, Florida|Melrose]] in northern [[Florida]], where she soon became involved in the agrarian reform movement of the Farmers Alliance as a newspaper editor, columnist and \u2018county lecturer\u2019.<ref>On the role of 'county lecturers' , see: Theodore R Mitchell, ''Political Education in the Southern Farmers\u2019 Alliance, 1887\u20131900'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987, 57.</ref>  In 1890 King and Nellie Glen established the Melrose Ladies Literary and Debating Society, one of the first women\u2019s clubs in Florida, now known as the 'Melrose Women\u2019s Club'.<ref>Jessie Hamm Meyer, ''Leading The Way: A Century Of Service: the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs, 1895\u20131995'', Lakeland, Florida Federation of Women\u2019s Clubs, 1994, p5.</ref> King delivered her last public lecture in Melrose in 1907 on \u2018Scandal: its Right and its Wrong Side\u2019.<ref>'Scandal: Its Right and its Wrong Side' ''Gainesville Daily Sun'', 2 May 1907. Public lecture in Melrose, Florida.</ref>  She returned to New Zealand later in that year to live with her daughters and died in 1911 in [[Omata]] not far from her marital home in New Plymouth.  She was buried in a railed enclosure in the grounds of the Taranaki Cathedral Church of St Mary, with her husband, William Cutfield King and her father, Thomas Watkin Richardson.\n\n==Beliefs, principles and philosophy==\nKing believed the similarities between men and women were more significant than their differences.  She argued that the differences were amplified, to the disadvantage of both sexes, by the prevailing political, theological and domestic conventions and prejudices of British and American society. In her public addresses, publications and campaigns for cooperative housekeeping and rational dress reform she was particularly influenced by the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]].\n\n==Selected publications==\n===Books and pamphlets===\n\n*''Truth.

After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\". The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo is no longer found on its vehicles but remains the corporate emblem used in Japan.\n\n[[File:Toyota logo.svg|thumb|left|Toyota wordmark, used as the main logo until 1989 and is currently used as a corporate logo]]\n[[File: Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro P4250811.jpg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Tacoma]] TRD Pro still uses Toyota wordmark]]\n\nStill, no guidelines existed for the use of the brand name, so \"TOYOTA\", which was used throughout most of the world, led to inconsistencies in its worldwide marketing campaigns.\n\nTo remedy this, Toyota introduced a new worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand. The logo made its debut on the 1989 Toyota Celsior and quickly gained worldwide recognition. The three ovals in the new logo combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. The overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |title=Company > Vision & Philosophy > Nov/Dec 2004 |publisher=TOYOTA |accessdate=October 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022095517/http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |title=Passion &#124; Toyota Motor Corporation Global Website |publisher=Toyota-global.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024915/http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toyota AA 1936 - Picture by Bertel Schmitt.jpg|thumb|Hubcap of 1936 Toyota AA, with the old \"Toyoda\" name]]\n\nThe new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most of the vehicles themselves in 1990.\n\nIn countries or regions using [[traditional Chinese character]]s, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".<ref name=\"Crown Motors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crown-motors.com/tch/corpinfo/story.aspx|title=Crown Motors Ltd.

selling vehicles in the United States of America\n}}\nToyota first entered the [[pickup truck]] market in 1947 with the [[Toyota SB|SB]] that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the [[Toyota RK|RK]] (renamed in 1959 as the [[Toyota Stout|Stout]]) and in 1968 by the compact [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]]. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable, and many of these trucks from as early as the late 1970s are still on the road today, some with over 300,000 miles. Extended- and crew-cab versions of these small haulers were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market.\n\nRiding on the success of the [[compact pickup]]s in the US, Toyota decided to attempt to enter the traditionally domestic-dominated full-size pickup market, introducing the [[Toyota T100|T100]] for the 1993 US model year, with production ending in 1998. While having a bed at the traditional full-size length of 8 feet, the suspension and engine characteristics were still similar to that of a compact pickup. It proved to be as economical and reliable as any typical Toyota pickup, but sales never became what Toyota brass had hoped for. It was criticized as being too small to appeal to the traditional American full-size pickup buyer. Another popular full-size truck essential, a V8 engine, was never available. Additionally, the truck was at first only available as a regular cab, though Toyota addressed this shortcoming and added the Xtracab version in mid-1995.\n\nIn 1999 for the 2000 model year, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]]. The Tundra addressed criticisms that the T100 did not have the look and feel of a legitimate American-style full-size pickup. It also added the V8 engine that the T100 was criticized for not having. However, the Tundra still came up short in towing capacity as well as still feeling slightly carlike. These concerns were addressed with an even larger 2007 redesign. A stronger V6 and a second V8 engine among other things were added to the option list. As of early 2010, the Tundra has captured 16% of the full-size half-ton market in the US.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The all-new Tundra was assembled in [[San Antonio, Texas]], US. Toyota assembled around 150,000 Standard and Double Cabs, and only 70,000 Crew Max's in 2007. The smaller Tacoma (which traces its roots back to the original Hilux) was also produced at the company's San Antonio facility.\n\nOutside the United States, Toyota produced the [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]] in Standard and Double Cab, gasoline and diesel engine, and 2WD and 4WD versions. The BBC's ''Top Gear'' TV show featured two episodes of a Hilux that was deemed \"virtually indestructible\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |title=Top Gear \u2013 Episode Archive \u2013 Series 3 |publisher=BBC |date=November 23, 2003 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106115656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Luxury-type vehicles====\n{{Further|List of Lexus vehicles}}\n[[File:2012 Toyota Crown-Royal 01.jpg|thumb|right|Toyota Crown Royal]]\n\nAs of 2009, the company sold nine luxury-branded models under its Lexus division, ranging from the [[Lexus LS|LS]] sedan to [[Lexus RX|RX]] crossover and [[Lexus LX|LX]] SUV.<ref name=Toyotaworld/> Luxury-type sedans produced under the Toyota brand included the [[Toyota Century|Century]], [[Toyota Crown|Crown]], and [[Toyota Crown Majesta|Crown Majesta]].<ref name=Toyotaworld/> A limited-edition model produced for the [[Emperor of Japan]] was the [[Toyota Century Royal|Century Royal]].

After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\". The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo is no longer found on its vehicles but remains the corporate emblem used in Japan.\n\n[[File:Toyota logo.svg|thumb|left|Toyota wordmark, used as the main logo until 1989 and is currently used as a corporate logo]]\n[[File: Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro P4250811.jpg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Tacoma]] TRD Pro still uses Toyota wordmark]]\n\nStill, no guidelines existed for the use of the brand name, so \"TOYOTA\", which was used throughout most of the world, led to inconsistencies in its worldwide marketing campaigns.\n\nTo remedy this, Toyota introduced a new worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand. The logo made its debut on the 1989 Toyota Celsior and quickly gained worldwide recognition. The three ovals in the new logo combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. The overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |title=Company > Vision & Philosophy > Nov/Dec 2004 |publisher=TOYOTA |accessdate=October 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022095517/http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |title=Passion &#124; Toyota Motor Corporation Global Website |publisher=Toyota-global.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024915/http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toyota AA 1936 - Picture by Bertel Schmitt.jpg|thumb|Hubcap of 1936 Toyota AA, with the old \"Toyoda\" name]]\n\nThe new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most of the vehicles themselves in 1990.\n\nIn countries or regions using [[traditional Chinese character]]s, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".<ref name=\"Crown Motors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crown-motors.com/tch/corpinfo/story.aspx|title=Crown Motors Ltd.

selling vehicles in the United States of America\n}}\nToyota first entered the [[pickup truck]] market in 1947 with the [[Toyota SB|SB]] that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the [[Toyota RK|RK]] (renamed in 1959 as the [[Toyota Stout|Stout]]) and in 1968 by the compact [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]]. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable, and many of these trucks from as early as the late 1970s are still on the road today, some with over 300,000 miles. Extended- and crew-cab versions of these small haulers were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market.\n\nRiding on the success of the [[compact pickup]]s in the US, Toyota decided to attempt to enter the traditionally domestic-dominated full-size pickup market, introducing the [[Toyota T100|T100]] for the 1993 US model year, with production ending in 1998. While having a bed at the traditional full-size length of 8 feet, the suspension and engine characteristics were still similar to that of a compact pickup. It proved to be as economical and reliable as any typical Toyota pickup, but sales never became what Toyota brass had hoped for. It was criticized as being too small to appeal to the traditional American full-size pickup buyer. Another popular full-size truck essential, a V8 engine, was never available. Additionally, the truck was at first only available as a regular cab, though Toyota addressed this shortcoming and added the Xtracab version in mid-1995.\n\nIn 1999 for the 2000 model year, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]]. The Tundra addressed criticisms that the T100 did not have the look and feel of a legitimate American-style full-size pickup. It also added the V8 engine that the T100 was criticized for not having. However, the Tundra still came up short in towing capacity as well as still feeling slightly carlike. These concerns were addressed with an even larger 2007 redesign. A stronger V6 and a second V8 engine among other things were added to the option list. As of early 2010, the Tundra has captured 16% of the full-size half-ton market in the US.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The all-new Tundra was assembled in [[San Antonio, Texas]], US. Toyota assembled around 150,000 Standard and Double Cabs, and only 70,000 Crew Max's in 2007. The smaller Tacoma (which traces its roots back to the original Hilux) was also produced at the company's San Antonio facility.\n\nOutside the United States, Toyota produced the [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]] in Standard and Double Cab, gasoline and diesel engine, and 2WD and 4WD versions. The BBC's ''Top Gear'' TV show featured two episodes of a Hilux that was deemed \"virtually indestructible\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |title=Top Gear \u2013 Episode Archive \u2013 Series 3 |publisher=BBC |date=November 23, 2003 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106115656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Luxury-type vehicles====\n{{Further|List of Lexus vehicles}}\n[[File:2012 Toyota Crown-Royal 01.jpg|thumb|right|Toyota Crown Royal]]\n\nAs of 2009, the company sold nine luxury-branded models under its Lexus division, ranging from the [[Lexus LS|LS]] sedan to [[Lexus RX|RX]] crossover and [[Lexus LX|LX]] SUV.<ref name=Toyotaworld/> Luxury-type sedans produced under the Toyota brand included the [[Toyota Century|Century]], [[Toyota Crown|Crown]], and [[Toyota Crown Majesta|Crown Majesta]].<ref name=Toyotaworld/> A limited-edition model produced for the [[Emperor of Japan]] was the [[Toyota Century Royal|Century Royal]].
