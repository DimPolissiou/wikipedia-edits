Oral history shared through generations of ancestry recorded that Leone did not experience starvation nor the lack of food during this famine. Instead, the village had an abundance of food and other necessities, hence the name \u201cLeone\u201d which derives from \u201cLe\u201d (No) and \u201cOne\u201d (Famine). During this famine, the villagers in Leone provided food and commodities for nearby villages and for families from a farther distance. This has earned the village the prestigious title \u201cLeone o le Tin\u0101 o le Alofa\u201d, which means \u201cLeone is the Mother of Love.\u201d The village's musical emblem is a living recording of this historical representation.<ref>Fai\u2019ivae, Alex Godinet (2018).

The school's purpose was to train locals to become missionaries. Later, the school became a part of the [[Congregational Christian Church in American Samoa]] (CCCAS). In 1862, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] arrived in Leone under the stewardship of Father Elloy. The Catholics initially encountered strong opposition for some of the village chiefs. On April 17, 1900, four of its traditional chiefs, PCs Tuitele and Faiivae, and HTCs Olo and Leoso (Tama Matua), signed the [[Deed of Cession of Tutuila|Deed of Cession]], which officially formed the current relationship with American Samoa and the [[United States]].

In 1922, the Leone Rapid Transit began operations, announcing two trips per day at a round trip fare of $2.00. It was a result of $30,000 earmarked for road construction by Governor [[Waldo A.

The swamp has been a natural resource for marine life growth and is home to a number of bird species. Aualii Stream and Leafu Stream flow down from Mulimauga Ridge and through the village before discharging into Pala Lagoon. Leone has a large number of [[mangrove tree]]s which have come back to normal after the destruction caused by the [[2009 tsunami]]. The village is home to large parcels of fertile land used for farming and livestock. The soil is excellent for planting and growing yams of all kinds, bananas, talo, papayas, coconut trees for copra products, vegetables, and many other crops that are sold in grocery stores and at the [[Fagatogo Market]]. The coastline of [[Fagatele]], an area in Leone, is made up of lava rocks, which were historically utilized to shape and grind stone tools.<ref>Fai\u2019ivae, Alex Godinet (2018).

The petroglyphs were the first to be discovered in the territory when they were found during Dr. [[Yosihiko Sinoto]]\u2019s archeological site surveys in 1961 and 1962. The petroglyphs include two representations of what is assumed to be two octopuses, fe'e. Another petroglyph is that of a turtle, laumei, while the fourth figure seems to represent a human figure. The petroglyphs are located in the Leone Lagoon on an intrusive shelf of ash called Papaloa. It consists of three shelves separated by two eroded channels of shallow water. The length of the shelf is around 150-200 feet.<ref>http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_76_1967/Volume_76%2C_No._3/Additional_petroglyphs_from_American_Samoa%2C_by_William_K._Kikuchi%2C_p_372_-_373/p1</ref><ref>http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_73_1964/Volume_73%2C_No._2/Petroglyphs_in_American_Samoa%2C_by_William_K._Kikuchi%2C_p_163_-_166/p1</ref>\n\nThe Leone Bay petroglyphs take the form of figurative engravings or rock carvings and have been engraved into the stone surface by pecking (hammering the stone with a sharp instrument), bruising (rubbing the surface with another stone), and abrading (a combination of bruising and pecking). In 1966, rock previously covered with algae was exposed and more petroglyphs were discovered. These took the shape of what appeared to be an octopus, a jellyfish, a turtle, and an incomplete human figure.<ref>Mallon, Sean (2002). ''Samoan Art and Artists''. University of Hawaii Press.

From this settlement of the 16th century [[Tongans]], the warriors of Tutuila Island went to war with the Tongans under the leadership of Fu\u0101'autoa, who later became known as Mauga. The Tongans were startled by the surprise attack, and they sailed away and promised to never to return to Tutuila as warriors, but rather as partners and peacemakers.\n* Mauga o Alii (Mountain of Chiefs). In prehistoric times, villagers would hear loud ringing sounds from the middle of the tall mountains behind the village just before the death of a prominent chief. It was a premonition in the premodern days; according to some of the elders, the ringing sounds can still be heard today.\n* A historic monument dedicated to Reverend [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] is located in front of the Leone Congregational Christian Church (Siona).\n\nA memorial woman sculpture is located by the sea and was placed there in order to signify the site where the first missionaries arrived in Leone.<ref>Fai\u2019ivae, Alex Godinet (2018).

Oral history shared through generations of ancestry recorded that Leone did not experience starvation nor the lack of food during this famine. Instead, the village had an abundance of food and other necessities, hence the name \u201cLeone\u201d which derives from \u201cLe\u201d (No) and \u201cOne\u201d (Famine). During this famine, the villagers in Leone provided food and commodities for nearby villages and for families from a farther distance. This has earned the village the prestigious title \u201cLeone o le Tin\u0101 o le Alofa\u201d, which means \u201cLeone is the Mother of Love.\u201d The village's musical emblem is a living recording of this historical representation.<ref>Fai\u2019ivae, Alex Godinet (2018).

Majolus was very active in reforming individual communities of monks and canons; first, as a personal commission, requested and authorized by the Emperor or other nobility. Later, he found it more effective to affiliate some of the foundations to the motherhouse at Cluny to lessen the likelihood of later relapse. \n  \nHe travelled widely and was recognized as a person of influence both at Rome and the Imperial court. He is buried at the Priory of Souvigny, along with St. Odilo, the fifth abbot of Cluny, and commemorated individually on May 11, and also on April 29 with four other early abbots of Cluny. \n\n==''Vitae''==\nThere are two \"lives\" written about Majolus: one by Syrius, a monk of Cluny; and one by [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]], the fifth abbot of Cluny.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wLkmSBuUxeoC&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=Miracles+of+Majolus&source=bl&ots=KR9lmbYNWc&sig=ACfU3U08CCRIOR19QhARdZEyjZfdGhr3vg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX27-G54PjAhVCCc0KHQwhBG8Q6AEwB3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Miracles%20of%20Majolus&f=false Duckett, Eleanor Shipley.

His mother was named Raimodis. They had two sons: Majolus and Cynricus. It is not known for sure which was the older, but traditionally the younger sons of noble families were given to the church and the elder sons were made the heirs to the father's estate, hence because Majolus became a monk, it is sometimes assumed he is the younger.<ref name=\"Smith1920\">{{cite book|first=Lucy Margaret|last=Smith|title=The Early History of the Monastery of Cluny|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=1920|url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyhistoryofmo00smit/earlyhistoryofmo00smit_djvu.txt|page=100|access-date=7 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nAround 916, Majolus fled his family's estates near [[Rietz]] to stay with relatives at [[M\u00e2con]] due to the feudal wars.<ref name=Souvigny>[http://www.ville-souvigny.com/Souvigny/Culture/Culture_Saint_Mayeul_Ang.html \"Majolus of Cluny: biography\", Ville de Souvigny]</ref>  Both his parents died while he was young.\n\n===Lyons and Macon===\nMajolus studied the liberal arts at [[Lyon]] and became canon, and later [[archdeacon]] of [[M\u00e2con]]; his ordination to the priesthood was in M\u00e2con. While in M\u00e2con he gave classes to a large body of clerks for free.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 102}} He built a small oratory on the opposite side of the river from the town, where he would retire for prayer. In personal habits he was always kind, never telling lies, detraction or flattery, and he was severe against sinners, if it was necessary to call them to repent. He gained a reputation among the local people as a holy person and so when [[Besan\u00e7on]] needed a new bishop, many people, called on him to become bishop, but he refused.<ref name=Souvigny/>\n\nThere was a famine at the time and Majolus prayed for help for those begging for food. One day as he prayed seven solidi (gold coins) appeared in front of him. He was afraid that this was a trick from the devil or that the money was lost, and he wouldn't touch it. But when he discovered the money was real and no one claimed it, he then used it to buy food for the poor that were starving.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 134}} \n\n===Monk===\nHe decided instead to enter [[Cluny Abbey]], which he had visited previously. [[Aymard of Cluny]] was Abbot at the time. Aymard appointed Majolus \"armarius\" (book-keeper and master of ceremonies). He was later made librarian. He had read the poems of Virgil and he considered that monks should not read these works, but that the Bible alone was enough for them. He was very harsh in the discipline he applied to new monks.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 103}}\n\nHe was sent with a fellow monk from Cluny to Rome, on one occasion, and on the return journey his companion became sick. Majolus waited by the suffering monk for three days with much anxiety, and on the third night he dreamed that he saw a white-haired old man who said 'Why art thou cast down in idle grief? Hast thou forgotten what my brother James orders for the sick?' He then woke up and realized that it was referring to the sacrament of extreme unction mentioned in the letter of James (5:14-15). He then anointed his brother-monk with the holy oil and the sick monk then started to recover from his illness. This miracle was then told at Cluny, and the monks held Majolus in veneration.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 103}}\n\n===Abbot of Cluny===\nAround 948, Majolus became coadjutor to Abbot Aymard. Aymard became blind, and he resigned his abbacy, recommending that the monks choose to elect a new abbot and suggested they choose Majolus as abbot, but he refused. However, Majolus dreamt that St Benedict appeared to him and told him to accept the responsibility of the office and that this book would be his guide. The next day Majolus addressed the monks and said, \"Now in Him who is able to smooth over rough places, to raise up heavy burdens, and to overthrow the adversary, I place my hope, and submit myself to your unchanged command.\"{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 104}} Majolus became abbot about the year 954.<ref name=Souvigny/>\n\nThe construction of Cluny II, ca. 955\u2013981, begun after the destructive Hungarian raids of 953, led the tendency for Burgundian churches to be stone-vaulted. The replacement abbey church of Cluny II was consecrated in 981. The relics of Peter and Paul were taken from Rome to Cluny during Majolus' abbacy.\n\n===Captivity===\nIn 972 when Majolus visited the Imperial Court in Pavia and returned through the alps by way of the [[Little St Bernard Pass|Saint Bernard Pass]]<ref>\"The Italian Cities and the Arabs before 1095\", Hilmar C. Krueger, ''A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years'', Vol.I, ed. Kenneth Meyer Setton, Marshall W. Baldwin, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1955), 51.</ref> in Provence. A number of monks and others accompanying were captured by the Saracens from the stronghold of [[Fraxinet]]. Much venerated by his monks, a ransom was quickly raised. The monks responded, however, once their abbot was released, by stirring up a fury in Provence against the raiders. The peasantry and the nobles together implored their overlord [[William I of Provence|William Count of Provence]], to act.\n\nWilliam, equally disturbed by the treatment of the abbot, raised a feudal host and took to the offensive. His army consisted not only of men from Provence, but also the lower Dauphin\u00e9 and Nice. He defeated the Saracen raiders at the [[Battle of Tourtour]], thus securing the mountain passes.\n\n===Political life===\n[[File:Absidi - Monastero di San Salvatore - Capo di Ponte (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|thumb|Monastero di San Salvatore]]\nThe [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto I]] had a good relationship with Majolus, as did his wife [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelheid of Burgundy]]. In 971, Majolus founded the [[Monastero di San Salvatore (Capo di Ponte)|Monastery of San Salvatore]] in Lombardy with Adelaide's support.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tatGKpRzzmYC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=saint+majolus+of+cluny&source=bl&ots=rirstOzJoy&sig=ACfU3U1ufJAaDizhrXWyBPAWaX0zHyBjUA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjz0_Hds4PjAhVjdt8KHY4JBSg4HhDoATAIegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=saint%20majolus%20of%20cluny&f=false Blumenthal, Uta-Renate.

He supposedly predicted the Emperor's death, when he had a dream seeing a lion in a cage that burst through its chains. Majolus interpreted that as a sign that the Emperor would die that year. Not long after this dream, the Emperor did die.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 106}} \n\nIn 974 Adelheid and her son [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]], summoned Majolus to Italy to make him Pope, but Majolus refused. Otto II married [[Theophanu]], a relative of the Byzantine Emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]]. She was frequently at odds with her mother-in-law, Adelaide, which caused an estrangement between mother and son. In Pavia, around 980, Otto II and his mother, the dowager empress, were reconciled after years of being apart, in part through the efforts of Majolus. This episode and other convinced contemporaries of the influence that Majolus and Cluny had over the Emperor. Majolus advised the Emperor against his Italian campaign in 983, telling him that he would die if he went on it,{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 108}} and the Emperor died in that year.\n\n==Monastic Reform ==\nUp until that time, Benedictine houses were autonomous. The Cluniac reform movement had already begun with [[Berno of Cluny]] at the beginning of the 10th century, but the monasteries reformed by the monks of Cluny during the tenures of [[Odo of Cluny|Odo]] and Aymard (2nd and 3rd abbots of Cluny) remained independent of Cluny. Reform was the personal work of the abbot, and it was not uncommon for the abbots of Cluny to hold abbacies at two or more monasteries. The relationship, however, was with the abbot, not with Cluny, and on the death of the abbot, rather than the position reverting to Cluny, the monks continued to elect their own successor abbot.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lxP9lEHFbNAC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=cluniac+reform+%2B+Majolus&source=bl&ots=vXqcfD2kha&sig=ACfU3U1OaW2oYgOlmFvZTxz8qRzkZE8Pow&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiKt_HXwYPjAhUJheAKHeOxAHkQ6AEwCXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=cluniac%20reform%20%2B%20Majolus&f=false Iogna-Prat, Dominique.

In the 980s [[Henry I, Duke of Burgundy]] asked Majolus to take charge of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain d'Auxerre]]. Majolus would appoint a prior to manage things in his absence, but not necessarily a monk of Cluny. \n[[File:Paray-le-Monial Basilique Sacr\u00e9-Coeur 08.jpg|thumb|left|Paray-le-Monial Basilique Sacr\u00e9-Coeur]]\nUnder Majolus, a network of monasteries dependent under Cluny's leadership began to take shape and would continue to develop under Majolus' successors Odilo and Hugh. In 965, the Empress Adelaide placed [[Payerne Priory]] under Cluny Abbey. The [[Basilica of Paray-le-Monial|Priory of Paray-le-Monial]] was founded by [[Lambert of Chalon]] and his wife, Adelaide of Chalon, both friends of Abbot Majolus, in 973 as a house of Cluny.<ref>Bouchard, Constance Brittain (1987).

Cluny was not known for the severity of its discipline or its asceticism, but the abbots of Cluny supported the revival of the papacy and the reforms of Pope Gregory VII. The Cluniac establishment found itself closely identified with the Papacy. The Popes in this time period were strongly supportive to Cluny and they placed the penalty of excommunication upon anyone who disturbed or usurped Cluny's rights.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 115}}\n\n==Character==\nMajolus was revered in his own time as a holy man. He spent much time in prayer and solitude, he rebuked sinners, he disliked public praise and high honours, but he would do much good in secret away from the eyes of the public. Whenever he went on a journey he would have an open book in his hand, which could be either a spiritual or philosophical work, which he would read as he rode. He had great knowledge of the scriptures and other subjects, but would never show off his knowledge to anyone, and would only speak when asked his opinion on something. He always spoke very briefly. He was not extreme in asceticism, whenever he sat down at table with the rich or powerful, he would eat the same things they would; he wore decent clothes that were neither too shabby nor too expensive. He drank a little wine. He was said to be a very gentle and kind person.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 131}}\n\n== Miracles ==\nA number of miracles were attributed to Majolus even during his lifetime. Majolus was said to have cured the sick, restored sight to the blind, healed those bitten by serpent, dogs or wolves, he also miraculously rescued people from death by drowning or fire. Among the stories of miracles attributed to him, the following are here related:\n\nOnce when Majolus was returning from Aquitaine, he decided to visit a monastery along the way and sent a messenger ahead of him to say he was coming. The monks of this monastery were happy that he was coming, but the purveyor of the monastery felt bad because they had run out of fish. However, the purveyor of the monastery told the monks to go down to the river and call on the name of Majolus, and when they did, they caught an enormously large salmon.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 137}}\n\nThe water that Majolus used to wash his hands in was said to have healing powers. Once in Vallavaense a blind mendicant caught hold of Majolus' bridle as he was leaving the town and begged Majolus to bless water in a jar he had brought. Majolus was moved by this show of faith and so he blessed the water. The beggar then washed his eyes with the water and received his sight.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 139}}\n\nOne time several pilgrims returning from his tomb reached the Loire river and they could not cross it because the boat was on the other side, and the boatman refused to come over for them. They called on the name of Majolus, and the boat crossed over by itself to them, waited for them to enter, and when they got in, it took them without being rowed to the other side of the river.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 141}}\n\nA woman who brought her dead child to Majolus' tomb in Souvigny. She put the body of her child in front of the altar, where it remained the whole night. At nine o'clock in the morning the eyes of the boy opened and the boy called for his mother, who ran to him.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 141}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Tombeau Mayeul Odilon.jpg|thumb|Tombs of Mayeul and Odilo, Souvigny]]\nMajolus lived to the old age of 84. Two years before he died, he gave up the abbacy and made [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]] his coadjutor, just as Aymard had done with him many years earlier. He retired to one of the smaller Cluniac houses where he devoted time to serving the brothers there by instruction, correction and inspiration. He continued to work even into his old age, and he died on his way to reform  [[Saint Denis Basilica|Saint-Denis]] in Paris. He did not get far and stopped at [[Souvigny Priory]], where he died and was buried.\n\n==Veneration==\nAfter he died, the monks at Cluny wanted to bring him to Cluny, but the monks at Sovigny protested and insisted that he remain there.

Majolus was very active in reforming individual communities of monks and canons; first, as a personal commission, requested and authorized by the Emperor or other nobility. Later, he found it more effective to affiliate some of the foundations to the motherhouse at Cluny to lessen the likelihood of later relapse. \n  \nHe travelled widely and was recognized as a person of influence both at Rome and the Imperial court. He is buried at the Priory of Souvigny, along with St. Odilo, the fifth abbot of Cluny, and commemorated individually on May 11, and also on April 29 with four other early abbots of Cluny. \n\n==''Vitae''==\nThere are two \"lives\" written about Majolus: one by Syrius, a monk of Cluny; and one by [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]], the fifth abbot of Cluny.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wLkmSBuUxeoC&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=Miracles+of+Majolus&source=bl&ots=KR9lmbYNWc&sig=ACfU3U08CCRIOR19QhARdZEyjZfdGhr3vg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX27-G54PjAhVCCc0KHQwhBG8Q6AEwB3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Miracles%20of%20Majolus&f=false Duckett, Eleanor Shipley.

His mother was named Raimodis. They had two sons: Majolus and Cynricus. It is not known for sure which was the older, but traditionally the younger sons of noble families were given to the church and the elder sons were made the heirs to the father's estate, hence because Majolus became a monk, it is sometimes assumed he is the younger.<ref name=\"Smith1920\">{{cite book|first=Lucy Margaret|last=Smith|title=The Early History of the Monastery of Cluny|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=1920|url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyhistoryofmo00smit/earlyhistoryofmo00smit_djvu.txt|page=100|access-date=7 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nAround 916, Majolus fled his family's estates near [[Rietz]] to stay with relatives at [[M\u00e2con]] due to the feudal wars.<ref name=Souvigny>[http://www.ville-souvigny.com/Souvigny/Culture/Culture_Saint_Mayeul_Ang.html \"Majolus of Cluny: biography\", Ville de Souvigny]</ref>  Both his parents died while he was young.\n\n===Lyons and Macon===\nMajolus studied the liberal arts at [[Lyon]] and became canon, and later [[archdeacon]] of [[M\u00e2con]]; his ordination to the priesthood was in M\u00e2con. While in M\u00e2con he gave classes to a large body of clerks for free.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 102}} He built a small oratory on the opposite side of the river from the town, where he would retire for prayer. In personal habits he was always kind, never telling lies, detraction or flattery, and he was severe against sinners, if it was necessary to call them to repent. He gained a reputation among the local people as a holy person and so when [[Besan\u00e7on]] needed a new bishop, many people, called on him to become bishop, but he refused.<ref name=Souvigny/>\n\nThere was a famine at the time and Majolus prayed for help for those begging for food. One day as he prayed seven solidi (gold coins) appeared in front of him. He was afraid that this was a trick from the devil or that the money was lost, and he wouldn't touch it. But when he discovered the money was real and no one claimed it, he then used it to buy food for the poor that were starving.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 134}} \n\n===Monk===\nHe decided instead to enter [[Cluny Abbey]], which he had visited previously. [[Aymard of Cluny]] was Abbot at the time. Aymard appointed Majolus \"armarius\" (book-keeper and master of ceremonies). He was later made librarian. He had read the poems of Virgil and he considered that monks should not read these works, but that the Bible alone was enough for them. He was very harsh in the discipline he applied to new monks.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 103}}\n\nHe was sent with a fellow monk from Cluny to Rome, on one occasion, and on the return journey his companion became sick. Majolus waited by the suffering monk for three days with much anxiety, and on the third night he dreamed that he saw a white-haired old man who said 'Why art thou cast down in idle grief? Hast thou forgotten what my brother James orders for the sick?' He then woke up and realized that it was referring to the sacrament of extreme unction mentioned in the letter of James (5:14-15). He then anointed his brother-monk with the holy oil and the sick monk then started to recover from his illness. This miracle was then told at Cluny, and the monks held Majolus in veneration.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 103}}\n\n===Abbot of Cluny===\nAround 948, Majolus became coadjutor to Abbot Aymard. Aymard became blind, and he resigned his abbacy, recommending that the monks choose to elect a new abbot and suggested they choose Majolus as abbot, but he refused. However, Majolus dreamt that St Benedict appeared to him and told him to accept the responsibility of the office and that this book would be his guide. The next day Majolus addressed the monks and said, \"Now in Him who is able to smooth over rough places, to raise up heavy burdens, and to overthrow the adversary, I place my hope, and submit myself to your unchanged command.\"{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 104}} Majolus became abbot about the year 954.<ref name=Souvigny/>\n\nThe construction of Cluny II, ca. 955\u2013981, begun after the destructive Hungarian raids of 953, led the tendency for Burgundian churches to be stone-vaulted. The replacement abbey church of Cluny II was consecrated in 981. The relics of Peter and Paul were taken from Rome to Cluny during Majolus' abbacy.\n\n===Captivity===\nIn 972 when Majolus visited the Imperial Court in Pavia and returned through the alps by way of the [[Little St Bernard Pass|Saint Bernard Pass]]<ref>\"The Italian Cities and the Arabs before 1095\", Hilmar C. Krueger, ''A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years'', Vol.I, ed. Kenneth Meyer Setton, Marshall W. Baldwin, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1955), 51.</ref> in Provence. A number of monks and others accompanying were captured by the Saracens from the stronghold of [[Fraxinet]]. Much venerated by his monks, a ransom was quickly raised. The monks responded, however, once their abbot was released, by stirring up a fury in Provence against the raiders. The peasantry and the nobles together implored their overlord [[William I of Provence|William Count of Provence]], to act.\n\nWilliam, equally disturbed by the treatment of the abbot, raised a feudal host and took to the offensive. His army consisted not only of men from Provence, but also the lower Dauphin\u00e9 and Nice. He defeated the Saracen raiders at the [[Battle of Tourtour]], thus securing the mountain passes.\n\n===Political life===\n[[File:Absidi - Monastero di San Salvatore - Capo di Ponte (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|thumb|Monastero di San Salvatore]]\nThe [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto I]] had a good relationship with Majolus, as did his wife [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelheid of Burgundy]]. In 971, Majolus founded the [[Monastero di San Salvatore (Capo di Ponte)|Monastery of San Salvatore]] in Lombardy with Adelaide's support.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tatGKpRzzmYC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=saint+majolus+of+cluny&source=bl&ots=rirstOzJoy&sig=ACfU3U1ufJAaDizhrXWyBPAWaX0zHyBjUA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjz0_Hds4PjAhVjdt8KHY4JBSg4HhDoATAIegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=saint%20majolus%20of%20cluny&f=false Blumenthal, Uta-Renate.

He supposedly predicted the Emperor's death, when he had a dream seeing a lion in a cage that burst through its chains. Majolus interpreted that as a sign that the Emperor would die that year. Not long after this dream, the Emperor did die.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 106}} \n\nIn 974 Adelheid and her son [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]], summoned Majolus to Italy to make him Pope, but Majolus refused. Otto II married [[Theophanu]], a relative of the Byzantine Emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]]. She was frequently at odds with her mother-in-law, Adelaide, which caused an estrangement between mother and son. In Pavia, around 980, Otto II and his mother, the dowager empress, were reconciled after years of being apart, in part through the efforts of Majolus. This episode and other convinced contemporaries of the influence that Majolus and Cluny had over the Emperor. Majolus advised the Emperor against his Italian campaign in 983, telling him that he would die if he went on it,{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 108}} and the Emperor died in that year.\n\n==Monastic Reform ==\nUp until that time, Benedictine houses were autonomous. The Cluniac reform movement had already begun with [[Berno of Cluny]] at the beginning of the 10th century, but the monasteries reformed by the monks of Cluny during the tenures of [[Odo of Cluny|Odo]] and Aymard (2nd and 3rd abbots of Cluny) remained independent of Cluny. Reform was the personal work of the abbot, and it was not uncommon for the abbots of Cluny to hold abbacies at two or more monasteries. The relationship, however, was with the abbot, not with Cluny, and on the death of the abbot, rather than the position reverting to Cluny, the monks continued to elect their own successor abbot.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lxP9lEHFbNAC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=cluniac+reform+%2B+Majolus&source=bl&ots=vXqcfD2kha&sig=ACfU3U1OaW2oYgOlmFvZTxz8qRzkZE8Pow&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiKt_HXwYPjAhUJheAKHeOxAHkQ6AEwCXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=cluniac%20reform%20%2B%20Majolus&f=false Iogna-Prat, Dominique.

In 972 Otto appointed Majolus abbot of [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe|Sant'Apollinare in Classe]], near Ravenna.

In the 980s [[Henry I, Duke of Burgundy]] asked Majolus to take charge of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain d'Auxerre]]. Majolus would appoint a prior to manage things in his absence, but not necessarily a monk of Cluny. \n[[File:Paray-le-Monial Basilique Sacr\u00e9-Coeur 08.jpg|thumb|left|Paray-le-Monial Basilique Sacr\u00e9-Coeur]]\nUnder Majolus, a network of monasteries dependent under Cluny's leadership began to take shape and would continue to develop under Majolus' successors Odilo and Hugh. In 965, the Empress Adelaide placed [[Payerne Priory]] under Cluny Abbey. The [[Basilica of Paray-le-Monial|Priory of Paray-le-Monial]] was founded by [[Lambert of Chalon]] and his wife, Adelaide of Chalon, both friends of Abbot Majolus, in 973 as a house of Cluny.<ref>Bouchard, Constance Brittain (1987).

Cluny was not known for the severity of its discipline or its asceticism, but the abbots of Cluny supported the revival of the papacy and the reforms of Pope Gregory VII. The Cluniac establishment found itself closely identified with the Papacy. The Popes in this time period were strongly supportive to Cluny and they placed the penalty of excommunication upon anyone who disturbed or usurped Cluny's rights.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 115}}\n\n==Character==\nMajolus was revered in his own time as a holy man. He spent much time in prayer and solitude, he rebuked sinners, he disliked public praise and high honours, but he would do much good in secret away from the eyes of the public. Whenever he went on a journey he would have an open book in his hand, which could be either a spiritual or philosophical work, which he would read as he rode. He had great knowledge of the scriptures and other subjects, but would never show off his knowledge to anyone, and would only speak when asked his opinion on something. He always spoke very briefly. He was not extreme in asceticism, whenever he sat down at table with the rich or powerful, he would eat the same things they would; he wore decent clothes that were neither too shabby nor too expensive. He drank a little wine. He was said to be a very gentle and kind person.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 131}}\n\n== Miracles ==\nA number of miracles were attributed to Majolus even during his lifetime. Majolus was said to have cured the sick, restored sight to the blind, healed those bitten by serpent, dogs or wolves, he also miraculously rescued people from death by drowning or fire. Among the stories of miracles attributed to him, the following are here related:\n\nOnce when Majolus was returning from Aquitaine, he decided to visit a monastery along the way and sent a messenger ahead of him to say he was coming. The monks of this monastery were happy that he was coming, but the purveyor of the monastery felt bad because they had run out of fish. However, the purveyor of the monastery told the monks to go down to the river and call on the name of Majolus, and when they did, they caught an enormously large salmon.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 137}}\n\nThe water that Majolus used to wash his hands in was said to have healing powers. Once in Vallavaense a blind mendicant caught hold of Majolus' bridle as he was leaving the town and begged Majolus to bless water in a jar he had brought. Majolus was moved by this show of faith and so he blessed the water. The beggar then washed his eyes with the water and received his sight.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 139}}\n\nOne time several pilgrims returning from his tomb reached the Loire river and they could not cross it because the boat was on the other side, and the boatman refused to come over for them. They called on the name of Majolus, and the boat crossed over by itself to them, waited for them to enter, and when they got in, it took them without being rowed to the other side of the river.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 141}}\n\nA woman who brought her dead child to Majolus' tomb in Souvigny. She put the body of her child in front of the altar, where it remained the whole night. At nine o'clock in the morning the eyes of the boy opened and the boy called for his mother, who ran to him.{{sfn|Smith 1920, p. 141}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Tombeau Mayeul Odilon.jpg|thumb|Tombs of Mayeul and Odilo, Souvigny]]\nMajolus lived to the old age of 84. Two years before he died, he gave up the abbacy and made [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]] his coadjutor, just as Aymard had done with him many years earlier. He retired to one of the smaller Cluniac houses where he devoted time to serving the brothers there by instruction, correction and inspiration. He continued to work even into his old age, and he died on his way to reform  [[Saint Denis Basilica|Saint-Denis]] in Paris. He did not get far and stopped at [[Souvigny Priory]], where he died and was buried.\n\n==Veneration==\nAfter he died, the monks at Cluny wanted to bring him to Cluny, but the monks at Sovigny protested and insisted that he remain there.

They are supplied with rudimentary materials, tools, and a small supply of food and water. How they use these resources is up to them.<ref name=\"Discovery\" />\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*[[Filtration|Water Filter]]: The Los Angeles River is the colonists' main water source, but the water is unsafe to drink without filtration. The plan is to puncture small holes in a 55-gallon drum, and fill it with multiple layers of [[sand]] and [[charcoal]] to filter out impurities such as [[algae]], [[lead]], and [[E. coli]]. The water is then to be [[boiled]] to remove bacteria, as only then will they have a safe water supply.\n*Cooktop: To cook their food, the colonists suspend a steel plate over a fire inside a steel drum.\n*Giant Bed: Using some [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]], [[pallets]], [[box-spring]]s, fabric and foam, the colonists assemble a giant bed to sleep on.\n*[[Security guard|Night Watch]]: In this post-apocalyptic world, security can be compromised at any time, so at night one or two colonists stays up to look after the others at certain times through the night.\n*Battery Array: To get electricity, the colonists [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] twenty 12-volt car [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] in parallel to maximise the [[Electric current|current]]. They then convert the [[direct current]] to [[alternating current]] using an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]]. It provides just enough power to last just a week, so a generator will need to be built to recharge the batteries.\n*[[Cistern]]: Keeping a supply of drinking water is crucial to the colonists' survival. To guarantee a steady supply, they move the filter on a warehouse shelf and places a large container beneath it.\n*Rain Catching: When a rare LA storm approaches, Mike and John V. modify the [[Rain gutter|gutter]]s of the warehouse to catch and stockpile [[rain]]water, thus saving them a river trip.\n*[[Laundry]]: Because of the grime on the roof, the first part of the collected rainwater is too dirty to drink, but it is suitable for laundry. Without detergent, the colonists improvise using [[baking soda]], and to clean their clothes they use a piece of [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated steel]] as a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]].<ref name=\"Discovery\" />\n\n===Episode 2===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 6: [[Sustainable Energy]]\n| Fuel Shortage\n| With the battery array running out of power, the colonists need to build a generator and find a plentiful fuel source.\n|-\n| Phase 7: Foraging\n| Resource Acquisition\n| With a lack of food, the colonists go out to acquire more food for the colony. They acquire a small supply of canned goods, fresh fruit, and a pair of goats.\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*[[Engine-generator|Generator]]: The immediate priority is power, and with the batteries having only a few days worth of power left, a generator needs to be built. The plan is to scavenge an [[engine]] from a [[pressure washer]], a [[pulley]] system from a ventilation fan, and a car [[alternator]]. The engine's drive shaft must turn the pulley and the pulley must spin the alternator. Just like in a car the alternator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, which is needed to charge the battery array.\n*[[Wood Gas Generator|Wood Gasifier]]: To keep the generator engine running they will need a constant fuel supply. One way is to scavenge for gasoline, but that method is dangerous and barely sustainable. John C. proposed building a gasifier after noticing an abundance of wood. A gasifier is two containers each holding wood scraps. The wood in the first container is used to build a fire. The fire heats the wood in the second container releasing a flammable vapor called [[wood gas]]. The wood gas is then piped directly into the generator engine.\n*Escape Vehicle: Everyone agrees that the warehouse, or the city for that matter, is not an ideal place for long-term survival in this post-apocalyptic world. Noticing a broken-down [[flatbed truck]] out on the yard, everyone brings it inside the warehouse and into the main work area so it can later be used for their exodus.<ref name=\"Discovery\" />\n\n===Episode 3===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 8: Creature Comforts\n| Recreating Home\n| With a power source for their tools, the colonists decide to make a shower and other smaller comforts to improve morale.\n|-\n| Phase 9: River Trip\n| Resource Scarcity\n| Running out of water and tired of eating canned goods, the colonists head to the river to acquire water, fresh fish, and citrus.\n|-\n| Phase 10: Power On\n| Outside Contact\n| Discovering the small television is on and is receiving an emergency signal, the colonists who did not leave the colony to go on the river trip discover that the power from the grid has been turned on for a short time.\n|-\n| Phase 11: Colony Attack\n| Resource Competition\n| Not paying attention to security, the colonists are surprised by an attack on the warehouse by marauders and thieves, and they lose two days worth of food afterwards. The marauders were given instructions not to physically harm the colonists, but the colonists don't know that and accidents can happen.\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*Solar Shower: The immediate project is a shower. A [[Water heating|tank]] of water on the roof uses [[solar energy]] to heat the water inside. The tank is painted black to maximize heat absorption, has [[Mirror|reflectors]] aimed at it to increase heat absorption, and is [[shrink wrap]]ped to preserve the heat.  A garden hose hooked to it pours the water down into a wood and fiberglass structure.  The [[gray water]] is then piped out of the box and into a bucket.  Water is pulled up by a [[bicycle]] pulley to the roof.\n*Fish Trap: Amy makes a [[fish net]] to help with fishing in the river.\n*Visual Diary: Morgan starts a picture [[diary]] about the colony's day activities in the Hieroglyphic room.\n\n===Episode 4===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 12: Security\n| Safety From Attack\n| After being surprised by an attack from marauders and thieves, the colonists agree to increase their security on the warehouse.\n|-\n| Phase 13: Traders\n| Negotiation Skills\n| A group of gun-toting traders arrive to trade with the colonists.\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*Warehouse Fortification: The immediate project is securing the warehouse with better defenses.  Joey fixes the hole in the back wall that was previously breached by putting trash on the stairs.  He also puts chainlink on the wall where they were previously attacked to prevent any openings in the wall and puts wooden board secured with metal screws to keep the front door shut.\n*Weapons: The colonists build a series of weapons for defending their home.  John C. creates a [[flamethrower]] and a large [[taser]] that can be used from a few feet away.  Vladimir starts building [[Improvised explosive device|claymore mines]] out of some small materials.\n*Gym: Leilani builds a small gym to teach everyone self-defense for when they need to leave the warehouse.  She makes a [[punching bag]] by filling a [[nylon]] bag with dirt from the yard and suspending it with chains.\n*[[Trade|Trading]]: The colonists send Joey and Mike to trade goods with the traders outside.  They trade an [[air compressor]] and [[jackhammer]] for a ten-kilowatt generator and five gallons of gasoline.  They also trade 157 oranges, eight cans of food, one bag of [[flour]], and one bag of [[salt]] for two [[chickens]], one jug of [[cooking oil]], one box of [[toiletries]], and nine [[Cassava|yuccas]].\n*Escape Vehicle: Mike and John V. get to work on the two-ton truck to get it running again. The colonists wish to use to leave the city and move into the country for a more sustainable existence.  Mike discovers that one of the engine's [[piston]]s and the [[carburetor]]'s [[butterfly valve]] were rusted in place and that the engine won't start. Fortunately he manages to fix them, so now the engine runs.\n\n===Episode 5===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 14: Solar Power\n| Fuel Shortage\n| Not having enough power for their fabrication needs, the team goes out scouting for renewable energy in the form of obtaining solar panels.\n|-\n| Phase 15: New Arrivals\n| Test of Unity\n| Two mysterious new colonists, Andre and Elizabeth, make their way into the complex through a locked side door, to test the team's willingness to accept outsiders and their unity against potential threats.\n|}\n'''Projects'''\n*Solar Panel Rig: Using the generator obtained from the traders in Episode 4, Mike, Joey and others set out to build a rig for the [[solar panels]] they obtained from the roof of a nearby building and along the railroad. John C. works to build a device that incorporates two [[photodiode]]s and a small motor into a solar tracking device, allowing the solar panels to follow the sun during the day, and return to starting positions at night.\n*[[Washing machine|Washing Machine]]: To make the laundry duty easier, John V. modifies the interior of a steel drum, then sets it on an angled base mounted with wheels so no water can get out. To conserve electricity, he gets the drum turning by hooking it up to a [[bicycle]] so it runs on pedal power instead.\n*Escape Vehicle: Their next objective for the escape vehicle is to get the bed stripped by removing the damaged truck bed and the remaining part of the trailer body, that way they can have something to work with.\n\n===Episode 6===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 16: Health\n| Illness and Injury\n| Five weeks of living in unsanitary conditions proves to be a health hazard for the colonists so even minor cuts and bruises need to be continuously looked after. Also, a lower intake of food has taken its toll on them physically as well.\n|-\n| Phase 17: Hospital Foraging\n| Resource Scarcity\n| Needing medical supplies, as well as food and other salvageable materials, some of the colonists enter an abandoned hospital for resources.\n|-\n| Phase 18: Disappearance\n| Coping With Loss\n| To simulate a loss in the group, George is removed from the experiment during the hospital trip. None of the colonists re informed of his whereabouts or if he will return.\n|-\n| Phase 19: Communication\n| Outside Contact\n| While grieving the loss of George, power from the grid goes on again and the television receives an emergency broadcast for a short while. With renewed hope, the colonists focus on communication with the outside world.\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*[[Clinic]]: Allison and George clean part of the lookout for a sanitary environment for a clinic. They assemble the furniture and shelving found in a typical doctors office and place a [[Weighing scale|scale]] to check the colonists' weight. The colonists' conditions are recorded in a [[medical record|journal]].\n*[[Spark-Gap Transmitter]]: John C. proposes making a rudimentary transmitter that's similar to a [[telegraph]]. It will consist of four components made from scratch. First, a [[capacitor]] is made from [[aluminium foil]] and [[glass]] sandwiched together to store electrical energy. A switch will activate a [[spark gap]] which will release the stored energy. John C. crafts a [[transformer]] that consists of a spool-like housing made of [[PVC pipe]] and [[copper wire]] to turn the electrical energy into [[radio waves]]. Finally, an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] will be wired to broadcast the radio waves over the [[AM band]]. Their messages will be transmitted in [[Morse Code]].\n*[[Receiver (radio)|Receiver]]: To go with the spark-gap transmitter, Morgan proceeds to build a receiver to go with it so they can listen in on any responses. She installs a second antenna to the roof of the warehouse and wraps a piece of insulated [[Electromagnetic coil|copper coil]] around a discarded peanut butter jar. She then hooks the receiver up to a telephone headset and later to a television to listen for any form of radio communication. By moving an [[alligator clip]] across the wires, she can pick up different AM frequencies.\n*SOS Banner: Hoping to get help from someone, Mike and Allison paint an [[SOS]] message with instructions to transmit over the AM band on a large piece of fabric and hang it on the roof.\n*[[Fireworks]]: Vladimir builds fireworks to hopefully get other survivors attention at night. For a [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] he uses [[Twine|string]], [[glue]], and charcoal from the gasifier. He then cuts [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] pipe to be used as a launcher. The fireworks themselves consists of [[gunpowder]] scavenged from [[shotgun shells]] and other flammable materials inside cardboard tubes. To safely set them off from the roof, he builds a [[detonation]] system so he can fire them from a safe distance.\n*Escape Vehicle: Joey continues work on the escape vehicle by getting to work on the truck's bed. He puts in benches, hidden compartments, and a tank to hold 75 gallons of drinking water.\n\n===Episode 7===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 20: Missionaries\n| Exploration of Faith\n| A group of missionaries walking down the river introduce the subject of faith to the colonists who are gathering water from the river.\n|-\n| Phase 21: Nomads\n| Sharing Resources\n| Two wandering nomads beg the colonists to share their dwindling resources in order to test their unity and sense of charity.\n|}\n'''Projects'''\n*[[Ozonator]]: With their propane supply gone, the colonists must find an alternative method of sterilizing the filtered water. One way is to use the cooktop to boil water, but that method isn't efficient enough to purify the amount of water they use every day. John C. gets an idea to use [[ozone]] as a way to purify their water supply. The plan is to build a [[tesla coil]] to generate ozone, then using a pump scavenged from hospital equipment, pipe the ozone into a bucket of water to be purified. John C. completes the project with some help from Mike and the colonists are now able to [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] their water.\n*[[Phonograph]]: Morgan is sick of all the stress and noise of colony life, so she decides to fix an old phonograph that she found. She discovers that the cartridge is broken, but is eventually able to fix it. The colonists celebrate by dancing.\n*[[Soap]]: After it is discovered there is a soap shortage, John C. and Allison check on the soap they made two weeks previously. They created the soap from [[lard]], [[lye]], water, [[lavender]] and [[lemon]]. As it has now set they test it and discover that it works.\n*[[Movie projector|Film Projector]]: John C. decides to fix an old film projector. The projector is missing the lamp so John C. uses the [[halogen lamp]] from a car headlight. He gets the projector running and the colonists spend the end of the day by watching some home movies that John Cohn found.\n*Escape Vehicle: Mike and Joey use body panels from cars to [[Non-military armored vehicles|armor the truck]] and protect it from projectiles.\n\n===Episode 8===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 22: Reconnaissance\n| Preparing for Departure\n| The colonists continue their preparations for departure by developing plans for reconnaissance.\n|-\n| Phase 23: Nomads\n| Reunion and Self-Preservation\n| A group of nomads arrives at the colony asking for food and water. Among them are women with children, a handicapped individual, and the wife of John Cohn, Diane.\n|-\n| Phase 24: Waterworks\n| Return of Public Utilities\n| As part of the experiment the water has been turned on to simulate the spastic nature of public utilities after a disaster, but the warehouse pipes can't take the pressure. Just as suddenly as it came on, the water is turned off.\n|-\n| Phase 25: Recon Mission\n| Supplies and Information\n| Mike and Vlad leave the safety of the warehouse to scavenge for supplies and information. When they reach a trailer park they are met with other survivors who are living in their own colony. Unfortunately for Vlad and Mike, these colonists see them as thieves trying to steal their food.\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*[[Electric Vehicle]]: Mike, John V. and John C. build a solar-powered [[Three wheeled car|trike]] using a 120-volt electric motor, car batteries and two solar panels.\n*Surveillance Dirigible: Morgan and Allison build a [[surveillance]] [[dirigible]], the plan is to inflate [[trash bags]] with [[helium]], and place them inside a net. Suspended from the net is a [[styrofoam]] [[gondola (airship)|gondola]] to which a [[surveillance camera]] is mounted and [[computer fan]]s for steering are attached. The dirigible is anchored to the ground using wires and a television so the colonists can observe from the ground.\n\n===Episode 9===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 26: Transportation\n| Preparing for Disaster\n| When a group of marauders block access to their water source and Andre and Liz return to steal their resources, the colonists focus all their efforts on their departure plan.\n|}\n'''Projects'''\n* Scout Vehicle: Mike gets to work on a [[Ford Ranchero]] in hopes of making it into a third vehicle to be used for their escape.\n* Trading: The traders return looking to haggle for items of interest that the colonists need.  The colonists trade two solar panels, two [[tires]], a bag of salt, a box of baking soda, and a kiss from Allison for ten gallons of [[propane]], five gallons of [[gasoline]], twenty gallons of water, one pound of [[beans]] and a jar of [[peanut butter]].\n* Escape Vehicle:  With a low gasoline supply the flatbed truck won't go very far, so Vlad, John C. and Diane build a bigger version of the gasifier.\n\n===Episode 10===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 27: Exodus\n| New Resources\n| In the aftermath of Mike's accident, the colonists put all of their effort into the truck.\n|-\n| Phase 28: Destination\n| Outside Contact\n| After transmitting their daily radio broadcast, the colonists receive a message from Umberto{{Citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=\"Who?

They are supplied with rudimentary materials, tools, and a small supply of food and water. How they use these resources is up to them.<ref name=\"Discovery\" />\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*[[Filtration|Water Filter]]: The Los Angeles River is the colonists' main water source, but the water is unsafe to drink without filtration. The plan is to puncture small holes in a 55-gallon drum, and fill it with multiple layers of [[sand]] and [[charcoal]] to filter out impurities such as [[algae]], [[lead]], and [[E. coli]]. The water is then to be [[boiled]] to remove bacteria, as only then will they have a safe water supply.\n*Cooktop: To cook their food, the colonists suspend a steel plate over a fire inside a steel drum.\n*Giant Bed: Using some [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]], [[pallets]], [[box-spring]]s, fabric and foam, the colonists assemble a giant bed to sleep on.\n*[[Security guard|Night Watch]]: In this post-apocalyptic world, security can be compromised at any time, so at night one or two colonists stays up to look after the others at certain times through the night.\n*Battery Array: To get electricity, the colonists [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] twenty 12-volt car [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] in parallel to maximise the [[Electric current|current]]. They then convert the [[direct current]] to [[alternating current]] using an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]]. It provides just enough power to last just a week, so a generator will need to be built to recharge the batteries.\n*[[Cistern]]: Keeping a supply of drinking water is crucial to the colonists' survival. To guarantee a steady supply, they move the filter on a warehouse shelf and places a large container beneath it.\n*Rain Catching: When a rare LA storm approaches, Mike and John V. modify the [[Rain gutter|gutter]]s of the warehouse to catch and stockpile [[rain]]water, thus saving them a river trip.\n*[[Laundry]]: Because of the grime on the roof, the first part of the collected rainwater is too dirty to drink, but it is suitable for laundry. Without detergent, the colonists improvise using [[baking soda]], and to clean their clothes they use a piece of [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated steel]] as a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]].<ref name=\"Discovery\" />\n\n===Episode 2===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 6: [[Sustainable Energy]]\n| Fuel Shortage\n| With the battery array running out of power, the colonists need to build a generator and find a plentiful fuel source.\n|-\n| Phase 7: Foraging\n| Resource Acquisition\n| With a lack of food, the colonists go out to acquire more food for the colony. They acquire a small supply of canned goods, fresh fruit, and a pair of goats.\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*[[Engine-generator|Generator]]: The immediate priority is power, and with the batteries having only a few days worth of power left, a generator needs to be built. The plan is to scavenge an [[engine]] from a [[pressure washer]], a [[pulley]] system from a ventilation fan, and a car [[alternator]]. The engine's drive shaft must turn the pulley and the pulley must spin the alternator. Just like in a car the alternator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, which is needed to charge the battery array.\n*[[Wood Gas Generator|Wood Gasifier]]: To keep the generator engine running they will need a constant fuel supply. One way is to scavenge for gasoline, but that method is dangerous and barely sustainable. John C. proposed building a gasifier after noticing an abundance of wood. A gasifier is two containers each holding wood scraps. The wood in the first container is used to build a fire. The fire heats the wood in the second container releasing a flammable vapor called [[wood gas]]. The wood gas is then piped directly into the generator engine.\n*Escape Vehicle: Everyone agrees that the warehouse, or the city for that matter, is not an ideal place for long-term survival in this post-apocalyptic world. Noticing a broken-down [[flatbed truck]] out on the yard, everyone brings it inside the warehouse and into the main work area so it can later be used for their exodus.<ref name=\"Discovery\" />\n\n===Episode 3===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 8: Creature Comforts\n| Recreating Home\n| With a power source for their tools, the colonists decide to make a shower and other smaller comforts to improve morale.\n|-\n| Phase 9: River Trip\n| Resource Scarcity\n| Running out of water and tired of eating canned goods, the colonists head to the river to acquire water, fresh fish, and citrus.\n|-\n| Phase 10: Power On\n| Outside Contact\n| Discovering the small television is on and is receiving an emergency signal, the colonists who did not leave the colony to go on the river trip discover that the power from the grid has been turned on for a short time.\n|-\n| Phase 11: Colony Attack\n| Resource Competition\n| Not paying attention to security, the colonists are surprised by an attack on the warehouse by marauders and thieves, and they lose two days worth of food afterwards. The marauders were given instructions not to physically harm the colonists, but the colonists don't know that and accidents can happen.\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*Solar Shower: The immediate project is a shower. A [[water heater|tank]] of water on the roof uses [[solar energy]] to heat the water inside. The tank is painted black to maximize heat absorption, has [[Mirror|reflectors]] aimed at it to increase heat absorption, and is [[shrink wrap]]ped to preserve the heat.  A garden hose hooked to it pours the water down into a wood and fiberglass structure.  The [[gray water]] is then piped out of the box and into a bucket.  Water is pulled up by a [[bicycle]] pulley to the roof.\n*Fish Trap: Amy makes a [[fish net]] to help with fishing in the river.\n*Visual Diary: Morgan starts a picture [[diary]] about the colony's day activities in the Hieroglyphic room.\n\n===Episode 4===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 12: Security\n| Safety From Attack\n| After being surprised by an attack from marauders and thieves, the colonists agree to increase their security on the warehouse.\n|-\n| Phase 13: Traders\n| Negotiation Skills\n| A group of gun-toting traders arrive to trade with the colonists.\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*Warehouse Fortification: The immediate project is securing the warehouse with better defenses.  Joey fixes the hole in the back wall that was previously breached by putting trash on the stairs.  He also puts chainlink on the wall where they were previously attacked to prevent any openings in the wall and puts wooden board secured with metal screws to keep the front door shut.\n*Weapons: The colonists build a series of weapons for defending their home.  John C. creates a [[flamethrower]] and a large [[taser]] that can be used from a few feet away.  Vladimir starts building [[Improvised explosive device|claymore mines]] out of some small materials.\n*Gym: Leilani builds a small gym to teach everyone self-defense for when they need to leave the warehouse.  She makes a [[punching bag]] by filling a [[nylon]] bag with dirt from the yard and suspending it with chains.\n*[[Trade|Trading]]: The colonists send Joey and Mike to trade goods with the traders outside.  They trade an [[air compressor]] and [[jackhammer]] for a ten-kilowatt generator and five gallons of gasoline.  They also trade 157 oranges, eight cans of food, one bag of [[flour]], and one bag of [[salt]] for two [[chickens]], one jug of [[cooking oil]], one box of [[toiletries]], and nine [[Cassava|yuccas]].\n*Escape Vehicle: Mike and John V. get to work on the two-ton truck to get it running again. The colonists wish to use to leave the city and move into the country for a more sustainable existence.  Mike discovers that one of the engine's [[piston]]s and the [[carburetor]]'s [[butterfly valve]] were rusted in place and that the engine won't start. Fortunately he manages to fix them, so now the engine runs.\n\n===Episode 5===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 14: Solar Power\n| Fuel Shortage\n| Not having enough power for their fabrication needs, the team goes out scouting for renewable energy in the form of obtaining solar panels.\n|-\n| Phase 15: New Arrivals\n| Test of Unity\n| Two mysterious new colonists, Andre and Elizabeth, make their way into the complex through a locked side door, to test the team's willingness to accept outsiders and their unity against potential threats.\n|}\n'''Projects'''\n*Solar Panel Rig: Using the generator obtained from the traders in Episode 4, Mike, Joey and others set out to build a rig for the [[solar panels]] they obtained from the roof of a nearby building and along the railroad. John C. works to build a device that incorporates two [[photodiode]]s and a small motor into a solar tracking device, allowing the solar panels to follow the sun during the day, and return to starting positions at night.\n*[[Washing machine|Washing Machine]]: To make the laundry duty easier, John V. modifies the interior of a steel drum, then sets it on an angled base mounted with wheels so no water can get out. To conserve electricity, he gets the drum turning by hooking it up to a [[bicycle]] so it runs on pedal power instead.\n*Escape Vehicle: Their next objective for the escape vehicle is to get the bed stripped by removing the damaged truck bed and the remaining part of the trailer body, that way they can have something to work with.\n\n===Episode 6===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 16: Health\n| Illness and Injury\n| Five weeks of living in unsanitary conditions proves to be a health hazard for the colonists so even minor cuts and bruises need to be continuously looked after. Also, a lower intake of food has taken its toll on them physically as well.\n|-\n| Phase 17: Hospital Foraging\n| Resource Scarcity\n| Needing medical supplies, as well as food and other salvageable materials, some of the colonists enter an abandoned hospital for resources.\n|-\n| Phase 18: Disappearance\n| Coping With Loss\n| To simulate a loss in the group, George is removed from the experiment during the hospital trip. None of the colonists re informed of his whereabouts or if he will return.\n|-\n| Phase 19: Communication\n| Outside Contact\n| While grieving the loss of George, power from the grid goes on again and the television receives an emergency broadcast for a short while. With renewed hope, the colonists focus on communication with the outside world.\n|}\n\n'''Projects'''\n*[[Clinic]]: Allison and George clean part of the lookout for a sanitary environment for a clinic. They assemble the furniture and shelving found in a typical doctors office and place a [[Weighing scale|scale]] to check the colonists' weight. The colonists' conditions are recorded in a [[medical record|journal]].\n*[[Spark-Gap Transmitter]]: John C. proposes making a rudimentary transmitter that's similar to a [[telegraph]]. It will consist of four components made from scratch. First, a [[capacitor]] is made from [[aluminium foil]] and [[glass]] sandwiched together to store electrical energy. A switch will activate a [[spark gap]] which will release the stored energy. John C. crafts a [[transformer]] that consists of a spool-like housing made of [[PVC pipe]] and [[copper wire]] to turn the electrical energy into [[radio waves]]. Finally, an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] will be wired to broadcast the radio waves over the [[AM band]]. Their messages will be transmitted in [[Morse Code]].\n*[[Receiver (radio)|Receiver]]: To go with the spark-gap transmitter, Morgan proceeds to build a receiver to go with it so they can listen in on any responses. She installs a second antenna to the roof of the warehouse and wraps a piece of insulated [[Electromagnetic coil|copper coil]] around a discarded peanut butter jar. She then hooks the receiver up to a telephone headset and later to a television to listen for any form of radio communication. By moving an [[alligator clip]] across the wires, she can pick up different AM frequencies.\n*SOS Banner: Hoping to get help from someone, Mike and Allison paint an [[SOS]] message with instructions to transmit over the AM band on a large piece of fabric and hang it on the roof.\n*[[Fireworks]]: Vladimir builds fireworks to hopefully get other survivors attention at night. For a [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] he uses [[Twine|string]], [[glue]], and charcoal from the gasifier. He then cuts [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] pipe to be used as a launcher. The fireworks themselves consists of [[gunpowder]] scavenged from [[shotgun shells]] and other flammable materials inside cardboard tubes. To safely set them off from the roof, he builds a [[detonation]] system so he can fire them from a safe distance.\n*Escape Vehicle: Joey continues work on the escape vehicle by getting to work on the truck's bed. He puts in benches, hidden compartments, and a tank to hold 75 gallons of drinking water.\n\n===Episode 7===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 20: Missionaries\n| Exploration of Faith\n| A group of missionaries walking down the river introduce the subject of faith to the colonists who are gathering water from the river.\n|-\n| Phase 21: Nomads\n| Sharing Resources\n| Two wandering nomads beg the colonists to share their dwindling resources in order to test their unity and sense of charity.\n|}\n'''Projects'''\n*[[Ozonator]]: With their propane supply gone, the colonists must find an alternative method of sterilizing the filtered water. One way is to use the cooktop to boil water, but that method isn't efficient enough to purify the amount of water they use every day. John C. gets an idea to use [[ozone]] as a way to purify their water supply. The plan is to build a [[tesla coil]] to generate ozone, then using a pump scavenged from hospital equipment, pipe the ozone into a bucket of water to be purified. John C. completes the project with some help from Mike and the colonists are now able to [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] their water.\n*[[Phonograph]]: Morgan is sick of all the stress and noise of colony life, so she decides to fix an old phonograph that she found. She discovers that the cartridge is broken, but is eventually able to fix it. The colonists celebrate by dancing.\n*[[Soap]]: After it is discovered there is a soap shortage, John C. and Allison check on the soap they made two weeks previously. They created the soap from [[lard]], [[lye]], water, [[lavender]] and [[lemon]]. As it has now set they test it and discover that it works.\n*[[Movie projector|Film Projector]]: John C. decides to fix an old film projector. The projector is missing the lamp so John C. uses the [[halogen lamp]] from a car headlight. He gets the projector running and the colonists spend the end of the day by watching some home movies that John Cohn found.\n*Escape Vehicle: Mike and Joey use body panels from cars to [[Non-military armored vehicles|armor the truck]] and protect it from projectiles.\n\n===Episode 8===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Phase\n!Context\n!Description\n|-\n| Phase 22: Reconnaissance\n| Preparing for Departure\n| The colonists continue their preparations for departure by developing plans for reconnaissance.\n|-\n| Phase 23: Nomads\n| Reunion and Self-Preservation\n| A group of nomads arrives at the colony asking for food and water. Among them are women with children, a handicapped individual, and the wife of John Cohn, Diane.\n|-\n| Phase 24: Waterworks\n| Return of Public Utilities\n| As part of the experiment the water has been turned on to simulate the spastic nature of public utilities after a disaster, but the warehouse pipes can't take the pressure. Just as suddenly as it came on, the water is turned off.\n|-\n| Phase 25: Recon Mission\n| Supplies and Information\n| Mike and Vlad leave the safety of the warehouse to scavenge for supplies and information. When they reach a trailer park they are met with other survivors who are living in their own colony.

Both Severianus and Theodora belonged to notable [[Hispano-Roman]] families of high social rank.<ref>Priscilla Throop, ''Isidore of Seville's Etymologies: Complete English Translation''. Vermont: MedievalMS, 2005, p. xi.</ref> His parents were members of an influential family who were instrumental in the political-religious maneuvering that [[Religious conversion|converted]] the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic kings]] from [[Arianism]] to Catholicism. The Catholic Church celebrates him and all his siblings as known saints:\n* An elder brother, [[Leander of Seville]], immediately preceded Isidore as Archbishop of Seville and, while in office, opposed King [[Liuvigild]].\n* A younger brother, [[Fulgentius of Cartagena]], served as the [[Diocese|Bishop]] of [[Astigi]] at the start of the new reign of the Catholic King [[Reccared]].\n* His sister, [[Saint Florentina|Florentina of Cartagena]], served God as a nun and allegedly ruled over forty convents and one thousand consecrated religious. This claim seems unlikely, however, given the few functioning monastic institutions in Iberia during her lifetime.<ref>Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Spain''. New York: St Martin's Press, 1995, pp. 79\u201386.</ref>\n\nIsidore received his elementary education in the Cathedral school of Seville. In this institution, the first of its kind in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], a body of learned men including Archbishop Leander of Seville taught the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]], the classic [[liberal arts]]. Isidore applied himself to study diligently enough that he quickly mastered Latin,<ref>\"His literary style, though lucid, is pedestrian\": Katherine Nell MacFarlane's observation, in \"Isidore of Seville on the Pagan Gods (Origines VIII. 11)\", ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'', New Series, '''70'''.3 (1980):1\u201340, p. 4, reflects mainstream secular opinion.</ref> and acquired some [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].\n\nTwo centuries of Gothic control of Iberia incrementally suppressed the ancient institutions, classic learning, and manners of the [[Roman Empire]]. The associated culture entered a period of long-term decline. The ruling [[Visigoths]] nevertheless showed some respect for the outward trappings of Roman culture. [[Arianism]] meanwhile took deep root among the Visigoths as the form of Christianity that they received.\n\nScholars may debate whether Isidore ever personally embraced monastic life or affiliated with any religious order, but he undoubtedly esteemed the monks highly.\n\n===Bishop of Seville===\n[[Image:Isidoro de Sevilla (Jos\u00e9 Alcoverro) 01.jpg|thumb|A statue of Isidore of Seville by [[Jos\u00e9 Alcoverro]], 1892, outside the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]], in [[Madrid]]]]\n[[Image:San Isidoro, Portada del Bautismo de la Catedral de Sevilla.jpg|thumb|[[Seville Cathedral]]. Sculpture by [[Lorenzo Mercadante|Lorenzo Mercadante de Breta\u00f1a]]]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Leander of Seville]] on 13 March 600 or 601, Isidore succeeded to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville|See of Seville]]. On his elevation to the [[Bishop|episcopate]], he immediately constituted himself as the protector of monks.\n\nIsidore recognized that the spiritual and material welfare of the people of his See depended on the assimilation of remnant Roman and ruling barbarian cultures, and consequently attempted to weld the peoples and subcultures of the Visigothic kingdom into a united nation. He used all available religious resources toward this end and succeeded. Isidore practically eradicated the heresy of [[Arianism]] and completely stifled the new [[heresy]] of [[Acephali]] at its very outset. Archbishop Isidore strengthened religious discipline throughout his See.\n\nArchbishop Isidore also used resources of education to counteract increasingly influential Gothic barbarism throughout his episcopal jurisdiction. His quickening spirit animated the educational movement centered on Seville. Isidore introduced [[Aristotle]] to his countrymen long before the Arabs studied Greek philosophy extensively.\n\nIn 619, Isidore of Seville pronounced anathema against any ecclesiastic who in any way should molest the monasteries.\n\n===Second Synod of Seville (November 619)===\n{{Main|Second Synod of Seville}}\n\nIsidore presided over the Second Council of Seville, begun on 13 November 619, in the reign of King [[Sisebut]], a provincial council attended by eight other bishops, all from the ecclesiastical province of Baetica in southern Spain. The Acts of the Council fully set forth the nature of Christ, countering the conceptions of Gregory, a Syrian representing the heretical Acephali.\n\n===Third Synod of Seville (624)===\n{{Main|Third Synod of Seville}}\n\nBased on a few surviving canons found in the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]], Isidore is known to have presided over an additional provincial council around 624.\n\nThe council dealt with a conflict over the [[Episcopal see|See]] of \u00c9cija, and wrongfully stripped bishop Martianus of his see, a situation that was rectified by the Fourth Council of Toledo. It also addressed a concern over Jews who had been forced to convert to Christianity by Sisebut failing to present their children for baptism.\n\nThe records of the council, unlike the First and Second Councils of Seville were not preserved in the [[Collections of ancient canons|Hispana]], a collection of canons and decretals likely edited by Isidore himself.<ref>Rachel Stocking, \"Martianus, Aventius and Isidore: provincial councils in seventh-century Spain\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' 6 (1997) 169\u2013188.</ref>\n\n===Fourth National Council of Toledo===\n{{Main|Fourth Council of Toledo}}\n\nAll bishops of Hispania attended the Fourth National Council of Toledo, begun on 5 December 633. The aged Archbishop Isidore presided over its deliberations and originated most enactments of the council.\n\nThrough Isidore's influence, this Council of Toledo promulgated a decree, commanding all bishops to establish seminaries in their cathedral cities along the lines of the cathedral school at Seville, which had educated Isidore decades earlier. The decree prescribed the study of Greek, Hebrew, and the liberal arts and encouraged interest in law and medicine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Isidore's own work regarding medicine is examined by {{cite journal |last1=Sharpe |first1=William D. |year=1964 |title=Isidore of Seville: The Medical Writings |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=54 |issue=2}}</ref> The authority of the Council made this education policy obligatory upon all bishops of the Kingdom of the Visigoths. The council granted remarkable position and deference to the king of the Visigoths. The independent Church bound itself in allegiance to the acknowledged king; it said nothing of allegiance to the [[Papacy|Bishop of Rome]].\n\n===Death===\nIsidore of Seville died on 4 April 636 after serving more than 32 years as archbishop of Seville.\n\n==Work==\n{{Catholic philosophy}}\nIsidore's Latin style in the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' and elsewhere, though simple and lucid, reveals increasing local Visigothic traditions.\n\n===''Etymologiae''===\n{{Main|Etymologiae}}\n\n[[Image:Isidoro di siviglia, etimologie, fine VIII secolo MSII 4856 Bruxelles, Bibliotheque Royale Albert I, 20x31,50, pagina in scrittura onciale carolina.jpg|thumb|A page of ''Etymologiae'', [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] manuscript (8th century), [[Brussels]], [[Royal Library of Belgium]]]]\n[[File:Isidori Hispalensis Opera Omnia.tif|thumb|''Isidori Hispalensis Opera Omnia'' (1797)]]\n\nIsidore was the first Christian writer to try to compile a ''[[summa]]'' of universal knowledge, in his most important work, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (taking its title from the method he uncritically used in the transcription of his era's knowledge). It is also known by classicists as the ''[[Origines]]'' (the standard abbreviation being ''Orig''). This [[encyclopedia]] \u2014 the first such Christian [[epitome]]\u2014formed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 volumes.<ref>MacFarlane 1980:4; MacFarlane translates ''Etymologiae'' viii.</ref>\n\nIn it, as Isidore entered his own terse digest of Roman handbooks, miscellanies and compendia, he continued the trend towards abridgements and summaries that had characterised Roman learning in [[Late Antiquity]]. In the process, many fragments of classical learning are preserved which otherwise would have been hopelessly lost; \"in fact, in the majority of his works, including the ''Origines'', he contributes little more than the mortar which connects excerpts from other authors, as if he was aware of his deficiencies and had more confidence in the ''stilus maiorum'' than his own\" his translator Katherine Nell MacFarlane remarks.<ref>MacFarlane 1980:4; MacFarlane translates ''Etymologiae'' viii.</ref>\n\nSome of these fragments were lost in the first place because Isidore's work was so highly regarded\u2014[[Braulio of Zaragoza|Braulio]] called it ''quaecunque fere sciri debentur'', \"practically everything that it is necessary to know\"<ref>Braulio, ''Elogium'' of Isidore appended to Isidore's ''[[De viris illustribus]]'', heavily indebted itself to [[Jerome]].</ref>\u2014that it superseded the use of many individual works of the classics themselves, which were not recopied and have therefore been lost: \"all secular knowledge that was of use to the Christian scholar had been winnowed out and contained in one handy volume; the scholar need search no further\".<ref>MacFarlane 1980:4.</ref>\n\nThe fame of this work imparted a new impetus to encyclopedic writing, which bore abundant fruit in the subsequent centuries of the [[Middle Ages]]. It was the most popular compendium in [[medieval]] libraries. It was printed in at least ten editions between 1470 and 1530, showing Isidore's continued popularity in the [[Renaissance]]. Until the 12th century brought translations from Arabic sources, Isidore transmitted what western Europeans remembered of the works of [[Aristotle]] and other Greeks, although he understood only a limited amount of Greek.<ref name=CatEncy>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08186a.htm St. Isidore of Seville]</ref> The ''Etymologiae'' was much copied, particularly into medieval [[bestiary|bestiaries]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Epistemology of the Monstrous in the Middle Ages|last=Verner|first=Lisa|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-415-97243-7|location=|pages=94-95}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics|last=|first=|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780691154916|editor-last=Green|editor-first=Roland|edition=4th|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Bestiary\u202f: Being an English Version of the Bodleian Library, Oxford M.S.

He was influential in the inner circle of [[Sisebut]], Visigothic king of [[Hispania]]. Like Leander, he played a prominent role in the [[Councils of Toledo]] and Seville. The Visigothic legislation that resulted from these councils influenced the beginnings of representative government.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nHis fame after his death was based on his ''[[Etymologiae]]'', an [[etymology|etymological]] encyclopedia which assembled extracts of many books from classical antiquity that would have otherwise been lost.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood and education===\nIsidore was born in [[Cartagena, Spain]], a former Carthaginian colony, to Severianus and Theodora. Both Severianus and Theodora belonged to notable [[Hispano-Roman]] families of high social rank.<ref>Priscilla Throop, ''Isidore of Seville's Etymologies: Complete English Translation''. Vermont: MedievalMS, 2005, p. xi.</ref> His parents were members of an influential family who were instrumental in the political-religious maneuvering that [[Religious conversion|converted]] the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic kings]] from [[Arianism]] to Catholicism. The Catholic Church celebrates him and all his siblings as known saints:\n* An elder brother, [[Leander of Seville]], immediately preceded Isidore as Archbishop of Seville and, while in office, opposed King [[Liuvigild]].\n* A younger brother, [[Fulgentius of Cartagena]], served as the [[Diocese|Bishop]] of [[Astigi]] at the start of the new reign of the Catholic King [[Reccared]].\n* His sister, [[Saint Florentina|Florentina of Cartagena]], served God as a nun and allegedly ruled over forty convents and one thousand consecrated religious. This claim seems unlikely, however, given the few functioning monastic institutions in Iberia during her lifetime.<ref>Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Spain''. New York: St Martin's Press, 1995, pp. 79\u201386.</ref>\n\nIsidore received his elementary education in the Cathedral school of Seville. In this institution, the first of its kind in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], a body of learned men including Archbishop Leander of Seville taught the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]], the classic [[liberal arts]]. Isidore applied himself to study diligently enough that he quickly mastered Latin,<ref>\"His literary style, though lucid, is pedestrian\": Katherine Nell MacFarlane's observation, in \"Isidore of Seville on the Pagan Gods (Origines VIII. 11)\", ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'', New Series, '''70'''.3 (1980):1\u201340, p. 4, reflects mainstream secular opinion.</ref> and acquired some [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].\n\nTwo centuries of Gothic control of Iberia incrementally suppressed the ancient institutions, classic learning, and manners of the [[Roman Empire]]. The associated culture entered a period of long-term decline. The ruling [[Visigoths]] nevertheless showed some respect for the outward trappings of Roman culture. [[Arianism]] meanwhile took deep root among the Visigoths as the form of Christianity that they received.\n\nScholars may debate whether Isidore ever personally embraced monastic life or affiliated with any religious order, but he undoubtedly esteemed the monks highly.\n\n===Bishop of Seville===\n[[Image:Isidoro de Sevilla (Jos\u00e9 Alcoverro) 01.jpg|thumb|A statue of Isidore of Seville by [[Jos\u00e9 Alcoverro]], 1892, outside the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]], in [[Madrid]]]]\n[[Image:San Isidoro, Portada del Bautismo de la Catedral de Sevilla.jpg|thumb|[[Seville Cathedral]]. Sculpture by [[Lorenzo Mercadante|Lorenzo Mercadante de Breta\u00f1a]]]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Leander of Seville]] on 13 March 600 or 601, Isidore succeeded to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville|See of Seville]]. On his elevation to the [[Bishop|episcopate]], he immediately constituted himself as the protector of monks.\n\nIsidore recognized that the spiritual and material welfare of the people of his See depended on the assimilation of remnant Roman and ruling barbarian cultures, and consequently attempted to weld the peoples and subcultures of the Visigothic kingdom into a united nation. He used all available religious resources toward this end and succeeded. Isidore practically eradicated the heresy of [[Arianism]] and completely stifled the new [[heresy]] of [[Acephali]] at its very outset. Archbishop Isidore strengthened religious discipline throughout his See.\n\nArchbishop Isidore also used resources of education to counteract increasingly influential Gothic barbarism throughout his episcopal jurisdiction. His quickening spirit animated the educational movement centered on Seville. Isidore introduced [[Aristotle]] to his countrymen long before the Arabs studied Greek philosophy extensively.\n\nIn 619, Isidore of Seville pronounced anathema against any ecclesiastic who in any way should molest the monasteries.\n\n===Second Synod of Seville (November 619)===\n{{Main|Second Synod of Seville}}\n\nIsidore presided over the Second Council of Seville, begun on 13 November 619, in the reign of King [[Sisebut]], a provincial council attended by eight other bishops, all from the ecclesiastical province of Baetica in southern Spain. The Acts of the Council fully set forth the nature of Christ, countering the conceptions of Gregory, a Syrian representing the heretical Acephali.\n\n===Third Synod of Seville (624)===\n{{Main|Third Synod of Seville}}\n\nBased on a few surviving canons found in the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]], Isidore is known to have presided over an additional provincial council around 624.\n\nThe council dealt with a conflict over the [[Episcopal see|See]] of \u00c9cija, and wrongfully stripped bishop Martianus of his see, a situation that was rectified by the Fourth Council of Toledo. It also addressed a concern over Jews who had been forced to convert to Christianity by Sisebut failing to present their children for baptism.\n\nThe records of the council, unlike the First and Second Councils of Seville were not preserved in the [[Collections of ancient canons|Hispana]], a collection of canons and decretals likely edited by Isidore himself.<ref>Rachel Stocking, \"Martianus, Aventius and Isidore: provincial councils in seventh-century Spain\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' 6 (1997) 169\u2013188.</ref>\n\n===Fourth National Council of Toledo===\n{{Main|Fourth Council of Toledo}}\n\nAll bishops of Hispania attended the Fourth National Council of Toledo, begun on 5 December 633. The aged Archbishop Isidore presided over its deliberations and originated most enactments of the council.\n\nThrough Isidore's influence, this Council of Toledo promulgated a decree, commanding all bishops to establish seminaries in their cathedral cities along the lines of the cathedral school at Seville, which had educated Isidore decades earlier. The decree prescribed the study of Greek, Hebrew, and the liberal arts and encouraged interest in law and medicine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Isidore's own work regarding medicine is examined by {{cite journal |last1=Sharpe |first1=William D. |year=1964 |title=Isidore of Seville: The Medical Writings |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=54 |issue=2}}</ref> The authority of the Council made this education policy obligatory upon all bishops of the Kingdom of the Visigoths. The council granted remarkable position and deference to the king of the Visigoths. The independent Church bound itself in allegiance to the acknowledged king; it said nothing of allegiance to the [[Papacy|Bishop of Rome]].\n\n===Death===\nIsidore of Seville died on 4 April 636 after serving more than 32 years as archbishop of Seville.\n\n==Work==\n{{Catholic philosophy}}\nIsidore's Latin style in the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' and elsewhere, though simple and lucid, reveals increasing local Visigothic traditions.\n\n===''Etymologiae''===\n{{Main|Etymologiae}}\n\n[[Image:Isidoro di siviglia, etimologie, fine VIII secolo MSII 4856 Bruxelles, Bibliotheque Royale Albert I, 20x31,50, pagina in scrittura onciale carolina.jpg|thumb|A page of ''Etymologiae'', [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] manuscript (8th century), [[Brussels]], [[Royal Library of Belgium]]]]\n[[File:Isidori Hispalensis Opera Omnia.tif|thumb|''Isidori Hispalensis Opera Omnia'' (1797)]]\n\nIsidore was the first Christian writer to try to compile a ''[[summa]]'' of universal knowledge, in his most important work, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (taking its title from the method he uncritically used in the transcription of his era's knowledge).

In the process, many fragments of classical learning are preserved which otherwise would have been hopelessly lost; \"in fact, in the majority of his works, including the ''Origines'', he contributes little more than the mortar which connects excerpts from other authors, as if he was aware of his deficiencies and had more confidence in the ''stilus maiorum'' than his own\" his translator Katherine Nell MacFarlane remarks.<ref>MacFarlane 1980:4; MacFarlane translates ''Etymologiae'' viii.</ref>\n\nSome of these fragments were lost in the first place because Isidore's work was so highly regarded\u2014[[Braulio of Zaragoza|Braulio]] called it ''quaecunque fere sciri debentur'', \"practically everything that it is necessary to know\"<ref>Braulio, ''Elogium'' of Isidore appended to Isidore's ''[[De viris illustribus]]'', heavily indebted itself to [[Jerome]].</ref>\u2014that it superseded the use of many individual works of the classics themselves, which were not recopied and have therefore been lost: \"all secular knowledge that was of use to the Christian scholar had been winnowed out and contained in one handy volume; the scholar need search no further\".<ref>MacFarlane 1980:4.</ref>\n\nThe fame of this work imparted a new impetus to encyclopedic writing, which bore abundant fruit in the subsequent centuries of the [[Middle Ages]]. It was the most popular compendium in [[medieval]] libraries. It was printed in at least ten editions between 1470 and 1530, showing Isidore's continued popularity in the [[Renaissance]]. Until the 12th century brought translations from Arabic sources, Isidore transmitted what western Europeans remembered of the works of [[Aristotle]] and other Greeks, although he understood only a limited amount of Greek.<ref name=CatEncy>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08186a.htm St. Isidore of Seville]</ref> The ''Etymologiae'' was much copied, particularly into medieval [[bestiary|bestiaries]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Epistemology of the Monstrous in the Middle Ages|last=Verner|first=Lisa|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-415-97243-7|location=|pages=94-95}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics|last=|first=|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780691154916|editor-last=Green|editor-first=Roland|edition=4th|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Bestiary\u202f: Being an English Version of the Bodleian Library, Oxford M.S.

The song features vocals from American singer [[Ty Dolla Sign]] and Trinidad and Tobago-born rapper [[Nicki Minaj]]. Relying on [[flute]]s being played along with a punchy bassline, the song's original lyrics are about [[body shaming]] and the stigma surrounding [[plastic surgery]]. A reworked version of the song featuring Christian-themed lyrics was later previewed at listening parties for West's ninth studio album ''[[Jesus Is King]]'' (2019). \n\nThe song was ultimately scrapped from ''Jesus Is King'' just before its October 2019 release due to creative differences between West and Minaj. Since being leaked online in July 2019, the song received positive reviews and was noted for being a highlight among other leaked ''Yandhi'' tracks.

{"title_page": "Women in the Bible", "text_new": "{{short description|Women mentioned in the Bible}}\n{{see also|List of women in the Bible}}\n[[File:Lucas Cranach d. \u00c4. 014.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.6|''Eva'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1528)]]\n{{Bible sidebar |expanded=interpretation}}\n{{Christianity and gender|theology}}\n\nThe '''women in the Bible''' are rarely mentioned by name, with named women representing only 5.5 to 8 percent of the total of all named characters, male and female.  This suggests that women were not usually in the forefront of public life. Those women that are named, rose to prominence for reasons outside the ordinary. They are often an aspect of the over-turning of man-made power structures commonly found in a biblical literary device called a \"reversal.\" [[Abigail]] and [[Esther]], [[Jael]] who drove a tent peg into the enemy commander's temple while he slept, are a few examples of women who turned the tables on men with power. The [[Matriarchs (Bible)|founding matriarchs]] are mentioned by name, as are some prophetesses, judges, heroines, and queens, while the common woman is largely, though not completely, unseen. The slave [[Hagar]]'s story is told, and the prostitute [[Rahab]]'s story is also told, along with a few others like them.\n\nAll [[Ancient Near East]]ern societies were [[patriarchal]], and the Bible is a patriarchal document, written by men from a patriarchal age.  Many scholars see the primary emphasis of the Bible as reinforcing women's subordinate status. However, there are also scholars who claim there is a kind of [[gender blindness]] in the Bible as well as patriarchy. Marital laws in the Bible favored men, as did inheritance laws. There were strict laws of sexual behavior with adultery a crime punishable by [[stoning]]. A woman in ancient biblical times was always under the authority of a man and was subject to strict purity laws, both ritual and moral. However, women such as [[Deborah]], the [[Woman of Shunem|Shunnemite woman]], and the prophetess [[Huldah]], rise above societal limitations in their stories. The Bible contains many noted narratives of women as both victors and victims, women who change the course of events, and women who are powerless and unable to affect their own destinies.\n\nThe [[New Testament]] refers to a number of women in [[Jesus]]\u2019 inner circle, and he is generally seen by scholars as dealing with women with respect. The New Testament names women in positions of leadership in the early church as well. There are controversies within the contemporary Christian church concerning women. For example, [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] as \"outstanding among the apostles\" and there is disagreement over whether Junia was a woman and an apostle, and [[Mary Magdalene]]'s role as a leader is also disputed. Sexuality has played a major role in these issues which have impacted, and continue to impact, how the modern Christian church sees the role of women. These changing views of women in the Bible are reflected in art and culture.\n\n==Women, sex, and law in surrounding cultures==\nAlmost all Near Eastern societies of the Bronze (3000-1200 BCE) and Axial Ages (800 to 300 BCE) were patriarchal with patriarchy established in most by 3000 BCE.<ref name=\"Henry Sumner Maine\">{{cite book |last1=Maine |first1=Henry Sumner |title=Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation With to Modern Ideas |date=2015|publisher=Palala Press|isbn= 978-1340712365|quote=Originally Published in 1874 by Henry Holt and Company, New York; Republished as Historically Significant.}}</ref>{{rp|xxxii}} Eastern societies such as the [[Akkadians]], [[Hittites]], [[Assyria]]ns and [[Persians]] relegated women to an inferior and subordinate position.

For example, a husband could divorce a wife if he chose to, but a wife could not divorce a husband without his consent. The law said a woman could not make a binding vow without consent of her male authority, so she could not legally marry without male approval.  The practice of [[levirate marriage]] applied to widows of childless deceased husbands, not to widowers of childless deceased wives; though, if either he or she didn't consent to the marriage, a different ceremony called ''[[chalitza]]'' was done instead; this involves the widow removing her brother-in-law's shoe, spitting in front of him, and proclaiming, \"This is what happens to someone who will not build his brother's house!\".<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\"/>{{rp|163}} Laws concerning the loss of female virginity have no male equivalent. Women in biblical times depended on men economically. Women had the right to own property jointly with their husbands, except in the rare case of inheriting land from a father who didn't bear sons. Even \"in such cases, women would be required to remarry within the tribe so as not to reduce its land holdings.\"<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\"/>{{rp|171}} Property was transferred through the male line and women could not inherit unless there were no male heirs (Numbers 27:1-11; 36:1-12).<ref name = \"Davies1\"/>{{rp|3}} These and other gender-based differences found in the Torah suggest that women were seen as subordinate to men; however, they also suggest that biblical society viewed continuity, property, and family unity as paramount.<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\" />\n\nPhilosopher Michael Berger says, the rural family was the backbone of biblical society. Women did tasks as important as those of men, managed their households, and were equals in daily life, but all public decisions were made by men. Men had specific obligations they were required to perform for their wives including the provision of clothing, food, and sexual relations.<ref>[[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, Joseph]].

In the Bible, for a woman or girl who was under the protection of a man to be called a \"''zonah''\" was a grave insult to her and her family. The ''zonah'' is shown as lacking protection, making each ''zonah'' vulnerable and available to other men; the lack of a specific man governing her meant that she was free to act in ways that other women weren't.

Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, \u201cAfter I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?\u201d (Genesis 18:10-15). Sarah gives her slave Hagar to Abraham and he has sexual relations with her and she becomes pregnant. Sarah hopes to build a family through Hagar, but Hagar \"began to despise her mistress\" (Genesis 16:4). Then Sarah mistreated Hagar, who fled. God spoke to the slave Hagar in the desert, sent her home, and she bore Abraham a son, [[Ishmael]], \"a wild donkey of a man\" (Genesis 16:12).\n\nWhen Ishmael was 13, Abraham received the covenant practice of circumcision, and circumcised every male of his household. Later \"Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him. When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him. Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him\" (Genesis 21:1-5).

Samson was a [[Nazarite]], a specially dedicated individual, from birth, yet his story indicates he violated every requirement of the Nazarite vow.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Long hair was one of the symbolic representations of his special relationship with God; no razor was supposed to touch his hair. Samson travels to Gaza and \"fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah. The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, \u201cSee if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.\u201d Samson lies to her a couple of times then tells her the truth. \"Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison. But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.\"\n\n\"Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, \u201cOur god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.\u201d And they brought Samson out to entertain each other. But Samson prayed, \"O Lord, remember me\" and he pushed the columns holding up the Temple and killed everyone there.\n\nThe story does not call Delilah a Philistine. The valley of Sorek was Danite territory that had been overrun by Philistines, so the population there would have been mixed. Delilah was likely an Israelite or the story would have said otherwise.  The Philistines offered Delilah an enormous sum of money to betray Samson. Art has generally portrayed Delilah as a type of femme fatale, but the biblical term used (patt\u00ee) means to persuade with words. Delilah uses emotional blackmail and Samson's genuine love for her to betray him. No other Hebrew biblical hero is ever defeated by an Israelite woman. Samson does not suspect, perhaps because he cannot think of a woman as dangerous, but Delilah is determined, bold and very dangerous indeed. The entire Philistine army could not bring him down.

She was married to Judah's son [[Er (biblical person)|Er]], but Er died, leaving Tamar childless. Under levirate law, Judah's next son, [[Onan]], was told to have sex with Tamar and give her a child, but when Onan slept with her, he \"spilled his seed on the ground\" rather than give her a child that would belong to his brother. Then Onan died too. \"Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, 'Live as a widow in your father\u2019s household until my son Shelah grows up.' For he thought, 'He may die too, just like his brothers'.\" (Genesis 38:11) But when Shelah grew up, she was not given to him as his wife. One day Judah travels to town (Timnah) to shear his sheep. Tamar \"took off her widow\u2019s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah.  When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, 'Come now, let me sleep with you'.\"(Genesis 38:14) He said he would give her something in return and she asked for a pledge, accepting his staff and his seal with its cord as earnest of later payment. So Judah slept with her and she became pregnant. Then she went home and put on her widow's weeds again. Months later when it was discovered she was pregnant, she was accused of prostitution (zonah), and was set to be burned.  Instead, she sent Judah's pledge offerings to him saying \"I am pregnant by the man who owns these.\" Judah recognized them and said, \u201cShe is more righteous than I, since I wouldn\u2019t give her to my son Shelah.\u201d\n\n====Jephthah's daughter====\n{{Main|Jephthah's daughter}}\n[[File:Alexandre Cabanel - The Daughter of Jephthah (1879, Oil on canvas).JPG|thumb|upright|''The Daughter of Jephthah'', by [[Alexandre Cabanel]] (1879).]]\nThe story of [[Jephthah]]'s daughter in Book of Judges begins as an archetypal biblical hagiography of a hero. Jephthah is the son of a marginal woman, a prostitute (zonah), and as such he is vulnerable.  He lives in his father's house, but when his father dies, his half-brothers reject him. According to Frymer-Kensky, \"This is not right.  In the ancient Near East prostitutes could be hired as surrogate wombs as well as sex objects. Laws and contracts regulated the relationship between the child of such a prostitute and children of the first wife... he could not be disinherited. Jephthah has been wronged, but he has no recourse. He must leave home.\"  Frymer-Kensky says the author assumes the biblical audience is familiar with this, will know Jephthah has been wronged, and will be sympathetic to him.<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002>{{cite book|last1=Frymer-Kensky|first1=Tikva|title=Reading the Women of the Bible: A New Interpretation of Their Stories|url=https://archive.org/details/readingwomenofbi00frym|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Schoken Books|location=New York|isbn=9780805211825|oclc=49823086}}</ref>{{rp|102\u2013115}}\n\nNevertheless, Jephthah goes out into the world and makes a name for himself as a mighty warrior\u2014a hero of Israel. The threat of [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|the Ammonites]] is grave. The brothers acknowledge their wrongdoing to gain his protection.  Frymer-Kensky says Jephthah's response reveals negotiation skills and deep piety. Then he attempts to negotiate peace with Ammon but fails.  War comes, with all of Israel vulnerable.  Before the battle he makes a battle vow: \"If you give the Ammonites into my hand...the one who comes out of the doors of my house...I will offer to YHWH.\"  This turns out to be his daughter. Jephthah's reaction expresses his horror and sense of tragedy in three key expressions of mourning, utter defeat, and reproach. He reproaches her and himself, but foresees only his doom in either keeping or breaking his vow. Jephthah's daughter responds to his speech and she becomes a true heroine of this story. They are both good, yet tragedy happens.  Frymer-Kensky summarizes: \"The vulnerable heroine is sacrificed, the hero's name is gone.\"<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002/>  She adds, the author of the book of Judges knew people were sacrificing their children and the narrator of Judges is in opposition. \"The horror is the very reason this story is in the book of Judges.\"<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002/>{{rp|115}}\n\nSome scholars have interpreted this story to mean that Jephthah's daughter was not actually sacrificed, but kept in seclusion.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hirsch|first1=Emil G.|last2=Seligsohn|first2=M. |last3=Schechter|first3=Solomon|last4=Barton|first4=George A.|editor1-last=Cyrus Adler|editor1-first=|display-editors=etal|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|date=1906|chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8584-jephthah|chapter=Jephthah (\u05d9\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7)|location=New York|publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Co}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Anne E|editor1-last=Newsom|editor1-first=Carol A.|editor2-last=Ringe|editor2-first=Sharon H.|editor3-last=Lapsley|editor3-first=Jacqueline E.|title=Women's Bible commentary|date=2012|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky|isbn=9780664237073|pages=133\u2013137|edition= 3rd, 20th anniversary|chapter=Jephthah's Daughter and her Interpreters|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9uUMZ_g2_NoC&pg=PA136}}</ref>{{rp|137}}\n\n====Tamar, daughter of David====\n{{Main|Tamar (daughter of David)}}\n[[File:Desolation of Tamar by J.Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|upright .8|Desolation of Tamar by J.Tissot, c. 1900]]\nThe story of Tamar is a literary unit consisting of seven parts.

Immediately after explaining Amnon's desire the narrator first uses the term sister to reveal Tamar is not only Absalom's sister but is also Amnon's sister by another mother.  Phyllis Trible says the storyteller \"stresses family ties for such intimacy exacerbates the coming tragedy.\"  Full of lust, the prince is impotent to act; Tamar is a virgin and protected property.

He does not listen, and rapes her.<ref name=Trible1984terror/>{{rp|45}}\n\nAmnon is immediately full of shame and angrily throws Tamar out. \u201cNo!\u201d she said to him. \u201cSending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.\u201d But he refuses to listen. Tamar is desolate: ruined and miserable. King David is furious but he does nothing to avenge his daughter or punish his son. Frymer Kensky says \"The reader of the story who expects that the state will provide protection for the vulnerable now sees that the state cannot control itself.\"<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/>{{rp|174}} Absalom is filled with hatred, and kills Amnon two years later.

Historically, artistic renderings tend to reflect the changing views on women from within society more than the biblical account that mentions them.\n\nEve is a common subject. Art historian Mati Meyer says society's views of women are observable in the differing renderings of Eve in art over the centuries. Meyer explains: \"Genesis 2\u20133 recounts the creation of man and the origins of evil and death; Eve, the temptress who disobeys God\u2019s commandment, is probably the most widely discussed and portrayed figure in art.\"<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\">{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=Mati|title=Art: Representation of Biblical Women|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women|website=Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive}}</ref> According to Mati Meyer, Eve is historically portrayed in a favorable light up through the [[Early Middle Ages]] (AD 800's), but by the [[Late Middle Ages]] (1400s) artistic interpretation of Eve becomes heavily misogynistic.  Meyer sees this change as influenced by the writings of the 4th century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]], \"who sees Eve\u2019s sexuality as destructive to male rationality\".<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\"/>  By the seventeenth century, the [[Fall of man]] as a male-female struggle emerges, and in the eighteenth century, the perception of Eve is influenced by [[John Milton]]s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' where Adam's free will is emphasized along with Eve's beauty. Thereafter a secular view of Eve emerges \"through her transformation into a ''[[femme fatale]]''\u2014a compound of beauty, seductiveness and independence set to destroy the man.\"<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\"/>\n\nCourageous and victorious women, such as Jael, Esther and the [[deuterocanonical]] [[Judith]], were popular \"moral\" figures in the Middle Ages. [[The Renaissance]], which preferred the sensuous female nude up through the eighteenth century, and the \"femme fatale\", such as Delilah, from the nineteenth century onward, all demonstrate how the Bible and art both shape and reflect views of women.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women | title=Art: Representation of Biblical Women &#124; Jewish Women's Archive}}</ref><ref name=\"Diane Apostolos-Cappadona\">{{Cite journal|last1=Apostolos-Cappadona|first1=Diane|title=Women in Religious Art|volume=1|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Oxford Research Encyclopedias|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.208|date=Jul 2016|isbn=9780199340378}}</ref>\n\nThe story of the biblical Queen Athaliah was the inspiration for one of the greatest tragedies of French dramatist [[Jean Racine]], ''[[Athalie]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1897/12/07/archives/athalie-played-at-harvard-racines-masterpiece-produced-before-a.html | work=The New York Times | title=\"ATHALIE\" PLAYED AT HARVARD; Racine's Masterpiece Produced Before a Brilliant Audience in Sander's Theatre -- Gov.

Views on sexuality in the early church were diverse and fiercely debated within its various communities; these doctrinal debates took place within the boundaries of the ideas in Paul's letters and in the context of an often persecuted minority seeking to define itself from the world around it.  In his letters, Paul often attempted to find a middle way among these disputes, which included people who saw the gospel as liberating them from all moral boundaries, and those who took very strict moral stances.<ref name=\"Kyle Harper\"/>{{rp|1\u201314,84\u201386,88}}  Conflicts over sexuality with the culture surrounding Christianity, as well as within Christianity itself, were fierce.

This suggests that women were not usually in the forefront of public life. Those women that are named, rose to prominence for reasons outside the ordinary. They are often an aspect of the over-turning of man-made power structures commonly found in a biblical literary device called a \"reversal.\" [[Abigail]] and [[Esther]], [[Jael]] who drove a tent peg into the enemy commander's temple while he slept, are a few examples of women who turned the tables on men with power. The [[Matriarchs (Bible)|founding matriarchs]] are mentioned by name, as are some prophetesses, judges, heroines, and queens, while the common woman is largely, though not completely, unseen. The slave [[Hagar]]'s story is told, and the prostitute [[Rahab]]'s story is also told, along with a few others like them.\n\nAll [[Ancient Near East]]ern societies were [[patriarchal]], and the Bible is a patriarchal document, written by men from a patriarchal age.  Many scholars see the primary emphasis of the Bible as reinforcing women's subordinate status. However, there are also scholars who claim there is a kind of [[gender blindness]] in the Bible as well as patriarchy. Marital laws in the Bible favored men, as did inheritance laws. There were strict laws of sexual behavior with adultery a crime punishable by [[stoning]]. A woman in ancient biblical times was always under the authority of a man and was subject to strict purity laws, both ritual and moral. However, women such as [[Deborah]], the [[Woman of Shunem|Shunnemite woman]], and the prophetess [[Huldah]], rise above societal limitations in their stories. The Bible contains many noted narratives of women as both victors and victims, women who change the course of events, and women who are powerless and unable to affect their own destinies.\n\nThe [[New Testament]] refers to a number of women in [[Jesus]]\u2019 inner circle, and he is generally seen by scholars as dealing with women with respect. The New Testament names women in positions of leadership in the early church as well. There are controversies within the contemporary Christian church concerning women. For example, [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] as \"outstanding among the apostles\" and there is disagreement over whether Junia was a woman and an apostle, and [[Mary Magdalene]]'s role as a leader is also disputed. Sexuality has played a major role in these issues which have impacted, and continue to impact, how the modern Christian church sees the role of women. These changing views of women in the Bible are reflected in art and culture.\n\n==Women, sex, and law in surrounding cultures==\nAlmost all Near Eastern societies of the Bronze (3000-1200 BCE) and Axial Ages (800 to 300 BCE) were patriarchal with patriarchy established in most by 3000 BCE.<ref name=\"Henry Sumner Maine\">{{cite book |last1=Maine |first1=Henry Sumner |title=Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation With to Modern Ideas |date=2015|publisher=Palala Press|isbn= 978-1340712365|quote=Originally Published in 1874 by Henry Holt and Company, New York; Republished as Historically Significant.}}</ref>{{rp|xxxii}} Eastern societies such as the [[Akkadians]], [[Hittites]], [[Assyria]]ns and [[Persians]] relegated women to an inferior and subordinate position.

For example, a husband could divorce a wife if he chose to, but a wife could not divorce a husband without his consent. The law said a woman could not make a binding vow without consent of her male authority, so she could not legally marry without male approval.  The practice of [[levirate marriage]] applied to widows of childless deceased husbands, not to widowers of childless deceased wives; though, if either he or she didn't consent to the marriage, a different ceremony called ''[[chalitza]]'' was done instead; this involves the widow removing her brother-in-law's shoe, spitting in front of him, and proclaiming, \"This is what happens to someone who will not build his brother's house!\".<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\"/>{{rp|163}} Laws concerning the loss of female virginity have no male equivalent. Women in biblical times depended on men economically. Women had the right to own property jointly with their husbands, except in the rare case of inheriting land from a father who didn't bear sons. Even \"in such cases, women would be required to remarry within the tribe so as not to reduce its land holdings.\"<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\"/>{{rp|171}} Property was transferred through the male line and women could not inherit unless there were no male heirs (Numbers 27:1-11; 36:1-12).<ref name = \"Davies1\"/>{{rp|3}} These and other gender-based differences found in the Torah suggest that women were seen as subordinate to men; however, they also suggest that biblical society viewed continuity, property, and family unity as paramount.<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\" />\n\nPhilosopher Michael Berger says, the rural family was the backbone of biblical society. Women did tasks as important as those of men, managed their households, and were equals in daily life, but all public decisions were made by men. Men had specific obligations they were required to perform for their wives including the provision of clothing, food, and sexual relations.<ref>[[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, Joseph]].

In the Bible, for a woman or girl who was under the protection of a man to be called a \"''zonah''\" was a grave insult to her and her family. The ''zonah'' is shown as lacking protection, making each ''zonah'' vulnerable and available to other men; the lack of a specific man governing her meant that she was free to act in ways that other women weren't. According to David Blumenthal, the Bible depicts the ''zonah'' as \"dangerous, fearsome and threatening by her freedom, and yet appealing and attractive at the same time.\"<ref name=\"Blumenthal\"/>{{rp|42}}  Her freedom is recognized by biblical law and her sexual activity is not punishable.<ref name=\"Blumenthal\"/>{{rp|42}} She is the source of extra-institutional sex.

Sarah had borne no children though God had promised them a child. Later in the story when Sarah hears the promise of God she does not believe it. \"Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, \u201cAfter I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?\u201d (Genesis 18:10-15). Sarah gives her slave Hagar to Abraham and he has sexual relations with her and she becomes pregnant. Sarah hopes to build a family through Hagar, but Hagar \"began to despise her mistress\" (Genesis 16:4). Then Sarah mistreated Hagar, who fled. God spoke to the slave Hagar in the desert, sent her home, and she bore Abraham a son, [[Ishmael]], \"a wild donkey of a man\" (Genesis 16:12).\n\nWhen Ishmael was 13, Abraham received the covenant practice of circumcision, and circumcised every male of his household.

She said to the spies, \"I know that the Lord has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you. We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.

Samson was a [[Nazarite]], a specially dedicated individual, from birth, yet his story indicates he violated every requirement of the Nazarite vow.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Long hair was one of the symbolic representations of his special relationship with God; no razor was supposed to touch his hair. Samson travels to Gaza and \"fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah. The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, \u201cSee if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.\u201d Samson lies to her a couple of times then tells her the truth. \"Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison. But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.\"\n\n\"Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, \u201cOur god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.\u201d And they brought Samson out to entertain each other. But Samson prayed, \"O Lord, remember me\" and he pushed the columns holding up the Temple and killed everyone there.\n\nThe story does not call Delilah a Philistine. The valley of Sorek was Danite territory that had been overrun by Philistines, so the population there would have been mixed. Delilah was likely an Israelite or the story would have said otherwise.  The Philistines offered Delilah an enormous sum of money to betray Samson. Art has generally portrayed Delilah as a type of femme fatale, but the biblical term used (patt\u00ee) means to persuade with words. Delilah uses emotional blackmail and Samson's genuine love for her to betray him. No other Hebrew biblical hero is ever defeated by an Israelite woman. Samson does not suspect, perhaps because he cannot think of a woman as dangerous, but Delilah is determined, bold and very dangerous indeed. The entire Philistine army could not bring him down.

She was married to Judah's son [[Er (biblical person)|Er]], but Er died, leaving Tamar childless. Under levirate law, Judah's next son, [[Onan]], was told to have sex with Tamar and give her a child, but when Onan slept with her, he \"spilled his seed on the ground\" rather than give her a child that would belong to his brother. Then Onan died too. \"Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, 'Live as a widow in your father\u2019s household until my son Shelah grows up.' For he thought, 'He may die too, just like his brothers'.\" (Genesis 38:11) But when Shelah grew up, she was not given to him as his wife. One day Judah travels to town (Timnah) to shear his sheep. Tamar \"took off her widow\u2019s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah.  When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, 'Come now, let me sleep with you'.\"(Genesis 38:14) He said he would give her something in return and she asked for a pledge, accepting his staff and his seal with its cord as earnest of later payment. So Judah slept with her and she became pregnant. Then she went home and put on her widow's weeds again. Months later when it was discovered she was pregnant, she was accused of prostitution (zonah), and was set to be burned.  Instead, she sent Judah's pledge offerings to him saying \"I am pregnant by the man who owns these.\" Judah recognized them and said, \u201cShe is more righteous than I, since I wouldn\u2019t give her to my son Shelah.\u201d\n\n====Jephthah's daughter====\n{{Main|Jephthah's daughter}}\n[[File:Alexandre Cabanel - The Daughter of Jephthah (1879, Oil on canvas).JPG|thumb|upright|''The Daughter of Jephthah'', by [[Alexandre Cabanel]] (1879).]]\nThe story of [[Jephthah]]'s daughter in Book of Judges begins as an archetypal biblical hagiography of a hero. Jephthah is the son of a marginal woman, a prostitute (zonah), and as such he is vulnerable.  He lives in his father's house, but when his father dies, his half-brothers reject him. According to Frymer-Kensky, \"This is not right.  In the ancient Near East prostitutes could be hired as surrogate wombs as well as sex objects. Laws and contracts regulated the relationship between the child of such a prostitute and children of the first wife... he could not be disinherited. Jephthah has been wronged, but he has no recourse. He must leave home.\"  Frymer-Kensky says the author assumes the biblical audience is familiar with this, will know Jephthah has been wronged, and will be sympathetic to him.<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002>{{cite book|last1=Frymer-Kensky|first1=Tikva|title=Reading the Women of the Bible: A New Interpretation of Their Stories|url=https://archive.org/details/readingwomenofbi00frym|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Schoken Books|location=New York|isbn=9780805211825|oclc=49823086}}</ref>{{rp|102\u2013115}}\n\nNevertheless, Jephthah goes out into the world and makes a name for himself as a mighty warrior\u2014a hero of Israel. The threat of [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|the Ammonites]] is grave. The brothers acknowledge their wrongdoing to gain his protection.  Frymer-Kensky says Jephthah's response reveals negotiation skills and deep piety. Then he attempts to negotiate peace with Ammon but fails.  War comes, with all of Israel vulnerable.  Before the battle he makes a battle vow: \"If you give the Ammonites into my hand...the one who comes out of the doors of my house...I will offer to YHWH.\"  This turns out to be his daughter. Jephthah's reaction expresses his horror and sense of tragedy in three key expressions of mourning, utter defeat, and reproach. He reproaches her and himself, but foresees only his doom in either keeping or breaking his vow. Jephthah's daughter responds to his speech and she becomes a true heroine of this story. They are both good, yet tragedy happens.

Immediately after explaining Amnon's desire the narrator first uses the term sister to reveal Tamar is not only Absalom's sister but is also Amnon's sister by another mother.

MacDonald explains that, \"In Celsus' work, Mary Magdalene's role in the resurrection story denigrates its credibility...

For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.\nFor this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.

Historically, artistic renderings tend to reflect the changing views on women from within society more than the biblical account that mentions them.\n\nEve is a common subject. Art historian Mati Meyer says society's views of women are observable in the differing renderings of Eve in art over the centuries. Meyer explains: \"Genesis 2\u20133 recounts the creation of man and the origins of evil and death; Eve, the temptress who disobeys God\u2019s commandment, is probably the most widely discussed and portrayed figure in art.\"<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\">{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=Mati|title=Art: Representation of Biblical Women|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women|website=Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive}}</ref> According to Mati Meyer, Eve is historically portrayed in a favorable light up through the [[Early Middle Ages]] (AD 800's), but by the [[Late Middle Ages]] (1400s) artistic interpretation of Eve becomes heavily misogynistic.  Meyer sees this change as influenced by the writings of the 4th century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]], \"who sees Eve\u2019s sexuality as destructive to male rationality\".<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\"/>  By the seventeenth century, the [[Fall of man]] as a male-female struggle emerges, and in the eighteenth century, the perception of Eve is influenced by [[John Milton]]s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' where Adam's free will is emphasized along with Eve's beauty. Thereafter a secular view of Eve emerges \"through her transformation into a ''[[femme fatale]]''\u2014a compound of beauty, seductiveness and independence set to destroy the man.\"<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\"/>\n\nCourageous and victorious women, such as Jael, Esther and the [[deuterocanonical]] [[Judith]], were popular \"moral\" figures in the Middle Ages. [[The Renaissance]], which preferred the sensuous female nude up through the eighteenth century, and the \"femme fatale\", such as Delilah, from the nineteenth century onward, all demonstrate how the Bible and art both shape and reflect views of women.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women | title=Art: Representation of Biblical Women &#124; Jewish Women's Archive}}</ref><ref name=\"Diane Apostolos-Cappadona\">{{Cite journal|last1=Apostolos-Cappadona|first1=Diane|title=Women in Religious Art|volume=1|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Oxford Research Encyclopedias|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.208|date=Jul 2016|isbn=9780199340378}}</ref>\n\nThe story of the biblical Queen Athaliah was the inspiration for one of the greatest tragedies of French dramatist [[Jean Racine]], ''[[Athalie]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1897/12/07/archives/athalie-played-at-harvard-racines-masterpiece-produced-before-a.html | work=The New York Times | title=\"ATHALIE\" PLAYED AT HARVARD; Racine's Masterpiece Produced Before a Brilliant Audience in Sander's Theatre -- Gov.

Their contention is that the Stannary Parliament, whilst not in session, still exists. They also point to the fact that the 1508 Charter of Pardon from which the historic parliament derived its powers, was confirmed as still being on the statute books in 1977.<ref>Reference \u2013 [[National Library of Wales]], [[Aberystwyth]], where [[Dafydd Wigley]] deposited his papers regarding this in 1978</ref>\n\nThe British government rejects the claims of the group.

The group interpreted the 1508 charter as applying to all descendants of Cornish tin-miners, and claimed that they had the power to veto all laws made in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], not only those relating to the tin and mineral industries. The meeting was primarily called in response to a crisis in the [[china clay]] industry. Employers in the industry had been forbidden by the [[Pay Board]] from paying their 9,000 workers the higher wages agreed under a productivity deal. The [[Lord Warden of the Stannaries]], [[Geoffrey Waldegrave, 12th Earl Waldegrave]] refused an invitation to open the parliament.<ref>\"Cornishmen show teeth in reviving a parliament\", Trevor Fishlock, ''[[The Times]]'', 21 May 1974</ref>\n\nOn 24 June, at a meeting at which the stannators wore kilts of [[Cornish national tartan|Cornish tartan]], and at which an [[The Song of the Western Men|unofficial Cornish national anthem]] was sung, the group proclaimed eighteen articles or acts, including the claim to retain all taxes gathered in the Duchy, the declaration of [[St Piran]]'s flag to be the national flag, a claim on all mineral rights including oil and natural gas, and sought to reverse recent local government reorganisation. A petition was sent to the Queen declaring that if she did not recognise the parliament they would seize crown lands and properties. They also sought recognition from the United Nations.<ref>\"Why Cornishmen are nailing their colours to Magna Carta\", Susanne Puddefoot, ''The Times'' 26 October 1974</ref>\n\nOn 12 December 1974, the [[Home Office]] replied to the petition, saying that the Home Office could only accept elections by the stannary towns as constitutive of a valid stannary parliament. On 15 December, Brian Hambley, using the title \"Lord Protector of the Stannaries\", said they had decided to postpone the seizure of property in [[St Austell]] to give the four town councils an opportunity to appoint stannators. Hambley claimed there was a constitutional crisis and that should be done \"immediately to avoid political anarchy\".\n\nThe Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament next hit the headlines in 1978, again at St Austell Magistrate's Court. Hambley had been charged with having failed to pay motor tax and displaying the stannary seal in place of a tax disc. His defence was that he was exempt from the court's jurisdiction because he was a \"privileged tinner\", having staked out several acres of moorland, with a view to working them for tin on land belonging to the [[lord-lieutenant]] of the county. After two and a half hours consultation, the magistrates agreed they had no jurisdiction.<ref>\"Ancient tin miners' parliament wins its challenge in a 1978 magistrate's court\", ''The Times'', 16 June 1978</ref> The following day a court in Bodmin adjourned a similar case ''[[sine die]]'' against Frederick Trull.<ref>\"Victories for Stannary Parliament seen as a giant leap for Cornwall\", ''The Times'', 17 June 1978</ref> On 11 July, the [[county court]] (which had the powers of the old [[stannary court]]s, under the ''Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896''), declared that the lands Hambley claimed to have staked were already bounded, and ordered him to pay the landowners' costs.<ref>\"Cornishman may appeal over tin mining ruling\", ''The Times'', 12 July 1978</ref> By the end of July, over a hundred people were refusing to pay road tax in Cornwall, but a decision of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] gave the [[Home Office]] leave to quash the original magistrate's decision.<ref>\"Court move to stop revolt over road tax\", ''The Times'', 1 August 1978</ref>\n\nThe Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament's next large campaign was in 1989, and related to the introduction of the unpopular [[community charge]] or poll tax. They claimed that, because the law imposing the charge had not been approved by the Stannary Parliament, \"all tin-miners and former tin-miners, all descendants of tin-miners, all shareholders in tin-mines and anyone who supplied equipment for tin-mining\" were exempt from the tax. Shares were made available for sale in the Royal Cornish Consols United Tin Mines Cost Book Company at one pound each, the claim being that shareholders would not be liable for the charge. The company was owned by Frederick Trull, who had rejoined the group as its clerk.<ref>\"Charter of 1508 is cited; Poll tax challenge\", ''The Times'', 29 August 1989</ref> By March 1990, up to one and a quarter million applications for shares had been made. On 22 March, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] was granted an injunction in the High Court freezing the company's assets, on the grounds that the company was not registered under the [[Companies Act 1985]], and that Mr Trull was not authorised under the [[Financial Services Act 1986]] to conduct investment business.<ref>\"Cornish poll tax rebel barred\", ''The Times'', 23 March 1990</ref> \n\nOn 27 June, the company was placed in receivership, with shareholders potentially facing the payment of costs.<ref>\"Tin mine investors face costs; Royal Cornish Consols United Tin Mines Cost Book Company\", ''The Times'', 28 June 1990</ref> On 5 September, the receiver announced that Trull had vanished and that there was no trace of the estimated \u00a31 million paid by members of the public.<ref>\"Founder of firm that offered poll-tax immunity is missing\", ''The Times'', 5 September 1990</ref> On 12 October, Trull was found guilty of contempt by breaching High Court orders to stop issuing shares, and for failing to disclose the whereabouts of the money. He was sentenced in his absence to six months imprisonment. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Harman, said ''\"The matter may be based on a genuine belief by Mr Trull in the privileges of Cornish tin miners but has all the appearance of being a con trick.\"''<ref>\"Tin mining 'conman' is jailed for six months\", ''The Times'', 13 October 1990</ref> On 22 February 1991, Trull appeared before the High Court, and his sentence was reduced to three months and suspended for two years, on the condition that he undertook to help the Department of Trade and Industry recover the money invested by the public. Trull's counsel told the court that the money had gone to ''\"the sharks of this world\"'' and that Trull was ''\"fired not by dishonesty, but by obsessive belief in the Stannary laws\"''.<ref>\"Jail term suspended\", ''The Times'', 23 February 1991</ref><ref>\"Cornish tin men's reluctant farewell\". ''The Times'', 27 February 1991</ref> Trull remained clerk of the \"revived\" parliament, and in November was again before the courts claiming the Bodmin magistrates had no jurisdiction to make orders for payment against him on behalf of [[Restormel]] Borough Council, because he was 'a privileged tinner within the Stannaries of Cornwall.' The case against Trull was finally settled in 1994.<ref>\"No stannary rates exemption\", ''The Times'', 20 June 1994</ref>\n\n==Operation Chough==\nIn 1999 the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament started a direct action campaign they called \"Operation Chough\". The organisation wrote to [[English Heritage]] demanding it remove all signs bearing the \"English Heritage\" title from sites it managed in Cornwall by 31 July.<ref>''Cornwall heritage warning'', ''The Times'', 26 April 1999</ref> Over eleven months, eighteen signs were removed from sites in Cornwall including [[Carn Euny]], [[Chysauster]], [[Pendennis Castle]] and [[Tintagel]]. The \"Keeper of the Seal of the Stannary Parliament\" wrote to English Heritage saying ''\"The signs have been confiscated and held as evidence of English cultural aggression in Cornwall. Such racially motivated signs are deeply offensive and cause distress to many Cornish people\"''. On 18 January 2002, at Truro Crown Court, three members of the group agreed to return the signs and pay \u00a34,500 in compensation to English Heritage and to be bound over to keep the peace. In return, the prosecution dropped charges of conspiracy to cause criminal damage.<ref name=\"Guar\">[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,636016,00.html \"How three Cornish men and a raid on King Arthur's castle rocked English Heritage\"] ''The Guardian'' 19 January 2002</ref> The case was unusual as a [[public-interest immunity]] certificate was presented to the court by the Crown Prosecution Service about ten minutes into the hearing. This prevented some defence evidence from being heard. The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament believed the reason for the introduction of the PII certificate was that the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] refuses to reveal the circumstances under which it transferred several of its properties (including [[Tintagel Castle]]) to the management of [[English Heritage]].<ref>[http://www.cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/justice.html  On the Road to Justice for the Cornish]</ref> {{dubious|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Elections==\nElections to Revived Cornish Stannary are from among the Cornish Stannary Community.  To be a member of the Cornish Stannary Community you have to declare that \"I am Cornish as one of my parents is of direct indigenous Cornish descent or I am Cornish by marriage, and that therefore, I consider myself to be an \"heir and successor\" of the Cornish Stannary Community who secured the Charter of Pardon from King Henry VII in 1508\".<ref>http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/join.html</ref> The elected officers of the Cornish Stannary Parliament are not published.  There is a further organisation attached to CSP, known as the Cornish Citizens Association which has a more inclusive membership policy not based on race.<ref>http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/cca.htm</ref>\n\n==RCSP claims==\nThe RCSP campaigned against the lack of a written constitutional text to protect British 'subjects' from abuse of power by the state and have highlighted the absence of a British constitutional/statutory guarantee of the principle of equality before the law (cf [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]). They raised concerns with the [[British government]] regarding the failure by the state to include Article 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in its [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the failure by the state to ratify Protocol 12 of the [[ECHR]], the failure by the state to incorporate the European [[Directive 2000/43/EC on Anti-discrimination]] into domestic legislation by introducing what the RCSP claim is the inadequate Statutory Instrument 1626. They have also raised concerns regarding the retention of an unelected head of state and associated upper chamber of parliament ([[House of Lords]]), and the retention of what the RCSP calls an archaic and undemocratic [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Cornish Stannary Parliament\">[http://www.cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/ Cornish Stannary Parliament]</ref><ref>[http://duchyofcornwall.eu/duchy05.php Suppression of Cornish identity]</ref>\n\nThe RCSP asserts that [[Cornish people]] are subject to forced assimilation by an education system that fails to provide them with an adequate level of knowledge about their history and, hence, their identity. They also claimed that there are persistent attempts by state authorities to deny Cornish people their identity, for example, in the national census, pupil level annual school census, exclusion from the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], and denial of adequate financial cultural/linguistic resources.<ref name=\"Cornish Stannary Parliament\"/>\n\nThe organisation's website says that the group has been active in seeking repayment of alleged over taxation on tin mined in Cornwall, and to have lodged documents with the [[European Court of Human Rights]].\n\n==Other activities==\nIn 2007 the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament presented at Truro Crown court having put together a legally applicable demand to restrict the 'rights and privileges' of the Duke of Cornwall, The Prince of Wales, in his role within the Duchy<ref>http://thisisnotcornwall.co.uk/csp.htm</ref><ref>http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk//resources//article.php?story=20061228180913245</ref> However the judge dismissed the case, saying the RCSP were in the wrong court.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n* The RCSP campaigned, along with other Cornish organisations, for the Cornish to be recognised by the UK Government under the Council of Europe's [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]].<ref>[http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/heritage-signs.html CSP and Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]</ref><ref>[http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk//resources//article.php?story=2006122221140669 CSP letter in reply to \"The United Kingdom's Draft Second Report to the Council of Europe under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities\"]</ref>\n* The RCSP says it campaigned, along with [[Mebyon Kernow]] and other Cornish organisations for the inclusion of a Cornish tick box on the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], although this was not successful and the forms as issued did not include a Cornish tick box.

After two and a half hours consultation, the magistrates agreed they had no jurisdiction.<ref>\"Ancient tin miners' parliament wins its challenge in a 1978 magistrate's court\", ''The Times'', 16 June 1978</ref> The following day a court in Bodmin adjourned a similar case ''[[sine die]]'' against Frederick Trull.<ref>\"Victories for Stannary Parliament seen as a giant leap for Cornwall\", ''The Times'', 17 June 1978</ref> On 11 July, the [[county court]] (which had the powers of the old [[stannary court]]s, under the ''Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896''), declared that the lands Hambley claimed to have staked were already bounded, and ordered him to pay the landowners' costs.<ref>\"Cornishman may appeal over tin mining ruling\", ''The Times'', 12 July 1978</ref> By the end of July, over a hundred people were refusing to pay road tax in Cornwall, but a decision of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] gave the [[Home Office]] leave to quash the original magistrate's decision.<ref>\"Court move to stop revolt over road tax\", ''The Times'', 1 August 1978</ref>\n\nThe Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament's next large campaign was in 1989, and related to the introduction of the unpopular [[community charge]] or poll tax. They claimed that, because the law imposing the charge had not been approved by the Stannary Parliament, \"all tin-miners and former tin-miners, all descendants of tin-miners, all shareholders in tin-mines and anyone who supplied equipment for tin-mining\" were exempt from the tax. Shares were made available for sale in the Royal Cornish Consols United Tin Mines Cost Book Company at one pound each, the claim being that shareholders would not be liable for the charge. The company was owned by Frederick Trull, who had rejoined the group as its clerk.<ref>\"Charter of 1508 is cited; Poll tax challenge\", ''The Times'', 29 August 1989</ref> By March 1990, up to one and a quarter million applications for shares had been made. On 22 March, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] was granted an injunction in the High Court freezing the company's assets, on the grounds that the company was not registered under the [[Companies Act 1985]], and that Mr Trull was not authorised under the [[Financial Services Act 1986]] to conduct investment business.<ref>\"Cornish poll tax rebel barred\", ''The Times'', 23 March 1990</ref> \n\nOn 27 June, the company was placed in receivership, with shareholders potentially facing the payment of costs.<ref>\"Tin mine investors face costs; Royal Cornish Consols United Tin Mines Cost Book Company\", ''The Times'', 28 June 1990</ref> On 5 September, the receiver announced that Trull had vanished and that there was no trace of the estimated \u00a31 million paid by members of the public.<ref>\"Founder of firm that offered poll-tax immunity is missing\", ''The Times'', 5 September 1990</ref> On 12 October, Trull was found guilty of contempt by breaching High Court orders to stop issuing shares, and for failing to disclose the whereabouts of the money. He was sentenced in his absence to six months imprisonment. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Harman, said ''\"The matter may be based on a genuine belief by Mr Trull in the privileges of Cornish tin miners but has all the appearance of being a con trick.\"''<ref>\"Tin mining 'conman' is jailed for six months\", ''The Times'', 13 October 1990</ref> On 22 February 1991, Trull appeared before the High Court, and his sentence was reduced to three months and suspended for two years, on the condition that he undertook to help the Department of Trade and Industry recover the money invested by the public. Trull's counsel told the court that the money had gone to ''\"the sharks of this world\"'' and that Trull was ''\"fired not by dishonesty, but by obsessive belief in the Stannary laws\"''.<ref>\"Jail term suspended\", ''The Times'', 23 February 1991</ref><ref>\"Cornish tin men's reluctant farewell\". ''The Times'', 27 February 1991</ref> Trull remained clerk of the \"revived\" parliament, and in November was again before the courts claiming the Bodmin magistrates had no jurisdiction to make orders for payment against him on behalf of [[Restormel]] Borough Council, because he was 'a privileged tinner within the Stannaries of Cornwall.' The case against Trull was finally settled in 1994.<ref>\"No stannary rates exemption\", ''The Times'', 20 June 1994</ref>\n\n==Operation Chough==\nIn 1999 the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament started a direct action campaign they called \"Operation Chough\". The organisation wrote to [[English Heritage]] demanding it remove all signs bearing the \"English Heritage\" title from sites it managed in Cornwall by 31 July.<ref>''Cornwall heritage warning'', ''The Times'', 26 April 1999</ref> Over eleven months, eighteen signs were removed from sites in Cornwall including [[Carn Euny]], [[Chysauster]], [[Pendennis Castle]] and [[Tintagel]]. The \"Keeper of the Seal of the Stannary Parliament\" wrote to English Heritage saying ''\"The signs have been confiscated and held as evidence of English cultural aggression in Cornwall. Such racially motivated signs are deeply offensive and cause distress to many Cornish people\"''. On 18 January 2002, at Truro Crown Court, three members of the group agreed to return the signs and pay \u00a34,500 in compensation to English Heritage and to be bound over to keep the peace. In return, the prosecution dropped charges of conspiracy to cause criminal damage.<ref name=\"Guar\">[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,636016,00.html \"How three Cornish men and a raid on King Arthur's castle rocked English Heritage\"] ''The Guardian'' 19 January 2002</ref> The case was unusual as a [[public-interest immunity]] certificate was presented to the court by the Crown Prosecution Service about ten minutes into the hearing. This prevented some defence evidence from being heard. The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament believed the reason for the introduction of the PII certificate was that the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] refuses to reveal the circumstances under which it transferred several of its properties (including [[Tintagel Castle]]) to the management of [[English Heritage]].<ref>[http://www.cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/justice.html  On the Road to Justice for the Cornish]</ref> {{dubious|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Elections==\nElections to Revived Cornish Stannary are from among the Cornish Stannary Community.  To be a member of the Cornish Stannary Community you have to declare that \"I am Cornish as one of my parents is of direct indigenous Cornish descent or I am Cornish by marriage, and that therefore, I consider myself to be an \"heir and successor\" of the Cornish Stannary Community who secured the Charter of Pardon from King Henry VII in 1508\".<ref>http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/join.html</ref> The elected officers of the Cornish Stannary Parliament are not published.

They raised concerns with the [[British government]] regarding the failure by the state to include Article 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in its [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the failure by the state to ratify Protocol 12 of the [[ECHR]], the failure by the state to incorporate the European [[Directive 2000/43/EC on Anti-discrimination]] into domestic legislation by introducing what the RCSP claim is the inadequate Statutory Instrument 1626. They have also raised concerns regarding the retention of an unelected head of state and associated upper chamber of parliament ([[House of Lords]]), and the retention of what the RCSP calls an archaic and undemocratic [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Cornish Stannary Parliament\">[http://www.cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/ Cornish Stannary Parliament]</ref><ref>[http://duchyofcornwall.eu/duchy05.php Suppression of Cornish identity]</ref>\n\nThe RCSP asserts that [[Cornish people]] are subject to forced assimilation by an education system that fails to provide them with an adequate level of knowledge about their history and, hence, their identity. They also claimed that there are persistent attempts by state authorities to deny Cornish people their identity, for example, in the national census, pupil level annual school census, exclusion from the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], and denial of adequate financial cultural/linguistic resources.<ref name=\"Cornish Stannary Parliament\"/>\n\nThe organisation's website says that the group has been active in seeking repayment of alleged over taxation on tin mined in Cornwall, and to have lodged documents with the [[European Court of Human Rights]].\n\n==Other activities==\nIn 2007 the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament presented at Truro Crown court having put together a legally applicable demand to restrict the 'rights and privileges' of the Duke of Cornwall, The Prince of Wales, in his role within the Duchy<ref>http://thisisnotcornwall.co.uk/csp.htm</ref><ref>http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk//resources//article.php?story=20061228180913245</ref> However the judge dismissed the case, saying the RCSP were in the wrong court.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n* The RCSP campaigned, along with other Cornish organisations, for the Cornish to be recognised by the UK Government under the Council of Europe's [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]].<ref>[http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/heritage-signs.html CSP and Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]</ref><ref>[http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk//resources//article.php?story=2006122221140669 CSP letter in reply to \"The United Kingdom's Draft Second Report to the Council of Europe under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities\"]</ref>\n* The RCSP says it campaigned, along with [[Mebyon Kernow]] and other Cornish organisations for the inclusion of a Cornish tick box on the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], although this was not successful and the forms as issued did not include a Cornish tick box. For the first time the Cornish were allocated the '06' census code for the 2001 Census but there have been claims that the actual number of people registering as Cornish would have been much higher if a Cornish option tick box had been included. 37,500 people wrote that they had Cornish ethnicity on the 2001 census form.<ref name=Brown>{{Cite conference|last=Brown|first=Malcolm|title=Cornish ethnicity data from the 2001 Census|conference=British Society for Population Studies Conference|location=University of Southampton|date=18\u201320 September 2006|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/socialPolicy/BSPS/annualConference/2006/2006_localgov.aspx |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> The RCSP said that many Cornish people were unaware of the new option and the figures would have been much higher if the tick-box was available.<ref>[http://cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/heritage-signs.html  RCSP and Cornish tickbox for 2011 Census]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n*[[List of topics related to Cornwall]]\n*[[Cornish Nationalism]]\n*[[Cornwall 2000]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/BSPS/annualConference/2006_localgov.htm#generated-subheading3 Cornish ethnicity data from the 2001 Census (British Society for Population Studies Conference 2006)]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1768853.stm BBC news 18 January 2002 \u2013 Historic signs case trio bound over]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171058/http://www.pjsymes.com.au/articles/Private02.htm   Cornish Stannary Banknotes], by [[Peter Symes]]\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,636016,00.html Operation Chough \u2013 London Guardian 19 January 2002]\n\n{{Cornish self-government movement}}\n{{Celtic nations}}\n\n[[Category:Political advocacy groups in England]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Cornish nationalism]]\n", "name_user": "Widefox", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:already a ref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revived_Cornish_Stannary_Parliament"}

It is located 22&nbsp;km from the city of [[Erode]] and 38&nbsp;km from [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]]. Sankari or [[Sankagiri]] is the town located around this place. Height 707.0 m or 2319.6 feet Location :11.47998,77.85749\n\n==Sankagiri fort==\n\nSankagiri Fort was built in the 15th century by the [[Vijayanagar empire]]. It has 14 fort walls built on and around a hill and the last phase these walls were built by the British. The fort served as a British tax storage facility for [[Kongu Nadu]], a region comprising the districts of  Salem, Erode, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Namakkal, Karur and Dindukal.\n\nIt was an important military base for [[Tippu Sultan]] and later for the British army. This is because only one side of the hill is climbable, as all the others are too steep to climb. This has a death well, granary, two oil [[godown]]s, one explosives godown, two masjiths, 2 Varadharaja Perumal temples, former British Army administrative buildings, and cemeteries formerly used by armies that were stationed at the fort.\n\n[[Dheeran Chinnamalai]] was hanged by the British in this fort.\n\nFollowing the demise of Chola rule in the 13th century, the Thanjavur country came under the rule of the Pandyas who ruled for about a century. Following the invasion of Malik Kafur, the Tanjore country fell into disorder. The rule of the Delhi Sultanate lasted for half a century before Pandya chieftains reasserted their independence. Soon afterwards, however, they were conquered by the Vijayanagar Empire. The supremacy of Vijayanagar was challenged by the Nayaks of Madurai who eventually conquered Thanjavur in 1646. The rule of the Thanjavur Nayaks lasted until 1673 when Chokkanatha Nayak the ruler of Madurai invaded Thanjavur and killed the ruler Vijayaraghava.\n\nChokkanatha placed his brother Alagiri on the throne of Thanjavur, but within a year the latter threw off his allegiance, and Chokkanatha was forced to recognise the independence of Thanjavur. A son of Vijaya Raghava induced the Bijapur Sultan to help him get back the Thanjavur throne. In 1675, the Sultan of Bijapur sent a force commanded by the Maratha general Venkoji (alias Ekoji) to recapture the kingdom from the new invader. Venkoji defeated Alagiri with ease, and occupied Thanjavur. He did not, however, place his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e on the throne as instructed by the Bijapur Sultan, but seized the kingdom and made himself king. Thus began the rule of the Marathas over Thanjavur.\n\nDuring this period Chettiar community helped the Thanjavur kingdom to mobilise money to fight against invaders. Hence Marathas ordered to convict all the Chettiar men. To avoid losing succession in the community, elderly wisemen arranged to gather 500 children of Chettiar community and confidentially moved them to Sankagiri region. These people were called Five hundred Kongu chettiars.  Chettiars being devotees of Lord Shiva, built their Shiva temple near Sankagiri in a place called Sunnambu Kuttai (Limestone Pond). The temple lord Shiva was named Kopineshwar, with Angayarkanni (Lord Meenakshi of Madurai).\n\nTo minimise the anger of Maratha king, (if at all king finds that Chettiar community is survived), these 500 people must be pardoned. Chettiars also named the deity after the Maratha lord Kopineshwar located at Thane. The temple at Thane was originally built when Silharas ruled thane from 810 to 1260. This temple at Thane was renovated during 1760, by Maratha king Maratha general Chimaji Appa .<ref><http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Thane_-_History/id/2075938>.</ref>\n\nThe remains of dilapidated temple Kopineshwar-Angayarkanni temple is still found on the way to Idapadi. This dilapidated temple was identified in 1982 by Viswanathan Chettiar of Coimbatore. He has identified the boundary of the temple, [[sanctum sanctorum]] of the temple and few broken granite idols. The adjacent land was cultivated, but this temple land was isolated and nobody wants to misuse this land due to its mystical power. Based on this fact, Viswanathan Chettiar initiated to build the temple in the location.\n\nThe author learns that Viswanathan Chettiar of Coimbatore has built the sanctum sanctorum and died.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Erode Fort]]\n* [[TANJORE FORT]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Forts in Tamil Nadu}}\n\n[[Category:Forts in Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions around Erode]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=February 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2013}}\n{{Infobox Military Structure\n|name = Sankagiri Fort\n|partof =  [[Tamil Nadu]]\n|location = [[Salem District]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]\n|image = Sankagiri hill 3.jpg\n|image_size = 300px\n|caption = Entrance\n|map_type = India Tamil Nadu\n|map_size = \n|map_caption = \n|type = [[Fort]]s\n|coordinates = {{coord|11.77|78.203|type:landmark|display=inline}}\n|code = \n|built =\n|builder =   \n|materials = \n|height = \n|used = \n|demolished =\n|condition = Ruins\n|ownership = [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]\n|open_to_public = \n|controlledby = {{flagcountry|Vijayanagara Empire}}<br />{{flagcountry|Kingdom of Mysore}}<br />{{flagcountry|United Kingdom}}\n* {{flagicon image|Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg}} [[East India Company]] (<small>till 1857</small>)\n* {{flagicon image|British Raj Red Ensign.svg}} [[India]] (<small>1857-1947</small>)\n{{flagcountry|India}} (<small>1947-</small>)\n|garrison = \n|current_commander = \n|commanders =\n|occupants = \n|battles = \n|events = \n|image2 = \n|caption2 = \n}}\n[[File:Sankagiri Fort at 08.46.20.jpg|thumb|311x311px|Height of Sankagiri Fort]]\n'''Sankagiri Fort''' is a historical fort maintained by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]].

This temple at Thane was renovated during 1760, by Maratha king Maratha general Chimaji Appa .<ref><http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Thane_-_History/id/2075938>.</ref>\n\nThe remains of dilapidated temple Kopineshwar-Angayarkanni temple is still found on the way to Idapadi. This dilapidated temple was identified in 1982 by Viswanathan Chettiar of Coimbatore. He has identified the boundary of the temple, [[sanctum sanctorum]] of the temple and few broken granite idols. The adjacent land was cultivated, but this temple land was isolated and nobody wants to misuse this land due to its mystical power. Based on this fact, Viswanathan Chettiar initiated to build the temple in the location.\n\nThe author learns that Viswanathan Chettiar of Coimbatore has built the sanctum sanctorum and died.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Erode Fort]]\n* [[TANJORE FORT]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Forts in Tamil Nadu}}\n\n[[Category:Forts in Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions around Erode]]\n", "name_user": "Dhivaharraj", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankagiri_Fort"}
