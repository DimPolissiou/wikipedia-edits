It was part of a mixed-use complex that includes the hotel [[Novotel|Novotel Clarke Quay]] (formerly Hotel New Otani) and Somerset Residences.\n\n==History==\nDeveloped by the Wuthelam Group in collaboration with Daimaru Inc, Liang Court opened in January 1984 as the first major shopping mall along River Valley Road. At that time of opening, it had Japanese department store and supermarket chain Daimaru, lifestyle bookstore Kinokuniya, Taiwanese restaurant Shin Yeh, karaoke chain Party World, consumer electronics chain SAFE Superstore and more than 60 speciality tenants mostly catering to Japanese expatriates. Above Liang Court were two 25-storey tower blocks occupied by Hotel New Otani Singapore and serviced apartment Somerset Liang Court, which opened in November 1984. In 2000, Rainforest Cafe opened in the lower floors but was closed in 2004 due to declining patronage.\n\nIn 2003, Daimaru closed down due to declining sales and restructuring. Its supermarket section was taken over by Meidi-Ya and department store section taken over by electronics chain Audio House and smaller shops. Hotel New Otani's management was taken over by Accor Hotels in December 2004, and was subsequently renamed Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay. The mall changed hands twice, having been sold to Pidemco Land in 1999 and subsequently sold to the Asia Retail Management Fund in 2006.\n\nUnder ARMF management, the mall underwent major refurbishment works in 2007, coupled with a repositioning of its image. The space once taken up by Daimaru was reconfigured into smaller shops, and Audio House was relocated to Level 4. The basement shops were replaced by Japanese restaurants and shops catering to Japanese expatriates. Refurbishment works were completed in 2010.\n\nUniqlo opened at the mall's ground floor in November 2013. In August 2016, Audio House closed down its only mall-based store. Following declining business, the mall was sold to a joint venture between Capitaland and City Developments Limited in March 2019. Kinokuniya closed its store in April 2019, following the end of its 32-year lease, with various shops and restaurants following suit by the end of that year.\n\n===Redevelopment===\nIn November 2019, CapitaLand and its subsidiary [[The Ascott Limited|Ascott REIT]], along with City Developments Limited announced that Liang Court will be redeveloped into a mixed-use, integrated development featuring two residential towers with 700 condo units, a retail mall, a hotel managed by [[Marriott International]] under the Moxy brand and a 192-unit Somerset serviced residence. The new development is expected to open in phases from 2024, with the Moxy Hotel opening in 2025.

This was nearly a year before [[Robert Peary]], who similarly claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts have been disputed ever since.<ref>Henderson 2009, pp. 58\u201369.</ref> His expedition discovered [[Meighen Island]], the only discovery of an island in the [[North American Arctic]] by an expedition with a United States national on board.\n\nIn December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the [[University of Copenhagen]] ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing his claim. His account of reaching the summit of [[Denali]] has also been discredited.\n\n== Biography ==\nCook's birthplace is often listed as [[Callicoon (CDP), New York]], but he was born in [[Hortonville, New York]], also in the Town of Delaware in Sullivan County.<ref>Bryce (1997), p. 3.</ref> His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting a phonetic version of their surname. He attended local schools before college. He graduated from [[Columbia University]] and did medical studies at [[New York University Medical School]], receiving his doctorate <!-- or M.D.? -->in 1890. \n\nCook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/frederick-albert-cook-explorer-and-physician-usa-his-news-photo/501373901|title=Ruth and Helene Cook|work=Haeckel Collection|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=2018-09-26}}</ref> After more than two decades of marriage, they divorced in 1923.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Early expeditions ===\nCook was the surgeon on [[Robert Peary]]'s Arctic expedition of 1891\u20131892, and on the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] of 1897\u20131899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship\u2014the {{RV|Belgica|1884|2}}\u2014was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent [[scurvy]], Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat.\n\nIn 1897, Cook twice visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], where he met Anglican missionary [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]]. They studied the [[Ona people|Ona]] and [[Yahgan]] peoples, with whom Bridges had worked for two decades. During this time, he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.<ref name=\"parson\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/21/104935739.pdf \"Cook Tried to Steal Parson's Life Work\"].

Accessed October 3, 2013</ref>\n\n=== Summit of Denali ===\n[[File:Fakepeak.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Alleged photo of Denali's summit, now known as [[Fake Peak]]]]\nIn 1903, Cook led an expedition to [[Denali]], during which he circumnavigated the range. He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's Denali ascent was also fraudulent.\n\nUnlike [[Hudson Stuck]] in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on [[Fake Peak|a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier]], {{Convert|19|mi|km|abbr=}} away.<ref>Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf \"An aerial photograph by Bradford Washburn\"]. ''DIO''. '''7''' (2). p. 40.</ref>\n\nIn late 1909, [[Ed Barrill]], Cook's sole companion during the 1906 climb, signed an affidavit saying that they had not reached the summit. In the late 20th century, historians found that he had been paid by Peary supporters to deny Cook's claim.

He planned to attempt to reach the [[North Pole]], although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left [[Annoatok]], a small settlement in the north of [[Greenland]], in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 21, 1908, after traveling north from [[Axel Heiberg Island]], taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to [[Jones Sound]], spending the open water season and part of the winter on [[Devon Island]]. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing [[Nares Strait]] to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey.\n\nCook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] (Berton, 2001), Cook's story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook's companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view.\n\nThere are similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook's sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]''. For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of [[Jones Sound]] in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization.<ref>Osczevski (2003).</ref>\n\nCook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as [[American football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] [[Fielding H. Yost]] (as related in [[Fred Russell]]'s 1943 book, ''I'll Go Quietly'').\n\n[[File:Picture of Frederick Cook.jpg|thumb|Cook in arctic gear]]\nCook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with [[Harry Whitney]], an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey {{Convert|700|mi|km|abbr=}} south to [[Upernavik]]. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the US on Peary's ship ''Roosevelt'' in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.\n\nOn December 21, 1909, a commission at the [[University of Copenhagen]], after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/22/101752152.pdf | title=University Finds That Cook's Papers Contain no Proof That He Reached the North Pole | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 22, 1909 | accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref> (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the [[National Geographic Society]], which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)\n\nCook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some.<ref>Cook, F. (1911). ''My Attainment of the Pole''. pp. 258, 274. Cook's first account of what he left with Whitney did not mention data, and Whitney knew of no data in what was left with him.

The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge.<ref>Osczevski, R. J. (2003). ''Arctic''. '''56''' (4).</ref> Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.\n\nThe Peary expedition's people (primarily [[Matthew Henson]], who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had traveled only a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook that correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown [[Meighen Island]], which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed.<ref>Osczevski, R.

Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.\n\nAt the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: \"I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision.\"\n\n== Reputation ==\nCook's reputation never recovered from the attacks on his claim. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has since been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the [[National Geographic Society]], which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. \n\nResearching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to assess how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and evaluated them against the period of the [[Gilded Age]].<ref name=\"ringle\"/> He believes that Cook, as a physician and [[ethnographer]], cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook \"genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration\u2014mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge\u2014and that of the world\u2014for its own sake.\"<ref name=\"ringle\">[http://www.surveyhistory.org/the_polar_controversy_resolved1.htm Ken Ringle, review: \"''Cook & Peary - The Polar Controversy Resolved''\"], ''Backsights'', 1997, published by Surveyors Historical Society, accessed 3 October 2013</ref> But, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain financial support for continued expeditions.\n\n=== Fraud trial ===\nIn 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and went to trial. Also tried was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.\n\nAmong other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]], who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud. In November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.<ref>Olien, R. (1989). \"Doctor Frederick A. Cook and the Petroleum Producers' Association\", ''Journal of the West''. '''28''' (4). pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n== Later life ==\nCook was imprisoned until 1930. [[Roald Amundsen]], who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the ''Belgica'', visited him several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Cook was [[pardon]]ed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5.

This was nearly a year before [[Robert Peary]], who similarly claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts have been disputed ever since.<ref>Henderson 2009, pp. 58\u201369.</ref> His expedition discovered [[Meighen Island]], the only discovery of an island in the [[North American Arctic]] by an expedition with a United States national on board.\n\nIn December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the [[University of Copenhagen]] ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing his claim. His account of reaching the summit of [[Denali]] has also been discredited.\n\n== Biography ==\nCook's birthplace is often listed as [[Callicoon (CDP), New York]], but he was born in [[Hortonville, New York]], also in the Town of Delaware in Sullivan County.<ref>Bryce (1997), p. 3.</ref> His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting a phonetic version of their surname. He attended local schools before college. He graduated from [[Columbia University]] and did medical studies at [[New York University Medical School]], receiving his doctorate <!-- or M.D.? -->in 1890. \n\nCook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/frederick-albert-cook-explorer-and-physician-usa-his-news-photo/501373901|title=Ruth and Helene Cook|work=Haeckel Collection|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=2018-09-26}}</ref> After more than two decades of marriage, they divorced in 1923.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Early expeditions ===\nCook was the surgeon on [[Robert Peary]]'s Arctic expedition of 1891\u20131892, and on the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] of 1897\u20131899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship\u2014the {{RV|Belgica|1884|2}}\u2014was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent [[scurvy]], Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat.\n\nIn 1897, Cook twice visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], where he met Anglican missionary [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]]. They studied the [[Ona people|Ona]] and [[Yahgan]] peoples, with whom Bridges had worked for two decades. During this time, he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.<ref name=\"parson\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/21/104935739.pdf \"Cook Tried to Steal Parson's Life Work\"].

He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's Denali ascent was also fraudulent.\n\nUnlike [[Hudson Stuck]] in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on [[Fake Peak|a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier]], {{Convert|19|mi|km|abbr=}} away.<ref>Bryce, R. (1997).

Both expeditions went to the same area of [[Jones Sound]] in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization.<ref>Osczevski (2003).</ref>\n\nCook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as [[American football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] [[Fielding H. Yost]] (as related in [[Fred Russell]]'s 1943 book, ''I'll Go Quietly'').\n\n[[File:Picture of Frederick Cook.jpg|thumb|Cook in arctic gear]]\nCook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with [[Harry Whitney]], an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey {{Convert|700|mi|km|abbr=}} south to [[Upernavik]]. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the US on Peary's ship ''Roosevelt'' in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.\n\nOn December 21, 1909, a commission at the [[University of Copenhagen]], after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/22/101752152.pdf | title=University Finds That Cook's Papers Contain no Proof That He Reached the North Pole | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 22, 1909 | accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref> (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the [[National Geographic Society]], which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)\n\nCook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some.<ref>Cook, F. (1911). ''My Attainment of the Pole''. pp. 258, 274. Cook's first account of what he left with Whitney did not mention data, and Whitney knew of no data in what was left with him.

The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge.<ref>Osczevski, R. J. (2003). ''Arctic''. '''56''' (4).</ref> Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.\n\nThe Peary expedition's people (primarily [[Matthew Henson]], who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had traveled only a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook that correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown [[Meighen Island]], which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed.<ref>Osczevski, R.

Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.\n\nAt the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: \"I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision.\"\n\n== Reputation ==\nCook's reputation never recovered from the attacks on his claim. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has since been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the [[National Geographic Society]], which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. \n\nResearching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to assess how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and evaluated them against the period of the [[Gilded Age]].<ref name=\"ringle\"/> He believes that Cook, as a physician and [[ethnographer]], cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook \"genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration\u2014mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge\u2014and that of the world\u2014for its own sake.\"<ref name=\"ringle\">[http://www.surveyhistory.org/the_polar_controversy_resolved1.htm Ken Ringle, review: \"''Cook & Peary - The Polar Controversy Resolved''\"], ''Backsights'', 1997, published by Surveyors Historical Society, accessed 3 October 2013</ref> But, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain financial support for continued expeditions.\n\n=== Fraud trial ===\nIn 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and went to trial. Also tried was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.\n\nAmong other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]], who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud. In November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.<ref>Olien, R. (1989). \"Doctor Frederick A. Cook and the Petroleum Producers' Association\", ''Journal of the West''. '''28''' (4). pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n== Later life ==\nCook was imprisoned until 1930. [[Roald Amundsen]], who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the ''Belgica'', visited him several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Cook was [[pardon]]ed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5.

Increased restrictions and labeling of cannabis as a poison began in many states from 1906 onward, and outright prohibitions began in the 1920s. By the mid-1930s cannabis was regulated as a drug in every state, including 35 states that adopted the [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]].<ref name=\"druglibrary.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/vlr/vlr3.htm |title=Richard J.

Despite this, states and other jurisdictions have continued to implement policies that conflict with federal law, beginning with the passage of California's [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]] in 1996.

Poison laws generally either required labels on the packaging indicating the harmful effects of the drugs or prohibited sale outside of licensed pharmacies and without a doctor's prescription.

Other regulations were prohibitions on the sale to minors, as well as restrictions on refills. Some pharmaceutical laws specifically enumerated the drugs that came under the effect of the regulations, while others did not\u2014leaving the matter to medical experts.

The new revisions aimed to restrict all narcotics, including cannabis, as poisons, limit their sale to pharmacies, and require doctor's prescriptions. The first instance was in the [[District of Columbia]] in 1906, under \"An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes\". The act was updated in 1938 to the Federal Pure Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938 which remains in effect even today, creating a legal paradox for federal sentencing. Under this act, the framework for prescription and non-prescription drugs and foods are set, along with standards as well as the enforcing agency, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). \"Goods found in violation of the law were subject to seizure and destruction at the expense of the manufacturer. That, combined with a legal requirement that all convictions be published (Notices of Judgment), proved to be important tools in the enforcement of the statute and had a deterrent effect upon would-be violators.\" Marijuana remains under this law defined as a \"dangerous drug\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/woodward.htm |title=Statement Of Dr. William C.

They argue that the reason for developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with [[silk]] and [[rayon]] in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caimateriali.org/index.php?id=32|title=the history of nylon|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Wolfe2008\">{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Nylon: A Revolution in Textiles|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/nylon-a-revolution-in-textiles|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|volume=26|issue=3|last1=Wolfe|first1=Audra J.|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/carotherspolymers/first-nylon-plant-historical-resource.pdf|title=American Chemical Society: THE FIRST NYLON PLANT. 1995|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hanfstengel.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Hemp, bast with fibers.

Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants the federal government jurisdiction, pursuant to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, to prosecute marijuana offenses.\n\nIn ''Gonzales'' the defendants argued that because the cannabis in question had been grown, transported, and consumed entirely within California and in compliance with California medical cannabis laws, their activity did not implicate interstate commerce, and as such could not be regulated by the federal government through the Commerce Clause.\n\nThe Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that cannabis grown within California for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana and that because the intrastate medical cannabis market contributes to the interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where California citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law.<ref>Supreme Court.

Increased restrictions and labeling of cannabis as a poison began in many states from 1906 onward, and outright prohibitions began in the 1920s.

Multiple efforts to [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|reschedule cannabis]] under the CSA have failed, and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[United States v.

Despite this, states and other jurisdictions have continued to implement policies that conflict with federal law, beginning with the passage of California's [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]] in 1996.

The new revisions aimed to restrict all narcotics, including cannabis, as poisons, limit their sale to pharmacies, and require doctor's prescriptions. The first instance was in the [[District of Columbia]] in 1906, under \"An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes\". The act was updated in 1938 to the Federal Pure Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938 which remains in effect even today, creating a legal paradox for federal sentencing. Under this act, the framework for prescription and non-prescription drugs and foods are set, along with standards as well as the enforcing agency, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). \"Goods found in violation of the law were subject to seizure and destruction at the expense of the manufacturer. That, combined with a legal requirement that all convictions be published (Notices of Judgment), proved to be important tools in the enforcement of the statute and had a deterrent effect upon would-be violators.\" Marijuana remains under this law defined as a \"dangerous drug\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/woodward.htm |title=Statement Of Dr. William C.

In New York, reform legislation began under the Towns-Boylan Act, which targeted all \"habit-forming drugs\", restricted their sale, prohibited refills in order to prevent habituation, prohibited sale to people with a habit, and prohibited doctors who were themselves habituated from selling them.<ref>{{cite news|title=TO MAKE IT TO GET HABIT DRUGS; Towns-Boylan Bill at Albany Would Stop the Loopholes in Present Prescription Law.|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 26, 1914|location=New York City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1914/01/26/archives/to-make-it-harder-to-get-habit-drugs-townsboylan-bill-at-albany.html}}</ref> Shortly after, several amendments were passed by the New York Board of Health, including adding cannabis to the list of habit-forming drugs.<ref>{{cite news|title=MUZZLES THE DOGS ALL THE YEAR 'ROUND; Health Board Seeks to Stop the Increase of Rabies by Sanitary Law.

The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed the [[Harrison Act]] in 1914 and the Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all that was necessary. The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or in regard to punishment of those responsible.

They argue that the reason for developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with [[silk]] and [[rayon]] in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce.

Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants the federal government jurisdiction, pursuant to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, to prosecute marijuana offenses.\n\nIn ''Gonzales'' the defendants argued that because the cannabis in question had been grown, transported, and consumed entirely within California and in compliance with California medical cannabis laws, their activity did not implicate interstate commerce, and as such could not be regulated by the federal government through the Commerce Clause.\n\nThe Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that cannabis grown within California for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana and that because the intrastate medical cannabis market contributes to the interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where California citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law.<ref>Supreme Court.

Unlike Initiative 502, Amendment 64 allowed for personal cultivation of up to six plants. Both allowed for commercial cultivation and sales, subject to regulation and taxes.\n\n====Cole Memorandum (2013)====\nAfter the first states legalized in 2012, the Justice Department issued the [[Cole Memorandum]] in August 2013, seeking to clarify how federal law would be enforced.

The episode was written by Vivian Tse and directed by [[Sharat Raju]].\n\nAfter the death of [[Siddiq (The Walking Dead)|Siddiq]] ([[Avi Nash]]), [[Michonne]] ([[Danai Gurira]]) embarks on a trip to the island of Virgil ([[Kevin Carroll (actor)|Kevin Carroll]]), to obtain weapons to defeat [[Alpha (The Walking Dead)|Alpha]] and the Whisperers, and help Virgil rejoin his family, without imagining that something awaits more than a trap.\n\nThe episode features the return of Avi Nash as Siddiq, whose character was killed in the seventh episode of the tenth season (\"[[Open Your Eyes (The Walking Dead)|Open Your Eyes]]\"). It also marks the final regular appearance of Danai Gurira as Michonne, who first appeared in the [[The Walking Dead (season 3)|season three]] premiere episode \"[[Seed (The Walking Dead)|Seed]]\". The episode also features [[stock footage|archive footage]] of [[Andrew Lincoln]] ([[Rick Grimes]]), [[Chandler Riggs]] ([[Carl Grimes]]), [[Laurie Holden]] ([[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]]), [[Steven Yeun]] ([[Glenn Rhee]]), [[Lauren Cohan]] ([[Maggie Greene]]), [[Sonequa Martin-Green]] ([[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha Williams]]), [[Michael Cudlitz]] ([[Abraham Ford]]), [[Austin Amelio]] ([[Dwight (The Walking Dead)|Dwight]]), [[Steven Ogg]] ([[Simon (The Walking Dead)|Simon]]), and more.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:TVPLOT, plot summaries for episode articles should have no more than 400 words. -->\nMichonne and Virgil use a boat to travel to Bloodsworth Island, an abandoned naval base where he claims his family and a stash of weapons can be found. Virgil soon admits his family is dead and asks for Michonne's help to put them down. Michonne helps clear the base of walkers, finds Virgil's family who had hung themselves within a cell, and helps Virgil put them to put them to rest and bury them. Virgil promises to lead Michonne to the weapons the next day.\n\nMichonne becomes impatient and takes off that night to look, but finds herself in a locked cell, a trap set by Virgil. Virgil's allies, trapped in an adjacent cell, warn Michonne Virgil has gone insane since he inadvertently locked his family in the cell while they went scavenging, leading to their hanging.\n\nVirgil feeds Michonne some drugged food, giving her hallucinations. In these sequences, she first recalls Siddiq and then experiences her life if she had ignored Andrea's cries for help, which led her to meeting Negan and joining the Saviors, fighting against Rick and his allies, but eventually killed by Daryl.\n\nAs Michonne regains her senses, Virgil offers her water, and Michonne uses the opportunity to attack him. Virgil flees, and Michonne helps the others out of their cell, but too late find Michonne's boat aflame. Capturing Virgil, the other three want to kill him, but Michonne shows mercy and reasons through Virgil to help. As the other three make repairs to another boat to return to the mainland, Virgil shows Michonne a room full of scavenged gear, and she recognizes Rick's boots among the items. Virgil takes her to a grounded military boat where he had found them, where among other equipment, she finds a cell phone etched with Rick's name and a drawing of her and Judith on its face, along with a log book indicating Rick may be alive near New Jersey.\n\nVirgil refuses to take the boat back to the mainland, and Michonne leaves with the other three. She contacts Judith via walkie-talkie, telling her that Rick is alive, and plans to talk to her each day as she searches. Later, she decides to help two stragglers catch up to a large number of organized human formations moving north.\n\n==Production and development==\n{{multiple image\n| align       = right\n| image1      = Danai Gurira (48411663897) (cropped).jpg\n| total_width = 350\n| image2      = Avi Nash by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| footer      = [[Danai Gurira]] (''left'') makes her final regular appearance in \"What We Become\".

The episode was written by Vivian Tse and directed by [[Sharat Raju]].\n\nAfter the death of [[Siddiq (The Walking Dead)|Siddiq]] ([[Avi Nash]]), [[Michonne]] ([[Danai Gurira]]) embarks on a trip to the island of Virgil ([[Kevin Carroll (actor)|Kevin Carroll]]), to obtain weapons to defeat [[Alpha (The Walking Dead)|Alpha]] and the Whisperers, and help Virgil rejoin his family, without imagining that something awaits more than a trap.\n\nThis episode features the return of Avi Nash as Siddiq, whose character was killed in the seventh episode of the tenth season, \"[[Open Your Eyes (The Walking Dead)|Open Your Eyes]]\". It also marks the final appearances of [[Danai Gurira]] ([[Michonne]]), who first appeared in the [[The Walking Dead (season 3)|third season]] premiere episode \"[[Seed (The Walking Dead)|Seed]]\". The episode also features archive footage of [[Andrew Lincoln]] ([[Rick Grimes]]), [[Chandler Riggs]] ([[Carl Grimes]]), [[Laurie Holden]] ([[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]]), [[Steven Yeun]] ([[Glenn Rhee]]), [[Lauren Cohan]] ([[Maggie Greene]]), [[Sonequa Martin-Green]] ([[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha Williams]]), [[Michael Cudlitz]] ([[Abraham Ford]]), [[Austin Amelio]] ([[Dwight (The Walking Dead)|Dwight]]), [[Steven Ogg]] ([[Simon (The Walking Dead)|Simon]]), and more.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:TVPLOT, plot summaries for episode articles should have no more than 400 words. -->\nMichonne and Virgil use a boat to travel to Bloodsworth Island, an abandoned naval base where he claims his family and a stash of weapons can be found. Virgil soon admits his family is dead and asks for Michonne's help to put them down. Michonne helps clear the base of walkers, finds Virgil's family who had hung themselves within a cell, and helps Virgil put them to put them to rest and bury them. Virgil promises to lead Michonne to the weapons the next day.\n\nMichonne becomes impatient and takes off that night to look, but finds herself in a locked cell, a trap set by Virgil. Virgil's allies, trapped in an adjacent cell, warn Michonne Virgil has gone insane since he inadvertently locked his family in the cell while they went scavenging, leading to their hanging. \n\nVirgil feeds Michonne some drugged food, giving her hallucinations. In these sequences, she first recalls Siddiq and then experiences her life if she had ignored Andrea's cries for help, which led her to meeting Negan and joining the Saviors, fighting against Rick and his allies, but eventually killed by Daryl.\n\nAs Michonne regains her senses, Virgil offers her water, and Michonne uses the opportunity to attack him. Virgil flees, and Michonne helps the others out of their cell, but too late find Michonne's boat aflame. Capturing Virgil, the other three want to kill him, but Michonne shows mercy and reasons through Virgil to help. As the other three make repairs to another boat to return to the mainland, Virgil shows Michonne a room full of scavenged gear, and she recognizes Rick's boots among the items. Virgil takes her to a grounded military boat where he had found them, where among other equipment, she finds a cell phone etched with Rick's name and a drawing of her and Judith on its face, along with a log book indicating Rick may be alive near New Jersey.\n\nVirgil refuses to take the boat back to the mainland, and Michonne leaves with the other three. She contacts Judith via walkie-talkie, telling her that Rick is alive, and plans to talk to her each day as she searches. Later, she comes to help two stragglers catch up to a large number of organized human formations moving north.\n\n==Production and development==\n{{multiple image\n| align       = right\n| image1      = Danai Gurira (43606261602) (cropped).jpg\n| total_width = 350\n| image2      = Avi Nash by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| footer      = [[Danai Gurira]] (''left'') makes her final regular appearance on \"What We Become\" and [[Avi Nash]] (''right'') also makes his final appearance.}}\n\n{{multiple image|left|perrow=3|total_width=350\n| image1 = Andrew Lincoln (42749683025) (cropped).jpg|height1=350\n| image2 = Chandler Riggs - 2018077122146 2018-03-18 Walker Stalker Con - Sven - 1D X MK II - 605 - AK8I9646 (cropped).jpg|height2=350\n| image3 = Laurie Holden 2012.jpg|height3=350\n| image4 = Steven Yeun 2016.jpg|height4=350\n| image5 = Lauren Cohan by Gage Skidmore 4.jpg|height5=350\n| image6 = Sonequa Martin-Green 2019 (cropped).jpg|height6=350\n| image7 = Michael Cudlitz 2016 (cropped).jpg|height7=350\n| image8 = Austin Amelio by Gage Skidmore.jpg|height8=350\n| image9 = Steven Ogg - 2018076123859 2018-03-17 Walker Stalker Con - Sven - 1D X MK II - 0435 - AK8I8091 (cropped).jpg|height9=350\n| footer = Archive footage of [[Andrew Lincoln]] ([[Rick Grimes]]), [[Chandler Riggs]] ([[Carl Grimes]]), [[Laurie Holden]] ([[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]]), [[Steven Yeun]] ([[Glenn Rhee]]), [[Lauren Cohan]] ([[Maggie Greene]]), [[Sonequa Martin-Green]] ([[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha Williams]]), [[Michael Cudlitz]] ([[Abraham Ford]]), [[Austin Amelio]] ([[Dwight (The Walking Dead)|Dwight]]), and [[Steven Ogg]] ([[Simon (The Walking Dead)|Simon]]) was used in this episode\n}}\n\nThe episode marks the departure of [[Danai Gurira]] as [[Michonne]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-danai-gurira-exit-explained-interview-1285840 |title='Walking Dead' Star Danai Gurira Opens Up About Filming Her \"Trippy\" Last Episode |last=Wigler |first=Josh |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 22, 2020 |accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref> Gurira's departure from the series was announced in February 2019.<ref name=\"Danai Gurira\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-danai-gurira-exit-1184189 |title='Walking Dead' Shocker: Danai Gurira to Exit |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=February 8, 2019 |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref> In July 2019, Gurira confirmed her exit at a panel at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], and stated:\n\n{{cquote|I can confirm this is the last season I'll be on this amazing TV show as Michonne.
