At the age of four, after consuming rabbit broth, he came up with the idea. \n\nIn [[algebra]], a '''quadratic equation''' (from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|quadratus}} for \"[[Square (algebra)|square]]\") is any equation that can be rearranged in standard form as \n\n:<math>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''x''}} represents an [[Equation|unknown]], and {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} represent known numbers, where {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}. If {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}, then the equation is [[linear equation|linear]], not quadratic, as there is no <math>ax^2</math> term. The numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are the ''[[coefficient]]s'' of the equation and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the ''quadratic coefficient'', the ''linear coefficient'' and the ''constant'' or ''free term''.<ref>Protters & Morrey: \"Calculus and Analytic Geometry. First Course\".</ref>\n\nThe values of {{mvar|x}} that satisfy the equation are called ''[[solution (mathematics)|solutions]]'' of the equation, and ''[[zero of a function|roots]]'' or ''[[zero of a function|zeros]]'' of its left-hand side. A quadratic equation has at most two solutions. If there is no [[real number|real]] solution, there are two [[complex number|complex]] solutions. If there is only one solution, one says that it is a [[double root]]. A quadratic equation always has two roots, if complex roots are included and a double root is counted for two. A quadratic equation can be [[Factorization|factored]] into an equivalent equation \n:<math>ax^2+bx+c=a(x-r)(x-s)=0</math>\nwhere {{Mvar|r}} and {{Mvar|s}} are the solutions for {{Mvar|x}}. [[Completing the square]] on a quadratic equation in standard form results in the [[quadratic formula]], which expresses the solutions in terms of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}}. Solutions to problems that can be expressed in terms of quadratic equations were known as early as 2000 BC.\n\nBecause the quadratic equation involves only one unknown, it is called \"[[univariate]]\". The quadratic equation only contains [[exponentiation|powers]] of {{math|''x''}} that are non-negative integers, and therefore it is a [[polynomial equation]]. In particular, it is a [[degree of a polynomial|second-degree]] polynomial equation, since the greatest power is two.\n\n==Solving the quadratic equation==\n[[File:Quadratic equation coefficients.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1.

The left plot illustrates varying c. When c equals 0, the vertex of the parabola representing the quadratic function is centered on the origin, and the parabola rises on both sides of the origin, opening to the top. When c is greater than zero, the parabola does not change in shape, but its vertex is raised above the origin. When c is less than zero, the vertex of the parabola is lowered below the origin. The center plot illustrates varying b. When b is less than zero, the parabola representing the quadratic function is unchanged in shape, but its vertex is shifted to the right of and below the origin. When b is greater than zero, its vertex is shifted to the left of and below the origin. The vertices of the family of curves created by varying b follow along a parabolic curve. The right plot illustrates varying eh. When eh is positive, the quadratic function is a parabola opening to the top. When eh is zero, the quadratic function is a horizontal straight line. When eh is negative, the quadratic function is a parabola opening to the bottom.]]\nA quadratic equation with [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[coefficients]] has two solutions, called ''roots''. These two solutions may or may not be distinct, and they may or may not be real.\n\n===Factoring by inspection===\nIt may be possible to express a quadratic equation {{math|''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c'' {{=}} 0}} as a product {{math|(''px'' + ''q'')(''rx'' + ''s'') {{=}} 0}}. In some cases, it is possible, by simple inspection, to determine values of ''p'', ''q'', ''r,'' and ''s'' that make the two forms equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the second form, then the \"Zero Factor Property\" states that the quadratic equation is satisfied if {{math|''px'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''rx'' + ''s'' {{=}} 0}}. Solving these two linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.\n\nFor most students, factoring by inspection is the first method of solving quadratic equations to which they are exposed.<ref name=Washington2000>{{cite book|last=Washington|first=Allyn J.|title=Basic Technical Mathematics with Calculus, Seventh Edition|year=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.|isbn=978-0-201-35666-3}}</ref>{{rp|202&ndash;207}} If one is given a quadratic equation in the form {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c'' {{=}} 0}}, the sought factorization has the form {{math|(''x'' + ''q'')(''x'' + ''s'')}}, and one has to find two numbers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''s''}} that add up to {{math| ''b''}} and whose product is {{math|''c''}} (this is sometimes called \"Vieta's rule\"<ref>{{citation|title=Numbers|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=123|first1=Heinz-Dieter|last1=Ebbinghaus|first2=John H.|last2=Ewing|publisher=Springer|year=1991|isbn=9780387974972|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKcKowxXwKkC&pg=PA77}}.</ref> and is related to [[Vieta's formulas]]). As an example, {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 5''x'' + 6}} factors as {{math|(''x'' + 3)(''x'' + 2)}}. The more general case where {{math|''a''}} does not equal {{math|1}} can require a considerable effort in trial and error guess-and-check, assuming that it can be factored at all by inspection.\n\nExcept for special cases such as where {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''c'' {{=}} 0}}, factoring by inspection only works for quadratic equations that have rational roots. This means that the great majority of quadratic equations that arise in practical applications cannot be solved by factoring by inspection.<ref name=Washington2000/>{{rp|207}}\n\n===Completing the square===\n{{Main|Completing the square}}\n[[File:Polynomialdeg2.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2.

These result in slightly different forms for the solution, but are otherwise equivalent.\n\nA number of [[Quadratic formula#Other derivations|alternative derivations]] can be found in the literature.  These proofs are simpler than the standard completing the square method, represent interesting applications of other frequently used techniques in algebra, or offer insight into other areas of mathematics.\n\nA lesser known quadratic formula, as used in [[Muller's method]] provides the same roots via the equation\n:<math>x = \\frac{2c}{-b \\pm \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}.</math> \nThis can be deduced from the standard quadratic formula by [[Vieta's formulas]], which assert that the product of the roots is {{math|''c''/''a''}}.\n\nOne property of this form is that it yields one valid root when {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}, while the other root contains division by zero, because when {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}, the quadratic equation becomes a linear equation, which has one root. By contrast, in this case, the more common formula has a division by zero for one root and an [[indeterminate form]] {{math|0/0}} for the other root. On the other hand, when {{math|''c'' {{=}} 0}}, the more common formula yields two correct roots whereas this form yields the zero root and an indeterminate form {{math|0/0}}.\n\n===Reduced quadratic equation===\nIt is sometimes convenient to reduce a quadratic equation so that its [[leading coefficient]] is one. This is done by dividing both sides by ''a'', which is always possible since ''a'' is non-zero.  This produces the ''reduced quadratic equation'':<ref>Alenit\u0361syn, Aleksandr and Butikov, Evgeni\u012d. ''Concise Handbook of Mathematics and Physics'', p. 38 (CRC Press 1997)</ref>\n\n:<math>x^2+px+q=0,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' = ''b''/''a'' and ''q'' = ''c''/''a''. This [[monic polynomial|monic equation]] has the same solutions as the original.\n\nThe quadratic formula for the solutions of the reduced quadratic equation, written in terms of its coefficients, is:\n:<math>x = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( - p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q} \\right) ,</math>\nor equivalently:\n:<math>x = - \\frac{p}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{p}{2}\\right)^2 - q}.</math>\n\n===Discriminant===\n[[File:Quadratic eq discriminant.svg|thumb|right|Figure 3. Discriminant signs|alt=Figure 3. This figure plots three quadratic functions on a single Cartesian plane graph to illustrate the effects of discriminant values. When the discriminant, delta, is positive, the parabola intersects the {{math|''x''}}-axis at two points. When delta is zero, the vertex of the parabola touches the {{math|''x''}}-axis at a single point. When delta is negative, the parabola does not intersect the {{math|''x''}}-axis at all.]]\nIn the quadratic formula, the expression underneath the square root sign is called the ''[[discriminant]]'' of the quadratic equation, and is often represented using an upper case {{math|''D''}} or an upper case Greek [[Delta (letter)|delta]]:<ref>'''\u0394''' is the initial of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word '''\u0394'''\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1, ''Diakr\u00ednousa'', discriminant.</ref>\n:<math>\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac.</math>\nA quadratic equation with ''real'' coefficients can have either one or two distinct real roots, or two distinct complex roots.

The location and size of the parabola, and how it opens, depend on the values of {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}. As shown in Figure&nbsp;1, if {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}}, the parabola has a minimum point and opens upward. If {{math|''a'' &lt; 0}}, the parabola has a maximum point and opens downward. The extreme point of the parabola, whether minimum or maximum, corresponds to its [[vertex (curve)|vertex]]. The ''{{math|x}}-coordinate'' of the vertex will be located at <math>\\scriptstyle x=\\tfrac{-b}{2a}</math>, and the ''{{math|y}}-coordinate'' of the vertex may be found by substituting this ''{{math|x}}-value'' into the function.

As shown in Figure&nbsp;3, if the discriminant is positive, the graph touches the [[x-axis|{{math|''x''}}-axis]] at two points; if zero, the graph touches at one point; and if negative, the graph does not touch the {{math|''x''}}-axis.\n\n===Quadratic factorization===\nThe term\n:<math>x - r</math>\nis a factor of the polynomial\n: <math>ax^2+bx+c</math>\nif and only if {{math|''r''}} is a [[root of a function|root]] of the quadratic equation\n: <math>ax^2+bx+c=0.</math>\nIt follows from the quadratic formula that\n: <math>ax^2+bx+c = a \\left( x - \\frac{-b + \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\right) \\left( x - \\frac{-b - \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\right).</math>\nIn the special case {{math|''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 4''ac''}} where the quadratic has only one distinct root (''i.e.'' the discriminant is zero), the quadratic polynomial can be [[Factorization|factored]] as\n:<math>ax^2+bx+c = a \\left( x + \\frac{b}{2a} \\right)^2.</math>\n\n===Graphical solution===\n[[File:Graphical calculation of root of quadratic equation.png|240px|thumb|Figure 4.

Graph of the difference between Vieta's approximation for the smaller of the two roots of the quadratic equation x squared plus b x plus c equals zero compared with the value calculated using the quadratic formula. The difference is plotted as a function of b for two different values of c, c equals 4, and c equals 400,000. The graph is a log log graph, with the vertical axis, the difference, ranging from ten to the minus 13 at the bottom to ten to the minus 1 at the top. The horizontal axis, b, ranges from 10 at the left to ten to the eighth at the right. Vieta's approximation for the smaller root is not accurate for small b but is accurate for large b. The direct evaluation of the smaller root using the quadratic formula is accurate for small b with roots of comparable value, but experiences loss of significance errors for large b and widely spaced roots. When c equals 4, Vieta's approximation starts off poorly at the left, but gets better with larger b, the difference between Vieta's approximation and the quadratic formula reaching a minimum at approximately b equals ten to the fifth. Vieta's approximation and the quadratic formula then start diverging again because the quadratic formula experiences loss of significance error. When c equals four hundred thousand, the difference between Vieta's approximation and the quadratic formula reaches a minimum at approximately b equals ten to the seventh. The curves are both straight to the left of the minimum, indicating a simple monomial power relationship between the difference and b. Likewise, the curves are both approximately straight to the right of the minimum, indicating a power relationship, except that the straight lines have squiggles in them due to the loss of significance errors in the quadratic formula.]]\n\nVieta's formulas give a simple relation between the roots of a polynomial and its coefficients. In the case of the quadratic polynomial, they take the following form:\n:<math> x_1 + x_2 = -\\frac{b}{a} </math>\nand\n:<math> x_1 x_2 = \\frac{c}{a}.</math>\nThese results follow immediately from the relation:\n:<math>\\left( x - x_1 \\right) \\left( x-x_2 \\right ) = x^2 - \\left( x_1+x_2 \\right)x +x_1 x_2 = 0,</math>\nwhich can be compared term by term with\n:<math> x^2 + (b/a)x +c/a = 0.</math>\nThe first formula above yields a convenient expression when graphing a quadratic function. Since the graph is symmetric with respect to a vertical line through the [[Quadratic function#Vertex|vertex]], when there are two real roots the vertex's {{math|''x''}}-coordinate is located at the average of the roots (or intercepts). Thus the {{math|''x''}}-coordinate of the vertex is given by the expression\n:<math> x_V = \\frac {x_1 + x_2} {2} = -\\frac{b}{2a}.</math>\nThe {{math|''y''}}-coordinate can be obtained by substituting the above result into the given quadratic equation, giving\n:<math> y_V = - \\frac{b^2}{4a} + c = - \\frac{ b^2 - 4ac} {4a}.</math>\n\nAs a practical matter, Vieta's formulas provide a useful method for finding the roots of a quadratic in the case where one root is much smaller than the other. If {{math|{{!}}&#8239;''x''\u2009<sub>2</sub>{{!}} &lt;&lt; {{!}}&#8239;''x''\u2009<sub>1</sub>{{!}}}}, then {{math|''x''\u2009<sub>1</sub> + ''x''\u2009<sub>2</sub> &asymp; ''x''\u2009<sub>1</sub>}}, and we have the estimate:\n:<math> x_1 \\approx -\\frac{b}{a} .</math>\nThe second Vieta's formula then provides:\n:<math>x_2 = \\frac{c}{a x_1} \\approx -\\frac{c}{b} .</math>\nThese formulas are much easier to evaluate than the quadratic formula under the condition of one large and one small root, because the quadratic formula evaluates the small root as the difference of two very nearly equal numbers (the case of large {{math|''b''}}), which causes [[round-off error]] in a numerical evaluation. Figure&nbsp;5 shows the difference between (i)&nbsp;a direct evaluation using the quadratic formula (accurate when the roots are near each other in value) and (ii)&nbsp;an evaluation based upon the above approximation of Vieta's formulas (accurate when the roots are widely spaced). As the linear coefficient {{math|''b''}} increases, initially the quadratic formula is accurate, and the approximate formula improves in accuracy, leading to a smaller difference between the methods as {{math|''b''}} increases. However, at some point the quadratic formula begins to lose accuracy because of round off error, while the approximate method continues to improve. Consequently, the difference between the methods begins to increase as the quadratic formula becomes worse and worse.\n\nThis situation arises commonly in amplifier design, where widely separated roots are desired to ensure a stable operation (see [[step response]]).\n\n====Trigonometric solution====\nIn the days before calculators, people would use [[mathematical table]]s\u2014lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments\u2014to simplify and speed up computation. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks. Specialized tables were published for applications such as astronomy, celestial navigation and statistics. Methods of numerical approximation existed, called [[prosthaphaeresis]], that offered shortcuts around time-consuming operations such as multiplication and taking powers and roots.<ref name=Ballew2007>{{cite web|last=Ballew|first=Pat|title=Solving Quadratic Equations \u2014 By analytic and graphic methods; Including several methods you may never have seen|url=http://www.pballew.net/quadsol.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409173024/http://www.pballew.net/quadsol.pdf|archive-date=9 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Astronomers, especially, were concerned with methods that could speed up the long series of computations involved in [[celestial mechanics]] calculations.\n\nIt is within this context that we may understand the development of means of solving quadratic equations by the aid of trigonometric substitution. Consider the following alternate form of the quadratic equation,\n\n'''[1]'''&nbsp;&nbsp; <math>ax^2 + bx \\pm c = 0 ,</math>\n\nwhere the sign of the \u00b1 symbol is chosen so that {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''c''}} may both be positive.

Substituting the two values of {{math|''&theta;''<sub>n</sub>}} or {{math|''&theta;''<sub>p</sub>}} found from equations '''[4]''' or '''[5]''' into '''[2]''' gives the required roots of '''[1]'''. Complex roots occur in the solution based on equation '''[5]''' if the absolute value of {{math|sin 2''&theta;''<sub>p</sub>}} exceeds unity.

Geometric solution of eh x squared plus b x plus c = 0 using Lill's method. The geometric construction is as follows: Draw a trapezoid S Eh B C. Line S Eh of length eh is the vertical left side of the trapezoid. Line Eh B of length b is the horizontal bottom of the trapezoid. Line B C of length c is the vertical right side of the trapezoid. Line C S completes the trapezoid. From the midpoint of line C S, draw a circle passing through points C and S. Depending on the relative lengths of eh, b, and c, the circle may or may not intersect line Eh B. If it does, then the equation has a solution. If we call the intersection points X 1 and X 2, then the two solutions are given by negative Eh X 1 divided by S Eh, and negative Eh X 2 divided by S Eh.]]\n\nThe quadratic equation may be solved geometrically in a number of ways. One way is via [[Lill's method]]. The three coefficients {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}} are drawn with right angles between them as in SA, AB, and BC in Figure&nbsp;6. A circle is drawn with the start and end point SC as a diameter. If this cuts the middle line AB of the three then the equation has a solution, and the solutions are given by negative of the distance along this line from A divided by the first coefficient {{math|''a''}} or SA. If {{math|''a''}} is {{math|1}} the coefficients may be read off directly. Thus the solutions in the diagram are &minus;AX1/SA and &minus;AX2/SA.<ref>{{Citation |title=Graphical Method for finding readily the Real Roots of Numerical Equations of Any Degree |first=William Herbert |last=Bixby |year=1879 |publisher=West Point N.

(In a field of characteristic 2, the element {{math|2''a''}} is zero and it is impossible to divide by it.)\n\nThe symbol\n:<math>\\pm \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}</math>\nin the formula should be understood as \"either of the two elements whose square is {{math|''b''<sup>2</sup> &minus; 4''ac''}}, if such elements exist\". In some fields, some elements have no square roots and some have two; only zero has just one square root, except in fields of characteristic {{math|2}}. Even if a field does not contain a square root of some number, there is always a quadratic [[extension field]] which does, so the quadratic formula will always make sense as a formula in that extension field.\n\n====Characteristic 2====\nIn a field of characteristic {{math|2}}, the quadratic formula, which relies on {{math|2}} being a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], does not hold. Consider the [[monic polynomial|monic]] quadratic polynomial\n:<math>x^{2} + bx + c</math>\nover a field of characteristic {{math|2}}. If {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}}, then the solution reduces to extracting a square root, so the solution is\n:<math>x = \\sqrt{c}</math>\nand there is only one root since\n:<math>-\\sqrt{c} = -\\sqrt{c} + 2\\sqrt{c} = \\sqrt{c}.</math>\nIn summary,\n:<math>\\displaystyle x^{2} + c = (x + \\sqrt{c})^{2}.</math>\nSee [[quadratic residue]] for more information about extracting square roots in finite fields.\n\nIn the case that {{math|''b'' &ne; 0}}, there are two distinct roots, but if the polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]], they cannot be expressed in terms of square roots of numbers in the coefficient field.

One verifies that {{math|''R''(''c'') + 1}} is also a root.

If {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}, then the equation is [[linear equation|linear]], not quadratic, as there is no <math>ax^2</math> term. The numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are the ''[[coefficient]]s'' of the equation and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the ''quadratic coefficient'', the ''linear coefficient'' and the ''constant'' or ''free term''.<ref>Protters & Morrey: \"Calculus and Analytic Geometry. First Course\".</ref>\n\nThe values of {{mvar|x}} that satisfy the equation are called ''[[solution (mathematics)|solutions]]'' of the equation, and ''[[zero of a function|roots]]'' or ''[[zero of a function|zeros]]'' of its left-hand side. A quadratic equation has at most two solutions. If there is no [[real number|real]] solution, there are two [[complex number|complex]] solutions. If there is only one solution, one says that it is a [[double root]]. A quadratic equation always has two roots, if complex roots are included and a double root is counted for two. A quadratic equation can be [[Factorization|factored]] into an equivalent equation \n:<math>ax^2+bx+c=a(x-r)(x-s)=0</math>\nwhere {{Mvar|r}} and {{Mvar|s}} are the solutions for {{Mvar|x}}. [[Completing the square]] on a quadratic equation in standard form results in the [[quadratic formula]], which expresses the solutions in terms of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}}. Solutions to problems that can be expressed in terms of quadratic equations were known as early as 2000 BC.\n\nBecause the quadratic equation involves only one unknown, it is called \"[[univariate]]\". The quadratic equation only contains [[exponentiation|powers]] of {{math|''x''}} that are non-negative integers, and therefore it is a [[polynomial equation]]. In particular, it is a [[degree of a polynomial|second-degree]] polynomial equation, since the greatest power is two.\n\n==Solving the quadratic equation==\n[[File:Quadratic equation coefficients.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1.

These two solutions may or may not be distinct, and they may or may not be real.\n\n===Factoring by inspection===\nIt may be possible to express a quadratic equation {{math|''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c'' {{=}} 0}} as a product {{math|(''px'' + ''q'')(''rx'' + ''s'') {{=}} 0}}. In some cases, it is possible, by simple inspection, to determine values of ''p'', ''q'', ''r,'' and ''s'' that make the two forms equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the second form, then the \"Zero Factor Property\" states that the quadratic equation is satisfied if {{math|''px'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''rx'' + ''s'' {{=}} 0}}. Solving these two linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.\n\nFor most students, factoring by inspection is the first method of solving quadratic equations to which they are exposed.<ref name=Washington2000>{{cite book|last=Washington|first=Allyn J.|title=Basic Technical Mathematics with Calculus, Seventh Edition|year=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.|isbn=978-0-201-35666-3}}</ref>{{rp|202&ndash;207}} If one is given a quadratic equation in the form {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c'' {{=}} 0}}, the sought factorization has the form {{math|(''x'' + ''q'')(''x'' + ''s'')}}, and one has to find two numbers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''s''}} that add up to {{math| ''b''}} and whose product is {{math|''c''}} (this is sometimes called \"Vieta's rule\"<ref>{{citation|title=Numbers|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=123|first1=Heinz-Dieter|last1=Ebbinghaus|first2=John H.|last2=Ewing|publisher=Springer|year=1991|isbn=9780387974972|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKcKowxXwKkC&pg=PA77}}.</ref> and is related to [[Vieta's formulas]]).

By contrast, in this case, the more common formula has a division by zero for one root and an [[indeterminate form]] {{math|0/0}} for the other root. On the other hand, when {{math|''c'' {{=}} 0}}, the more common formula yields two correct roots whereas this form yields the zero root and an indeterminate form {{math|0/0}}.\n\n===Reduced quadratic equation===\nIt is sometimes convenient to reduce a quadratic equation so that its [[leading coefficient]] is one. This is done by dividing both sides by ''a'', which is always possible since ''a'' is non-zero.  This produces the ''reduced quadratic equation'':<ref>Alenit\u0361syn, Aleksandr and Butikov, Evgeni\u012d.

Graph of the difference between Vieta's approximation for the smaller of the two roots of the quadratic equation x squared plus b x plus c equals zero compared with the value calculated using the quadratic formula. The difference is plotted as a function of b for two different values of c, c equals 4, and c equals 400,000. The graph is a log log graph, with the vertical axis, the difference, ranging from ten to the minus 13 at the bottom to ten to the minus 1 at the top. The horizontal axis, b, ranges from 10 at the left to ten to the eighth at the right. Vieta's approximation for the smaller root is not accurate for small b but is accurate for large b. The direct evaluation of the smaller root using the quadratic formula is accurate for small b with roots of comparable value, but experiences loss of significance errors for large b and widely spaced roots. When c equals 4, Vieta's approximation starts off poorly at the left, but gets better with larger b, the difference between Vieta's approximation and the quadratic formula reaching a minimum at approximately b equals ten to the fifth. Vieta's approximation and the quadratic formula then start diverging again because the quadratic formula experiences loss of significance error. When c equals four hundred thousand, the difference between Vieta's approximation and the quadratic formula reaches a minimum at approximately b equals ten to the seventh. The curves are both straight to the left of the minimum, indicating a simple monomial power relationship between the difference and b. Likewise, the curves are both approximately straight to the right of the minimum, indicating a power relationship, except that the straight lines have squiggles in them due to the loss of significance errors in the quadratic formula.]]\n\nVieta's formulas give a simple relation between the roots of a polynomial and its coefficients. In the case of the quadratic polynomial, they take the following form:\n:<math> x_1 + x_2 = -\\frac{b}{a} </math>\nand\n:<math> x_1 x_2 = \\frac{c}{a}.</math>\nThese results follow immediately from the relation:\n:<math>\\left( x - x_1 \\right) \\left( x-x_2 \\right ) = x^2 - \\left( x_1+x_2 \\right)x +x_1 x_2 = 0,</math>\nwhich can be compared term by term with\n:<math> x^2 + (b/a)x +c/a = 0.</math>\nThe first formula above yields a convenient expression when graphing a quadratic function. Since the graph is symmetric with respect to a vertical line through the [[Quadratic function#Vertex|vertex]], when there are two real roots the vertex's {{math|''x''}}-coordinate is located at the average of the roots (or intercepts). Thus the {{math|''x''}}-coordinate of the vertex is given by the expression\n:<math> x_V = \\frac {x_1 + x_2} {2} = -\\frac{b}{2a}.</math>\nThe {{math|''y''}}-coordinate can be obtained by substituting the above result into the given quadratic equation, giving\n:<math> y_V = - \\frac{b^2}{4a} + c = - \\frac{ b^2 - 4ac} {4a}.</math>\n\nAs a practical matter, Vieta's formulas provide a useful method for finding the roots of a quadratic in the case where one root is much smaller than the other. If {{math|{{!}}&#8239;''x''\u2009<sub>2</sub>{{!}} &lt;&lt; {{!}}&#8239;''x''\u2009<sub>1</sub>{{!}}}}, then {{math|''x''\u2009<sub>1</sub> + ''x''\u2009<sub>2</sub> &asymp; ''x''\u2009<sub>1</sub>}}, and we have the estimate:\n:<math> x_1 \\approx -\\frac{b}{a} .</math>\nThe second Vieta's formula then provides:\n:<math>x_2 = \\frac{c}{a x_1} \\approx -\\frac{c}{b} .</math>\nThese formulas are much easier to evaluate than the quadratic formula under the condition of one large and one small root, because the quadratic formula evaluates the small root as the difference of two very nearly equal numbers (the case of large {{math|''b''}}), which causes [[round-off error]] in a numerical evaluation. Figure&nbsp;5 shows the difference between (i)&nbsp;a direct evaluation using the quadratic formula (accurate when the roots are near each other in value) and (ii)&nbsp;an evaluation based upon the above approximation of Vieta's formulas (accurate when the roots are widely spaced). As the linear coefficient {{math|''b''}} increases, initially the quadratic formula is accurate, and the approximate formula improves in accuracy, leading to a smaller difference between the methods as {{math|''b''}} increases. However, at some point the quadratic formula begins to lose accuracy because of round off error, while the approximate method continues to improve. Consequently, the difference between the methods begins to increase as the quadratic formula becomes worse and worse.\n\nThis situation arises commonly in amplifier design, where widely separated roots are desired to ensure a stable operation (see [[step response]]).\n\n====Trigonometric solution====\nIn the days before calculators, people would use [[mathematical table]]s\u2014lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments\u2014to simplify and speed up computation. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks. Specialized tables were published for applications such as astronomy, celestial navigation and statistics. Methods of numerical approximation existed, called [[prosthaphaeresis]], that offered shortcuts around time-consuming operations such as multiplication and taking powers and roots.<ref name=Ballew2007>{{cite web|last=Ballew|first=Pat|title=Solving Quadratic Equations \u2014 By analytic and graphic methods; Including several methods you may never have seen|url=http://www.pballew.net/quadsol.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409173024/http://www.pballew.net/quadsol.pdf|archive-date=9 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Astronomers, especially, were concerned with methods that could speed up the long series of computations involved in [[celestial mechanics]] calculations.\n\nIt is within this context that we may understand the development of means of solving quadratic equations by the aid of trigonometric substitution. Consider the following alternate form of the quadratic equation,\n\n'''[1]'''&nbsp;&nbsp; <math>ax^2 + bx \\pm c = 0 ,</math>\n\nwhere the sign of the \u00b1 symbol is chosen so that {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''c''}} may both be positive.

Substituting the two values of {{math|''&theta;''<sub>n</sub>}} or {{math|''&theta;''<sub>p</sub>}} found from equations '''[4]''' or '''[5]''' into '''[2]''' gives the required roots of '''[1]'''. Complex roots occur in the solution based on equation '''[5]''' if the absolute value of {{math|sin 2''&theta;''<sub>p</sub>}} exceeds unity.

Geometric solution of eh x squared plus b x plus c = 0 using Lill's method. The geometric construction is as follows: Draw a trapezoid S Eh B C. Line S Eh of length eh is the vertical left side of the trapezoid. Line Eh B of length b is the horizontal bottom of the trapezoid. Line B C of length c is the vertical right side of the trapezoid. Line C S completes the trapezoid. From the midpoint of line C S, draw a circle passing through points C and S. Depending on the relative lengths of eh, b, and c, the circle may or may not intersect line Eh B. If it does, then the equation has a solution. If we call the intersection points X 1 and X 2, then the two solutions are given by negative Eh X 1 divided by S Eh, and negative Eh X 2 divided by S Eh.]]\n\nThe quadratic equation may be solved geometrically in a number of ways. One way is via [[Lill's method]]. The three coefficients {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}} are drawn with right angles between them as in SA, AB, and BC in Figure&nbsp;6. A circle is drawn with the start and end point SC as a diameter. If this cuts the middle line AB of the three then the equation has a solution, and the solutions are given by negative of the distance along this line from A divided by the first coefficient {{math|''a''}} or SA. If {{math|''a''}} is {{math|1}} the coefficients may be read off directly. Thus the solutions in the diagram are &minus;AX1/SA and &minus;AX2/SA.<ref>{{Citation |title=Graphical Method for finding readily the Real Roots of Numerical Equations of Any Degree |first=William Herbert |last=Bixby |year=1879 |publisher=West Point N.

Even if a field does not contain a square root of some number, there is always a quadratic [[extension field]] which does, so the quadratic formula will always make sense as a formula in that extension field.\n\n====Characteristic 2====\nIn a field of characteristic {{math|2}}, the quadratic formula, which relies on {{math|2}} being a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], does not hold.

If {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}}, then the solution reduces to extracting a square root, so the solution is\n:<math>x = \\sqrt{c}</math>\nand there is only one root since\n:<math>-\\sqrt{c} = -\\sqrt{c} + 2\\sqrt{c} = \\sqrt{c}.</math>\nIn summary,\n:<math>\\displaystyle x^{2} + c = (x + \\sqrt{c})^{2}.</math>\nSee [[quadratic residue]] for more information about extracting square roots in finite fields.\n\nIn the case that {{math|''b'' &ne; 0}}, there are two distinct roots, but if the polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]], they cannot be expressed in terms of square roots of numbers in the coefficient field. Instead, define the '''2-root''' {{math|''R''(''c'')}} of {{math|''c''}} to be a root of the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''x'' + ''c''}}, an element of the [[splitting field]] of that polynomial. One verifies that {{math|''R''(''c'') + 1}} is also a root. In terms of the 2-root operation, the two roots of the (non-monic) quadratic {{math|''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c''}} are\n:<math>\\frac{b}{a}R\\left(\\frac{ac}{b^2}\\right)</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac{b}{a}\\left(R\\left(\\frac{ac}{b^2}\\right)+1\\right).</math>\n\nFor example, let {{math|''a''}} denote a multiplicative generator of the group of units of {{math|''F''<sub>4</sub>}}, the [[Galois field]] of order four (thus {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''a'' + 1}} are roots of {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''x'' + 1}} over {{math|''F''<sub>4</sub>}}. Because {{math|(''a'' + 1)<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''a''}}, {{math|''a'' + 1}} is the unique solution of the quadratic equation {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''a'' {{=}} 0}}. On the other hand, the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''ax'' + 1}} is irreducible over {{math|''F''<sub>4</sub>}}, but it splits over {{math|''F''<sub>16</sub>}}, where it has the two roots {{math|''ab''}} and {{math|''ab'' + ''a''}}, where {{math|''b''}} is a root of {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''x'' + ''a''}} in {{math|''F''<sub>16</sub>}}.\n\nThis is a special case of [[Artin\u2013Schreier theory]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Solving quadratic equations with continued fractions]]\n* [[Linear equation]]\n* [[Cubic function]]\n* [[Quartic equation]]\n* [[Quintic equation]]\n* [[Fundamental theorem of algebra]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{springer|title=Quadratic equation|id=p/q076050}}\n* {{MathWorld|title=Quadratic equations|urlname=QuadraticEquation}}\n* [http://plus.maths.org/issue29/features/quadratic/index-gifd.html 101 uses of a quadratic equation]\n* [http://plus.maths.org/issue30/features/quadratic/index-gifd.html 101 uses of a quadratic equation: Part II]\n{{Polynomials}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quadratic Equation}}\n[[Category:Elementary algebra]]\n[[Category:Equations]]\n", "name_user": "Cockblock4567", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation"}

In this context, quantum vortices are zeros on the wave function, around which this velocity field has a [[Solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]] shape, similar to that of irrotational vortex on potential flows of traditional fluid dynamics\n\n==Vortex-quantisation in a superfluid==\n\nIn a superfluid, a quantum vortex is a hole with the superfluid circulating around the vortex axis; the inside of the vortex may contain excited particles, air, vacuum, etc.  The thickness of the vortex depends on a variety of factors; in liquid [[helium]], the thickness is of the order of a few [[Angstroms]].\n\nA [[superfluid]] has the special property of having phase, given by the [[wavefunction]], and the velocity of the superfluid is proportional to the [[gradient]] of the phase (in the parabolic mass approximation). The [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] around any closed loop in the superfluid is zero if the region enclosed is [[simply connected]].  The superfluid is deemed [[irrotational]]; however, if the enclosed region actually contains a smaller region with an absence of superfluid, for example a rod through the superfluid or a vortex, then the circulation is:\n\n:<math>\\oint_{C} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\,d\\mathbf{l} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\oint_{C}\\nabla\\phi_v\\cdot\\,d\\mathbf{l} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\Delta^{tot}\\phi_v,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hbar</math> is [[Planck's constant]] divided by <math>2\\pi</math>, m is the mass of the superfluid particle, and <math>\\Delta^{tot}\\phi_v</math> is the total phase difference around the vortex.  Because the wave-function must return to its same value after an integer number of turns around the vortex (similar to what is described in the [[Bohr model]]), then <math>\\Delta^{tot}\\phi_v= 2\\pi n</math>, where n is an [[integer]].  Thus, the circulation is quantized:\n\n:<math>\\oint_{C} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\,d\\mathbf{l} \\equiv \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{m}n</math>.\n\n==London's flux quantization in a superconductor==\nA principal property of [[superconductors]] is that they expel [[magnetic fields]]; this is called the [[Meissner effect]].  If the magnetic field becomes sufficiently strong it will, in some cases, \u201cquench\u201d the superconductive state by inducing a phase transition.  In other cases, however, it will be energetically favorable for the superconductor to form a lattice of quantum vortices, which carry quantized magnetic flux through the superconductor.  A superconductor that is capable of supporting vortex lattices is called a [[type-II superconductor]], vortex-quantization in superconductors is general.\n\nOver some enclosed area S, the [[magnetic flux]] is\n\n:<math>\\Phi = \\iint_S\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}\\,d^2x = \\oint_{\\partial S}\\mathbf{A}\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}, </math> where <math>\\mathbf A</math> is the vector potential of the magnetic induction <math>\\mathbf B.</math>\n\nSubstituting a result of [[London equations|London's equation]]: <math>\\mathbf{j}_s = -\\frac{n_se_s^2}{m}\\mathbf{A} + \\frac{n_se_s\\hbar}{m}\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\phi</math>, we find (with <math>\\mathbf B=\\mathrm{curl}\\,\\, \\mathbf A</math>):\n\n:<math>\\Phi =-\\frac{m}{n_s e_s^2}\\oint_{\\partial S}\\mathbf{j}_s\\cdot d\\mathbf{l} +\\frac{\\hbar}{e_s}\\oint_{\\partial S}\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\phi\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}</math>,\n\nwhere ''n<sub>s</sub>'', ''m'', and ''e<sub>s</sub>'' are, respectively, number density, mass, and charge of the [[Cooper pairs]].\n\nIf the region, S, is large enough so that <math>\\mathbf{j}_s = 0</math> along <math>\\partial S</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\Phi = \\frac{\\hbar}{e_s}\\oint_{\\partial S}\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\phi\\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\frac{\\hbar}{e_s}\\Delta^{tot}\\phi = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e_s}n. </math>\n\nThe flow of current can cause vortices in a superconductor to move, causing the electric field due to the [[Electromagnetic induction|phenomenon of electromagnetic induction]]. This leads to energy dissipation and causes the material to display a small amount of [[electrical resistance]] while in the superconducting state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news8980.html |title=First vortex 'chains' observed in engineered superconductor |publisher=Physorg.com |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==Constrained vortices in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets==\nThe vortex states in ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic material are also important, mainly for information technology<ref name=Info>[http://phys.org/news/2015-03-magnetic-vortices-nanodisks-reveal.html ''Magnetic vortices in nanodisks reveal information'']. Phys.org (March 3, 2015).</ref> They are exceptional, since in contrast to superfluids or superconducting material one has a more subtle mathematics: instead of the usual equation of the type <math>\\operatorname{curl} \\ \\vec v (x,y,z,t)\\propto\\vec \\Omega (\\mathrm r,t)\\cdot\\delta (x,y),</math> where <math>\\vec \\Omega (\\mathrm r,t)</math> is the vorticity at the spatial and temporal coordinates, and where <math>\\delta (x,y)</math> is the [[Dirac function]], one has:\n\n::<math>\\operatorname{curl} \\, \\vec v (x,y,z,t)\\propto\\vec m_\\mathrm{eff} (\\mathrm r,t)\\cdot\\delta(x,y) \\ \\ (eqn. *),</math>\nwhere now at any point and at any time there is the [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]  <math>m_x^2(\\mathrm r, t)+m_y^2(\\mathrm r,t)+m_z^2(\\mathrm r,t)\\equiv M_0^2</math>. Here <math>M_0</math> is constant, the ''constant magnitude'' of the non-constant magnetization vector <math>\\vec m(x,y,z,t)</math>. As a consequence the vector <math>\\vec m</math> in eqn. (*) has been modified to a more complex entity <math>\\vec m_\\mathrm{eff}</math>. This leads, among other points, to the following fact:\n\nIn ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic material a vortex can be moved to generate bits for information storage and recognition, corresponding, e.g., to changes of the quantum number ''n''.<ref name=Info /> But although the magnetization has the usual azimuthal direction, and although one has vorticity quantization as in superfluids, as long as the circular integration lines surround the central axis at far enough perpendicular distance, this apparent vortex magnetization will change with the distance from an azimuthal direction to an upward or downward one, as soon as the vortex center is approached.\n\nThus, for each directional element <math>\\mathrm d\\varphi \\,\\mathrm d\\vartheta</math> there are now not two, but four bits to be stored by a change of vorticity: The first two bits concern the sense of rotation, clockwise or counterclockwise; the remaining bits three and four concern the polarization of the central singular line, which may be polarized up- or downwards. The change of rotation and/or polarization involves subtle [[topology]].<ref>Pylipovskyi, O.V. ''et al.'' (January 2015) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.06548 \"Polarity Switching in Magnets with Surface Anisotropy]. arxiv.org</ref>\n\n==Statistical mechanics of vortex lines==\n\nAs first discussed by Onsager and Feynman, if the temperature in a [[superfluid]] or a [[superconductor]] is raised, the vortex loops undergo a [[second-order phase transition]]. This happens when the configurational [[entropy]] overcomes the\n[[Boltzmann factor]] which suppresses the thermal or heat generation of vortex lines.\nThe lines form a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|condensate]]. Since the center of the lines, the [[vortex cores]], are normal liquid or normal conductors, respectively, the condensation transforms the [[superfluid]] or [[superconductor]] into the normal state. The ensembles of vortex lines and their phase transitions can be described efficiently by a [[gauge theory]].\n\n==Statistical mechanics of point vortices==\nIn 1949 Onsager analysed a toy model consisting of a neutral system of point vortices confined to a finite area<ref name = Ons1949/>. He was able to show that, due to the properties of [[Two-dimensional point vortex gas|two-dimensional point vortices]] the bounded area (and consequently, bounded phase space), allows the system to exhibit [[Negative_temperature|negative temperatures]]. Onsager provided the first prediction that some isolated systems can exhibit negative Boltzmann temperature. Onsager's prediction was confirmed experimentally for a system of quantum vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate in 2019<ref name=Gau19>{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=G. |authorlink= |last2=Reeves |first2=M.

In this context, quantum vortices are zeros on the wave function, around which this velocity field has a [[Solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]] shape, similar to that of irrotational vortex on potential flows of traditional fluid dynamics\n\n==Vortex-quantisation in a superfluid==\n\nIn a superfluid, a quantum vortex is a hole with the superfluid circulating around the vortex axis; the inside of the vortex may contain excited particles, air, vacuum, etc.  The thickness of the vortex depends on a variety of factors; in liquid [[helium]], the thickness is of the order of a few [[Angstroms]].\n\nA [[superfluid]] has the special property of having phase, given by the [[wavefunction]], and the velocity of the superfluid is proportional to the [[gradient]] of the phase (in the parabolic mass approximation). The [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] around any closed loop in the superfluid is zero if the region enclosed is [[simply connected]].  The superfluid is deemed [[irrotational]]; however, if the enclosed region actually contains a smaller region with an absence of superfluid, for example a rod through the superfluid or a vortex, then the circulation is:\n\n:<math>\\oint_{C} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\,d\\mathbf{l} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\oint_{C}\\nabla\\phi_v\\cdot\\,d\\mathbf{l} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\Delta^{tot}\\phi_v,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hbar</math> is [[Planck's constant]] divided by <math>2\\pi</math>, m is the mass of the superfluid particle, and <math>\\Delta^{tot}\\phi_v</math> is the total phase difference around the vortex.  Because the wave-function must return to its same value after an integer number of turns around the vortex (similar to what is described in the [[Bohr model]]), then <math>\\Delta^{tot}\\phi_v= 2\\pi n</math>, where n is an [[integer]].  Thus, the circulation is quantized:\n\n:<math>\\oint_{C} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\,d\\mathbf{l} \\equiv \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{m}n</math>.\n\n==London's flux quantization in a superconductor==\nA principal property of [[superconductors]] is that they expel [[magnetic fields]]; this is called the [[Meissner effect]].  If the magnetic field becomes sufficiently strong it will, in some cases, \u201cquench\u201d the superconductive state by inducing a phase transition.  In other cases, however, it will be energetically favorable for the superconductor to form a lattice of quantum vortices, which carry quantized magnetic flux through the superconductor.  A superconductor that is capable of supporting vortex lattices is called a [[type-II superconductor]], vortex-quantization in superconductors is general.\n\nOver some enclosed area S, the [[magnetic flux]] is\n\n:<math>\\Phi = \\iint_S\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}\\,d^2x = \\oint_{\\partial S}\\mathbf{A}\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}, </math> where <math>\\mathbf A</math> is the vector potential of the magnetic induction <math>\\mathbf B.</math>\n\nSubstituting a result of [[London equations|London's equation]]: <math>\\mathbf{j}_s = -\\frac{n_se_s^2}{m}\\mathbf{A} + \\frac{n_se_s\\hbar}{m}\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\phi</math>, we find (with <math>\\mathbf B=\\mathrm{curl}\\,\\, \\mathbf A</math>):\n\n:<math>\\Phi =-\\frac{m}{n_s e^2}\\oint_{\\partial S}\\mathbf{j}_s\\cdot d\\mathbf{l} +\\frac{\\hbar}{e_s}\\oint_{\\partial S}\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\phi\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}</math>,\n\nwhere ''n<sub>s</sub>'', ''m'', and ''e<sub>s</sub>'' are, respectively, number density, mass, and charge of the [[Cooper pairs]].\n\nIf the region, S, is large enough so that <math>\\mathbf{j}_s = 0</math> along <math>\\partial S</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\Phi = \\frac{\\hbar}{e_s}\\oint_{\\partial S}\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\phi\\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\frac{\\hbar}{e_s}\\Delta^{tot}\\phi = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e_s}n. </math>\n\nThe flow of current can cause vortices in a superconductor to move, causing the electric field due to the [[Electromagnetic induction|phenomenon of electromagnetic induction]]. This leads to energy dissipation and causes the material to display a small amount of [[electrical resistance]] while in the superconducting state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news8980.html |title=First vortex 'chains' observed in engineered superconductor |publisher=Physorg.com |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==Constrained vortices in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets==\nThe vortex states in ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic material are also important, mainly for information technology<ref name=Info>[http://phys.org/news/2015-03-magnetic-vortices-nanodisks-reveal.html ''Magnetic vortices in nanodisks reveal information''].

Here <math>M_0</math> is constant, the ''constant magnitude'' of the non-constant magnetization vector <math>\\vec m(x,y,z,t)</math>. As a consequence the vector <math>\\vec m</math> in eqn. (*) has been modified to a more complex entity <math>\\vec m_\\mathrm{eff}</math>. This leads, among other points, to the following fact:\n\nIn ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic material a vortex can be moved to generate bits for information storage and recognition, corresponding, e.g., to changes of the quantum number ''n''.<ref name=Info /> But although the magnetization has the usual azimuthal direction, and although one has vorticity quantization as in superfluids, as long as the circular integration lines surround the central axis at far enough perpendicular distance, this apparent vortex magnetization will change with the distance from an azimuthal direction to an upward or downward one, as soon as the vortex center is approached.\n\nThus, for each directional element <math>\\mathrm d\\varphi \\,\\mathrm d\\vartheta</math> there are now not two, but four bits to be stored by a change of vorticity: The first two bits concern the sense of rotation, clockwise or counterclockwise; the remaining bits three and four concern the polarization of the central singular line, which may be polarized up- or downwards. The change of rotation and/or polarization involves subtle [[topology]].<ref>Pylipovskyi, O.V. ''et al.'' (January 2015) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.06548 \"Polarity Switching in Magnets with Surface Anisotropy]. arxiv.org</ref>\n\n==Statistical mechanics of vortex lines==\n\nAs first discussed by Onsager and Feynman, if the temperature in a [[superfluid]] or a [[superconductor]] is raised, the vortex loops undergo a [[second-order phase transition]]. This happens when the configurational [[entropy]] overcomes the\n[[Boltzmann factor]] which suppresses the thermal or heat generation of vortex lines.\nThe lines form a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|condensate]]. Since the center of the lines, the [[vortex cores]], are normal liquid or normal conductors, respectively, the condensation transforms the [[superfluid]] or [[superconductor]] into the normal state. The ensembles of vortex lines and their phase transitions can be described efficiently by a [[gauge theory]].\n\n==Statistical mechanics of point vortices==\nIn 1949 Onsager analysed a toy model consisting of a neutral system of point vortices confined to a finite area<ref name = Ons1949/>. He was able to show that, due to the properties of [[Two-dimensional point vortex gas|two-dimensional point vortices]] the bounded area (and consequently, bounded phase space), allows the system to exhibit [[Negative_temperature|negative temperatures]]. Onsager provided the first prediction that some isolated systems can exhibit negative Boltzmann temperature. Onsager's prediction was confirmed experimentally for a system of quantum vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate in 2019<ref name=Gau19>{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=G. |authorlink= |last2=Reeves |first2=M.

In respect of content, there is scarcely any difference between the two groups of texts. Babylonian mathematics remained constant, in character and content, for nearly two millennia.<ref name=\"Aaboe, Asger\" />\n\nIn contrast to the scarcity of sources in [[Egyptian mathematics]], knowledge of [[Babylonia]]n mathematics is derived from some 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s. Written in [[Cuneiform script]], tablets were inscribed while the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. The majority of recovered clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600&nbsp;BC, and cover topics that include [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], [[algebra]], [[quadratic equation|quadratic]] and [[cubic equation]]s and the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The Babylonian tablet [[YBC 7289]] gives an approximation to <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> accurate to three significant sexagesimal digits (about six significant decimal digits).\n\n==Origins of Babylonian mathematics==\nBabylonian mathematics is a range of numeric and more advanced mathematical practices in the [[ancient Near East]], written in [[cuneiform script]]. Study has historically focused on the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian period]] in the early second millennium BC due to the wealth of data available. There has been debate over the earliest appearance of Babylonian mathematics, with historians suggesting a range of dates between the 5th and 3rd millennia BC.<ref>{{cite book |title= An Aramaic Wisdom Text From Qumran: A New Interpretation Of The Levi Document |volume= 86 |series= Supplements to the Journal for the Study of Judaism |author= Henryk Drawnel |edition= illustrated |publisher= BRILL |year= 2004 |isbn= 9789004137530}}</ref> Babylonian mathematics was primarily written on clay tablets in cuneiform script in the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] or [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] languages.\n\n\"Babylonian mathematics\" is perhaps an unhelpful term since the earliest suggested origins date to the use of accounting devices, such as [[Bulla (seal)|bullae]] and [[History of writing ancient numbers#Clay tokens|tokens]], in the 5th millennium BC.<ref>{{cite book |title= Ancient Mesopotamia: New Perspectives |series= Understanding ancient civilizations |author= Jane McIntosh |edition= illustrated |publisher= ABC-CLIO |year= 2005 |isbn= 9781576079652 |page= 265}}</ref>\n\n==Babylonian numerals==\n{{Main|Babylonian numerals}}\n\nThe Babylonian system of mathematics was a [[sexagesimal]] (base 60) [[numeral system]]. From this we derive the modern-day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 degrees in a circle.<ref>Michael A. Lombardi, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-time-division-days-hours-minutes/ \"Why is a minute divided into 60 seconds, an hour into 60 minutes, yet there are only 24 hours in a day?\"], \"Scientific American\" March 5, 2007</ref> The Babylonians were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons. Firstly, the number 60 is a [[superior highly composite number|superior]] [[highly composite number]], having factors of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 (including those that are themselves composite), facilitating calculations with [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]. Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true [[positional notation|place-value]] system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values (much as, in our base ten system, 734 = 7\u00d7100 + 3\u00d710 + 4\u00d71).<ref>{{cite book |title= The Historical Roots of Elementary Mathematics |author= Lucas N. H. Bunt, Phillip S. Jones, Jack D. Bedient |edition= reprint |publisher= Courier Corporation |year= 2001 |isbn= 9780486139685 |page= 44}}</ref>\n\n==Sumerian mathematics==\nThe ancient [[Sumer]]ians of [[Mesopotamia]] developed a complex system of [[metrology]] from 3000 BC. From 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.<ref>Duncan J. Melville (2003). [http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/3Mill/chronology.html Third Millennium Chronology], ''Third Millennium Mathematics''. [[St. Lawrence University]].</ref>\n\n==Old Babylonian mathematics (2000\u20131600 BC)==\nMost clay tablets that describe Babylonian mathematics belong to the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian]], which is why the mathematics of Mesopotamia is commonly known as Babylonian mathematics. Some clay tablets contain mathematical lists and tables, others contain problems and worked solutions.\n\n===Arithmetic===\nThe Babylonians used pre-calculated tables to assist with [[arithmetic]]. For example, two tablets found at Senkerah on the [[Euphrates]] in 1854, dating from 2000 BC, give lists of the [[square number|squares]] of numbers up to 59 and the [[cube (arithmetic)|cubes]] of numbers up to 32. The Babylonians used the lists of squares together with the formulae:\n\n:<math>ab = \\frac{(a + b)^2 - a^2 - b^2}{2}</math>\n\n:<math>ab = \\frac{(a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2}{4}</math>\n\nto simplify multiplication.\n\nThe Babylonians did not have an algorithm for [[long division]].<ref>{{Cite article|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Babylonian_mathematics.html|title=An Overview of Babylonian mathematics}}</ref> Instead they based their method on the fact that:\n\n:<math>\\frac{a}{b} = a \\times \\frac{1}{b}</math>\n\ntogether with a table of [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]]. Numbers whose only [[prime factor]]s are 2, 3 or 5 (known as 5-[[smooth numbers|smooth]] or [[regular numbers]]) have finite [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]s in sexagesimal notation, and tables with extensive lists of these reciprocals have been found.\n\nReciprocals such as 1/7, 1/11, 1/13, etc. do not have finite representations in sexagesimal notation. To compute 1/13 or to divide a number by 13 the Babylonians would use an approximation such as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{7}{91} = 7 \\times \\frac {1}{91} \\approx 7 \\times \\frac{1}{90}=7 \\times \\frac{40}{3600} = \\frac{280}{3600} = \\frac{4}{60} + \\frac{40}{3600}.</math>\n\n===Algebra===\n{{See also|Square root of 2#History}}\nThe [[Babylonia]]n clay tablet [[Yale Babylonian Collection|YBC]] 7289 (c. 1800\u20131600 BC) gives an approximation of {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}} in four [[sexagesimal]] figures, 1;24,51,10,<ref name=sexagesimal/> which is accurate to about six [[decimal]] digits,<ref>Fowler and Robson, p. 368.<br />[http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html Photograph, illustration, and description of the ''root(2)'' tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection]<br />[http://www.math.ubc.ca/%7Ecass/Euclid/ybc/ybc.html High resolution photographs, descriptions, and analysis of the ''root(2)'' tablet (YBC 7289) from the Yale Babylonian Collection]</ref> and is the closest possible three-place sexagesimal representation of {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}}:\n:<math>1 + \\frac{24}{60} + \\frac{51}{60^2} + \\frac{10}{60^3} = \\frac{30547}{21600} = 1.41421\\overline{296}.</math>\nAs well as arithmetical calculations, Babylonian mathematicians also developed [[elementary algebra|algebraic]] methods of solving [[equation]]s. Once again, these were based on pre-calculated tables.\n\nTo solve a [[quadratic equation]], the Babylonians essentially used the standard [[quadratic formula]]. They considered quadratic equations of the form:\n\n:<math>\\ x^2 + bx = c</math>\n\nwhere ''b'' and ''c'' were not necessarily integers, but ''c'' was always positive. They knew that a solution to this form of equation is:{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n:<math>x = - \\frac{b}{2} + \\sqrt{ \\left ( \\frac{b}{2} \\right )^2 + c}</math>\n\nand they found square roots efficiently using division and averaging.<ref name=Allen>{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Arnold |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |date=January 1999 |title=Reviews: Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers. By Jan Gullberg |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201385 |jstor=2589607 |doi=10.2307/2589607}}</ref> They always used the positive root because this made sense when solving \"real\" problems. Problems of this type included finding the dimensions of a rectangle given its area and the amount by which the length exceeds the width.\n\nTables of values of ''n''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''<sup>2</sup> were used to solve certain [[cubic equation]]s. For example, consider the equation:\n\n:<math>\\ ax^3 + bx^2 = c.</math>\n\n<nowiki>Multiplying the equation by</nowiki> ''a''<sup>2</sup> and dividing by ''b''<sup>3</sup> gives:\n\n:<math>\\left ( \\frac{ax}{b} \\right )^3 + \\left ( \\frac {ax}{b} \\right )^2 = \\frac {ca^2}{b^3}.</math>\n\nSubstituting ''y'' = ''ax''/''b'' gives:\n\n:<math>y^3 + y^2 = \\frac {ca^2}{b^3}</math>\n\nwhich could now be solved by looking up the ''n''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''<sup>2</sup> table to find the value closest to the right hand side. The Babylonians accomplished this without algebraic notation, showing a remarkable depth of understanding. However, they did not have a method for solving the general cubic equation.\n\n===Growth===\nBabylonians modeled exponential growth, constrained growth (via a form of [[sigmoid function]]s), and [[doubling time]], the latter in the context of interest on loans.\n\nClay tablets from c. 2000 BCE include the exercise \"Given an interest rate of 1/60 per month (no compounding), compute the doubling time.\" This yields an annual interest rate of 12/60 = 20%, and hence a doubling time of 100% growth/20% growth per year = 5 years.<ref name=\"hudson\">[http://michael-hudson.com/2007/08/why-the-%E2%80%9Cmiracle-of-compound-interest%E2%80%9D-leads-to-financial-crises/ Why the \"Miracle of Compound Interest\" leads to Financial Crises], by Michael Hudson</ref><ref>[http://plus.maths.org/issue11/features/compound/ Have we caught your interest?] by John H. Webb</ref>\n\n===Plimpton 322===\n{{main|Plimpton 322}}\n\nThe [[Plimpton 322]] tablet contains a list of \"[[Pythagorean triples]]\", i.e., integers <math>(a,b,c)</math> such that <math>a^2+b^2=c^2</math>.\nThe triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by brute force.\n\nMuch has been written on the subject, including some speculation (perhaps anachronistic) as to whether the tablet could have served as an early trigonometrical table. Care must be exercised to see the tablet in terms of methods familiar or accessible to scribes at the time.\n<blockquote>\n[...] the question \"how was the tablet calculated?\" does not have to have the\nsame answer as the question \"what problems does the tablet set?\" The first can be answered\nmost satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs, as first suggested half a century ago, and the second\nby some sort of right-triangle problems.\n</blockquote>\n(E. Robson, \"Neither Sherlock Holmes nor Babylon: a reassessment of Plimpton 322\", ''Historia Math.'' '''28''' (3), p.&nbsp;202).\n\n===Geometry===\nBabylonians knew the common rules for measuring volumes and areas. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if ''[[Pi|{{pi}}]]'' is estimated as 3. They were aware that this was an approximation, and one Old Babylonian mathematical tablet excavated near [[Susa]] in 1936 (dated to between the 19th and 17th centuries BCE) gives a better approximation of {{pi}} as 25/8 = 3.125, about 0.5 percent below the exact value.<ref>David Gilman Romano, ''Athletics and Mathematics in Archaic Corinth: The Origins of the Greek Stadion'', American Philosophical Society, 1993, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=q0gyy5JOZzIC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78  p. 78].\n\"A group of mathematical clay tablets from the Old Babylonian Period, excavated at Susa in 1936, and published by E.M. Bruins in 1950, provide the information that the Babylonian approximation of {{pi}} was 3\u215b or 3.125.\"\nE. M.

The tablets date from between 350 and 50 B.C.E., revealing that the Babylonians understood and used geometry even earlier than previously thought. The Babylonians used a method for estimating the area under a curve by drawing a [[trapezoid]] underneath, a technique previously believed to have originated in 14th century Europe. This method of estimation allowed them to, for example, find the distance [[Jupiter]] had traveled in a certain amount of time.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Babylonians Were Using Geometry Centuries Earlier Than Thought|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ancient-babylonians-were-using-geometry-centuries-earlier-thought-180957965/|website = Smithsonian|access-date = 2016-02-01|first = Jesse|last = Emspak}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\n\nSince the rediscovery of the Babylonian civilization, it has become apparent that [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic mathematics|Hellenistic mathematicians]] and [[Hellenistic astronomy|astronomers]], and in particular [[Hipparchus]], borrowed greatly from the [[Babylonia]]ns.\n\n[[Franz Xaver Kugler]] demonstrated in his book ''Die Babylonische Mondrechnung'' (\"''The Babylonian lunar computation''\", Freiburg im Breisgau, 1900) the following: Ptolemy had stated in his ''Almagest'' IV.2 that Hipparchus improved the values for the Moon's periods known to him from \"even more ancient astronomers\" by comparing eclipse observations made earlier by \"the Chaldeans\", and by himself. However, Kugler found that the periods that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus had already been used in Babylonian [[ephemerides]], specifically the collection of texts nowadays called \"System B\" (sometimes attributed to [[Kidinnu]]). Apparently, Hipparchus only confirmed the validity of the periods he learned from the Chaldeans by his newer observations.\n\nIt is clear that Hipparchus (and Ptolemy after him) had an essentially complete list of eclipse observations covering many centuries. Most likely these had been compiled from the \"diary\" tablets: these are clay tablets recording all relevant observations that the Chaldeans routinely made. Preserved examples date from 652 BC to AD 130, but probably the records went back as far as the reign of the Babylonian king [[Nabonassar]]: Ptolemy starts his chronology with the first day in the Egyptian calendar of the first year of Nabonassar, i.e., 26 February 747 BC.\n\nThis raw material by itself must have been hard to use, and no doubt the Chaldeans themselves compiled extracts of e.g., all observed eclipses (some tablets with a list of all eclipses in a period of time covering a [[Saros cycle|saros]] have been found). This allowed them to recognise periodic recurrences of events. Among others they used in System B (cf. ''Almagest'' IV.2):\n\n* 223 [[synodic month]]s = 239 returns in anomaly ([[anomalistic month]]) = 242 returns in latitude ([[draconic month]]).  This is now known as the [[Saros cycle|saros]] period, which is useful for predicting [[eclipse]]s.\n* 251 (synodic) months = 269 returns in anomaly\n* 5458 (synodic) months = 5923 returns in latitude\n* 1 [[Synodic month#Synodic month|synodic month]] = 29;31,50,08,20 days<ref name=sexagesimal>The standard sexagesimal notation using semicolon\u2013commas was introduced by Otto Neugebauer in the 1930s. {{Citation | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto Neugebauer | last2 = Sachs | first2 = Abraham Joseph | author2-link = Abraham Sachs | last3 = G\u00f6tze | first3 = Albrecht | title = Mathematical Cuneiform Texts | place = New Haven | publisher = American Oriental Society and the American Schools of Oriental Research | series = American Oriental Series | volume = 29 | year = 1945 | page = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=i-juAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA2}}</ref> (sexagesimal; 29.53059413... days in decimals = 29&nbsp;days 12&nbsp;hours 44&nbsp;min 3\u2153&nbsp;s, P.S. real time is 2.9&nbsp;s, so 0.43 seconds off)\n\nThe Babylonians expressed all periods in synodic [[month]]s, probably because they used a [[lunisolar calendar]]. Various relations with yearly phenomena led to different values for the length of the year.\n\nSimilarly, various relations between the periods of the [[planet]]s were known. The relations that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus in ''Almagest'' IX.3 had all already been used in predictions found on Babylonian clay tablets.\n\nAll this knowledge was transferred to the [[Greeks]] probably shortly after the conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] (331 BC). According to the late classical philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] (early 6th century AD), Alexander ordered the translation of the historical astronomical records under supervision of his chronicler [[Callisthenes|Callisthenes of Olynthus]], who sent it to his uncle [[Aristotle]]. Although Simplicius is a very late source, his account may be reliable. He spent some time in exile at the [[Sassanid]] (Persian) court and may have accessed sources otherwise lost in the West. It is striking that he mentions the title ''t\u00e8resis'' (Greek: guard), which is an odd name for a historical work, but is an adequate translation of the Babylonian title ''MassArt'' meaning ''guarding,'' but also ''observing.''  Anyway, Aristotle's pupil [[Callippus|Callippus of Cyzicus]] introduced his 76-year cycle, which improved on the 19-year [[Metonic cycle]], about that time. He had the first year of his first cycle start at the summer solstice of 28 June 330 BC ([[Proleptic Julian calendar]] date), but later he seems to have counted lunar months from the first month after Alexander's decisive battle at [[Gaugamela]] in fall 331 BC.  So Callippus may have obtained his data from Babylonian sources and his calendar may have been anticipated by Kidinnu. Also it is known that the Babylonian priest known as [[Berossus]] wrote around 281 BC a book in Greek on the (rather mythological) history of Babylonia, the ''[[Babyloniaca]]'', for the new ruler [[Antiochus I]]; it is said that later he founded a school of [[astrology]] on the Greek island of [[Kos]]. Another candidate for teaching the Greeks about Babylonian [[astronomy]]/[[astrology]] was [[Sudines]] who was at the court of [[Attalus I|Attalus I Soter]] late in the 3rd century BC.\n\nIn any case, the translation of the astronomical records required profound knowledge of the [[cuneiform script]], the language, and the procedures, so it seems likely that it was done by some unidentified Chaldeans. Now, the Babylonians dated their observations in their lunisolar calendar, in which months and years have varying lengths (29 or 30 days; 12 or 13 months respectively). At the time they did not use a regular calendar (such as based on the [[Metonic cycle]] like they did later) but started a new month based on observations of the [[New Moon]]. This made it very tedious to compute the time interval between events.\n\nWhat Hipparchus may have done is transform these records to the [[Egyptian calendar]], which uses a fixed year of always 365 days (consisting of 12 months of 30 days and 5 extra days): this makes computing time intervals much easier. Ptolemy dated all observations in this calendar. He also writes that \"All that he (=Hipparchus) did was to make a compilation of the planetary observations arranged in a more useful way\" (''Almagest'' IX.2).  Pliny states (''Naturalis Historia'' II.IX(53)) on eclipse predictions: \"After their time (=[[Thales]]) the courses of both stars (=Sun and Moon) for 600 years were prophesied by Hipparchus, \u2026\".  This seems to imply that Hipparchus predicted eclipses for a period of 600 years, but considering the enormous amount of computation required, this is very unlikely. Rather, Hipparchus would have made a list of all eclipses from Nabonasser's time to his own.\n\n\n\nJag gillar pannkakor\n\n\n\nOther traces of Babylonian practice in Hipparchus' work are:\n* first known Greek use of the division the circle in 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] of 60 [[arc minute]]s.\n* first consistent use of the [[sexagesimal]] number system.\n* the use of the unit ''pechus'' (\"cubit\") of about 2\u00b0 or 2\u00bd\u00b0.\n* use of a short period of 248 days = 9 anomalistic months.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics|Asia}}\n* [[Babylonia]]\n* [[Babylonian astronomy]]\n* [[History of mathematics]]\n* [[Islamic mathematics]] for mathematics in [[History of Iraq|Islamic Iraq/Mesopotamia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |last=Berriman |first=A.

Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true [[positional notation|place-value]] system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values (much as, in our base ten system, 734 = 7\u00d7100 + 3\u00d710 + 4\u00d71).<ref>{{cite book |title= The Historical Roots of Elementary Mathematics |author= Lucas N.

The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.<ref>Duncan J. Melville (2003).

Some clay tablets contain mathematical lists and tables, others contain problems and worked solutions.\n\n===Arithmetic===\nThe Babylonians used pre-calculated tables to assist with [[arithmetic]]. For example, two tablets found at Senkerah on the [[Euphrates]] in 1854, dating from 2000 BC, give lists of the [[square number|squares]] of numbers up to 59 and the [[cube (arithmetic)|cubes]] of numbers up to 32.

Once again, these were based on pre-calculated tables.\n\nTo solve a [[quadratic equation]], the Babylonians essentially used the standard [[quadratic formula]]. They considered quadratic equations of the form:\n\n:<math>\\ x^2 + bx = c</math>\n\nwhere ''b'' and ''c'' were not necessarily integers, but ''c'' was always positive.

Problems of this type included finding the dimensions of a rectangle given its area and the amount by which the length exceeds the width.\n\nTables of values of ''n''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''<sup>2</sup> were used to solve certain [[cubic equation]]s.

The Babylonians accomplished this without algebraic notation, showing a remarkable depth of understanding. However, they did not have a method for solving the general cubic equation.\n\n===Growth===\nBabylonians modeled exponential growth, constrained growth (via a form of [[sigmoid function]]s), and [[doubling time]], the latter in the context of interest on loans.\n\nClay tablets from c. 2000 BCE include the exercise \"Given an interest rate of 1/60 per month (no compounding), compute the doubling time.\" This yields an annual interest rate of 12/60 = 20%, and hence a doubling time of 100% growth/20% growth per year = 5 years.<ref name=\"hudson\">[http://michael-hudson.com/2007/08/why-the-%E2%80%9Cmiracle-of-compound-interest%E2%80%9D-leads-to-financial-crises/ Why the \"Miracle of Compound Interest\" leads to Financial Crises], by Michael Hudson</ref><ref>[http://plus.maths.org/issue11/features/compound/ Have we caught your interest?] by John H.

Care must be exercised to see the tablet in terms of methods familiar or accessible to scribes at the time.\n<blockquote>\n[...] the question \"how was the tablet calculated?\" does not have to have the\nsame answer as the question \"what problems does the tablet set?\" The first can be answered\nmost satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs, as first suggested half a century ago, and the second\nby some sort of right-triangle problems.\n</blockquote>\n(E.

They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if ''[[Pi|{{pi}}]]'' is estimated as 3. They were aware that this was an approximation, and one Old Babylonian mathematical tablet excavated near [[Susa]] in 1936 (dated to between the 19th and 17th centuries BCE) gives a better approximation of {{pi}} as 25/8 = 3.125, about 0.5 percent below the exact value.<ref>David Gilman Romano, ''Athletics and Mathematics in Archaic Corinth: The Origins of the Greek Stadion'', American Philosophical Society, 1993, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=q0gyy5JOZzIC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78  p. 78].\n\"A group of mathematical clay tablets from the Old Babylonian Period, excavated at Susa in 1936, and published by E.M.

The tablets date from between 350 and 50 B.C.E., revealing that the Babylonians understood and used geometry even earlier than previously thought. The Babylonians used a method for estimating the area under a curve by drawing a [[trapezoid]] underneath, a technique previously believed to have originated in 14th century Europe. This method of estimation allowed them to, for example, find the distance [[Jupiter]] had traveled in a certain amount of time.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Babylonians Were Using Geometry Centuries Earlier Than Thought|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ancient-babylonians-were-using-geometry-centuries-earlier-thought-180957965/|website = Smithsonian|access-date = 2016-02-01|first = Jesse|last = Emspak}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\n\nSince the rediscovery of the Babylonian civilization, it has become apparent that [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic mathematics|Hellenistic mathematicians]] and [[Hellenistic astronomy|astronomers]], and in particular [[Hipparchus]], borrowed greatly from the [[Babylonia]]ns.\n\n[[Franz Xaver Kugler]] demonstrated in his book ''Die Babylonische Mondrechnung'' (\"''The Babylonian lunar computation''\", Freiburg im Breisgau, 1900) the following: Ptolemy had stated in his ''Almagest'' IV.2 that Hipparchus improved the values for the Moon's periods known to him from \"even more ancient astronomers\" by comparing eclipse observations made earlier by \"the Chaldeans\", and by himself. However, Kugler found that the periods that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus had already been used in Babylonian [[ephemerides]], specifically the collection of texts nowadays called \"System B\" (sometimes attributed to [[Kidinnu]]). Apparently, Hipparchus only confirmed the validity of the periods he learned from the Chaldeans by his newer observations.\n\nIt is clear that Hipparchus (and Ptolemy after him) had an essentially complete list of eclipse observations covering many centuries. Most likely these had been compiled from the \"diary\" tablets: these are clay tablets recording all relevant observations that the Chaldeans routinely made. Preserved examples date from 652 BC to AD 130, but probably the records went back as far as the reign of the Babylonian king [[Nabonassar]]: Ptolemy starts his chronology with the first day in the Egyptian calendar of the first year of Nabonassar, i.e., 26 February 747 BC.\n\nThis raw material by itself must have been hard to use, and no doubt the Chaldeans themselves compiled extracts of e.g., all observed eclipses (some tablets with a list of all eclipses in a period of time covering a [[Saros cycle|saros]] have been found). This allowed them to recognise periodic recurrences of events. Among others they used in System B (cf. ''Almagest'' IV.2):\n\n* 223 [[synodic month]]s = 239 returns in anomaly ([[anomalistic month]]) = 242 returns in latitude ([[draconic month]]).  This is now known as the [[Saros cycle|saros]] period, which is useful for predicting [[eclipse]]s.\n* 251 (synodic) months = 269 returns in anomaly\n* 5458 (synodic) months = 5923 returns in latitude\n* 1 [[Synodic month#Synodic month|synodic month]] = 29;31,50,08,20 days<ref name=sexagesimal>The standard sexagesimal notation using semicolon\u2013commas was introduced by Otto Neugebauer in the 1930s. {{Citation | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto Neugebauer | last2 = Sachs | first2 = Abraham Joseph | author2-link = Abraham Sachs | last3 = G\u00f6tze | first3 = Albrecht | title = Mathematical Cuneiform Texts | place = New Haven | publisher = American Oriental Society and the American Schools of Oriental Research | series = American Oriental Series | volume = 29 | year = 1945 | page = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=i-juAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA2}}</ref> (sexagesimal; 29.53059413... days in decimals = 29&nbsp;days 12&nbsp;hours 44&nbsp;min 3\u2153&nbsp;s, P.S. real time is 2.9&nbsp;s, so 0.43 seconds off)\n\nThe Babylonians expressed all periods in synodic [[month]]s, probably because they used a [[lunisolar calendar]]. Various relations with yearly phenomena led to different values for the length of the year.\n\nSimilarly, various relations between the periods of the [[planet]]s were known. The relations that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus in ''Almagest'' IX.3 had all already been used in predictions found on Babylonian clay tablets.\n\nAll this knowledge was transferred to the [[Greeks]] probably shortly after the conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] (331 BC). According to the late classical philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] (early 6th century AD), Alexander ordered the translation of the historical astronomical records under supervision of his chronicler [[Callisthenes|Callisthenes of Olynthus]], who sent it to his uncle [[Aristotle]]. Although Simplicius is a very late source, his account may be reliable. He spent some time in exile at the [[Sassanid]] (Persian) court and may have accessed sources otherwise lost in the West. It is striking that he mentions the title ''t\u00e8resis'' (Greek: guard), which is an odd name for a historical work, but is an adequate translation of the Babylonian title ''MassArt'' meaning ''guarding,'' but also ''observing.''  Anyway, Aristotle's pupil [[Callippus|Callippus of Cyzicus]] introduced his 76-year cycle, which improved on the 19-year [[Metonic cycle]], about that time. He had the first year of his first cycle start at the summer solstice of 28 June 330 BC ([[Proleptic Julian calendar]] date), but later he seems to have counted lunar months from the first month after Alexander's decisive battle at [[Gaugamela]] in fall 331 BC.  So Callippus may have obtained his data from Babylonian sources and his calendar may have been anticipated by Kidinnu. Also it is known that the Babylonian priest known as [[Berossus]] wrote around 281 BC a book in Greek on the (rather mythological) history of Babylonia, the ''[[Babyloniaca]]'', for the new ruler [[Antiochus I]]; it is said that later he founded a school of [[astrology]] on the Greek island of [[Kos]]. Another candidate for teaching the Greeks about Babylonian [[astronomy]]/[[astrology]] was [[Sudines]] who was at the court of [[Attalus I|Attalus I Soter]] late in the 3rd century BC.\n\nIn any case, the translation of the astronomical records required profound knowledge of the [[cuneiform script]], the language, and the procedures, so it seems likely that it was done by some unidentified Chaldeans. Now, the Babylonians dated their observations in their lunisolar calendar, in which months and years have varying lengths (29 or 30 days; 12 or 13 months respectively). At the time they did not use a regular calendar (such as based on the [[Metonic cycle]] like they did later) but started a new month based on observations of the [[New Moon]]. This made it very tedious to compute the time interval between events.\n\nWhat Hipparchus may have done is transform these records to the [[Egyptian calendar]], which uses a fixed year of always 365 days (consisting of 12 months of 30 days and 5 extra days): this makes computing time intervals much easier. Ptolemy dated all observations in this calendar. He also writes that \"All that he (=Hipparchus) did was to make a compilation of the planetary observations arranged in a more useful way\" (''Almagest'' IX.2).  Pliny states (''Naturalis Historia'' II.IX(53)) on eclipse predictions: \"After their time (=[[Thales]]) the courses of both stars (=Sun and Moon) for 600 years were prophesied by Hipparchus, \u2026\".  This seems to imply that Hipparchus predicted eclipses for a period of 600 years, but considering the enormous amount of computation required, this is very unlikely. Rather, Hipparchus would have made a list of all eclipses from Nabonasser's time to his own.\n\nOther traces of Babylonian practice in Hipparchus' work are:\n* first known Greek use of the division the circle in 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] of 60 [[arc minute]]s.\n* first consistent use of the [[sexagesimal]] number system.\n* the use of the unit ''pechus'' (\"cubit\") of about 2\u00b0 or 2\u00bd\u00b0.\n* use of a short period of 248 days = 9 anomalistic months.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics|Asia}}\n* [[Babylonia]]\n* [[Babylonian astronomy]]\n* [[History of mathematics]]\n* [[Islamic mathematics]] for mathematics in [[History of Iraq|Islamic Iraq/Mesopotamia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |last=Berriman |first=A.

While under this label, the group released a string of million-selling albums containing singles that have reached various charts worldwide, including the 1998 single \"[[Deeper Underground]]\", which topped in the UK, while having moderate success in the US within the Dance charts. All eight of the band's albums have entered the UK top 10. Three of them, ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999), ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001), along with [[High Times: Singles 1992\u20132006|their greatest hits compilation]], charted at number 1.\n\nJamiroquai have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide as of 2017. Their third album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for the album's lead single, \"[[Virtual Insanity]]\", was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The group has won an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]], as well as one [[Grammy Award]], two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, and two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]]s.

{"title_page": "Gebre Hanna", "text_new": "{{short description|Ethiopian poet}}\n[[Aleqa]] '''Gebre Hanna''' (flourished late 19th century) was a [[dabtara]] (a lay person of religious learning) of the [[Ethiopian Church]], renowned in [[Amhara people|Amharic]] oral tradition for (to quote Donald Levine) his \"quick and biting wit.\"<ref>Donald N. Levine, ''Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture'' (Chicago: University Press, 1972), p. 27.</ref> He was a master of the genre of [[Amharic language|Amharic]] poetry known as ''[[qene]]'', as well as introducing a new style of ceremonial dancing to the Ethiopian Church.\n\n== Life ==\nGebre Hanna was born in [[Fogera]], a district on the eastern shore of [[Lake Tana]], and his interest in religious learning brought him to the city of [[Gondar]] towards the end of the [[Zemene Mesafint]], where he became a teacher at the [[Ba'eta Maryam Church|Church of Ba'eta Maryam]] in the city and eventually its ''aleqa''.<ref name=\"Levine, Wax and Gold, p. 27\">Levine, ''Wax and Gold'', p. 27.</ref>\n\nWhile at Baeta Maryam, Aleqa Gebre Hanna invented a new style of religious dancing, known as ''Ya-Takla'' after his son.<ref>Solomon Getamun, ''History of the City of Gondar'' (Africa World Press, 2005), p. 141.</ref> The Ethiopian Church is unique amongst Christian traditions in its traditional incorporation of ritual dances (known as ''aquaquam'') in its ceremonies, which were performed by dabtaras.<ref>Levine, ''Wax and Gold'', p. 173.</ref> As Levine describes Aleqa Gebre Hanna's innovation:\n\n<blockquote>In the traditional style of ''aquaquam'', the bodies and sticks of the dancers move up and down, punctuating the flow of chant with alternatively gradual and abrupt movements. Alaqa Gebre Hanna, inspired by the lateral movement of the waves of Lake Tana and the bamboo reeds in the breeze at its shore, taught that bodies should sway from side to side. Although the conservative clergy in Gondar rejected this teaching, his son Takla successfully introduced to [[Debre Tabor]], where it spread to the rest of Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Levine, Wax and Gold, p. 27\"/>\n</blockquote>\nAccording to the one-time Ethiopian ambassador to the United States, [[Berhanu Denqe]], who had received his education there, ''Aleqa'' Gebre was one of the teachers at the church school of Saint Raguel on [[Mount Entoto]].<ref>Cited in Bahru Zewde, ''Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p.22 n. 4</ref> He was often a guest of the Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] and his wife Empress [[Taytu Betul|Taytu]], and his exchanges with these monarchs are the setting for many of the stories told about him.\n\n== His wit ==\nAs Simon Messing explains,\n\n<blockquote>The Amharic language lends itself readily to puns and hidden meanings,<ref>This ambiguity is the theme of Donald N. Levine's book ''Wax and Gold''. As Levine explains, \"The apparent, figurative meaning of the words is called 'wax'; their more or less hidden actual significance is the 'gold'\"(p. 5).</ref> since many verbs have double or triple interpretations due to the hidden variations in the basic verbal stem and the absence or presence of [[gemination]] of some consonants. The listener must pay close attention. If he misinterprets the context and fails to discern the pun, he is often made the butt of the next tricky joke by those who have heard it before. The more a storyteller and wit masters the ''sowaso'' 'grammar' of the Amharic language, the better he can manipulate the humor.<ref>Simon D.

When asked to which saint the ''tabot'' had been consecrated, the Aleqa told them ''Qeddus Giyorgis''\u2014[[Saint George]], the most common saint in Ethiopia. When asked which one, without missing a beat he replied, \"St. George of the linseed paste.\"\n\n: The outlaws not only believed him, but escorted him to the top of the valley, explaining that the area was full of gangs of bandits.

Mindful of the long trip ahead of him without fresh beef, he decided to wait to obtain a good share of the meat, which was being parcelled out. Having meat, he now needed drink and obtained a jugful of ''[[tej]]'', and spent the day feasting.\n\n: Late afternoon found the Aleqa still in the capital, when the Emperor Menelik happened upon him.

So he sent a messenger to tell Emperor Menelik II that the Aleqa was dead, and his family had no money to give him a proper ''tazkar'' or wake. When the Empress Taytu heard this report, she went to the Emperor and wailed and berated the man until he sent money to Gondar.<ref>Levine, ''Wax and Gold'', p. 251.</ref>\n\n: Eventually, Aleqa Gebre Hanna found need to return to Menelik's capital. There are a number of variants of how he explained the fact he had not died to his imperial patrons. One tells that, the Emperor saw him and after recovering from the shock asked sarcastically, \"How is it that the dead arise form the dead?\" The Aleqa replied, with a deep bow, \"Your majesty, it is not uncommon in our Christian religion to arise from the dead.\" Another has him explaining, \"Your majesty, I so longed to see the faces of your Majesties again that I was not at peace in the earth and had to so return.\" A third gives his explanation that \"they had so many rules and regulations up there [pointing to heaven] that I preferred to return and live under the rules of your Majesty.\"<ref>All three variants are recorded in Messing, \"Ethiopian folktales\", p. 70.</ref>\n\n* One day, his wife left Aleqa Gebre Hanna home with their baby on a lengthy errand.

Levine, ''Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture'' (Chicago: University Press, 1972), p. 27.</ref> He was a master of the genre of [[Amharic language|Amharic]] poetry known as ''[[qene]]'', as well as introducing a new style of ceremonial dancing to the Ethiopian Church.\n\n== Life ==\nGebre Hanna was born in [[Fogera]], a district on the eastern shore of [[Lake Tana]], and his interest in religious learning brought him to the city of [[Gondar]] towards the end of the [[Zemene Mesafint]], where he became a teacher at the [[Ba'eta Maryam Church|Church of Ba'eta Maryam]] in the city and eventually its ''aleqa''.<ref name=\"Levine, Wax and Gold, p. 27\">Levine, ''Wax and Gold'', p. 27.</ref>\n\nWhile at Baeta Maryam, Aleqa Gebre Hanna invented a new style of religious dancing, known as ''Ya-Takla'' after his son.<ref>Solomon Getamun, ''History of the City of Gondar'' (Africa World Press, 2005), p. 141.</ref> The Ethiopian Church is unique amongst Christian traditions in its traditional incorporation of ritual dances (known as ''aquaquam'') in its ceremonies, which were performed by dabtaras.<ref>Levine, ''Wax and Gold'', p. 173.</ref> As Levine describes Aleqa Gebre Hanna's innovation:\n: In the traditional style of ''aquaquam'', the bodies and sticks of the dancers move up and down, punctuating the flow of chant with alternatively gradual and abrupt movements. Alaqa Gebre Hanna, inspired by the lateral movement of the waves of Lake Tana and the bamboo reeds in the breeze at its shore, taught that bodies should sway from side to side. Although the conservative clergy in Gondar rejected this teaching, his son Takla successfully introduced to [[Debre Tabor]], where it spread to the rest of Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Levine, Wax and Gold, p. 27\"/>\n\nAccording to the one-time Ethiopian ambassador to the United States, [[Berhanu Denqe]], who had received his education there, ''Aleqa'' Gebre was one of the teachers at the church school of Saint Raguel on [[Mount Entoto]].<ref>Cited in Bahru Zewde, ''Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p.22 n. 4</ref> He was often a guest of the Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] and his wife Empress [[Taytu Betul|Taytu]], and his exchanges with these monarchs are the setting for many of the stories told about him.\n\n== His wit ==\nAs Simon Messing explains,\n: The Amharic language lends itself readily to puns and hidden meanings,<ref>This ambiguity is the theme of Donald N. Levine's book ''Wax and Gold''. As Levine explains, \"The apparent, figurative meaning of the words is called 'wax'; their more or less hidden actual significance is the 'gold'\"(p. 5).</ref> since many verbs have double or triple interpretations due to the hidden variations in the basic verbal stem and the absence or presence of [[gemination]] of some consonants. The listener must pay close attention. If he misinterprets the context and fails to discern the pun, he is often made the butt of the next tricky joke by those who have heard it before. The more a storyteller and wit masters the ''sowaso'' 'grammar' of the Amharic language, the better he can manipulate the humor.<ref>Simon D.

Anesthesia is not used during the middle of an \"awake\" brain surgery. Awake brain surgery is where the patient is conscious for the middle of the procedure and sedated for the beginning and end. This procedure is used when the tumor does not have clear boundaries and the surgeon wants to know if they are invading on critical regions of the brain which involve functions like talking, [[cognition]], vision, and hearing. It will also be conducted for procedures which the surgeon is trying to combat [[Epileptic seizure|epileptic]] seizures.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/ionm/types/intraoperative-brain-mapping.html |title = Awake Brain Surgery (Intraoperative Brain Mapping) &#124; Imaging Services &#124; Johns Hopkins Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring Unit (IONM)}}</ref>\n\n===History===\nTrepanning, an early form of neuroanesthesia, appears to have been practised by the [[Incas]] in South America. In these procedures [[coca]] leaves and [[Datura|datura plants]] were used to manage pain as the person had dull primitive tools cut open their skull. In 400 BC the physician [[Hippocrates]] made accounts of using different wines to [[Sedation|sedate]] patients while trepanning. In 60 AD [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]], a physician, pharmacologist, and botanist, detailed how [[mandrake]], [[Hyoscyamus niger|henbane]], [[opium]], and alcohol were used to put patients to sleep during trepanning. In 972 AD two brother surgeons in [[Paramara dynasty|Paramara]], modern-day India, used \"samohine\" to sedate a patient while removing a small tumor and awoke the patient by pouring onion and vinegar in the patients mouth. Since then, multiple cocktails have been derived in order to sedate a patient during a brain surgery. The most recent form of neuroanesthesia is the combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen. This was discovered in the 18th century by [[Humphry Davy]] and brought into the operating room by [[Astley Cooper]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chivukula |first1=Srinivas |last2=Grandhi |first2=Ramesh |last3=Friedlander |first3=Robert M. |title=A brief history of early neuroanesthesia |journal=Neurosurgical Focus |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=E2 |year=2014 |pmid=24684332 |doi=10.3171/2014.2.FOCUS13578 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==Neurosurgery methods==\n{{Infobox medical intervention\n| Name        = Neurosurgery\n| Image       =\n| Caption     =\n| ICD10       = {{ICD10PCS|00|0/0}}-{{ICD10PCS|01|0/1}}\n| ICD9        = {{ICD9proc|01}}\u2013{{ICD9proc|05}}\n| MeshID      = D019635\n| OPS301      = {{OPS301|5-01...5-05}}\n| OtherCodes  =\n| HCPCSlevel2 =\n}}\n\nNeuroradiology plays a key role not only in diagnosis but also in the operative phase of neurosurgery.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Neuroradiology]] methods are used in modern neurosurgery diagnosis and treatment.

Techniques involving smaller openings with the aid of microscopes and endoscopes are now being used as well. Methods that utilize small craniotomies in conjunction with high-clarity microscopic visualization of neural tissue offer excellent results. However, the open methods are still traditionally used in trauma or emergency situations.<ref name=\"neurosurgery.org cybermuseum microneurohall jhardy\"/><ref name=neurosurgery-surgical-power-tool/>\n\n''Microsurgery'' is utilized in many aspects of neurological surgery. Microvascular techniques are used in EC-IC bypass surgery and in restoration carotid endarterectomy. The clipping of an aneurysm is performed under microscopic vision. [[Minimally-invasive procedures|minimally-invasive]] spine surgery utilizes microscopes or endoscopes. Procedures such as microdiscectomy, laminectomy, and artificial disc replacement rely on microsurgery.<ref name=\"stealthsurgical.com department neurosurgical\"/>\n\nUsing ''stereotaxy'' neurosurgeons can approach a minute target in the brain through a minimal opening. This is used in functional neurosurgery where electrodes are implanted or gene therapy is instituted with high level of accuracy as in the case of Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. Using the combination method of open and stereotactic surgery, intraventricular hemorrhages can potentially be evacuated successfully.<ref name=technology-increases-precision-safety-during-neurosurgery/> Conventional surgery using image guidance technologies is also becoming common and is referred to as surgical navigation, computer assisted surgery, navigated surgery, stereotactic navigation. Similar to a car or mobile Global Positioning System (GPS), image guided surgery systems, like Curve Image Guided Surgery and StealthStation, use cameras or electromagnetic fields to capture and relay the patient\u2019s anatomy and the surgeon\u2019s precise movements in relation to the patient, to computer monitors in the operating room. These sophisticated computerized systems are used before and during surgery to help orient the surgeon with three-dimensional images of the patient\u2019s anatomy including the tumor.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Duan, Zhaoliang & Yuan, Zhi-Yong & Liao, Xiangyun & Si, Weixin & Zhao, Jianhui |title=3D Tracking and Positioning of Surgical Instruments in Virtual Surgery Simulation |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=502\u2013509 |date=2011 |journal=Journal of Multimedia |doi=10.4304/jmm.6.6.502-509}}</ref> Real-time functional brain mapping has been employed to identify specific functional regions using [[Electrocorticography|electrocorticography (ECoG)]]<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Swift, James & Coon, William & Guger, Christoph & Brunner, Peter & Bunch, M & Lynch, T & Frawley, T & Ritaccio, Anthony & Schalk, Gerwin |title=Passive functional mapping of receptive language areas using electrocorticographic signals |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=2517\u20132524 |date=2018 |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2018.09.007|pmid=30342252 |pmc=6414063}}</ref>\n\nMinimally invasive ''endoscopic surgery'' is commonly utilized by neurosurgeons when appropriate.

Some indications for spine surgery include spinal cord compression resulting from trauma, arthritis of the spinal discs, or spondylosis. In cervical cord compression, patients may have difficulty with gait, balance issues, and/or numbness and tingling in the hands or feet. [[Spondylosis]] is the condition of spinal disc degeneration and arthritis that may compress the spinal canal. This condition can often result in bone-spurring and disc herniation. Power drills and special instruments are often used to correct any compression problems of the spinal canal. Disc herniations of spinal vertebral discs are removed with special rongeurs.  This procedure is known as a ''discectomy''. Generally once a disc is removed it is replaced by an implant which will create a bony fusion between vertebral bodies above and below. Instead, a mobile disc could be implanted into the disc space to maintain mobility. This is commonly used in cervical disc surgery. At times instead of disc removal a Laser discectomy could be used to decompress a nerve root. This method is mainly used for lumbar discs. ''Laminectomy'' is the removal of the [[Lamina of the vertebral arch|Lamina]] portion of the vertebrae of the spine in order to make room for the compressed nerve tissue.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nRadiology assisted spine surgery uses minimally-invasive procedures. They include the techniques of ''vertebroplasty'' and ''kyphoplasty'' in which certain types of spinal fractures are managed.<ref>''Principles of Neurosurgery- Rengachary, Ellenbogen''{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}</ref>\nPotentially unstable spines will need ''spine fusions''.

Therefore, careful selection of patients for each procedure is important. It has to be noted that if there is prior permanent neural tissue damage spinal surgery may not take away the symptoms.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSurgery for chronic pain is a sub branch of functional neurosurgery.

Anesthesia is not used during the middle of an \"awake\" brain surgery. Awake brain surgery is where the patient is conscious for the middle of the procedure and sedated for the beginning and end. This procedure is used when the tumor does not have clear boundaries and the surgeon wants to know if they are invading on critical regions of the brain which involve functions like talking, [[cognition]], vision, and hearing. It will also be conducted for procedures which the surgeon is trying to combat [[Epileptic seizure|epileptic]] seizures.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/ionm/types/intraoperative-brain-mapping.html |title = Awake Brain Surgery (Intraoperative Brain Mapping) &#124; Imaging Services &#124; Johns Hopkins Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring Unit (IONM)}}</ref>\n\n===History===\nTrepanning, an early form of neuroanesthesia, appears to have been practised by the [[Incas]] in South America. In these procedures [[coca]] leaves and [[Datura|datura plants]] were used to manage pain as the person had dull primitive tools cut open their skull. In 400 BC the physician [[Hippocrates]] made accounts of using different wines to [[Sedation|sedate]] patients while trepanning. In 60 AD [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]], a physician, pharmacologist, and botanist, detailed how [[mandrake]], [[Hyoscyamus niger|henbane]], [[opium]], and alcohol were used to put patients to sleep during trepanning. In 972 AD two brother surgeons in [[Paramara dynasty|Paramara]], modern-day India, used \"samohine\" to sedate a patient while removing a small tumor and awoke the patient by pouring onion and vinegar in the patients mouth. Since then, multiple cocktails have been derived in order to sedate a patient during a brain surgery. The most recent form of neuroanesthesia is the combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen. This was discovered in the 18th century by [[Humphry Davy]] and brought into the operating room by [[Astley Cooper]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chivukula |first1=Srinivas |last2=Grandhi |first2=Ramesh |last3=Friedlander |first3=Robert M. |title=A brief history of early neuroanesthesia |journal=Neurosurgical Focus |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=E2 |year=2014 |pmid=24684332 |doi=10.3171/2014.2.FOCUS13578 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==Neurosurgery methods==\n{{Infobox medical intervention\n| Name        = Neurosurgery\n| Image       =\n| Caption     =\n| ICD10       = {{ICD10PCS|00|0/0}}-{{ICD10PCS|01|0/1}}\n| ICD9        = {{ICD9proc|01}}\u2013{{ICD9proc|05}}\n| MeshID      = D019635\n| OPS301      = {{OPS301|5-01...5-05}}\n| OtherCodes  =\n| HCPCSlevel2 =\n}}\n\nNeuroradiology plays a key role not only in diagnosis but also in the operative phase of neurosurgery.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Neuroradiology]] methods are used in modern neurosurgery diagnosis and treatment.

Techniques involving smaller openings with the aid of microscopes and endoscopes are now being used as well. Methods that utilize small craniotomies in conjunction with high-clarity microscopic visualization of neural tissue offer excellent results. However, the open methods are still traditionally used in trauma or emergency situations.<ref name=\"neurosurgery.org cybermuseum microneurohall jhardy\"/><ref name=neurosurgery-surgical-power-tool/>\n\n''Microsurgery'' is utilized in many aspects of neurological surgery. Microvascular techniques are used in EC-IC bypass surgery and in restoration carotid endarterectomy. The clipping of an aneurysm is performed under microscopic vision. [[Minimally-invasive procedures|minimally-invasive]] spine surgery utilizes microscopes or endoscopes. Procedures such as microdiscectomy, laminectomy, and artificial disc replacement rely on microsurgery.<ref name=\"stealthsurgical.com department neurosurgical\"/>\n\nUsing ''stereotaxy'' neurosurgeons can approach a minute target in the brain through a minimal opening. This is used in functional neurosurgery where electrodes are implanted or gene therapy is instituted with high level of accuracy as in the case of Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. Using the combination method of open and stereotactic surgery, intraventricular hemorrhages can potentially be evacuated successfully.<ref name=technology-increases-precision-safety-during-neurosurgery/> Conventional surgery using image guidance technologies is also becoming common and is referred to as surgical navigation, computer assisted surgery, navigated surgery, stereotactic navigation. Similar to a car or mobile Global Positioning System (GPS), image guided surgery systems, like Curve Image Guided Surgery and StealthStation, use cameras or electromagnetic fields to capture and relay the patient\u2019s anatomy and the surgeon\u2019s precise movements in relation to the patient, to computer monitors in the operating room. These sophisticated computerized systems are used before and during surgery to help orient the surgeon with three-dimensional images of the patient\u2019s anatomy including the tumor.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Duan, Zhaoliang & Yuan, Zhi-Yong & Liao, Xiangyun & Si, Weixin & Zhao, Jianhui |title=3D Tracking and Positioning of Surgical Instruments in Virtual Surgery Simulation |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=502\u2013509 |date=2011 |journal=Journal of Multimedia |doi=10.4304/jmm.6.6.502-509}}</ref> Real-time functional brain mapping has been employed to identify specific functional regions using [[Electrocorticography|electrocorticography (ECoG)]]<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Swift, James & Coon, William & Guger, Christoph & Brunner, Peter & Bunch, M & Lynch, T & Frawley, T & Ritaccio, Anthony & Schalk, Gerwin |title=Passive functional mapping of receptive language areas using electrocorticographic signals |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=2517\u20132524 |date=2018 |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2018.09.007|pmid=30342252 |pmc=6414063}}</ref>\n\nMinimally invasive ''endoscopic surgery'' is commonly utilized by neurosurgeons when appropriate.

Some indications for spine surgery include spinal cord compression resulting from trauma, arthritis of the spinal discs, or spondylosis. In cervical cord compression, patients may have difficulty with gait, balance issues, and/or numbness and tingling in the hands or feet. [[Spondylosis]] is the condition of spinal disc degeneration and arthritis that may compress the spinal canal. This condition can often result in bone-spurring and disc herniation. Power drills and special instruments are often used to correct any compression problems of the spinal canal. Disc herniations of spinal vertebral discs are removed with special rongeurs.  This procedure is known as a ''discectomy''. Generally once a disc is removed it is replaced by an implant which will create a bony fusion between vertebral bodies above and below. Instead, a mobile disc could be implanted into the disc space to maintain mobility. This is commonly used in cervical disc surgery. At times instead of disc removal a Laser discectomy could be used to decompress a nerve root. This method is mainly used for lumbar discs. ''Laminectomy'' is the removal of the [[Lamina of the vertebral arch|Lamina]] portion of the vertebrae of the spine in order to make room for the compressed nerve tissue.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nRadiology assisted spine surgery uses minimally-invasive procedures. They include the techniques of ''vertebroplasty'' and ''kyphoplasty'' in which certain types of spinal fractures are managed.<ref>''Principles of Neurosurgery- Rengachary, Ellenbogen''{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}</ref>\nPotentially unstable spines will need ''spine fusions''.

Therefore, careful selection of patients for each procedure is important. It has to be noted that if there is prior permanent neural tissue damage spinal surgery may not take away the symptoms.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSurgery for chronic pain is a sub branch of functional neurosurgery.
