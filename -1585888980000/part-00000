[[Pope Benedict XVI]] said that Leo's papacy \"...was undoubtedly one of the most important in the Church's history.\"<ref name=Benedict/>\n\nHe was a [[Rome|Roman]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], and was the first pope to have been called \"the Great\". He is perhaps best known for having met [[Attila the Hun]] in 452 and allegedly persuaded him to turn back from his invasion of Italy. He is also a [[Doctor of the Church]], most remembered theologically for issuing the [[Leo's Tome|Tome of Leo]], a document which was a major foundation to the debates of the [[Ecumenical Council]] of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]]. The Council of Chalcedon, the fourth ecumenical council, dealt primarily with [[Christology]], and elucidated the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] definition of [[Christ]]'s being as the [[hypostatic union]] of two natures, divine and human, united in one person, \"with neither confusion nor division\". It was followed by a major [[schism (religion)|schism]] associated with [[Monophysitism]], [[Miaphysitism]] and [[Dyophysitism]].<ref name=\"first seven\">{{cite book|last=Davis, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]]|first=Leo Donald|title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325\u2013787): Their History and Theology (Theology and Life Series 21)|year=1990|publisher=Michael Glazier/Liturgical Press|location=Collegeville, MN|isbn=978-0-8146-5616-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/firstsevenec_davi_1990_000_6702418/page/342 342]|url=https://archive.org/details/firstsevenec_davi_1990_000_6702418/page/342}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nAccording to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', he was a native of [[Tuscany]]. By 431, as a [[deacon]], he was sufficiently well known outside of Rome that [[John Cassian]] dedicated to him the treatise against [[Nestorius]] written at Leo's suggestion. About this time [[Cyril of Alexandria]] appealed to Rome regarding a jurisdictional dispute with [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]], but it is not entirely clear whether the letter was intended for Leo, in his capacity of [[archdeacon]],<ref name=Butler>[http://www.bartleby.com/210/4/111.html Butler, Alban. \"St. Leo the Great, Pope\", ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'', vol. IV, 1866]</ref> or for [[Pope Celestine I]] directly. Near the end of the reign of [[Pope Sixtus III]], Leo was dispatched at the request of [[Valentinian III|Emperor Valentinian III]] to settle a dispute between [[Flavius A\u00ebtius|A\u00ebtius]], one of Gaul's chief military commanders, and the chief magistrate [[Caecina Decius Aginatius Albinus (consul 444)|Caecina Decius Aginatius Albinus]]. [[Johann Peter Kirsch]] sees this commission as a proof of the confidence placed in the able deacon by the Imperial Court.<ref name=Kirsch>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09154b.htm Kirsch, Johann Peter. \"Pope St. Leo I (the Great).\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9.

His attitude was as decided against the [[Priscillian]]ists. Bishop [[Turibius of Astorga]], astonished at the spread of the sect in [[Spain]], had addressed the other Spanish bishops on the subject, sending a copy of his letter to Leo, who took the opportunity to write an extended treatise (21 July 447) against the sect, examining its false teaching in detail and calling for a Spanish general council to investigate whether it had any adherents in the episcopate.<ref name=Crawley>[https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/saint-leo-the-great-5614 ''Lives of the Saints'', John J. Crawley & Co., Inc.]</ref>\n\nFrom a pastoral perspective, he galvanized charitable works in a Rome beset by famines, an influx of refugees, and poverty. He further associated the practice of fasting with charity and almsgiving particularly on the occasion of the ''Quattro tempora'', (the quarterly [[Ember days]]).<ref name=Butler/>\n\n== Papal Authority ==\n{{Infobox popestyles\n|image      = \n|dipstyle   = [[His Holiness]]\n|offstyle   = Your Holiness\n|relstyle   = Holy Father\n|deathstyle = Saint\n}}\n\nLeo drew many learned men about him and chose [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] to act in some secretarial or notarial capacity.<ref name=Butler/>\nLeo was a significant contributor to the centralisation of spiritual authority within the Church and in reaffirming papal authority. The bishop of Rome had gradually become viewed as the chief patriarch in the Western church.\n\n===Various regional matters===\nOn several occasions, Leo was asked to arbitrate disputes in Gaul. Patroclus of Arles (d. 426) had received from [[Pope Zosimus]] the recognition of a subordinate [[primate (bishop)|primacy]] over the Gallican Church which was strongly asserted by his successor [[Hilary of Arles]]. An appeal from Chelidonius of Besan\u00e7on gave Leo the opportunity to assert the pope's authority over Hilary, who defended himself stoutly at Rome, refusing to recognize Leo's judicial status. Feeling that the primatial rights of the bishop of Rome were threatened, Leo appealed to the civil power for support and obtained, from [[Valentinian III]], a decree of 6 June 445, which recognized the primacy of the bishop of Rome based on the merits of Peter, the dignity of the city, and the legislation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]]; and provided for the forcible extradition by provincial governors of any bishop who refused to answer a summons to Rome.<ref>Henry Bettenson, Chris Maunder, ''Documents of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2011 {{ISBN|9780199568987}}), p. 24</ref> Faced with this decree, Hilary submitted to the pope, although under his successor, Ravennius, Leo divided the metropolitan rights between Arles and Vienne (450).\n\n[[File:Priest celebrating Mass at Altar of Leo I in St. Peter's Basilica.jpg|thumb|left|Priest celebrating Mass at the Altar of Leo the Great in St. Peter's Basilica]]\n\nIn 445, Leo disputed with [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Patriarch Dioscorus]], [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s successor as [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], insisting that the ecclesiastical practice of his see should follow that of Rome on the basis that [[Mark the Evangelist]], the disciple of [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]] and the founder of the Alexandrian Church, could have had no other tradition than that of the prince of the apostles.\n\nThe fact that the African province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] had been preserved to the empire and thus to the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] faith during the [[Vandal]] invasion and, in its isolation, was disposed to rest on outside support, gave Leo an opportunity to assert his authority there. In 446 he wrote to the Church in Mauretania in regard to a number of questions of discipline, stressing the point that laymen were not to be appointed to the episcopate.<ref name=Crawley/>\n\nIn a letter to the bishops of [[Campania]], [[Picenum]], and [[Tuscany]] (443) he required the observance of all his precepts and those of his predecessors; and he sharply rebuked the bishops of [[Sicily]] (447) for their deviation from the Roman custom as to the time of [[baptism]], requiring them to send delegates to the Roman synod to learn the proper practice.\n\nBecause of the earlier line of division between the western and eastern parts of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Illyria]] was ecclesiastically subject to Rome. [[Pope Innocent I]] had constituted the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Thessalonica]] his [[vicar]], in order to oppose the growing influence of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch of Constantinople]] in the area. In a letter of about 446 to a successor bishop of Thessalonica, Anastasius, Leo reproached him for the way he had treated one of the metropolitan bishops subject to him; after giving various instructions about the functions entrusted to Anastasius and stressing that certain powers were reserved to the pope himself, Leo wrote: \"The care of the universal Church should converge towards Peter's one seat, and nothing anywhere should be separated from its Head.\"<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3604014.htm Letter XIV, Leo to Anastasius, (Charles Lett Feltoe, tr.), ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', Second Series, Vol. 12.

The council did not read the letter nor did it pay any attention to the protests of Leo's legates but deposed Flavian and [[Eusebius of Dorylaeum]], who appealed to Rome. That is one reason that the council was never recognized as ecumenical and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon.\n\nIt was presented again at the subsequent Council of Chalcedon as offering a solution to the Christological controversies still raging between East and West.<ref name=sourcebook>[https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/chalcedon.asp \"Extracts from the Acts: Session II (cont.)\", ''The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', 2nd series, Vol XIV edition by H.R.

Leo demanded of the emperor that an [[ecumenical]] council should be held in Italy, and in the meantime, at a Roman synod in October 449, repudiated all the decisions of the \"[[Robber Synod]]\". In his letters to the emperor and others he demanded the deposition of Eutyches as a [[Manichaean]] and [[Docetic]] heretic.\n\nThe [[Council of Chalcedon]] of 451 rejected the heresy of Eutyches who denied the true human nature of the Son of God, and affirmed the union in his one Person, without confusion and without separation, of his two natures, human and divine.\n\nThe acts of the council report: \"After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out: This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe. This is the true faith. Those of us who are orthodox thus believe.

Subsequently, through numerous letters addressed to bishops and members of the imperial family, Leo incessantly worked for the propagation and universal reception of the faith in Christ as defined by Chalcedon, also in the eastern part of the Roman empire. Leo defends the true divinity and the true humanity of the one Christ against heretical one-sidedness. He takes up this topic also in many of his sermons, and over the years, he further develops his own original concepts. A central idea around which Leo deepens and explains his theology is Christ's presence in the Church, more specifically in the teaching and preaching of the faith (Scripture, Tradition and their interpretation), in the liturgy (sacraments and celebrations), in the life of the individual believer and of the organized Church, especially in a council.\n\nTo Leo the Great, Mariology is determined by [[Christology]]. If Christ were divine only, everything about him would be divine. Only his divinity would have been crucified, buried and resurrected. Mary would only be the mother of God, and Christians would have no hope for their own resurrection. The nucleus of Christianity would be destroyed.<ref>PL 54, 221, C 226</ref> The most unusual beginning of a truly human life through her was to give birth to Jesus, the Lord and Son of King David.<ref>Sermons, 9, PL54, 227, CF, and 205 BC</ref>\n\n===Heir of Peter===\nLeo assumed the papacy at a time of increasing barbarian invasions; this, coupled with the decreasing imperial authority in the West, forced the Bishop of Rome to take a more active part in civic and political affairs. He was one of the first bishops of Rome to promote papal primacy based on succession from [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]]; and he did so as a means of maintaining unity among the churches.<ref>[https://zenit.org/articles/pope-leo-the-great-defended-the-primacy-of-rome/ \"Pope: Leo the Great Defended the Primacy of Rome\", ''Zenit'', March 5, 2008]</ref> \n\nBesides recourse to biblical language, Leo also described his own special relationship with Peter in terms derived from Roman law. He called himself the (unworthy) heir and deputy (''vicarius'') of Peter, having received his apostolic authority and being obliged to follow his example. On the one hand, Peter stood before him with a claim on how Leo is to exercise his office; on the other hand, Leo, as the Roman bishop, represented the Apostle, whose authority he held. Christ, however, always comes out as the source of all grace and authority, and Leo is responsible to him for how he fulfilled his duties (sermon 1). Thus, the office of the Roman bishop, was grounded on the special relationship between Christ and Peter, a relationship that cannot be repeated per se; therefore, Leo depended on Peter's mediation, his assistance and his example in order to be able to adequately fulfill his role and exercise his authority as the Bishop of Rome, both in the city and beyond.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Leo and Attila ==\n[[Image:Leoattila-Raphael.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' depicts Leo, escorted by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], meeting with the [[Hun]] king outside Rome.]]\n\nDespite his defeat at the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451, [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] invaded [[Italy]] in 452, sacking cities such as [[Sack of Aquileia|Aquileia]] and heading for Rome. He allegedly demanded that the sister of the reigning Emperor Valentinian III be sent to him with a dowry. In response, the emperor sent three envoys to negotiate with Attila: [[Gennadius Avienus]], one of the [[Roman consul|consul]]s of 450, Memmius Aemilius Trygetius, the former [[urban prefect]], and Leo. Little is known of the specifics of the negotiations, as a result of which Attila withdrew. Most ancient and medieval historians celebrated Leo's actions, giving him all the credit for this successful embassy. According to [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] who was alive at the time of the event, Attila was so impressed by Leo that he withdrew.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/attila2.html Medieval Sourcebook: Leo I and Attila]</ref> Another near-contemporary was the historian [[Priscus]] who records that Attila was dissuaded from attacking Rome by his own men because they feared he would share the fate of the Visigothic king [[Alaric I|Alaric]], who died shortly after sacking the city in 410.<ref>[http://www.evolpub.com/CRE/CREseries.html#CRE11 John Given, ''The Fragmentary History of Priscus'' (2014) Evolution Publishing, Merchantville, NJ] {{ISBN|978-1-935228-14-1}}, p. 107</ref> Paul the Deacon, in the late 8th century, relates that an enormously huge man dressed in priestly robes and armed with a sword, visible only to Attila, threatened him and his army with death during his discourse with Leo, and this prompted Attila to submit to his request.<ref>Paul the Deacon, Historia Romana 14.12</ref>\n\nMore modern historians debate other possible reasons for Attila's sudden withdrawal. The pope may have offered Attila a large sum of gold or Attila may have had logistical and strategic concerns: an army probably laden with booty from plunder; a plague in northern Italy; food shortages; military actions of the Eastern Emperor [[Marcianus]] on the Danube frontier. Besides, the whereabouts of [[Flavius Aetius|A\u00ebtius]] at that time are unknown, and Attila or his warriors may have felt endangered by their arch-enemy from the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains|Catalaunian plains]].\n\nWriting in the early 20th century, [[John B. Bury]] remarked: \n<blockquote>\nThe fact of the embassy cannot be doubted. The distinguished ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of [[Lake Garda]]. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But we are at a loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, and at the same time troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/9*.html#4 J.

The Pope and members of his clergy, went to meet the invader to implore him to desist. While the Vandals plundered the city, the gesture nevertheless prevented Rome from being burned and assured that the Basilicas of St Peter, St Paul and St John, in which part of the terrified population sought refuge, were spared. \n\nLeo did, however, assist in rebuilding the city of Rome, restoring key places such as Saint Peter's.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmiPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&dq=Leo+461+portico&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VGtcVMKiMs7T7AbcmYHoAQ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Leo%20461%20portico&f=false Bronwen Neil, ''Leo the Great'' (Routledge 2009] {{ISBN|978-1-13528408-4}}), p. 49</ref>\n\n== On the fundamental dignity of Christians ==\nIn his ''In Nativitate Domini'', Christmas Day, sermon, \"Christian, remember your dignity\", Leo articulates a fundamental dignity common to all Christians, whether saints or sinners, and the consequent obligation to live up to it:\n{{Quotation|Our Saviour, dearly-beloved, was born today: let us be glad. For there is no proper place for sadness, when we keep the birthday of the Life, which destroys the fear of mortality and brings to us the joy of promised eternity. No one is kept from sharing in this happiness. There is for all one common measure of joy, because as our Lord the destroyer of sin and death finds none free from charge, so is He come to free us all. Let the saint exult in that he draws near to victory. Let the sinner be glad in that he is invited to pardon. Let the gentile take courage in that he is called to life...<br>\nLet us put off then the old man with his deeds: and having obtained a share in the birth of Christ let us renounce the works of the flesh.

By the mystery of Baptism thou wert made the temple of the Holy Ghost: do not put such a denizen to flight from thee by base acts, and subject thyself once more to the devil\u2019s thraldom:  because thy purchase money is the blood of Christ, because He shall judge thee in truth Who ransomed thee in mercy, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit reigns for ever and ever.

This assertion is commonly referred to as the doctrine of [[Petrine supremacy]].\n\nAccording to Leo and several [[Church Fathers]] as well as certain interpretations of the [[Scriptures]], the Church is built upon Peter, in pursuance of the promise of [[Confession of Peter|Matthew 16:16\u201319]]. Peter participates in everything which is Christ's; what the other apostles have in common with him they have through him. What is true of Peter is true also of his successors. Every other bishop is charged with the care of his particular flock, the Roman pontiff with that of the whole Church. Other bishops are his assistants in this great task.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] said that Leo's papacy \"...was undoubtedly one of the most important in the Church's history.\"<ref name=Benedict/>\n\nHe was a [[Rome|Roman]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], and was the first pope to have been called \"the Great\". He is perhaps best known for having met [[Attila the Hun]] in 452 and allegedly persuaded him to turn back from his invasion of Italy. He is also a [[Doctor of the Church]], most remembered theologically for issuing the [[Leo's Tome|Tome of Leo]], a document which was a major foundation to the debates of the [[Ecumenical Council]] of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]]. The Council of Chalcedon, the fourth ecumenical council, dealt primarily with [[Christology]], and elucidated the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] definition of [[Christ]]'s being as the [[hypostatic union]] of two natures, divine and human, united in one person, \"with neither confusion nor division\". It was followed by a major [[schism (religion)|schism]] associated with [[Monophysitism]], [[Miaphysitism]] and [[Dyophysitism]].<ref name=\"first seven\">{{cite book|last=Davis, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]]|first=Leo Donald|title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325\u2013787): Their History and Theology (Theology and Life Series 21)|year=1990|publisher=Michael Glazier/Liturgical Press|location=Collegeville, MN|isbn=978-0-8146-5616-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/firstsevenec_davi_1990_000_6702418/page/342 342]|url=https://archive.org/details/firstsevenec_davi_1990_000_6702418/page/342}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nAccording to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', he was a native of [[Tuscany]]. By 431, as a [[deacon]], he was sufficiently well known outside of Rome that [[John Cassian]] dedicated to him the treatise against [[Nestorius]] written at Leo's suggestion. About this time [[Cyril of Alexandria]] appealed to Rome regarding a jurisdictional dispute with [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]], but it is not entirely clear whether the letter was intended for Leo, in his capacity of [[archdeacon]],<ref name=Butler>[http://www.bartleby.com/210/4/111.html Butler, Alban. \"St. Leo the Great, Pope\", ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'', vol. IV, 1866]</ref> or for [[Pope Celestine I]] directly. Near the end of the reign of [[Pope Sixtus III]], Leo was dispatched at the request of [[Valentinian III|Emperor Valentinian III]] to settle a dispute between [[Flavius A\u00ebtius|A\u00ebtius]], one of Gaul's chief military commanders, and the chief magistrate [[Caecina Decius Aginatius Albinus (consul 444)|Caecina Decius Aginatius Albinus]]. [[Johann Peter Kirsch]] sees this commission as a proof of the confidence placed in the able deacon by the Imperial Court.<ref name=Kirsch>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09154b.htm Kirsch, Johann Peter. \"Pope St. Leo I (the Great).\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9.

His attitude was as decided against the [[Priscillian]]ists. Bishop [[Turibius of Astorga]], astonished at the spread of the sect in [[Spain]], had addressed the other Spanish bishops on the subject, sending a copy of his letter to Leo, who took the opportunity to write an extended treatise (21 July 447) against the sect, examining its false teaching in detail and calling for a Spanish general council to investigate whether it had any adherents in the episcopate.<ref name=Crawley>[https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/saint-leo-the-great-5614 ''Lives of the Saints'', John J. Crawley & Co., Inc.]</ref>\n\nFrom a pastoral perspective, he galvanized charitable works in a Rome beset by famines, an influx of refugees, and poverty. He further associated the practice of fasting with charity and almsgiving particularly on the occasion of the ''Quattro tempora'', (the quarterly [[Ember days]]).<ref name=Butler/>\n\n== Papal Authority ==\n{{Infobox popestyles\n|image      = \n|dipstyle   = [[His Holiness]]\n|offstyle   = Your Holiness\n|relstyle   = Holy Father\n|deathstyle = Saint\n}}\n\nLeo drew many learned men about him and chose [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] to act in some secretarial or notarial capacity.<ref name=Butler/>\nLeo was a significant contributor to the centralisation of spiritual authority within the Church and in reaffirming papal authority. The bishop of Rome had gradually become viewed as the chief patriarch in the Western church.\n\n===Various regional matters===\nOn several occasions, Leo was asked to arbitrate disputes in Gaul. Patroclus of Arles (d. 426) had received from [[Pope Zosimus]] the recognition of a subordinate [[primate (bishop)|primacy]] over the Gallican Church which was strongly asserted by his successor [[Hilary of Arles]]. An appeal from Chelidonius of Besan\u00e7on gave Leo the opportunity to assert the pope's authority over Hilary, who defended himself stoutly at Rome, refusing to recognize Leo's judicial status. Feeling that the primatial rights of the bishop of Rome were threatened, Leo appealed to the civil power for support and obtained, from [[Valentinian III]], a decree of 6 June 445, which recognized the primacy of the bishop of Rome based on the merits of Peter, the dignity of the city, and the legislation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]]; and provided for the forcible extradition by provincial governors of any bishop who refused to answer a summons to Rome.<ref>Henry Bettenson, Chris Maunder, ''Documents of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2011 {{ISBN|9780199568987}}), p. 24</ref> Faced with this decree, Hilary submitted to the pope, although under his successor, Ravennius, Leo divided the metropolitan rights between Arles and Vienne (450).\n\n[[File:Priest celebrating Mass at Altar of Leo I in St. Peter's Basilica.jpg|thumb|left|Priest celebrating Mass at the Altar of Leo the Great in St. Peter's Basilica]]\n\nIn 445, Leo disputed with [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Patriarch Dioscorus]], [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s successor as [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], insisting that the ecclesiastical practice of his see should follow that of Rome on the basis that [[Mark the Evangelist]], the disciple of [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]] and the founder of the Alexandrian Church, could have had no other tradition than that of the prince of the apostles.\n\nThe fact that the African province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] had been preserved to the empire and thus to the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] faith during the [[Vandal]] invasion and, in its isolation, was disposed to rest on outside support, gave Leo an opportunity to assert his authority there. In 446 he wrote to the Church in Mauretania in regard to a number of questions of discipline, stressing the point that laymen were not to be appointed to the episcopate.<ref name=Crawley/>\n\nIn a letter to the bishops of [[Campania]], [[Picenum]], and [[Tuscany]] (443) he required the observance of all his precepts and those of his predecessors; and he sharply rebuked the bishops of [[Sicily]] (447) for their deviation from the Roman custom as to the time of [[baptism]], requiring them to send delegates to the Roman synod to learn the proper practice.\n\nBecause of the earlier line of division between the western and eastern parts of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Illyria]] was ecclesiastically subject to Rome. [[Pope Innocent I]] had constituted the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Thessalonica]] his [[vicar]], in order to oppose the growing influence of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch of Constantinople]] in the area. In a letter of about 446 to a successor bishop of Thessalonica, Anastasius, Leo reproached him for the way he had treated one of the metropolitan bishops subject to him; after giving various instructions about the functions entrusted to Anastasius and stressing that certain powers were reserved to the pope himself, Leo wrote: \"The care of the universal Church should converge towards Peter's one seat, and nothing anywhere should be separated from its Head.\"<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3604014.htm Letter XIV, Leo to Anastasius, (Charles Lett Feltoe, tr.), ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', Second Series, Vol. 12.

The council did not read the letter nor did it pay any attention to the protests of Leo's legates but deposed Flavian and [[Eusebius of Dorylaeum]], who appealed to Rome. That is one reason that the council was never recognized as ecumenical and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon.\n\nIt was presented again at the subsequent Council of Chalcedon as offering a solution to the Christological controversies still raging between East and West.<ref name=sourcebook>[https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/chalcedon.asp \"Extracts from the Acts: Session II (cont.)\", ''The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', 2nd series, Vol XIV edition by H.R.

Leo demanded of the emperor that an [[ecumenical]] council should be held in Italy, and in the meantime, at a Roman synod in October 449, repudiated all the decisions of the \"[[Robber Synod]]\". In his letters to the emperor and others he demanded the deposition of Eutyches as a [[Manichaean]] and [[Docetic]] heretic.\n\nThe [[Council of Chalcedon]] of 451 rejected the heresy of Eutyches who denied the true human nature of the Son of God, and affirmed the union in his one Person, without confusion and without separation, of his two natures, human and divine.\n\nThe acts of the council report: \"After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out: This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril.

Subsequently, through numerous letters addressed to bishops and members of the imperial family, Leo incessantly worked for the propagation and universal reception of the faith in Christ as defined by Chalcedon, also in the eastern part of the Roman empire. Leo defends the true divinity and the true humanity of the one Christ against heretical one-sidedness. He takes up this topic also in many of his sermons, and over the years, he further develops his own original concepts. A central idea around which Leo deepens and explains his theology is Christ's presence in the Church, more specifically in the teaching and preaching of the faith (Scripture, Tradition and their interpretation), in the liturgy (sacraments and celebrations), in the life of the individual believer and of the organized Church, especially in a council.\n\nTo Leo the Great, Mariology is determined by [[Christology]]. If Christ were divine only, everything about him would be divine. Only his divinity would have been crucified, buried and resurrected. Mary would only be the mother of God, and Christians would have no hope for their own resurrection. The nucleus of Christianity would be destroyed.<ref>PL 54, 221, C 226</ref> The most unusual beginning of a truly human life through her was to give birth to Jesus, the Lord and Son of King David.<ref>Sermons, 9, PL54, 227, CF, and 205 BC</ref>\n\n===Heir of Peter===\nLeo assumed the papacy at a time of increasing barbarian invasions; this, coupled with the decreasing imperial authority in the West, forced the Bishop of Rome to take a more active part in civic and political affairs. He was one of the first bishops of Rome to promote papal primacy based on succession from [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]]; and he did so as a means of maintaining unity among the churches.<ref>[https://zenit.org/articles/pope-leo-the-great-defended-the-primacy-of-rome/ \"Pope: Leo the Great Defended the Primacy of Rome\", ''Zenit'', March 5, 2008]</ref> \n\nBesides recourse to biblical language, Leo also described his own special relationship with Peter in terms derived from Roman law. He called himself the (unworthy) heir and deputy (''vicarius'') of Peter, having received his apostolic authority and being obliged to follow his example. On the one hand, Peter stood before him with a claim on how Leo is to exercise his office; on the other hand, Leo, as the Roman bishop, represented the Apostle, whose authority he held. Christ, however, always comes out as the source of all grace and authority, and Leo is responsible to him for how he fulfilled his duties (sermon 1). Thus, the office of the Roman bishop, was grounded on the special relationship between Christ and Peter, a relationship that cannot be repeated per se; therefore, Leo depended on Peter's mediation, his assistance and his example in order to be able to adequately fulfill his role and exercise his authority as the Bishop of Rome, both in the city and beyond.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Leo and Attila ==\n[[Image:Leoattila-Raphael.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' depicts Leo, escorted by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], meeting with the [[Hun]] king outside Rome.]]\n\nDespite his defeat at the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451, [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] invaded [[Italy]] in 452, sacking cities such as [[Sack of Aquileia|Aquileia]] and heading for Rome. He allegedly demanded that the sister of the reigning Emperor Valentinian III be sent to him with a dowry. In response, the emperor sent three envoys to negotiate with Attila: [[Gennadius Avienus]], one of the [[Roman consul|consul]]s of 450, Memmius Aemilius Trygetius, the former [[urban prefect]], and Leo. Little is known of the specifics of the negotiations, as a result of which Attila withdrew. Most ancient and medieval historians celebrated Leo's actions, giving him all the credit for this successful embassy. According to [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] who was alive at the time of the event, Attila was so impressed by Leo that he withdrew.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/attila2.html Medieval Sourcebook: Leo I and Attila]</ref> Another near-contemporary was the historian [[Priscus]] who records that Attila was dissuaded from attacking Rome by his own men because they feared he would share the fate of the Visigothic king [[Alaric I|Alaric]], who died shortly after sacking the city in 410.<ref>[http://www.evolpub.com/CRE/CREseries.html#CRE11 John Given, ''The Fragmentary History of Priscus'' (2014) Evolution Publishing, Merchantville, NJ] {{ISBN|978-1-935228-14-1}}, p. 107</ref> Paul the Deacon, in the late 8th century, relates that an enormously huge man dressed in priestly robes and armed with a sword, visible only to Attila, threatened him and his army with death during his discourse with Leo, and this prompted Attila to submit to his request.<ref>Paul the Deacon, Historia Romana 14.12</ref>\n\nMore modern historians debate other possible reasons for Attila's sudden withdrawal. The pope may have offered Attila a large sum of gold or Attila may have had logistical and strategic concerns: an army probably laden with booty from plunder; a plague in northern Italy; food shortages; military actions of the Eastern Emperor [[Marcianus]] on the Danube frontier. Besides, the whereabouts of [[Flavius Aetius|A\u00ebtius]] at that time are unknown, and Attila or his warriors may have felt endangered by their arch-enemy from the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains|Catalaunian plains]].\n\nWriting in the early 20th century, [[John B. Bury]] remarked: \n<blockquote>\nThe fact of the embassy cannot be doubted. The distinguished ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of [[Lake Garda]]. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But we are at a loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, and at the same time troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/9*.html#4 J.

The Pope and members of his clergy, went to meet the invader to implore him to desist. While the Vandals plundered the city, the gesture nevertheless prevented Rome from being burned and assured that the Basilicas of St Peter, St Paul and St John, in which part of the terrified population sought refuge, were spared. \n\nLeo did, however, assist in rebuilding the city of Rome, restoring key places such as Saint Peter's.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmiPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&dq=Leo+461+portico&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VGtcVMKiMs7T7AbcmYHoAQ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Leo%20461%20portico&f=false Bronwen Neil, ''Leo the Great'' (Routledge 2009] {{ISBN|978-1-13528408-4}}), p. 49</ref>\n\n== On the fundamental dignity of Christians ==\nIn his ''In Nativitate Domini'', Christmas Day, sermon, \"Christian, remember your dignity\", Leo articulates a fundamental dignity common to all Christians, whether saints or sinners, and the consequent obligation to live up to it:\n{{Quotation|Our Saviour, dearly-beloved, was born today: let us be glad. For there is no proper place for sadness, when we keep the birthday of the Life, which destroys the fear of mortality and brings to us the joy of promised eternity. No one is kept from sharing in this happiness. There is for all one common measure of joy, because as our Lord the destroyer of sin and death finds none free from charge, so is He come to free us all. Let the saint exult in that he draws near to victory. Let the sinner be glad in that he is invited to pardon. Let the gentile take courage in that he is called to life...<br>\nLet us put off then the old man with his deeds: and having obtained a share in the birth of Christ let us renounce the works of the flesh. Christian, acknowledge thy dignity, and becoming a partner in the Divine nature, refuse to return to the old baseness by degenerate conduct. Remember the Head and the Body of which thou art a member. Recollect that thou wert rescued from the power of darkness and brought out into God\u2019s light and kingdom. By the mystery of Baptism thou wert made the temple of the Holy Ghost: do not put such a denizen to flight from thee by base acts, and subject thyself once more to the devil\u2019s thraldom:  because thy purchase money is the blood of Christ, because He shall judge thee in truth Who ransomed thee in mercy, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit reigns for ever and ever.

In 688 his remains were moved inside the basilica itself.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Significance ==\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] said that Leo's papacy \"...was undoubtedly one of the most important in the Church's history.\"<ref name=Benedict/>\n\nThe significance of Leo's pontificate lies in his assertion of the universal jurisdiction of the Roman bishop, as expressed in his letters, and still more in his 96 extant orations. This assertion is commonly referred to as the doctrine of [[Petrine supremacy]].\n\nAccording to Leo and several [[Church Fathers]] as well as certain interpretations of the [[Scriptures]], the Church is built upon Peter, in pursuance of the promise of [[Confession of Peter|Matthew 16:16\u201319]]. Peter participates in everything which is Christ's; what the other apostles have in common with him they have through him. What is true of Peter is true also of his successors. Every other bishop is charged with the care of his particular flock, the Roman pontiff with that of the whole Church. Other bishops are his assistants in this great task. In Leo's eyes the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon acquired their validity from his confirmation.\n\nLeo's letters and sermons reflect the many aspects of his career and personality and are invaluable historical sources. His rhythmic prose style, called ''cursus leonicus'', influenced ecclesiastical language for centuries.\n\nIn 1754 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] proclaimed Leo I a [[Doctor of the Church]].<ref name=Benedict>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2008/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20080305.html Pope Benedict XVI, \"Saint Leo the Great\", General Audience, 5 March 2008, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]</ref><ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09154b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia on Pope St. Leo I (the Great)</ref> Next to Leo only one other pope, [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory]], is also recognized as Doctor of the Church.<ref name=\"leo\">[https://www.vaticannews.va/en/saints/11/10/st--leo-the-great--pope-and-doctor-of-the-church.html St. Leo the Great, pope and doctor of the church] vaticannews.va</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] marks 10 November as the feast day of Saint Leo, given in the [[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]] and the 8th-century Calendar of Saint Willibrord as the date of his death and entry to heaven.

Researchers express the measures either as percentages or as percentile scores scaled from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100. By convention, researchers express the differences between the two measures as self-assessed competence minus actual competence. In such a convention, negative numbers signify erring toward underconfidence, positive numbers signify erring toward overconfidence, and zero signifies perfectly accurate self-assessment.\n\nEhrlinger et al.<ref name=\"unskilledunaware\"></ref> summarized the major assertions of the Effect that first appeared in the 1999 seminal paper and continued to be supported by many studies after nine years of research: \"People are typically overly optimistic when evaluating the quality of their performance on social and intellectual tasks. In particular, poor performers grossly overestimate their performances\" (Ehrlinger et al. 2008, p. 98)''.''\n\nThe Effect asserts that most people are overconfident about their actual abilities, and that the least competent people are the most overconfident. Support for both assertions rests upon interpreting the patterns produced from graphing the paired measures,\n \nThe most common graphical convention is the Kruger-Dunning type graph typified by Figure 1 in the seminal paper.<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> That paper depicted college students' accuracy in self-assessing their competencies in humor, logical reasoning, and grammar. Researchers adopted that convention in subsequent papers on the Effect.

These researchers graphed their data in all the earlier papers' various conventions, and explained how the numerical reasoning used to argue for the Effect are similar in all. When graphed in these established conventions, the researchers' data also supported the Effect. Had the researchers ended their study at this point, their results would have added to the established consensus that validated the Effect. But their deeper analyses led them to conclude that the numerical procedures used repeatedly in all previous work were the likely sources of misleading conclusions.\n\nTo expose the sources of the misleading conclusions, the researchers employed their own real data set of paired measures from 1154 participants, and created a second simulated data set that employed random numbers to simulate random guessing by an equal number of simulated participants. The simulated data set contained only random noise, without any measures of human behavior.\n\nThe researchers<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" /><ref name=\"Nuhfer 2017\" /> then used the simulated data set and the graphical conventions of the behavioral scientists to produce patterns like those described as validating the Dunning-Kruger Effect. They traced the origin of the patterns, not to the dominant literature's claimed psychological disposition of humans, but instead to the nature of graphing data bounded by limits of 0 and 100 and to the process of ordering and grouping the paired measures to create the graphs. These patterns are mathematical artifacts that random noise devoid of any human influence can produce. They further showed that the graphs used to establish the Effect in three of the four case examples presented in the seminal paper are patterns characteristic of purely random noise. These patterns are numerical artifacts that behavioral scientists and educators seem to have interpreted as evidence for a human psychological disposition toward overconfidence.\n\nBut the graphic presented on the case study on humor in the seminal paper's Figure 1<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> and the Numeracy researchers' real data (Figure 4 of Nuhfer et al.<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />) were not the patterns of purely random noise. Although the data was noisy, that human-derived data exhibited some order that could not be attributed to random noise. The researchers attributed it to human influence and called it the \"self-assessment signal.\"<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />\n\nThe researchers went on to characterize the signal and worked to determine what human disposition it revealed. To do so, they employed different kinds of graphics that suppress or eliminate the noise responsible for most of the artifacts and distortions. The authors discovered that the different graphics refuted the assertions made for the Effect. Instead, they showed that most people are reasonably accurate in their self-assessments. About half of the 1154 participants in their studies accurately estimated their performance within \u00b110 percentage points (ppts). Two-thirds of these participants self-assessed their competency scores within \u00b115 ppts. Only about 6% of participants displayed wild overconfidence and were unable to accurately self-assess their abilities within 30 ppts. All groups overestimated and underestimated their actual ability with equal frequency. No marked tendency toward overconfidence, as predicted by the Effect, occurs, even in the most novice groups. In 2020, with an updated database of over 5000 participants, this relationship still held true. The revised mathematical interpretation of data confirmed that people typically have no pronounced tendency to overestimate their actual proficiency.\n\nGroups' mean self-assessments prove more than an order of magnitude more accurate than do individuals'. In randomly selected groups of 50 participants, 81% of groups' self-assessed mean scores were within 3 ppts of their actual mean competency score. The discovery that groups of people are accurate in their self-assessments opens an entirely new way to study groups of people with respect to paired measures of cognitive competence and affective self-assessed competence.

Therefore, judges at all levels of skill are subject to similar degrees of error in the performance of tasks.<ref name=\"Burson2006\">{{cite journal |last=Burson |first=Katherine A. |last2=Larrick |first2=Richard P. |last3=Klayman |first3=Joshua |title=Skilled or unskilled, but still unaware of it: How perceptions of difficulty drive miscalibration in relative comparisons. |date=2006 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=60\u201377 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.1.60 |pmid=16448310 |hdl=2027.42/39168 |citeseerx=10.1.1.178.7774}}</ref>\n\nIn testing alternative explanations for the cognitive bias of illusory superiority, the study \"Why the Unskilled are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) Self-insight Among the Incompetent\" (2008), reached the same conclusions as previous studies of the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect: that, in contrast to high performers, \"poor performers do not learn from feedback suggesting a need to improve\".<ref name=\"unskilledunaware\">{{cite journal |last=Ehrlinger |first=Joyce |last2=Johnson |first2=Kerri |last3=Banner |first3=Matthew |last4=Dunning |first4=David |author4-link=David Dunning |last5=Kruger |first5=Justin |author5-link=Justin Kruger |title=Why the unskilled are unaware: Further explorations of (absent) self-insight among the incompetent |year=2008 |journal=[[Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes]] |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=98\u2013121 |doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.05.002 |pmc=2702783 |pmid=19568317}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals of relatively high social class are more overconfident than lower-class individuals.<ref>Belmi, Neale, Reiff, & Ulfe, \"[https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspi0000187.pdf The Social Advantage of Miscalibrated Individuals: The Relationship Between Social Class and Overconfidence and Its Implications for Class-Based Inequality]\", ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes'' (2019)</ref>\n\n==Mathematical critique==\nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect is a statement about a particular disposition of human behavior, but it also makes quantitative assertions that rest on mathematical arguments. \n \nThe Effect relies on the quantifying of paired measures consisting of (a) the measure of the competence people can demonstrate when put to the test (actual competence) and (b) the measure of competence people believe that they have (self-assessed competence). Researchers express the measures either as percentages or as percentile scores scaled from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100. By convention, researchers express the differences between the two measures as self-assessed competence minus actual competence. In such a convention, negative numbers signify erring toward underconfidence, positive numbers signify erring toward overconfidence, and zero signifies perfectly accurate self-assessment.\n\nEhrlinger et al.<ref name=\"unskilledunaware\"></ref> summarized the major assertions of the Effect that first appeared in the 1999 seminal paper and continued to be supported by many studies after nine years of research: \"People are typically overly optimistic when evaluating the quality of their performance on social and intellectual tasks. In particular, poor performers grossly overestimate their performances\" (Ehrlinger et al. 2008, p. 98)''.''\n\nThe Effect asserts that most people are overconfident about their actual abilities, and that the least competent people are the most overconfident. Support for both assertions rests upon interpreting the patterns produced from graphing the paired measures,\n \nThe most common graphical convention is the Kruger-Dunning type graph typified by Figure 1 in the seminal paper.<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> That paper depicted college students' accuracy in self-assessing their competencies in humor, logical reasoning, and grammar. Researchers adopted that convention in subsequent papers on the Effect. Additional graphs used by other researchers who argued for the legitimacy of the Effect include (y-x) versus (x) cross plots (Figure 5 of Pazicni and Bauer, 2015<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pazicni|first=Samuel|last2=Bauer|first2=Christopher F.|date=2014|title=Characterizing illusions of competence in introductory chemistry students|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C3RP00106G|journal=Chem.

The first two of these studies depicted college students' accuracy in self-assessing their competence in introductory chemistry, and the third depicted their accuracy in self-assessing their competence in business classes.\n\nRecent researchers who focused on the mathematical reasoning<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\">{{Cite journal|last=Nuhfer|first=Edward|last2=Cogan|first2=Christopher|last3=Fleischer|first3=Steven|last4=Gaze|first4=Eric|last5=Wirth|first5=Karl|date=2016|title=Random Number Simulations Reveal How Random Noise Affects the Measurements and Graphical Portrayals of Self-Assessed Competency|journal=Numeracy|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.5038/1936-4660.9.1.4}}</ref><ref name=\"Nuhfer 2017\">{{Cite journal|last=Nuhfer|first=Edward|last2=Fleischer|first2=Steven|last3=Cogan|first3=Christopher|last4=Wirth|first4=Karl|last5=Gaze|first5=Eric|date=2017|title=How Random Noise and a Graphical Convention Subverted Behavioral Scientists' Explanations of Self-Assessment Data: Numeracy Underlies Better Alternatives|journal=Numeracy|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.5038/1936-4660.10.1.4}}</ref>  behind the Effect studied 1154 participants' ability to self-assess their competence in understanding the nature of science. These researchers graphed their data in all the earlier papers' various conventions, and explained how the numerical reasoning used to argue for the Effect are similar in all. When graphed in these established conventions, the researchers' data also supported the Effect. Had the researchers ended their study at this point, their results would have added to the established consensus that validated the Effect. But their deeper analyses led them to conclude that the numerical procedures used repeatedly in all previous work were the likely sources of misleading conclusions.\n\nTo expose the sources of the misleading conclusions, the researchers employed their own real data set of paired measures from 1154 participants, and created a second simulated data set that employed random numbers to simulate random guessing by an equal number of simulated participants. The simulated data set contained only random noise, without any measures of human behavior.\n\nThe researchers<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" /><ref name=\"Nuhfer 2017\" /> then used the simulated data set and the graphical conventions of the behavioral scientists to produce patterns like those described as validating the Dunning-Kruger Effect. They traced the origin of the patterns, not to the dominant literature's claimed psychological disposition of humans, but instead to the nature of graphing data bounded by limits of 0 and 100 and to the process of ordering and grouping the paired measures to create the graphs. These patterns are mathematical artifacts that random noise devoid of any human influence can produce. They further showed that the graphs used to establish the Effect in three of the four case examples presented in the seminal paper are patterns characteristic of purely random noise. These patterns are numerical artifacts that behavioral scientists and educators seem to have interpreted as evidence for a human psychological disposition toward overconfidence.\n\nBut the graphic presented on the case study on humor in the seminal paper's Figure 1<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> and the Numeracy researchers' real data (Figure 4 of Nuhfer et al.<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />) were not the patterns of purely random noise. Although the data was noisy, that human-derived data exhibited some order that could not be attributed to random noise. The researchers attributed it to human influence and called it the \"self-assessment signal.\"<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />\n\nThe researchers went on to characterize the signal and worked to determine what human disposition it revealed. To do so, they employed different kinds of graphics that suppress or eliminate the noise responsible for most of the artifacts and distortions. The authors discovered that the different graphics refuted the assertions made for the Effect. Instead, they showed that most people are reasonably accurate in their self-assessments. About half of the 1154 participants in their studies accurately estimated their performance within \u00b110 percentage points (ppts). Two-thirds of these participants self-assessed their competency scores within \u00b115 ppts. Only about 6% of participants displayed wild overconfidence and were unable to accurately self-assess their abilities within 30 ppts. All groups overestimated and underestimated their actual ability with equal frequency. No marked tendency toward overconfidence, as predicted by the Effect, occurs, even in the most novice groups. In 2020, with an updated database of over 5000 participants, this relationship still held true. The revised mathematical interpretation of data confirmed that people typically have no pronounced tendency to overestimate their actual proficiency.\n\nGroups' mean self-assessments prove more than an order of magnitude more accurate than do individuals'. In randomly selected groups of 50 participants, 81% of groups' self-assessed mean scores were within 3 ppts of their actual mean competency score. The discovery that groups of people are accurate in their self-assessments opens an entirely new way to study groups of people with respect to paired measures of cognitive competence and affective self-assessed competence.

The paper confirms that minority groups are on average less privileged and score lower in the cognitive test scores and self-assessed confidence ratings on the instruments used in this research. They verified that women on average self-assessed more accurately than men, and did so across all ethnic groups that had sufficient representation in the researchers' database.\n\n==Cultural differences in self-perception==\nStudies of the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect usually have been of North Americans, but studies of Japanese people suggest that cultural forces have a role in the occurrence of the effect.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate.aspx |title=Why We overestimate Our Competence |last=DeAngelis |first=Tori |date=February 2003 |journal=Monitor on Psychology |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=60 |issn=1529-4978 |access-date=7 March 2011}}</ref> The study \"Divergent Consequences of Success and Failure in Japan and North America: An Investigation of Self-improving Motivations and Malleable Selves\" (2001) indicated that Japanese people tended to underestimate their abilities, and tended to see underachievement (failure) as an opportunity to improve their abilities at a given task, thereby increasing their value to the social group.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Heine |first=S.J. |last2=Lehman |first2=D.R. |last3=Ide |first3=E. |last4=Leung |first4=C. |last5=Kitayama |first5=S. |last6=Takata |first6=T. |last7=Matsumoto |first7=H. |date=October 2001 |title=Divergent Consequences of Success and Failure in Japan and North America: An Investigation of Self-improving Motivations and Malleable Selves |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=599\u2013615 |issn=0022-3514 |pmid=11642348 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.4.599}}</ref>\n\n==Popular recognition==\nIn 2000, Kruger and Dunning were awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in recognition of the scientific work recorded in \"their modest report\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2000 |title=Ig Nobel Past Winners |work=Improbable Research |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> \n\"The Dunning\u2013Kruger Song\"<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdnH19KsVVc |title=\"The Dunning\u2013Kruger Song\", from ''The Incompetence Opera'' |date=15 January 2018 |website=YouTube.com |publisher=ImprobableResearch |access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> is part of ''The Incompetence Opera'',<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNGusIvpVxc |title=The Incompetence Opera |date=29 December 2017 |website=YouTube.com |publisher=ImprobableResearch |access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> a mini-opera that premiered at the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/ig/2017/ |title=The 27th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony & Lectures |access-date=18 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120422/https://www.improbable.com/ig/2017/ |archive-date=19 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mini-opera is billed as \"a musical encounter with the [[Peter principle]] and the Dunning\u2013Kruger Effect\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/2017/08/30/preview-the-incompetence-opera/ |title=Preview: \"The Incompetence Opera\" |publisher=Improbable Research |access-date=18 January 2018|date=30 August 2017 }}</ref>\n\nJournalists have often cited the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect in discussions of political incompetence.
