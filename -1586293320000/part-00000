The shape is determined partly by [[aerodynamics]]; a capsule is aerodynamically stable falling blunt end first, which allows only the blunt end to require a [[heat shield]] for [[atmospheric entry]]. Its shape has also been compared {{by whom|date=August 2019}} to that of an old-fashioned automobile's headlight. A manned capsule contains the spacecraft's instrument panel, limited storage space, and seats for crew members.  Because a capsule shape has little [[aerodynamic lift]], the final descent is via [[parachute]], either coming to rest on land, at sea, or by active capture by an aircraft. In contrast, the development of [[spaceplane]] reentry vehicles attempts to provide a more flexible reentry profile.\n\n==Structure==\n[[Image:Apollo cm.jpg|thumb|Artwork of [[Apollo command module]] flying with the blunt end of the heat shield at a non-zero [[angle of attack]] in order to establish a lifting entry and control the landing site]]\nReentry capsules have typically been smaller than {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter due to [[launch vehicle]] aerodynamic requirements. The capsule design is both volumetrically efficient and structurally strong, so it is typically possible to construct small capsules of performance comparable to [[lifting body]] or [[spaceplane]] designs in all but lift-to-drag ratio for less cost. The [[Soyuz spacecraft]] is an example. Most capsules have used an [[ablative heat shield]] for reentry and been non-reusable. The [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]] appears likely, as of December 2005, to use a ten-times reusable capsule with a replaceable heat shield. There is no limit, save for lack of engineering experience, on using high-temperature ceramic tiles or ultra-high temperature [[ceramic]] sheets on reentry capsules.\n\nMaterials for the capsule are designed in different ways, like the [[Apollo command and service module#Command module|Apollo command module]]\u2019s [[aluminum]] [[honeycomb structure]]. Aluminum is very light, and the structure gives the capsule extra strength. The early spacecraft had a coating of glass embedded with synthetic resin and put in very high temperatures. [[Carbon fiber]], reinforced plastics and ceramic are new materials that are constantly being made better for use in space exploration.\n\n== Reentry ==\n{{Main|Atmospheric reentry}}\nMost reentry capsules have used an [[ablative heat shield]] for reentry and been non-reusable. The early spacecraft had a coating of glass embedded with synthetic resin and put in very high temperatures.\n\nReentry capsules are well-suited to high energy reentries. Capsules reenter aft-end first with the occupants lying down, as this is the optimum position for the human body to withstand the g-forces induced as the capsule impacts the atmosphere. The rounded shape (blunt body) of a capsule forms a shock wave that keeps most of the heat away from the heat shield, but a [[thermal protection system]] is still necessary. The space capsule must be strong enough to withstand reentry forces such as [[drag (physics)|drag]], and must reenter at a precise angle of attack to prevent a skip off the surface of the atmosphere or destructively high accelerations.\n\nWhen the reentry capsule comes through the atmosphere the capsule compresses the air in front of it, which heats up to very high temperatures. The surface temperature of a capsule can reach {{cvt|1480|\u00b0C}} as it descends through the Earth's atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} To prevent this heat from reaching interior structures, capsules are typically equipped with an [[ablative heat shield]] that melts and then vaporizes, removing the heat.\n\nThe Apollo command module reentered with the [[center of mass]] offset from the center line; this caused the capsule to assume an angled attitude through the air, providing lift that could be used for directional control. [[Reaction control system]] thrusters were used to steer the capsule by changing the lift vector.\n\nParachutes are used for the final descent, sometimes augmented by braking rockets if the capsule is designed to land on the Earth's surface. Examples of land landing capsules include Vostok, Voskhod, Soyuz, Shenzhou and the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. Other capsules, such as Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Orion, and Dragon, splash down in the ocean.\n\n==Aerodynamic heating==\n{{Main|Atmospheric reentry}}\nCapsules are well-suited to high-temperature and dynamic loading reentries. Whereas delta-wing gliders such as the [[Space Shuttle]] can reenter from [[Low Earth Orbit]], and lifting bodies are capable of entry from as far away as the [[Moon]], it is rare to find designs for reentry vehicles from [[Mars]] that are not capsules. The current [[RKK Energia]] design for the [[Kliper]], being capable of flights to Mars, is an exception.\n\nEngineers building a reentry capsule must take forces such as [[gravity]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]] into consideration. The capsule must be strong enough to slow down quickly, must endure extremely high or low temperatures, and must survive the landing. When the capsule comes close to a planet's or moon's surface, it has to slow down at a very exact rate. If it slows down too quickly, everything in the capsule will be crushed. If it doesn\u2019t slow down quickly enough, it will crash into the surface and be destroyed. There are additional requirements for atmospheric reentry. If the angle of attack is too shallow, the capsule may skip off the surface of the atmosphere. If the angle of attack is too steep, the deceleration forces may be too high or the heat of reentry may exceed the tolerances of the heat shield.\n\nCapsules reenter aft-end first with the occupants lying down, as this is the optimum position for the human body to withstand the decelerative g-force. The aft end is formed in a rounded shape (blunt body), as this forms a shock wave that doesn't touch the capsule, and the heat is deflected away rather than melting the vehicle.\n\nThe Apollo Command Module reentered with the [[center of mass]] offset from the center line; this caused the capsule to assume an angled attitude through the air, providing a sideways lift to be used for directional control. Rotational thrusters were used to steer the capsule under either automatic or manual control by changing the lift vector.\n\nAt lower altitudes and speeds parachutes are used to slow the capsule down by making more drag.\n\nCapsules also have to be able to withstand the impact when they reach the Earth's surface. All US crewed capsules (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo) would land on water; the Soviet/Russian Soyuz and Chinese Shenzhou (and planned US, Russian, Indian) creweded capsules uses small rockets to touch down on land. In the lighter [[gravity of Mars]], airbags were sufficient to land some of the robotic missions safely.\n\n===Gravity, drag, and lift===\nTwo of the biggest external forces that a reentry capsule experiences are [[gravity]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]].\n\nDrag is the capsule's resistance to it moving through [[air]]. Air is a mixture of different [[molecules]], including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide. Anything falling through air hits these molecules and therefore slows down. The amount of drag on a capsule depends on many things, including the [[density]] of the air, and the shape, mass, diameter and roughness of the capsule. The speed of a spacecraft highly depends on the combined effect of the two forces &mdash; gravity, which can speed up a rocket, and drag, which will slow down the rocket. Capsules entering Earth's atmosphere will be considerably slowed because our atmosphere is so thick.\n\nWhen the capsule comes through the atmosphere, it compresses the air in front of it which heats up to very high temperatures (contrary to popular belief friction is not significant).\n\nA good example of this is a [[meteor|shooting star]]. A shooting star, which is usually tiny, creates so much heat coming through the atmosphere that the air around the meteorite glows white hot. So when a huge object like a capsule comes through, even more heat is created.\n\nAs the capsule slows down, the compression of the air molecules hitting the capsules surface creates a lot of heat. The surface of a capsule can get to 1480 \u00b0C (2700 F) as it descends through the Earth's atmosphere. All this heat has to be directed away. Reentry capsules are typically coated with a material that melts and then vaporizes (\"ablation\"). It may seem counterproductive, but the vaporization takes heat away from the capsule. This keeps the reentry heat from getting inside the capsule. Capsules see a more intense heating regime than spaceplanes and ceramics such as used on the Space Shuttle are usually less suitable, and all capsules have used ablation.\n\nIn practice, capsules do create a significant and useful amount of lift. This lift is used to control the trajectory of the capsule, allowing reduced g-forces on the crew, as well as reducing the peak heat transfer into the capsule. The longer the vehicle spends at high altitude, the thinner the air is and the less heat is conducted. For example, the Apollo CM had a lift to drag ratio of about 0.35. In the absence of any lift the Apollo capsule would have been subjected to about 20g deceleration (8g for low-Earth-orbiting spacecraft), but by using lift the trajectory was kept to around 4g.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Current designs==\n===Shenzhou===\n\nThe reentry capsule is the \"middle\" module of the three-part [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] or [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou]] spacecraft \u2013 the orbital module is located at the front of the spacecraft, with the [[service module|service]] or equipment module attached to the rear. A feature in the landing system allows the use of a single parachute and \"[[braking rocket]]\", thus the heatshield is dropped from the spacecraft similar to the landing bag deployment on the U.S. [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] spacecraft. Like the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] of the [[Apollo spacecraft]], the Shenzhou reentry capsule has no reusable capabilities; each spacecraft is flown once and then \"thrown away\" (usually sent to museums).\n\nFew details are known about the Shenzhou reentry capsule, except that it uses some technology from the Soyuz TM design.  The new Soyuz TMA spacecraft, now used solely for [[International Space Station]] flights, had its couches modified to allow for taller crewmembers to fly, and features \"[[glass cockpit]]\" technology similar to that found on the [[Space Shuttle]] and newer commercial and military aircraft.\n\n===Soyuz===\nThe former Soviet Union suffered two disasters, and one near-disaster, all three involving the capsule during the de-orbit and reentry.  [[Soyuz 1]] ended in disaster when the parachutes failed to deploy and the capsule smashed into the earth at speeds over {{convert|300|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, killing cosmonaut [[Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov|Vladimir Komarov]].  [[Soyuz 5]] almost ended in disaster, when the reentry capsule entered the atmosphere nose first \u2013 attributed to a failure of the service module to separate similar to that on the [[Vostok 1]] flight.  Luckily, the service module was burned off and the capsule righted itself.\n\n[[Soyuz 11]] ended in disaster in 1971 when an equalization valve, used to equalize air pressure during the Soyuz final descent, prematurely opened in the vacuum of space, killing the three crew members, who were not wearing [[spacesuits]].  Subsequent flights, from [[Soyuz 12]] to [[Soyuz 40]], utilized a two-man crew because the third seat had to be removed for the pressure suit controls.  The [[Soyuz-T]] version restored the third seat.\n\n==List of reentry capsules==\n{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}<!-- Gemini. Mercury. Voshkod. India's effort.

Girard was the author of nearly thirty books, with his writings spanning many academic domains. Although the reception of his work is different in each of these areas, there is a growing body of secondary literature on his work and his influence on disciplines such as [[literary criticism]], [[critical theory]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], [[psychology]], [[mythology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[cultural studies]], and [[philosophy]].\n\nGirard's main contribution to philosophy, and in turn to other disciplines, was in the field of epistemological and ethical systems of desire. Girard believed that human development occurs initially through a process of observational [[Mimesis|mimicry]], where the infant develops desire through a process of learning to copy adult behaviour, fundamentally linking acquisition of identity, knowledge and material wealth to the development of a desire to have something others possess. \n\nAll conflict, competition and rivalry therefore originate in [[#Mimetic desire|mimetic desire]] (mimetic rivalry), which eventually reaches destructive stages of conflict both between individuals and social groups that requires them to blame someone or something in order to diffuse conflict through the [[scapegoat mechanism]]. Unable to assume responsibility or engage in self-reflection to recognize their own part in the conflict, humans individually and cross-tribally unite, to diffuse conflict, by murdering the king or whoever appears to have the least support in the conflict, and then recognizing when the person has died how much less stress they have, and the unification leads to them eventually thinking of the deposed dead king as a god, i.e. [[deification]] or [[sanctification]].  Or, guilt is ascribed to an innocent third-party, whose murder permits the creation of a common unifying mythological underlay necessary for the foundation of human [[culture]]. \n\nFor Girard, religion and mythology were therefore necessary steps in human evolution to control the violence that arises from mimetic rivalry and unequal distribution of desirable things. Religion directed the scapegoat impulse on imaginary concepts, such as Satan or demons, the absence of which would see an increase in human conflict, according to Girard. His ideas ran sharply contrary to the post-modernism in vogue through most of his life, and his views of human nature were pessimistic in contrast with the mainstream currents of his time. Girard saw religion as an essential instrument of cohesion, believing that the primary purpose of sacred texts was to end the practice of human sacrifice through ritualistically surrogating for the behaviour triggered by scapegoat mechanism, adopting and expanding many of Nietzsche's ideas.  \n\nGirard was professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1957 to 1981, and subsequently at [[Stanford University]] where he was named special fellow of the [[Hoover Institution]], a conservative think-tank based at Stanford.\n\nFor his contributions, in 2005 Rene Girard was named as one of the 40 \"Les immortals\" members of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]].\n\n== Biography ==\nGirard was born in Avignon on 25 December 1923.{{Efn |{{lang|fr|No\u00ebl}}, his second name, is also French for \"Christmas\", the day on which he was born.}}  Between 1e studied [[medieval history]] at the [[\u00c9cole des Chartes]], Paris.  The subject of his thesis was \"Private life in Avignon in the second half of the fifteenth century\" (\"{{lang|fr|La vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 Avignon dans la seconde moiti\u00e9 du XVe si\u00e8cle}}\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">An excerpt from this thesis was reprinted in the Ren\u00e9 Girard issue of ''[[Les Cahiers de l'Herne]]'' (2008).</ref> {{Page needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1947, Girard went to [[Indiana University]] on a one-year fellowship. He was to spend most of his career in the United States. He received his [[PhD]] in 1950 and stayed at Indiana University until 1953. The subject of his PhD at Indiana University was \"American Opinion of France, 1940\u20131943\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Although his research was in history, he was also assigned to teach [[French literature]], the field in which he would first make his reputation as a literary critic by publishing influential essays on such authors as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Marcel Proust]]. \n\nGirard occupied positions at [[Duke University]] and [[Bryn Mawr College]] from 1953 to 1957, after which he moved to [[Johns Hopkins University]], Baltimore, where he became a full professor in 1961. In that year, he also published his first book: {{lang |fr|Mensonge romantique et v\u00e9rit\u00e9 romanesque}} (''Deceit, Desire and the Novel'', 1966). For several years, he moved back and forth between the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] and Johns Hopkins University. Books he published in this period include {{lang|fr|La Violence et le sacr\u00e9}} (1972; ''[[Violence and the Sacred]]'', 1977) and {{lang |fr|Des choses cach\u00e9es depuis la fondation du monde}} (1978; ''[[Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World]]'', 1987).\n\nIn 1981, Girard became Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization at [[Stanford University]], where he stayed until his retirement in 1995. During this period, he published {{lang |fr|Le Bouc \u00e9missaire}} (1982), {{lang|fr|La route antique des hommes pervers}} (1985), ''A Theatre of Envy: William Shakespeare'' (1991) and {{lang |fr|Quand ces choses commenceront ...}} (1994). \n\nIn 1985, he received his first honorary degree from the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands; several others followed. \n\nIn 1990, a group of scholars founded the Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COV&R) with a goal to \"explore, criticize, and develop the [[Mimesis|mimetic model]] of the relationship between violence and religion in the genesis and maintenance of culture.\"<ref>[http://www.uibk.ac.at/theol/cover/bulletin/xtexte/bulletin01-1.html#_1_1 'The rationale for and goals of \"The Bulletin of the Colloquium on Violence & Religion\"'] ''COV&R-Bulletin'' No. 1 (September 1991)</ref><ref>[http://www.uibk.ac.at/theol/cover/bulletin/xtexte/bulletin06-4.html \"Constitution and By-Laws of the Colloquium on Violence and Religion\"] ''COV&R-Bulletin'' No. 6 (March 1994)</ref> This organization organizes a yearly conference devoted to topics related to mimetic theory, [[scapegoating]], violence, and religion.

Beyond the \"uniqueness\" of individual works, he looked for their common structural properties, having observed that characters in great fiction evolved in a system of relationships otherwise common to the wider generality of novels. But there was a distinction to be made:\n\n{{Quote | Only the great writers succeed in painting these mechanisms faithfully, without falsifying them: we have here a system of relationships that paradoxically, or rather not paradoxically at all, has less variability the greater a writer is.{{Sfn | Girard | 1994 | p = 32}}}}\n\nSo there did indeed exist \"psychological laws\" as Proust calls them.<ref>For example in ''Time Regained'' ({{lang|fr|Le Temps retrouv\u00e9}}, volume 7 of ''Remembrance of Things Past''): \"It is the feeling for the general in the potential writer, which selects material suitable to a work of art because of its generality. He only pays attention to others, however dull and tiresome, because in repeating what their kind say like parrots, they are for that very reason prophetic birds, spokesmen of a psychological law.\" In French: \"...{{lang |fr|c'est le sentiment du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui dans l'\u00e9crivain futur choisit lui-m\u00eame ce qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et pourra entrer dans l'\u0153uvre d'art. Car il n'a \u00e9cout\u00e9 les autres que quand, si b\u00eates ou si fous qu'ils fussent, r\u00e9p\u00e9tant comme des perroquets ce que disent les gens de caract\u00e8re semblable, ils s'\u00e9taient faits par l\u00e0 m\u00eame les oiseaux proph\u00e8tes, les porte-paroles d'une loi psychologique}}.\"</ref> These laws and this system are the consequences of a fundamental reality grasped by the novelists, which Girard called '''mimetic desire'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, \"the [[Mimesis|mimetic]] character of desire.\" This is the content of his first book, ''Deceit, Desire and the Novel'' (1961). We borrow our desires from others. Far from being autonomous, our desire for a certain object is always provoked by the desire of another person\u2014the model\u2014for this same object. This means that the relationship between the subject and the object is not direct: there is always a triangular relationship of subject, model, and object. Through the object, one is drawn to the model, whom Girard calls the mediator: it is in fact the model who is sought. Girard calls desire \"metaphysical\" in the measure that, as soon as a desire is something more than a simple need or appetite, \"all desire is a desire to be\",{{Sfn | Girard | 1994 | p = 32}} it is an aspiration, the dream of a fullness attributed to the mediator.\n\nMediation is external when the mediator of the desire is socially beyond the reach of the subject or, for example, a fictional character, as in the case of [[Amadis de Gaula]] and [[Don Quixote]]. The [[hero]] lives a kind of folly that nonetheless remains optimistic. Mediation is internal when the mediator is at the same level as the subject. The mediator then transforms into a rival and an obstacle to the acquisition of the object, whose value increases as the rivalry grows. This is the universe of the novels of [[Stendhal]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], [[Proust]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], which are particularly studied in this book.\n\nThrough their characters, our own behaviour is displayed.  Everyone holds firmly to the illusion of the authenticity of one's own desires; the novelists implacably expose all the diversity of lies, dissimulations, maneuvers, and the snobbery of the Proustian heroes; these are all but \"tricks of desire\", which prevent one from facing the truth: envy and jealousy. These characters, desiring the being of the mediator, project upon him superhuman virtues while at the same time depreciating themselves, making him a god while making themselves slaves, in the measure that the mediator is an obstacle to them.  Some, pursuing this logic, come to seek the failures that are the signs of the proximity of the ideal to which they aspire. This can manifest as a heightened experience of the universal pseudo-[[Sadomasochism|masochism]] inherent in seeking the unattainable, which can, of course, turn into [[Sadomasochism|sadism]] should the actor play this part in reverse{{Citation needed|reason=How is seeking failure masochism? How do sadism and masochism relate to the article?|date=January 2013}}.\n\nThis fundamental focus on mimetic desire would be pursued by Girard throughout the rest of his career. The stress on imitation in humans was not a popular subject when Girard developed his theories,{{Citation needed|reason=Girard probably said this in an interview, but where?|date=January 2009}} but today there is independent support for his claims coming from empirical research in psychology and neuroscience (see below). Farneti (2013) also discusses the role of mimetic desire in intractable conflicts, using the case study of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and referencing Girard's theory. He posits that intensified conflict is a product of the imitative behaviors of Israelis and Palestinians, entitling them \"Siamese twins\".<ref>Roberto Farneti, ''Mimetic politics'' (Michigan State University Press 2015), pp. 34-38, 58-65, 69-71.</ref>\n\nThe idea that desire to possess endless material wealth was harmful to society was not new. From the New Testament verses about the love of money being the root of all evil, to Hegelian and Marxist critique that saw material wealth and capital as the mechanism of alienation of the human being both from their own humanity and their community, to Bertrand Russell's famous speech on accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950, desire has been understood as a destructive force in all of literature - with the theft of Helen by Paris frequent topic of discussion by Girard.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  What Girard contributed to this concept is the idea that what is desired fundamentally is not the object itself, but the ontological state of the subject which possesses it, where ''mimicry'' is the aim of the competition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  What Paris wanted, then, was not Helen, but to be a great king like Agamemnon.  A person who desires seeks to be like the subject he imitates, through the medium of object that is possessed by the person he immitates.  Girard writes: {{Quote |\"It is not difference that dominates the world, but the obliteration of difference by mimetic reciprocity, which itself, being truly universal, shows the relativism of perpetual difference to be an illusion.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Girard, Ren\u00e9, 1923-2015.|title=The one by whom scandal comes|isbn=978-1-61186-109-9|oclc=843010034|date=January 2014}}</ref>}} This was, and remains, a pessimistic view of human life, as it posits a paradox in the very act of seeking to unify and have peace, since the erasure of differences between people through mimicry is what creates conflict, not the differentiation itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n=== Fundamental anthropology<!--'Fundamental anthropology' redirects here--> ===\n{{See also|Mimetic double bind|Generative anthropology}}\nSince the [[Mimesis|mimetic]] rivalry that develops from the struggle for the possession of the objects is contagious, it leads to the threat of violence.  Girard himself says, \"If there is a normal order in societies, it must be the fruit of an anterior crisis.\"{{Sfn | Girard | 1994 | p = 29}}  Turning his interest towards the anthropological domain, Girard began to study anthropological literature and proposed his second great hypothesis: the [[scapegoat mechanism]], which is at the origin of archaic religion and which he sets forth in his second book ''Violence and the Sacred'' (1972), a work on '''fundamental anthropology'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.<ref>Thomas Ryba (ed.), ''Ren\u00e9 Girard and Creative Reconciliation'', Lexington Books, 2014, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIf two individuals desire the same thing, there will soon be a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At this stage of the crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but now they want to destroy the same enemy. So, a paroxysm of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually over the course of the repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nAlthough explorers and anthropologists have not been able to witness events similar to these, which go back to the earliest times, indirect evidence for them abounds, such as the universality of ritual sacrifice and the innumerable myths that have been collected from the most varied peoples. If Girard's theory is true, then we will find in myths the culpability of the victim-god, depictions of the selection of the victim, and his power to beget the order that governs the group. Girard found these elements in numerous myths, beginning with that of [[Oedipus]] which he analyzed in this and later books.  On this question he opposes [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]].{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nThe phrase \"[[scapegoat mechanism]]\" was not coined by Girard himself; it had been used earlier by [[Kenneth Burke]] in ''Permanence and Change'' (1935) and ''A Grammar of Motives'' (1940). However, Girard took this concept from Burke and developed it much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nIn ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), Girard develops the implications of this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion, which [[Durkheim]] had sensed.<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The elementary forms of the religious life, a study in religious sociology\n | last = Durkheim | first = Emile\n | publisher = G. Allen & Unwin | location = London\n | url = https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durkrich\n | date = 1915 | access-date = 2014-05-19\n}}</ref> The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.\n\nAccording to Girard, just as the theory of [[natural selection]] of species is the rational principle that explains the immense diversity of forms of life, the victimization process is the rational principle that explains the origin of the infinite diversity of cultural forms. The analogy with [[Charles Darwin]] also extends to the scientific status of the theory, as each of these presents itself as a hypothesis that is not capable of being proven experimentally, given the extreme amounts of time necessary for the production of the phenomena in question, but which imposes itself by its great explanatory power.\n\n=== Origin of language ===\nAccording to Girard, the [[origin of language]] is also related to scapegoating. After the first victim, after the murder of the first scapegoat, there were the first prohibitions and rituals, but these came into being before representation and  language, hence before culture. And that means that \"people\" (perhaps not human beings) \"will not start fighting again.\"<ref name=\"MuellerInterview1996\" /> Girard says:\n{{Quote | If mimetic disruption comes back, our instinct will tell us to do again what the sacred has done to save us, which is to kill the scapegoat.  Therefore it would be the force of substitution of immolating another victim instead of the first. But the relationship of this process with representation is not one that can be defined in a clear-cut way. This process would be one that moves towards representation of the sacred, towards definition of the ritual as ritual and prohibition as prohibition. But this process would already begin prior the representation, you see, because it is directly produced by the experience of the misunderstood scapegoat.<ref name=\"MuellerInterview1996\" />}}\n\nAccording to Girard, the substitution of an immolated victim for the first, is \"the very first symbolic sign created by the hominids.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Girard|2004|p=157}}.  {{lang|fr|\"premier signe symbolique jamais invent\u00e9 par les hominid\u00e9s\"}}</ref>  Girard also says this is the first time that one thing represents another thing, standing in the place of this (absent) one. This substitution is the beginning of [[Mental representation|representation and language]], but also the beginning of sacrifice and ritual. The genesis of language and ritual is very slow and we must imagine that there are also kinds of rituals among the animals: \"It is the originary scapegoating which prolongs itself in a process which can be infinitely long in moving from, how should I say, from instinctive ritualization, instinctive prohibition, instinctive separation of the antagonists, which you already find to a certain extent in animals, towards representation.\"<ref name = \"MuellerInterview1996\" />\n\nUnlike [[Eric Gans]], Girard does not think that there is an original scene during which there is \"a sudden shift from non-representation to representation,\"<ref name=\"MuellerInterview1996\">{{Citation\n | title = Interview with Ren\u00e9 Girard\n | last = M\u00fcller | first = Markus\n | journal = Anthropoetics\n | volume = II | number = 1\n | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0201/interv.htm\n | date = June 1996 | accessdate = November 1, 2008\n}}.</ref> or a sudden shift from animality to humanity. According to the French sociologist Camille Tarot, it is hard to understand how the process of representation (symbolicity, language...) actually occurs and he has called this a ''black box'' in Girard's theory.<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Le symbolique et le sacr\u00e9\n | trans-title = The symbolic & the sacred\n | last = Tarot | first = Camille\n | publisher = {{lang|fr|La D\u00e9couverte}} | place = Paris\n | year = 2008 | page = 860\n | language = fr\n}}.</ref>\n\nGirard also says:\n{{Quote | One great characteristic of man is what they [the authors of the modern theory of evolution] call neoteny, the fact that the human infant is born premature, with an open skull, no hair and a total inability to fend for himself. To keep it alive, therefore, there must be some form of cultural protection, because in the world of mammals, such infants would not survive, they would be destroyed.  Therefore there is a reason to believe that in the later stages of human evolution, culture and nature are in constant interaction. The first stages of this interaction must occur prior to language, but they must include forms of sacrifice and prohibition that create a space of non-violence around the mother and the children which make it possible to reach still higher stages of human development. You can postulate as many such stages as are needed. Thus, you can have a transition between ethology and anthropology which removes, I think, all philosophical postulates. The discontinuities would never be of such a nature as to demand some kind of sudden intellectual illumination.<ref name=\"MuellerInterview1996\" />}}\n\n=== Judeo-Christian scriptures ===\n==== Biblical text as a science of man ====\nIn ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'', Girard discusses for the first time Christianity and the [[Bible]]. The [[Gospel]]s ostensibly present themselves as a typical mythical account, with a victim-god lynched by a unanimous crowd, an event that is then commemorated by Christians through ritual sacrifice \u2014 a material re-presentation in this case \u2014 in the [[Eucharist]].  The parallel is perfect except for one detail: the truth of the innocence of the victim is proclaimed by the text and the writer. The mythical account is usually built on the lie of the guilt of the victim in as much as it is an account of the event seen from the viewpoint of the anonymous lynchers.  This ignorance is indispensable to the efficacy of the sacrificial violence.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nThe evangelical \"good news\" clearly affirms the innocence of the victim, thus becoming, by attacking ignorance, the germ of the destruction of the sacrificial order on which rests the equilibrium of societies.  Already the [[Old Testament]] shows this turning inside-out of the mythic accounts with regard to the innocence of the victims ([[Abel]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]\u2026), and the Hebrews were conscious of the uniqueness of their religious tradition. With the Gospels, it is with full clarity that are unveiled these \"things hidden since the foundation of the world\" (Matthew 13:35), the foundation of social order on murder, described in all its repulsive ugliness in the account of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nThis revelation is even clearer because the text is a work on desire and violence, from the serpent setting alight the desire of [[Eve]] in paradise to the prodigious strength of the mimetism that brings about the denial of [[Saint Peter|Peter]] during the Passion (Mark 14: 66\u201372; Luke 22:54\u201362). Girard reinterprets certain biblical expressions in light of his theories; for instance, he sees \"scandal\" (''[[Stumbling block|skandalon]]'', literally, a \"snare\", or an \"impediment placed in the way and causing one to stumble or fall\"<ref>{{Citation\n | title = The New Testament Greek Lexicon\n | publisher = Study light\n | contribution = Skandalon\n | contribution-url = http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=4625\n}}.</ref>) as signifying mimetic rivalry, for example Peter's denial of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Are the Gospels Mythical?\n | last = Girard | first = Ren\u00e9\n | journal = First Things\n | url = http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=3856\n | date = April 1996\n}}.</ref> No one escapes responsibility, neither the envious nor the envied: \"Woe to the man through whom scandal comes\" (Matthew 18:7).{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\n==== Christian society ====\nThe evangelical revelation contains the truth on the violence, available for two thousand years, Girard tells us. Has it put an end to the sacrificial order based on violence in the society that has claimed the gospel text as its own religious text? No, he replies, since in order for a truth to have an impact it must find a receptive listener, and people do not change that quickly. The gospel text has instead acted as a ferment that brings about the decomposition of the sacrificial order. While medieval Europe showed the face of a sacrificial society that still knew very well how to despise and ignore its victims, nonetheless the efficacy of sacrificial violence has never stopped decreasing, in the measure that ignorance receded. Here Girard sees the principle of the uniqueness and of the transformations of the Western society whose destiny today is one with that of human society as a whole.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nDoes the retreat of the sacrificial order mean less violence?  Not at all; rather, it deprives modern societies of most of the capacity of sacrificial violence to establish temporary order.  The \"innocence\" of the time of the ignorance is no more. On the other hand, Christianity, following the example of [[Judaism]], has desacralized the world, making possible a utilitarian relationship with nature.  Increasingly threatened by the resurgence of mimetic crises on a grand scale, the contemporary world is on one hand more quickly caught up by its guilt, and on the other hand has developed such a great technical power of destruction that it is condemned to both more and more responsibility and less and less innocence. So, for example, while empathy for victims manifests progress in the moral conscience of society, it nonetheless also takes the form of a competition among victims that threatens an escalation of violence.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\n== Influence ==\n=== Psychology and neuroscience ===\nJean-Michel Oughourlian in his book ''A mime named desire'' (''Un mime nomm\u00e9 d\u00e9sir'' - Grasset 1982) has used Girard's theories in psychopathology. Hysteria and obsession are explained through mimetic rivalry and the priority of desire.\n\nGirard's work is also attracting increasing interest from empirical researchers investigating human [[imitation]] (among them [[Andrew Meltzoff]] and [[Vittorio Gallese]]). Recently, empirical studies into the mechanism of desire have suggested some intriguing correlations with Girard's theory on the subject. For instance, clinical psychologist Scott R. Garrels wrote:\n{{Quote | What makes Girard's insights so remarkable is that he not only discovered and developed the primordial role of psychological mimesis (...) during a time when imitation was quite out of fashion, but he did so through investigation in literature, cultural anthropology, history, and ultimately returning to religious texts for further evidence of mimetic phenomena. The parallels between Girard's insights and the only recent conclusions made by empirical researchers concerning imitation (in both development and the evolution of species) are extraordinary (...).<ref>{{Citation\n |title       = Imitation, Mirror Neurons, & Mimetic Desire: Convergent Support for the Work of Rene Girard\n |last        = Garrels\n |first       = Scott R\n |page        = 29\n |url         = http://girardianlectionary.net/covr2004/garrelspaper.pdf\n |date        = 1 May 2004\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074007/http://girardianlectionary.net/covr2004/garrelspaper.pdf\n |archivedate = 27 March 2009\n}} (an earlier version of the paper that appeared as {{Citation\n |title       = Imitation, Mirror Neurons and Mimetic Desire: Convergence between the Mimetic Theory of Ren\u00e9 Girard and Empirical Research on Imitation\n |last        = Garrels\n |first       = Scott R\n |journal     = Contagion: Journal of Violence, Mimesis, and Culture\n |year        = 2006\n |volume      = 12-13\n |pages       = 47\u201386\n |url         = http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/cont/pdf/Cont.%2012-13%20Garrels%2047-86.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074008/http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/cont/pdf/Cont.%2012-13%20Garrels%2047-86.pdf\n |archivedate = 2009-03-27\n}}).</ref>}}\n\n===Economics and globalization===\nThe mimetic theory has also been applied in the study of economics, most notably in {{lang|fr|La violence de la monnaie}} (1982) by [[Michel Aglietta]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Orl\u00e9an]]. Orl\u00e9an was also a contributor to the volume ''Ren\u00e9 Girard'' in ''[[Les cahiers de l'Herne]]'' (\"{{lang |fr|Pour une approche girardienne de l'homo oeconomicus}}\").<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Ren\u00e9 Girard\n | number = 89 | pages = 261\u201365\n | series = Cahier de L'Herne\n}}.</ref> According to the philosopher of technology [[Andrew Feenberg]]:\n{{Quote | In {{lang|fr|La violence de la monnaie}}, Aglietta and Orl\u00e9an follow Girard in suggesting that the basic relation of exchange can be interpreted as a conflict of 'doubles', each mediating the desire of the Other.

According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the [[gift economy]], as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: \"Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him to do the same for you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift.

Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by \"economic rationality.\" This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.\n\n===Literature===\nGirard's influence extends beyond philosophy and social science, and includes the literary realm. A prominent example of a fiction writer influenced by Girard is [[J. M. Coetzee]], winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. Critics have noted that mimetic desire and scapegoating are recurring themes in Coetzee's novels ''Elizabeth Costello'' and ''Disgrace.'' In the latter work, the book's protagonist also gives a speech about the history of scapegoating with noticeable similarities to Girard's view of the same subject. Coetzee has also frequently cited Girard in his non-fiction essays, on subjects ranging from advertising to the Russian writer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]].<ref>Andy Lamey, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 \"Sympathy and Scapegoating in J.

For Girard's influence on Coetzee, see pages 181-5.</ref>\n\n===Theology===\nTheologians who describe themselves as indebted to Girard include [[James Alison]] (who focuses on mimetic desire's implications for the doctrine of [[original sin]]), [[Raymund Schwager]] (who builds a dramatic narrative around both the scapegoat mechanism and the theo-drama of fellow Swiss theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]), and Bishop Robert Barron (who has remarked that Girard will be appreciated as a 21st-Century [[Church Father]] in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSzF2OG2ejI |title=Bishop Barron on Rene Girard |first=Robert |last=Barron |date=January 21, 2016 |website=YouTube |access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref>)\n\n== Criticism ==\n=== Originality ===\nSome critics have pointed out that while Girard may be the first to have suggested that ''all'' desire is mimetic, he is by no means the first to have noticed that ''some'' desire is mimetic \u2013 Gabriel Tarde's book ''Les lois de l'imitation'' (''The Laws of Imitation'') appeared in 1890. Building on Tarde, crowd psychology, Nietzsche, and more generally on a modernist tradition of the \"mimetic unconscious\" that had hypnosis as its via regia, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that for the modernists not only desire but all affects turn out to be contagious and mimetic.<ref>Nidesh Lawtoo, ''The Phantom of the Ego: Modernism and the Mimetic Unconscious'', East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2013.</ref> Ren\u00e9 Pommier<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard, ''Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare'', Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 42</ref> mentions [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], a seventeenth-century thinker who already wrote that \"Nothing is so infectious as example\" and that \"There are some who never would have loved if they never had heard it spoken of.\"<ref>La Rochefoucauld, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/9105/9105-h/9105-h.htm \"Maxims,\"] maxims 230, 136.</ref>\n\nSt\u00e9phane Vinolo sees [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] as important precursors.

Like Hobbes, he refers to the increase of mimetic desire coming along with equality.\"<ref>Wolfgang Palaver: {{lang|fr|De la violence: une approche mim\u00e9tique}} Traduit de l'anglais par Paul Dumouchel.

What is more, both Girard and Lacan read these myths through the lens of structural anthropology so it is not surprising that their intellectual systems came to resemble one another so strongly. Meloni writes that Girard and Lacan were \"moved by similar preoccupations and are fascinated by and attracted to the same kind of issues: the constituent character of the other in the structure of desire, the role of jealousy and rivalry in the construction of the social bond, the proliferation of triangles within apparently dual relations, doubles and mirrors, imitation and the Imaginary, and the crisis of modern society within which the 'rite of Oedipus' is situated.\"\n\nAt times, Girard acknowledges his indebtedness to such precursors, including Tocqueville.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard. 1965. ''Deceit, Desire and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure'' Translated by Y. Freccero, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1965 p. 120</ref> At other times, however, Girard makes stronger claims to originality, as when he says that mimetic rivalry \"is responsible for the frequency and intensity of human conflicts, but strangely, no one ever speaks of it.\"<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard. 2001. Celui par qui le scandale arrive: Entretiens avec Maria Stella Barberi. Paris: Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer. p. 19: \"D\u00e8s que nous d\u00e9sirons ce que d\u00e9sire un mod\u00e8le assez proche de nous dans le temps et dans l'espace, pour que l'objet convoit\u00e9 par lui passe \u00e0 notre port\u00e9e, nous nous effor\u00e7ons de lui enlever cet objet | et la rivalit\u00e9 entre lui et nous est in\u00e9vitable.  C'est la rivalit\u00e9 mim\u00e9tique. Elle peut atteindre un niveau d'intensit\u00e9 extraordinaire. Elle est responsable de la fr\u00e9quence et de l'intensit\u00e9 des conflits humains, mais chose \u00e9trange, personne ne parle jamais d'elle.\"</ref>\n\n=== Use of evidence ===\nGirard has presented his view as being scientifically grounded: \"Our theory should be approached, then, as one approaches any scientific hypothesis.\"<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard, ''Violence and the Sacred'', translated by Patrick Gregory, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977, p. 316.</ref> Ren\u00e9 Pommier has written a book about Girard with the ironic title ''Girard Ablaze Rather Than Enlightened'' in which he asserts that Girard's readings of myths and Bible stories\u2014the basis of some of his most important claims\u2014are often tendentious. Girard notes, for example, that the disciples actively turn against Jesus.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard, ''Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1987, p. 167.</ref> Since Peter warms himself by a fire, and fires always create community, and communities breed mimetic desire, this means that Peter becomes actively hostile to Jesus, seeking his death.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, pp. 98-102.</ref> According to Pommier, Girard claims that the Gospels present the Crucifixion as a purely human affair, with no indication of Christ dying for the sins of mankind, a claim contradicted by [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] 10:45, [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]] 20:28.<ref name=\"Ren\u00e9 Pommier 2010, pp. 115-16\">Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, pp. 115-16.</ref>\n\nThe same goes for readings of literary texts, says Pommier. For example, [[Moli\u00e8re]]'s Don Juan only pursues ''one'' love object for mediated reasons,<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 25.</ref> not ''all'' of them, as Girard claims.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard. 1965. ''Deceit, Desire and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure'' Translated by Y. Freccero, The Johns Hopkins University Press,Baltimore, 1965 p. 51</ref> Or again, [[Sancho Panza]] wants an island not because he is catching the bug of romanticism from [[Don Quixote]], but because he has been promised one.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 27.</ref> And Pavel Pavlovitch, in [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''Eternal Husband'', has been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival, so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavel's desire.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 45.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, a number of scholars have suggested that Girard's writings are metaphysics rather than science.  Theorist of history [[Hayden White]] did so in an article titled \"Ethnological 'Lie' and Mystical 'Truth'\";<ref>Hayden White, \"Ethnological 'Lie' and Mythical 'Truth'\", ''Diacritics'' 8 (1978): 2-9, p. 7.</ref> Belgian anthropologist [[Luc de Heusch]] made a similar claim in his piece \"{{lang|fr|L'Evangile selon Saint-Girard}}\" (\"The Gospel according to Saint Girard\");<ref>Luc de Heusch: \"L'Evangile selon Saint-Girard\" Le Monde, 25 June 1982, p. 19.</ref> and Jean Greisch sees Girard's thought as more or less a kind of [[Gnosis]].<ref>Jean Greisch  \"{{lang|fr|Une anthropologie fondamentale du rite: Ren\u00e9 Girard.|italic=no}}\" in  {{lang|fr|Le rite. Philosophie}} {{lang|fr|Institut catholique de Paris, pr\u00e9sentation de Jean Greisch.|italic=no}} Paris, Beauchesne, 1981.</ref>\n\n=== Non-mimetic desires ===\nRen\u00e9 Pommier has pointed out a number of problems with the Girardian claim that all desire is mimetic.  First, it is very hard to explain the existence of taboo desires, such as homosexuality in repressive societies, on that basis.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 38.</ref> In Girard's defence on the other hand, Jean-Michel Oughourlian exemplifies the situation by noting that \"one homosexual admitted to me that he just wanted to be somebody else.\"\n\nSecond, every situation presents large numbers of potential mediators, which means that the individual has to make a choice among them; either authentic choice is possible, then, or else the theory leads to a regress.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, pp. 33-34.</ref> Third, Girard leaves no room for innovation: Surely somebody has to be the first to desire a new object, even if everyone else follows that trend-setter.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 18.</ref>\n\nIt is not clear that the first objection really provides a challenge to Girard's theory, as even in repressive societies men are still desired (albeit by women). However, such a response leaves unexplained why homosexuals would imitate the desires of heterosexual members of the opposite sex.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard's philosophy of romance is compared with [[Plato|Plato\u2019s]], [[Iain King|Iain King's]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s]] in [http://kindnesslovejoy.com/when-romance-and-philosophy-meet/ When Romance and Philosophy Meet (link to blog)] retrieved 2013-12-02.</ref> One might also argue that the last objection ignores the influence of an original sin from which all others follow, which Girard clearly affirms. However, original sin, according to Girard's interpretation, explains only our propensity to imitate, not the specific content of our imitated desires.<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/#SH5d Girard, Ren\u00e9 [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&#93;]. Iep.utm.edu. Retrieved on 2013-10-23.</ref> Thus, the doctrine of original sin does not solve the problem of how the original model first acquires the desire that is subsequently imitated by others.\n\n=== Beneficial imitation ===\nIn the early part of Girard's career, there seemed no place for beneficial imitation. Jean-Michel Oughourlian objected that \"imitation can be totally peaceful and beneficial; I don't believe that I am the other, I don't want to take  his place. \u2026This imitation can lead me to become sensitive to social and political problems.\"<ref>Jean-Michel Oughourlian: ''Gen\u00e8se du d\u00e9sir''. Paris: Carnets Nord, 2007, {{ISBN|978-2-35536-003-9}}. The French sentence goes: \"L'imitation peut alors demeurer enti\u00e8rement paisible et b\u00e9n\u00e9fique; je ne me prends pas pour l'autre, je ne veux pas prendre sa place [\u2026] Cette imitation [\u2026] me conduira peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 me sensibiliser aux probl\u00e8mes sociaux et politiques\u2026</ref> Rebecca Adams argued that because Girard's theories fixated on violence, he was creating a \"scapegoat\" himself with his own theory: the scapegoat of positive mimesis.  Adams proposed a reassessment of Girard's theory that includes an account of loving mimesis or, as she preferred to call it, creative mimesis.<ref>{{Cite web\n |title       = Loving Mimesis and Girard's \"Scapegoat of the Text\": A Creative Reassessment of Mimetic Desire\n |author      = Rebecca Adams\n |year        = 2000\n |publisher   = Pandora Press US\n |url         = http://web.ustpaul.uottawa.ca/covr2006/Document/RebeccaGirard.pdf\n |access-date = 2008-07-09\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074008/http://web.ustpaul.uottawa.ca/covr2006/Document/RebeccaGirard.pdf\n |archivedate = 2009-03-27\n}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Girard has made room for positive imitation.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard, The Girard Reader, Trans. Yvonne Freccero, Ed. James G. Williams, New York: Crossroad Herder, 1996, pp. 63\u201364, 269.</ref> But as Adams implies, it is not clear how the revised theory accords with earlier claims about the origin of culture.  If beneficial imitation is possible, then it is no longer necessary for cultures to be born by means of scapegoating; they could just as well be born through healthy emulation. Nidesh Lawtoo further develops the healthy side of mimetic contagion by drawing on a Nietzschean philosophical tradition that privileges \"laughter\" and other gay forms of \"sovereign communication\" in the formation of \"community.\"<ref>Nidesh Lawtoo. ''The Phantom of the Ego: Modernism and the Mimetic Unconscious''. East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2007, pp. 284-304</ref>\n\n=== Anthropology ===\nVarious anthropologists have contested Girard's claims. Elizabeth Traube, for example, reminds us that there are other ways of making sense of the data that Girard borrows from Evans-Pritchard and company\u2014ways that are more consistent with the practices of the given culture. By applying a one-size-fits-all approach, Girard \"loses \u2026 the ability to tell us anything about cultural products themselves, for the simple reason that he has annihilated the cultures which produced them.\"<ref>Elizabeth Traube, \"Incest and Mythology: Anthropological and Girardian Perspectives, \" The Berkshire Review 14 (1979): 37\u201354, pp. 49\u201350)</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nOne of the main sources of criticism of Girard's work comes from intellectuals who claim that his comparison of Judeo-Christian texts vis-\u00e0-vis other religions leaves something to be desired.<ref>E.g. see the criticisms in ''Violence and Truth: On the Work of Ren\u00e9 Girard'', Paul Dumouchel ed., Stanford University Press, 1988</ref> There are also those who find the interpretation of the Christ event\u2014as a purely human event, having nothing to do with redemption from sin\u2014an unconvincing one, given what the Gospels themselves say.<ref name = \"Ren\u00e9 Pommier 2010, pp. 115-16\" /> Yet, [[Roger Scruton]] notes, Girard's account has a [[Christology|divine Jesus]]: \"that Jesus was the first scapegoat to understand the need for his death and to forgive those who inflicted it \u2026  Girard argues, Jesus gave the best evidence \u2026 of his divine nature.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The Soul of the World\n | last = Scruton | first = Roger\n | author-link= Roger Scruton \n | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, NJ\n | page = 20\n | date = 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n== Honours and awards ==\n* Honorary degrees at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (the Netherlands, 1985), UFSIA in Antwerp (Belgium, 1995), the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova (Italy, 2001, honorary degree in \"Arts\"),<ref>{{lang|it|Universit\u00e0 degli Studie di Padova}}: [http://www.unipd.it/en/area/area-51.htm Honoris causa degrees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429013257/http://www.unipd.it/en/area/area-51.htm |date=2007-04-29 }}</ref> the faculty of theology at the University of Innsbruck (Austria), the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (Canada, 2004),<ref>Marie-Claude Bourdon: [http://www.iforum.umontreal.ca/Forum/ArchivesForum/2003-2004/040419/article3470.htm {{lang|fr|La violence et le sacr\u00e9: L'Universit\u00e9 remet un doctorat honoris causa au penseur Ren\u00e9 Girard}}] iForum vol. 38 num. 28 (19 April 2004)</ref> and the University of St Andrews (UK, 2008)<ref>University of St Andrews: [http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2008/title,22097,en.php Honorary degrees - June 2008].</ref>\n* The [[Prix M\u00e9dicis]] essai for ''Shakespeare, les feux de l'envie'' (''A Theatre of Envy: William Shakespeare'', 1991)\n* The prix Aujourd'hui for ''Les origines de la culture'' (2004)\n* [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Fellow]] (1959 and 1966)<ref>[http://www.gf.org/gfellow.html John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation: Fellows page: G] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214123114/http://www.gf.org/gfellow.html |date=2008-02-14 }}</ref>\n* Election to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] (2005)\n* Awarded the [[Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize]] by the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] (2006)<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = Wissenschaft und christlicher Glaube\n | last = Girard | first = Ren\u00e9\n | year = 2007\n | publisher = Mohr Siebeck | location = T\u00fcbingen\n | page = 110\n | isbn = 978-3-16-149266-2\n}}</ref>\n* Awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic, Commander by Number, by the Spanish head of state, H.M.

Girard was the author of nearly thirty books, with his writings spanning many academic domains. Although the reception of his work is different in each of these areas, there is a growing body of secondary literature on his work and his influence on disciplines such as [[literary criticism]], [[critical theory]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], [[psychology]], [[mythology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[cultural studies]], and [[philosophy]].\n\nGirard's main contribution to philosophy, and in turn to other disciplines, was in the field of epistemological and ethical systems of desire. Girard believed that human development occurs initially through a process of observational [[Mimesis|mimicry]], where the infant develops desire through a process of learning to copy adult behaviour, fundamentally linking acquisition of identity, knowledge and material wealth to the development of a desire to have something others possess. \n\nAll conflict, competition and rivalry therefore originate in [[#Mimetic desire|mimetic desire]] (mimetic rivalry), which eventually reaches destructive stages of conflict both between individuals and social groups that requires them to blame someone or something in order to diffuse conflict through the [[scapegoat mechanism]]. Unable to assume responsibility or engage in self-reflection to recognize their own part in the conflict, humans individually and cross-tribally unite, to diffuse conflict, by murdering the king or whoever appears to have the least support in the conflict, and then recognizing when the person has died how much less stress they have, and the unification leads to them eventually thinking of the deposed dead king as a god, i.e. [[deification]] or [[sanctification]].  Or, guilt is ascribed to an innocent third-party, whose murder permits the creation of a common unifying mythological underlay necessary for the foundation of human [[culture]]. \n\nFor Girard, religion and mythology were therefore necessary steps in human evolution to control the violence that arises from mimetic rivalry and unequal distribution of desirable things. Religion directed the scapegoat impulse on imaginary concepts, such as Satan or demons, the absence of which would see an increase in human conflict, according to Girard. His ideas ran sharply contrary to the post-modernism in vogue through most of his life, and his views of human nature were pessimistic in contrast with the mainstream currents of his time. Girard saw religion as an essential instrument of cohesion, believing that the primary purpose of sacred texts was to end the practice of human sacrifice through ritualistically surrogating for the behaviour triggered by scapegoat mechanism, adopting and expanding many of Nietzsche's ideas.  \n\nGirard was professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1957 to 1981, and subsequently at [[Stanford University]] where he was named special fellow of the [[Hoover Institution]], a conservative think-tank based at Stanford.\n\nFor his contributions, in 2005 Rene Girard was named as one of the 40 \"Les immortals\" members of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]].\n\n== Biography ==\nGirard was born in Avignon on 25 December 1923.{{Efn |{{lang|fr|No\u00ebl}}, his second name, is also French for \"Christmas\", the day on which he was born.}}  Between 1e studied [[medieval history]] at the [[\u00c9cole des Chartes]], Paris.  The subject of his thesis was \"Private life in Avignon in the second half of the fifteenth century\" (\"{{lang|fr|La vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 Avignon dans la seconde moiti\u00e9 du XVe si\u00e8cle}}\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">An excerpt from this thesis was reprinted in the Ren\u00e9 Girard issue of ''[[Les Cahiers de l'Herne]]'' (2008).</ref> {{Page needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1947, Girard went to [[Indiana University]] on a one-year fellowship. He was to spend most of his career in the United States. He received his [[PhD]] in 1950 and stayed at Indiana University until 1953. The subject of his PhD at Indiana University was \"American Opinion of France, 1940\u20131943\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Although his research was in history, he was also assigned to teach [[French literature]], the field in which he would first make his reputation as a literary critic by publishing influential essays on such authors as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Marcel Proust]]. \n\nGirard occupied positions at [[Duke University]] and [[Bryn Mawr College]] from 1953 to 1957, after which he moved to [[Johns Hopkins University]], Baltimore, where he became a full professor in 1961. In that year, he also published his first book: {{lang |fr|Mensonge romantique et v\u00e9rit\u00e9 romanesque}} (''Deceit, Desire and the Novel'', 1966). For several years, he moved back and forth between the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] and Johns Hopkins University. Books he published in this period include {{lang|fr|La Violence et le sacr\u00e9}} (1972; ''[[Violence and the Sacred]]'', 1977) and {{lang |fr|Des choses cach\u00e9es depuis la fondation du monde}} (1978; ''[[Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World]]'', 1987).\n\nIn 1981, Girard became Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization at [[Stanford University]], where he stayed until his retirement in 1995. During this period, he published {{lang |fr|Le Bouc \u00e9missaire}} (1982), {{lang|fr|La route antique des hommes pervers}} (1985), ''A Theatre of Envy: William Shakespeare'' (1991) and {{lang |fr|Quand ces choses commenceront ...}} (1994). \n\nIn 1985, he received his first honorary degree from the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands; several others followed. \n\nIn 1990, a group of scholars founded the Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COV&R) with a goal to \"explore, criticize, and develop the [[Mimesis|mimetic model]] of the relationship between violence and religion in the genesis and maintenance of culture.\"<ref>[http://www.uibk.ac.at/theol/cover/bulletin/xtexte/bulletin01-1.html#_1_1 'The rationale for and goals of \"The Bulletin of the Colloquium on Violence & Religion\"'] ''COV&R-Bulletin'' No. 1 (September 1991)</ref><ref>[http://www.uibk.ac.at/theol/cover/bulletin/xtexte/bulletin06-4.html \"Constitution and By-Laws of the Colloquium on Violence and Religion\"] ''COV&R-Bulletin'' No. 6 (March 1994)</ref> This organization organizes a yearly conference devoted to topics related to mimetic theory, [[scapegoating]], violence, and religion.

Beyond the \"uniqueness\" of individual works, he looked for their common structural properties, having observed that characters in great fiction evolved in a system of relationships otherwise common to the wider generality of novels. But there was a distinction to be made:\n\n{{Quote | Only the great writers succeed in painting these mechanisms faithfully, without falsifying them: we have here a system of relationships that paradoxically, or rather not paradoxically at all, has less variability the greater a writer is.{{Sfn | Girard | 1994 | p = 32}}}}\n\nSo there did indeed exist \"psychological laws\" as Proust calls them.<ref>For example in ''Time Regained'' ({{lang|fr|Le Temps retrouv\u00e9}}, volume 7 of ''Remembrance of Things Past''): \"It is the feeling for the general in the potential writer, which selects material suitable to a work of art because of its generality. He only pays attention to others, however dull and tiresome, because in repeating what their kind say like parrots, they are for that very reason prophetic birds, spokesmen of a psychological law.\" In French: \"...{{lang |fr|c'est le sentiment du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui dans l'\u00e9crivain futur choisit lui-m\u00eame ce qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et pourra entrer dans l'\u0153uvre d'art. Car il n'a \u00e9cout\u00e9 les autres que quand, si b\u00eates ou si fous qu'ils fussent, r\u00e9p\u00e9tant comme des perroquets ce que disent les gens de caract\u00e8re semblable, ils s'\u00e9taient faits par l\u00e0 m\u00eame les oiseaux proph\u00e8tes, les porte-paroles d'une loi psychologique}}.\"</ref> These laws and this system are the consequences of a fundamental reality grasped by the novelists, which Girard called '''mimetic desire'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, \"the [[Mimesis|mimetic]] character of desire.\" This is the content of his first book, ''Deceit, Desire and the Novel'' (1961). We borrow our desires from others. Far from being autonomous, our desire for a certain object is always provoked by the desire of another person\u2014the model\u2014for this same object. This means that the relationship between the subject and the object is not direct: there is always a triangular relationship of subject, model, and object. Through the object, one is drawn to the model, whom Girard calls the mediator: it is in fact the model who is sought. Girard calls desire \"metaphysical\" in the measure that, as soon as a desire is something more than a simple need or appetite, \"all desire is a desire to be\",{{Sfn | Girard | 1994 | p = 32}} it is an aspiration, the dream of a fullness attributed to the mediator.\n\nMediation is external when the mediator of the desire is socially beyond the reach of the subject or, for example, a fictional character, as in the case of [[Amadis de Gaula]] and [[Don Quixote]]. The [[hero]] lives a kind of folly that nonetheless remains optimistic. Mediation is internal when the mediator is at the same level as the subject. The mediator then transforms into a rival and an obstacle to the acquisition of the object, whose value increases as the rivalry grows. This is the universe of the novels of [[Stendhal]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], [[Proust]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], which are particularly studied in this book.\n\nThrough their characters, our own behaviour is displayed.  Everyone holds firmly to the illusion of the authenticity of one's own desires; the novelists implacably expose all the diversity of lies, dissimulations, maneuvers, and the snobbery of the Proustian heroes; these are all but \"tricks of desire\", which prevent one from facing the truth: envy and jealousy. These characters, desiring the being of the mediator, project upon him superhuman virtues while at the same time depreciating themselves, making him a god while making themselves slaves, in the measure that the mediator is an obstacle to them.  Some, pursuing this logic, come to seek the failures that are the signs of the proximity of the ideal to which they aspire. This can manifest as a heightened experience of the universal pseudo-[[Sadomasochism|masochism]] inherent in seeking the unattainable, which can, of course, turn into [[Sadomasochism|sadism]] should the actor play this part in reverse{{Citation needed|reason=How is seeking failure masochism? How do sadism and masochism relate to the article?|date=January 2013}}.\n\nThis fundamental focus on mimetic desire would be pursued by Girard throughout the rest of his career. The stress on imitation in humans was not a popular subject when Girard developed his theories,{{Citation needed|reason=Girard probably said this in an interview, but where?|date=January 2009}} but today there is independent support for his claims coming from empirical research in psychology and neuroscience (see below). Farneti (2013) also discusses the role of mimetic desire in intractable conflicts, using the case study of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and referencing Girard's theory. He posits that intensified conflict is a product of the imitative behaviors of Israelis and Palestinians, entitling them \"Siamese twins\".<ref>Roberto Farneti, ''Mimetic politics'' (Michigan State University Press 2015), pp. 34-38, 58-65, 69-71.</ref>\n\nThe idea that desire to possess endless material wealth was harmful to society was not new. From the New Testament verses about the love of money being the root of all evil, to Hegelian and Marxist critique that saw material wealth and capital as the mechanism of alienation of the human being both from their own humanity and their community, to Bertrand Russell's famous speech on accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950, desire has been understood as a destructive force in all of literature - with the theft of Helen by Paris frequent topic of discussion by Girard.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  What Girard contributed to this concept is the idea that what is desired fundamentally is not the object itself, but the ontological state of the subject which possesses it, where ''mimicry'' is the aim of the competition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  What Paris wanted, then, was not Helen, but to be a great king like Agamemnon.  A person who desires seeks to be like the subject he imitates, through the medium of object that is possessed by the person he immitates.  Girard writes: {{Quote |\"It is not difference that dominates the world, but the obliteration of difference by mimetic reciprocity, which itself, being truly universal, shows the relativism of perpetual difference to be an illusion.}}.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Girard, Ren\u00e9, 1923-2015.|title=The one by whom scandal comes|isbn=978-1-61186-109-9|oclc=843010034|date=January 2014}}</ref> This was, and remains, a pessimistic view of human life, as it posits a paradox in the very act of seeking to unify and have peace, since the erasure of differences between people through mimicry is what creates conflict, not the differentiation itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n=== Fundamental anthropology<!--'Fundamental anthropology' redirects here--> ===\n{{See also|Mimetic double bind|Generative anthropology}}\nSince the [[Mimesis|mimetic]] rivalry that develops from the struggle for the possession of the objects is contagious, it leads to the threat of violence.  Girard himself says, \"If there is a normal order in societies, it must be the fruit of an anterior crisis.\"{{Sfn | Girard | 1994 | p = 29}}  Turning his interest towards the anthropological domain, Girard began to study anthropological literature and proposed his second great hypothesis: the [[scapegoat mechanism]], which is at the origin of archaic religion and which he sets forth in his second book ''Violence and the Sacred'' (1972), a work on '''fundamental anthropology'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.<ref>Thomas Ryba (ed.), ''Ren\u00e9 Girard and Creative Reconciliation'', Lexington Books, 2014, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIf two individuals desire the same thing, there will soon be a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At this stage of the crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but now they want to destroy the same enemy. So, a paroxysm of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually over the course of the repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nAlthough explorers and anthropologists have not been able to witness events similar to these, which go back to the earliest times, indirect evidence for them abounds, such as the universality of ritual sacrifice and the innumerable myths that have been collected from the most varied peoples. If Girard's theory is true, then we will find in myths the culpability of the victim-god, depictions of the selection of the victim, and his power to beget the order that governs the group. Girard found these elements in numerous myths, beginning with that of [[Oedipus]] which he analyzed in this and later books.  On this question he opposes [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]].{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nThe phrase \"[[scapegoat mechanism]]\" was not coined by Girard himself; it had been used earlier by [[Kenneth Burke]] in ''Permanence and Change'' (1935) and ''A Grammar of Motives'' (1940). However, Girard took this concept from Burke and developed it much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nIn ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), Girard develops the implications of this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion, which [[Durkheim]] had sensed.<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The elementary forms of the religious life, a study in religious sociology\n | last = Durkheim | first = Emile\n | publisher = G. Allen & Unwin | location = London\n | url = https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durkrich\n | date = 1915 | access-date = 2014-05-19\n}}</ref> The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.\n\nAccording to Girard, just as the theory of [[natural selection]] of species is the rational principle that explains the immense diversity of forms of life, the victimization process is the rational principle that explains the origin of the infinite diversity of cultural forms. The analogy with [[Charles Darwin]] also extends to the scientific status of the theory, as each of these presents itself as a hypothesis that is not capable of being proven experimentally, given the extreme amounts of time necessary for the production of the phenomena in question, but which imposes itself by its great explanatory power.\n\n=== Origin of language ===\nAccording to Girard, the [[origin of language]] is also related to scapegoating. After the first victim, after the murder of the first scapegoat, there were the first prohibitions and rituals, but these came into being before representation and  language, hence before culture. And that means that \"people\" (perhaps not human beings) \"will not start fighting again.\"<ref name=\"MuellerInterview1996\" /> Girard says:\n{{Quote | If mimetic disruption comes back, our instinct will tell us to do again what the sacred has done to save us, which is to kill the scapegoat.  Therefore it would be the force of substitution of immolating another victim instead of the first. But the relationship of this process with representation is not one that can be defined in a clear-cut way. This process would be one that moves towards representation of the sacred, towards definition of the ritual as ritual and prohibition as prohibition. But this process would already begin prior the representation, you see, because it is directly produced by the experience of the misunderstood scapegoat.<ref name=\"MuellerInterview1996\" />}}\n\nAccording to Girard, the substitution of an immolated victim for the first, is \"the very first symbolic sign created by the hominids.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Girard|2004|p=157}}.  {{lang|fr|\"premier signe symbolique jamais invent\u00e9 par les hominid\u00e9s\"}}</ref>  Girard also says this is the first time that one thing represents another thing, standing in the place of this (absent) one. This substitution is the beginning of [[Mental representation|representation and language]], but also the beginning of sacrifice and ritual. The genesis of language and ritual is very slow and we must imagine that there are also kinds of rituals among the animals: \"It is the originary scapegoating which prolongs itself in a process which can be infinitely long in moving from, how should I say, from instinctive ritualization, instinctive prohibition, instinctive separation of the antagonists, which you already find to a certain extent in animals, towards representation.\"<ref name = \"MuellerInterview1996\" />\n\nUnlike [[Eric Gans]], Girard does not think that there is an original scene during which there is \"a sudden shift from non-representation to representation,\"<ref name=\"MuellerInterview1996\">{{Citation\n | title = Interview with Ren\u00e9 Girard\n | last = M\u00fcller | first = Markus\n | journal = Anthropoetics\n | volume = II | number = 1\n | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0201/interv.htm\n | date = June 1996 | accessdate = November 1, 2008\n}}.</ref> or a sudden shift from animality to humanity. According to the French sociologist Camille Tarot, it is hard to understand how the process of representation (symbolicity, language...) actually occurs and he has called this a ''black box'' in Girard's theory.<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Le symbolique et le sacr\u00e9\n | trans-title = The symbolic & the sacred\n | last = Tarot | first = Camille\n | publisher = {{lang|fr|La D\u00e9couverte}} | place = Paris\n | year = 2008 | page = 860\n | language = fr\n}}.</ref>\n\nGirard also says:\n{{Quote | One great characteristic of man is what they [the authors of the modern theory of evolution] call neoteny, the fact that the human infant is born premature, with an open skull, no hair and a total inability to fend for himself. To keep it alive, therefore, there must be some form of cultural protection, because in the world of mammals, such infants would not survive, they would be destroyed.  Therefore there is a reason to believe that in the later stages of human evolution, culture and nature are in constant interaction. The first stages of this interaction must occur prior to language, but they must include forms of sacrifice and prohibition that create a space of non-violence around the mother and the children which make it possible to reach still higher stages of human development. You can postulate as many such stages as are needed. Thus, you can have a transition between ethology and anthropology which removes, I think, all philosophical postulates. The discontinuities would never be of such a nature as to demand some kind of sudden intellectual illumination.<ref name=\"MuellerInterview1996\" />}}\n\n=== Judeo-Christian scriptures ===\n==== Biblical text as a science of man ====\nIn ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'', Girard discusses for the first time Christianity and the [[Bible]]. The [[Gospel]]s ostensibly present themselves as a typical mythical account, with a victim-god lynched by a unanimous crowd, an event that is then commemorated by Christians through ritual sacrifice \u2014 a material re-presentation in this case \u2014 in the [[Eucharist]].  The parallel is perfect except for one detail: the truth of the innocence of the victim is proclaimed by the text and the writer. The mythical account is usually built on the lie of the guilt of the victim in as much as it is an account of the event seen from the viewpoint of the anonymous lynchers.  This ignorance is indispensable to the efficacy of the sacrificial violence.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nThe evangelical \"good news\" clearly affirms the innocence of the victim, thus becoming, by attacking ignorance, the germ of the destruction of the sacrificial order on which rests the equilibrium of societies.  Already the [[Old Testament]] shows this turning inside-out of the mythic accounts with regard to the innocence of the victims ([[Abel]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]\u2026), and the Hebrews were conscious of the uniqueness of their religious tradition. With the Gospels, it is with full clarity that are unveiled these \"things hidden since the foundation of the world\" (Matthew 13:35), the foundation of social order on murder, described in all its repulsive ugliness in the account of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nThis revelation is even clearer because the text is a work on desire and violence, from the serpent setting alight the desire of [[Eve]] in paradise to the prodigious strength of the mimetism that brings about the denial of [[Saint Peter|Peter]] during the Passion (Mark 14: 66\u201372; Luke 22:54\u201362). Girard reinterprets certain biblical expressions in light of his theories; for instance, he sees \"scandal\" (''[[Stumbling block|skandalon]]'', literally, a \"snare\", or an \"impediment placed in the way and causing one to stumble or fall\"<ref>{{Citation\n | title = The New Testament Greek Lexicon\n | publisher = Study light\n | contribution = Skandalon\n | contribution-url = http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=4625\n}}.</ref>) as signifying mimetic rivalry, for example Peter's denial of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Are the Gospels Mythical?\n | last = Girard | first = Ren\u00e9\n | journal = First Things\n | url = http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=3856\n | date = April 1996\n}}.</ref> No one escapes responsibility, neither the envious nor the envied: \"Woe to the man through whom scandal comes\" (Matthew 18:7).{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\n==== Christian society ====\nThe evangelical revelation contains the truth on the violence, available for two thousand years, Girard tells us. Has it put an end to the sacrificial order based on violence in the society that has claimed the gospel text as its own religious text? No, he replies, since in order for a truth to have an impact it must find a receptive listener, and people do not change that quickly. The gospel text has instead acted as a ferment that brings about the decomposition of the sacrificial order. While medieval Europe showed the face of a sacrificial society that still knew very well how to despise and ignore its victims, nonetheless the efficacy of sacrificial violence has never stopped decreasing, in the measure that ignorance receded. Here Girard sees the principle of the uniqueness and of the transformations of the Western society whose destiny today is one with that of human society as a whole.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\nDoes the retreat of the sacrificial order mean less violence?  Not at all; rather, it deprives modern societies of most of the capacity of sacrificial violence to establish temporary order.  The \"innocence\" of the time of the ignorance is no more. On the other hand, Christianity, following the example of [[Judaism]], has desacralized the world, making possible a utilitarian relationship with nature.  Increasingly threatened by the resurgence of mimetic crises on a grand scale, the contemporary world is on one hand more quickly caught up by its guilt, and on the other hand has developed such a great technical power of destruction that it is condemned to both more and more responsibility and less and less innocence. So, for example, while empathy for victims manifests progress in the moral conscience of society, it nonetheless also takes the form of a competition among victims that threatens an escalation of violence.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\n== Influence ==\n=== Psychology and neuroscience ===\nJean-Michel Oughourlian in his book ''A mime named desire'' (''Un mime nomm\u00e9 d\u00e9sir'' - Grasset 1982) has used Girard's theories in psychopathology. Hysteria and obsession are explained through mimetic rivalry and the priority of desire.\n\nGirard's work is also attracting increasing interest from empirical researchers investigating human [[imitation]] (among them [[Andrew Meltzoff]] and [[Vittorio Gallese]]). Recently, empirical studies into the mechanism of desire have suggested some intriguing correlations with Girard's theory on the subject. For instance, clinical psychologist Scott R. Garrels wrote:\n{{Quote | What makes Girard's insights so remarkable is that he not only discovered and developed the primordial role of psychological mimesis (...) during a time when imitation was quite out of fashion, but he did so through investigation in literature, cultural anthropology, history, and ultimately returning to religious texts for further evidence of mimetic phenomena. The parallels between Girard's insights and the only recent conclusions made by empirical researchers concerning imitation (in both development and the evolution of species) are extraordinary (...).<ref>{{Citation\n |title       = Imitation, Mirror Neurons, & Mimetic Desire: Convergent Support for the Work of Rene Girard\n |last        = Garrels\n |first       = Scott R\n |page        = 29\n |url         = http://girardianlectionary.net/covr2004/garrelspaper.pdf\n |date        = 1 May 2004\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074007/http://girardianlectionary.net/covr2004/garrelspaper.pdf\n |archivedate = 27 March 2009\n}} (an earlier version of the paper that appeared as {{Citation\n |title       = Imitation, Mirror Neurons and Mimetic Desire: Convergence between the Mimetic Theory of Ren\u00e9 Girard and Empirical Research on Imitation\n |last        = Garrels\n |first       = Scott R\n |journal     = Contagion: Journal of Violence, Mimesis, and Culture\n |year        = 2006\n |volume      = 12-13\n |pages       = 47\u201386\n |url         = http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/cont/pdf/Cont.%2012-13%20Garrels%2047-86.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074008/http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/cont/pdf/Cont.%2012-13%20Garrels%2047-86.pdf\n |archivedate = 2009-03-27\n}}).</ref>}}\n\n===Economics and globalization===\nThe mimetic theory has also been applied in the study of economics, most notably in {{lang|fr|La violence de la monnaie}} (1982) by [[Michel Aglietta]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Orl\u00e9an]]. Orl\u00e9an was also a contributor to the volume ''Ren\u00e9 Girard'' in ''[[Les cahiers de l'Herne]]'' (\"{{lang |fr|Pour une approche girardienne de l'homo oeconomicus}}\").<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Ren\u00e9 Girard\n | number = 89 | pages = 261\u201365\n | series = Cahier de L'Herne\n}}.</ref> According to the philosopher of technology [[Andrew Feenberg]]:\n{{Quote | In {{lang|fr|La violence de la monnaie}}, Aglietta and Orl\u00e9an follow Girard in suggesting that the basic relation of exchange can be interpreted as a conflict of 'doubles', each mediating the desire of the Other.

In their theory, the market takes the place of the sacred in modern life as the chief institutional mechanism stabilizing the otherwise explosive conflicts of desiring subjects.<ref>{{Citation\n | contribution = Fetishism and Form: Erotic and Economic Disorder in Literature\n | last = Feenberg | first = Andrew\n | title = Violence and Truth\n | editor-last = Dumouchel | editor-first = Paul\n | publisher = Athlone Press & Stanford University Press\n | year = 1988 | pages = 134\u201351\n | url = https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/Girard.htm\n}}.</ref>}}\n\nIn an interview with the ''Unesco Courier'', anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the ''Ren\u00e9 Girard'' issue of ''Les Cahiers de l'Herne'') explains that Aglietta and Orl\u00e9an (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the [[gift economy]], as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: \"Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him to do the same for you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity.\"<ref name=\"anspach_unesco\">{{Citation\n |title         = Global markets, anonymous victims\n |last1         = Anspach\n |first1        = Mark\n |editor1-last  = Blanc\n |editor1-first = Yannick\n |editor2-last  = Bessi\u00e8res\n |editor2-first = Michel\n |journal       = The UNESCO Courrier\n |type          = interview\n |url           = http://www.mimetictheory.net/bios/articles/Anspach_UNESCO.pdf\n |date          = May 2001\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20081119161211/http://mimetictheory.net/bios/articles/Anspach_UNESCO.pdf\n |archivedate   = 2008-11-19\n}}.</ref> Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development\u2014\"economic rationality\"\u2014is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by \"economic rationality.\" This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.\n\n===Literature===\nGirard's influence extends beyond philosophy and social science, and includes the literary realm. A prominent example of a fiction writer influenced by Girard is [[J. M. Coetzee]], winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. Critics have noted that mimetic desire and scapegoating are recurring themes in Coetzee's novels ''Elizabeth Costello'' and ''Disgrace.'' In the latter work, the book's protagonist also gives a speech about the history of scapegoating with noticeable similarities to Girard's view of the same subject. Coetzee has also frequently cited Girard in his non-fiction essays, on subjects ranging from advertising to the Russian writer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]].<ref>Andy Lamey, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 \"Sympathy and Scapegoating in J. M. Coetzee,\"] in ''J. M. Coetzee and Ethics: Philosophical Perspectives on Literature,'' Anton Leist and Peter Singer eds. (New York: Columbia University Press 2010). For Girard's influence on Coetzee, see pages 181-5.</ref>\n\n===Theology===\nTheologians who describe themselves as indebted to Girard include [[James Alison]] (who focuses on mimetic desire's implications for the doctrine of [[original sin]]), [[Raymund Schwager]] (who builds a dramatic narrative around both the scapegoat mechanism and the theo-drama of fellow Swiss theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]), and Bishop Robert Barron (who has remarked that Girard will be appreciated as a 21st-Century [[Church Father]] in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSzF2OG2ejI |title=Bishop Barron on Rene Girard |first=Robert |last=Barron |date=January 21, 2016 |website=YouTube |access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref>)\n\n== Criticism ==\n=== Originality ===\nSome critics have pointed out that while Girard may be the first to have suggested that ''all'' desire is mimetic, he is by no means the first to have noticed that ''some'' desire is mimetic \u2013 Gabriel Tarde's book ''Les lois de l'imitation'' (''The Laws of Imitation'') appeared in 1890. Building on Tarde, crowd psychology, Nietzsche, and more generally on a modernist tradition of the \"mimetic unconscious\" that had hypnosis as its via regia, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that for the modernists not only desire but all affects turn out to be contagious and mimetic.<ref>Nidesh Lawtoo, ''The Phantom of the Ego: Modernism and the Mimetic Unconscious'', East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2013.</ref> Ren\u00e9 Pommier<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard, ''Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare'', Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 42</ref> mentions [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], a seventeenth-century thinker who already wrote that \"Nothing is so infectious as example\" and that \"There are some who never would have loved if they never had heard it spoken of.\"<ref>La Rochefoucauld, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/9105/9105-h/9105-h.htm \"Maxims,\"] maxims 230, 136.</ref>\n\nSt\u00e9phane Vinolo sees [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] as important precursors.

What is more, both Girard and Lacan read these myths through the lens of structural anthropology so it is not surprising that their intellectual systems came to resemble one another so strongly. Meloni writes that Girard and Lacan were \"moved by similar preoccupations and are fascinated by and attracted to the same kind of issues: the constituent character of the other in the structure of desire, the role of jealousy and rivalry in the construction of the social bond, the proliferation of triangles within apparently dual relations, doubles and mirrors, imitation and the Imaginary, and the crisis of modern society within which the 'rite of Oedipus' is situated.\"\n\nAt times, Girard acknowledges his indebtedness to such precursors, including Tocqueville.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard. 1965. ''Deceit, Desire and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure'' Translated by Y. Freccero, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1965 p. 120</ref> At other times, however, Girard makes stronger claims to originality, as when he says that mimetic rivalry \"is responsible for the frequency and intensity of human conflicts, but strangely, no one ever speaks of it.\"<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard. 2001.

Girard notes, for example, that the disciples actively turn against Jesus.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard, ''Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1987, p. 167.</ref> Since Peter warms himself by a fire, and fires always create community, and communities breed mimetic desire, this means that Peter becomes actively hostile to Jesus, seeking his death.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, pp. 98-102.</ref> According to Pommier, Girard claims that the Gospels present the Crucifixion as a purely human affair, with no indication of Christ dying for the sins of mankind, a claim contradicted by [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] 10:45, [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]] 20:28.<ref name=\"Ren\u00e9 Pommier 2010, pp. 115-16\">Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, pp. 115-16.</ref>\n\nThe same goes for readings of literary texts, says Pommier. For example, [[Moli\u00e8re]]'s Don Juan only pursues ''one'' love object for mediated reasons,<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 25.</ref> not ''all'' of them, as Girard claims.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard. 1965.

First, it is very hard to explain the existence of taboo desires, such as homosexuality in repressive societies, on that basis.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 38.</ref> In Girard's defence on the other hand, Jean-Michel Oughourlian exemplifies the situation by noting that \"one homosexual admitted to me that he just wanted to be somebody else.\"\n\nSecond, every situation presents large numbers of potential mediators, which means that the individual has to make a choice among them; either authentic choice is possible, then, or else the theory leads to a regress.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, pp. 33-34.</ref> Third, Girard leaves no room for innovation: Surely somebody has to be the first to desire a new object, even if everyone else follows that trend-setter.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Pommier, \"Ren\u00e9 Girard, Un allum\u00e9 qui se prend pour un phare,\" Paris: Kim\u00e9, 2010, p. 18.</ref>\n\nIt is not clear that the first objection really provides a challenge to Girard's theory, as even in repressive societies men are still desired (albeit by women). However, such a response leaves unexplained why homosexuals would imitate the desires of heterosexual members of the opposite sex.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard's philosophy of romance is compared with [[Plato|Plato\u2019s]], [[Iain King|Iain King's]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s]] in [http://kindnesslovejoy.com/when-romance-and-philosophy-meet/ When Romance and Philosophy Meet (link to blog)] retrieved 2013-12-02.</ref> One might also argue that the last objection ignores the influence of an original sin from which all others follow, which Girard clearly affirms. However, original sin, according to Girard's interpretation, explains only our propensity to imitate, not the specific content of our imitated desires.<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/#SH5d Girard, Ren\u00e9 [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&#93;]. Iep.utm.edu. Retrieved on 2013-10-23.</ref> Thus, the doctrine of original sin does not solve the problem of how the original model first acquires the desire that is subsequently imitated by others.\n\n=== Beneficial imitation ===\nIn the early part of Girard's career, there seemed no place for beneficial imitation. Jean-Michel Oughourlian objected that \"imitation can be totally peaceful and beneficial; I don't believe that I am the other, I don't want to take  his place. \u2026This imitation can lead me to become sensitive to social and political problems.\"<ref>Jean-Michel Oughourlian: ''Gen\u00e8se du d\u00e9sir''. Paris: Carnets Nord, 2007, {{ISBN|978-2-35536-003-9}}. The French sentence goes: \"L'imitation peut alors demeurer enti\u00e8rement paisible et b\u00e9n\u00e9fique; je ne me prends pas pour l'autre, je ne veux pas prendre sa place [\u2026] Cette imitation [\u2026] me conduira peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 me sensibiliser aux probl\u00e8mes sociaux et politiques\u2026</ref> Rebecca Adams argued that because Girard's theories fixated on violence, he was creating a \"scapegoat\" himself with his own theory: the scapegoat of positive mimesis.  Adams proposed a reassessment of Girard's theory that includes an account of loving mimesis or, as she preferred to call it, creative mimesis.<ref>{{Cite web\n |title       = Loving Mimesis and Girard's \"Scapegoat of the Text\": A Creative Reassessment of Mimetic Desire\n |author      = Rebecca Adams\n |year        = 2000\n |publisher   = Pandora Press US\n |url         = http://web.ustpaul.uottawa.ca/covr2006/Document/RebeccaGirard.pdf\n |access-date = 2008-07-09\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074008/http://web.ustpaul.uottawa.ca/covr2006/Document/RebeccaGirard.pdf\n |archivedate = 2009-03-27\n}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Girard has made room for positive imitation.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard, The Girard Reader, Trans. Yvonne Freccero, Ed. James G. Williams, New York: Crossroad Herder, 1996, pp. 63\u201364, 269.</ref> But as Adams implies, it is not clear how the revised theory accords with earlier claims about the origin of culture.  If beneficial imitation is possible, then it is no longer necessary for cultures to be born by means of scapegoating; they could just as well be born through healthy emulation. Nidesh Lawtoo further develops the healthy side of mimetic contagion by drawing on a Nietzschean philosophical tradition that privileges \"laughter\" and other gay forms of \"sovereign communication\" in the formation of \"community.\"<ref>Nidesh Lawtoo. ''The Phantom of the Ego: Modernism and the Mimetic Unconscious''. East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2007, pp. 284-304</ref>\n\n=== Anthropology ===\nVarious anthropologists have contested Girard's claims. Elizabeth Traube, for example, reminds us that there are other ways of making sense of the data that Girard borrows from Evans-Pritchard and company\u2014ways that are more consistent with the practices of the given culture. By applying a one-size-fits-all approach, Girard \"loses \u2026 the ability to tell us anything about cultural products themselves, for the simple reason that he has annihilated the cultures which produced them.\"<ref>Elizabeth Traube, \"Incest and Mythology: Anthropological and Girardian Perspectives, \" The Berkshire Review 14 (1979): 37\u201354, pp. 49\u201350)</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nOne of the main sources of criticism of Girard's work comes from intellectuals who claim that his comparison of Judeo-Christian texts vis-\u00e0-vis other religions leaves something to be desired.<ref>E.g. see the criticisms in ''Violence and Truth: On the Work of Ren\u00e9 Girard'', Paul Dumouchel ed., Stanford University Press, 1988</ref> There are also those who find the interpretation of the Christ event\u2014as a purely human event, having nothing to do with redemption from sin\u2014an unconvincing one, given what the Gospels themselves say.<ref name = \"Ren\u00e9 Pommier 2010, pp. 115-16\" /> Yet, [[Roger Scruton]] notes, Girard's account has a [[Christology|divine Jesus]]: \"that Jesus was the first scapegoat to understand the need for his death and to forgive those who inflicted it \u2026  Girard argues, Jesus gave the best evidence \u2026 of his divine nature.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The Soul of the World\n | last = Scruton | first = Roger\n | author-link= Roger Scruton \n | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, NJ\n | page = 20\n | date = 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n== Honours and awards ==\n* Honorary degrees at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (the Netherlands, 1985), UFSIA in Antwerp (Belgium, 1995), the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova (Italy, 2001, honorary degree in \"Arts\"),<ref>{{lang|it|Universit\u00e0 degli Studie di Padova}}: [http://www.unipd.it/en/area/area-51.htm Honoris causa degrees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429013257/http://www.unipd.it/en/area/area-51.htm |date=2007-04-29 }}</ref> the faculty of theology at the University of Innsbruck (Austria), the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (Canada, 2004),<ref>Marie-Claude Bourdon: [http://www.iforum.umontreal.ca/Forum/ArchivesForum/2003-2004/040419/article3470.htm {{lang|fr|La violence et le sacr\u00e9: L'Universit\u00e9 remet un doctorat honoris causa au penseur Ren\u00e9 Girard}}] iForum vol. 38 num. 28 (19 April 2004)</ref> and the University of St Andrews (UK, 2008)<ref>University of St Andrews: [http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2008/title,22097,en.php Honorary degrees - June 2008].</ref>\n* The [[Prix M\u00e9dicis]] essai for ''Shakespeare, les feux de l'envie'' (''A Theatre of Envy: William Shakespeare'', 1991)\n* The prix Aujourd'hui for ''Les origines de la culture'' (2004)\n* [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Fellow]] (1959 and 1966)<ref>[http://www.gf.org/gfellow.html John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation: Fellows page: G] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214123114/http://www.gf.org/gfellow.html |date=2008-02-14 }}</ref>\n* Election to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] (2005)\n* Awarded the [[Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize]] by the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] (2006)<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = Wissenschaft und christlicher Glaube\n | last = Girard | first = Ren\u00e9\n | year = 2007\n | publisher = Mohr Siebeck | location = T\u00fcbingen\n | page = 110\n | isbn = 978-3-16-149266-2\n}}</ref>\n* Awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic, Commander by Number, by the Spanish head of state, H.M.

He was the foreign minister during some of the most important periods of Denmark's modern history, including the First World War, the plebiscites over the return of northern [[Schleswig]] to Denmark, and the German occupation. Scavenius was a member of the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] (the [[upper house]] of the Danish parliament before 1953)  from 1918 to 1920 and from 1925 to 1927 representing the [[Det Radikale Venstre|Social Liberal Party]]. He was chairman of its party organization from 1922 to 1924.\n\nScavenius belonged to a tradition of elite governance that distrusted democratically elected politicians at a time when they were gaining power and influence. He believed that many of them were influenced by ignorant strains of populism and ill-equipped to face tough compromises and realities. For example, during the negotiations over the return of territory to Denmark following the First World War, he advocated a more cautious approach than many more nationalistic figures. He believed that areas that were mostly German should stay in Germany.\n\nHis policy of accommodation and compromise toward the Nazi occupation authorities in Denmark during the Second World War is one of the enduring controversies of Danish history. Some see it as a necessary compromise to protect the Danish state and people, but others see it as unnecessarily accommodating of totalitarian Nazi Germany.\n\n==Early life==\nThe Scavenius family belongs to the [[Danish Nobility]]. It was in the family tradition to work as a [[diplomacy|diplomat]]. Scavenius graduated in [[economics]] in 1901. Soon afterward, he became employed in the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was a secretary at the Danish Embassy in Berlin from 1906 to 1908, a time forming his emphasis upon the primacy of Danish-German relations. Then, he became head of section in the ministry.\n\n==Diplomat==\nHe was an envoy to Vienna and Rome from 1912 to 1913 and to Stockholm from 1924 to 1932. From 1932 to 1940, he was chairman of the board of the major daily [[Politiken]]. Scavenius was the owner of a large estate from 1915 to 1946. After 1945, he experienced marital and economic difficulties.\n\n==In Cabinet==\nThe appointment of the 32-year-old head of section Scavenius as minister of Foreign Affairs in the Social Liberal cabinet (1909-1910) came as a surprise. He was reappointed when the party formed another cabinet in 1913. During [[World War I]], he strongly put his efforts into the continuation of \"the German course\", a policy of keeping Denmark out of conflict with its neighbouring [[great power]] through adaptation. Among other things he supported giving in to the German demands to mine the [[Danish straits]] in August 1914.\n\nScavenius was also an important figure as foreign minister during the negotiations surrounding the [[Schleswig Plebiscites|return of parts of Slesvig to Denmark]] following the war. Scavenius was one of the chief advocates of the Danish government's official position, advocating a return of only territories with clear Danish majorities (see [[Easter Crisis of 1920]]). That was opposed to the more \"maximalist\" position which demanded a return of all previously Danish territories south to the \"''[[Danevirke]]\"''.<ref name=Lidegaard>{{cite book|last=Lidegaard|first=Bo|title=En fort\u00e6lling om Danmark i det 20. \u00c5rhundrede|year=2011|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|location=Copenhagen|language=Danish|page=98}}</ref>\n\n===Occupation of Denmark===\n[[image:Scavenius og Best.jpg|left|thumb|Erik Scavenius (left) with German plenipotentiary of Denmark, Dr. [[Werner Best]].]]\nScavenius became foreign minister again during most of the [[Occupation of Denmark|German occupation of Denmark]]. As such, he was the most important liaison between the Danish government and the German authorities. In addition, he was [[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|prime minister]] for some of the war as head of a coalition cabinet after the [[Telegram Crisis]]. He was more of a professional diplomat than an elected politician and held an [[elitist]] approach to government. At this time, the Social Liberal Party did not consider Scavenius to be its representative although the party accepted his line, along with the other coalition parties.\n\nScavenius was concerned that emotional public opinion would destabilise his attempts to build a compromise between Danish sovereignty and the realities of occupation. He felt strongly that he was Denmark's most ardent defender. After the war, there was much recrimination of his stance, particularly from members of the [[Danish resistance movement|active resistance]], who felt that he had hindered the cause of resistance and threatened Denmark's national honour. He felt that these people were vain and seeking to build their own reputations or political careers through [[emotionalism (disorder)|emotionalism]].\n\nAfter 29 August 1943, Erik Scavenius lost all of his real powers when the German authorities dissolved the Danish government following the refusal of that government to crack down on unrest to the satisfaction of the German plenipotentiary. His cabinet resigned in 1943 and suspended operations. The resignation was never formally accepted by King [[Christian X of Denmark]] so the cabinet existed ''de jure'', until a new one was formed following the liberation on 5 May 1945. Scavenius was politically isolated after 1945, but the parliamentary commission on misconduct during the Occupation did not find reason to impeach him for the High Court of the Realm for maladministration of office in its report in 1955.\n\n==Legacy==\nDebate continues over his legacy, and he remains one of the most controversial figures in the history of Danish politics. For example, on the 60th anniversary of the 29 August dissolution of government, prime minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] chastised his predecessor for his stance, saying that it was naive and morally unacceptable.<ref name=Lemhag>{{cite newspaper|last=Lemhag|first=Linn|title=Who is ...

He was the foreign minister during some of the most important periods of Denmark's modern history, including the First World War, the plebiscites over the return of northern [[Schleswig]] to Denmark, and the German occupation. Scavenius was a member of the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] (the [[upper house]] of the Danish parliament before 1953)  from 1918 to 1920 and from 1925 to 1927 representing the [[Det Radikale Venstre|Social Liberal Party]]. He was chairman of its party organization from 1922 to 1924.\n\nScavenius belonged to a tradition of elite governance that distrusted democratically elected politicians at a time when they were gaining power and influence. He believed that many of them were influenced by ignorant strains of populism and ill-equipped to face tough compromises and realities. For example, during the negotiations over the return of territory to Denmark following the First World War, he advocated a more cautious approach than many more nationalistic figures. He believed that areas that were mostly German should stay in Germany.\n\nHis policy of accommodation and compromise toward the Nazi occupation authorities in Denmark during the Second World War is one of the enduring controversies of Danish history. Some see it as a necessary compromise to protect the Danish state and people, but others see it as unnecessarily accommodating of totalitarian Nazi Germany.\n\n==Early life==\nThe Scavenius family belongs to the [[Danish Nobility]]. It was in the family tradition to work as a [[diplomacy|diplomat]]. Scavenius graduated in [[economics]] in 1901. Soon afterward, he became employed in the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was a secretary at the Danish Embassy in Berlin from 1906 to 1908, a time forming his emphasis upon the primacy of Danish-German relations. Then, he became head of section in the ministry.\n\n==Diplomat==\nHe was an envoy to Vienna and Rome from 1912 to 1913 and to Stockholm from 1924 to 1932. From 1932 to 1940, he was chairman of the board of the major daily [[Politiken]]. Scavenius was the owner of a large estate from 1915 to 1946. After 1945, he experienced marital and economic difficulties.\n\n==In Cabinet==\nThe appointment of the 32-year-old head of section Scavenius as minister of Foreign Affairs in the Social Liberal cabinet (1909-1910) came as a surprise. He was reappointed when the party formed another cabinet in 1913. During [[World War I]], he strongly put his efforts into the continuation of \"the German course\", a policy of keeping Denmark out of conflict with its neighbouring [[great power]] through adaptation. Among other things he supported giving in to the German demands to mine the [[Danish straits]] in August 1914.\n\nScavenius was also an important figure as foreign minister during the negotiations surrounding the [[Schleswig Plebiscites|return of parts of Slesvig to Denmark]] following the war. Scavenius was one of the chief advocates of the Danish government's official position, advocating a return of only territories with clear Danish majorities (see [[Easter Crisis of 1920]]). That was opposed to the more \"maximalist\" position which demanded a return of all previously Danish territories south to the \"''[[Danevirke]]\"''.<ref name=Lidegaard>{{cite book|last=Lidegaard|first=Bo|title=En fort\u00e6lling om Danmark i det 20. \u00c5rhundrede|year=2011|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|location=Copenhagen|language=Danish|page=98}}</ref>\n\n===Occupation of Denmark===\n[[image:Scavenius og Best.jpg|left|thumb|Erik Scavenius (left) with German plenipotentiary of Denmark, Dr. [[Werner Best]].]]\nScavenius became foreign minister again during most of the [[Occupation of Denmark|German occupation of Denmark]]. As such, he was the most important liaison between the Danish government and the German authorities. In addition, he was [[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|prime minister]] for some of the war as head of a coalition cabinet after the [[Telegram Crisis]]. He was more of a professional diplomat than an elected politician and held an [[elitist]] approach to government. At this time, the Social Liberal Party did not consider Scavenius to be its representative although the party accepted his line, along with the other coalition parties.\n\nScavenius was concerned that emotional public opinion would destabilise his attempts to build a compromise between Danish sovereignty and the realities of occupation. He felt strongly that he was Denmark's most ardent defender. After the war, there was much recrimination of his stance, particularly from members of the [[Danish resistance movement|active resistance]], who felt that he had hindered the cause of resistance and threatened Denmark's national honour. He felt that these people were vain and seeking to build their own reputations or political careers through [[emotionalism (disorder)|emotionalism]].\n\nAfter 29 August 1943, Erik Scavenius lost all of his real powers when the German authorities dissolved the Danish government following the refusal of that government to crack down on unrest to the satisfaction of the German plenipotentiary. His cabinet resigned in 1943 and suspended operations. The resignation was never formally accepted by King [[Christian X of Denmark]] so the cabinet existed ''de jure'', until a new one was formed following the liberation on 5 May 1945. Scavenius was politically isolated after 1945, but the parliamentary commission on misconduct during the Occupation did not find reason to impeach him for the High Court of the Realm for maladministration of office in its report in 1955.\n\n==Legacy==\nDebate continues over his legacy, and he remains one of the most controversial figures in the history of Danish politics. For example, on the 60th anniversary of the 29 August dissolution of government, prime minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] chastised his predecessor for his stance, saying that it was naive and morally unacceptable.<ref name=Lemhag>{{cite newspaper|last=Lemhag|first=Linn|title=Who is ...

Shields Tramways''' operated a tramway service in [[South Shields]] between 1883 and 1906.<ref>The Golden Age of Tramways. Published by Taylor and Francis.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe South Shields Tramways were constructed by South Shields Corporation. The services were operated under a lease by ''South Shields Tramways Company''. Services started on 1 August 1883.\n\nBy 1886 the company was in financial difficulty, and services stopped on 30 April. The tramcars were sold in an auction to the [[Douglas Bay Horse Tramway]]. Tramcar 14 is in the Manx Museum and 18 still operates on the Douglas system (both Double Deckers)\n\nOn 28 March 1887, a new lease arranged by the Corporation with the ''South Shields Tramways and Carriage Company'' enabled services to restart.\n\n==Closure==\nThe company was taken over in 1899 by [[British Electric Traction]] in expectation that it would be allowed to modernise and electrify the services. However, it withdrew and the new tramway opened, operated by [[South Shields Corporation Tramways]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Historic UK Trams}}\n\n[[Category:Tram transport in England]]\n[[Category:South Shields]]\n[[Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in England]]\n\n\n{{UK-tram-stub}}\n", "name_user": "MSGJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "refine category", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Shields_Tramways"}

Mytilene is the [[capital city]] and port of the island of [[Lesbos]] and also the capital and administration center of the [[North Aegean]] Region. The seat of the governor of the [[North Aegean]] Region is Mytilene, such as the headquarters of the [[University of the Aegean]].\n\nMytilene is one of the 13 [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (counties) on the island of [[Lesbos]]. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island.

The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]]. The strait eventually filled with earth.<ref>[http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 Harbor of Mytilene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052712/http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 |date=2014-08-08 }} accessed July 31, 2014</ref>\n\nMytilene contested successfully with [[Mithymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island's prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]).

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].

Mytilene is the [[capital city]] and port of the island of [[Lesbos]] and also the capital and administration center of the [[North Aegean]] Region. The seat of the governor of the [[North Aegean]] Region is Mytilene, such as the headquarters of the [[University of the Aegean]].\n\nMytilene is one of the 13 [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (counties) on the island of [[Lesbos]]. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is also the seat of a [[metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 59v 3.png|thumb|left|160px|[[Pittacus of Mytilene]] (c. 640 \u2013 568 BC), one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]\n[[File:Port Mytilene.jpg|thumb|View of the port, with the dome of Saint Therapon.]]\n[[File:Lesbos Mytilene01.JPG|thumb|The church of [[Saint Therapon (Mytilene)|Saint Therapon]] at the port]]\n\nAs an ancient city, lying off the east coast, Mytilene was initially confined to a small island just offshore that later was joined to Lesbos, creating a north and south harbor. The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]]. The strait eventually filled with earth.<ref>[http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 Harbor of Mytilene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052712/http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 |date=2014-08-08 }} accessed July 31, 2014</ref>\n\nMytilene contested successfully with [[Mithymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island's prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]).

Facing economic crises, oppressive governments, violence, and war, thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, and other countries have decided to leave their homes and seek safety in Europe. As the capital of Lesbos, the city of Mytilene has become a primary entry point for refugees and migrants who seek to pass through Greece to resettle elsewhere in Europe.\n\nA refugee's journey to Mytilene involves a series of strategic steps. Individuals often travel by foot, car, bus, and boat to reach Turkey before taking boats across the Aegean Sea to Lesbos. Mytilene serves as a doorway to the Greek mainland and thus to the European countries, such as the Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany, in which refugees often desire to settle. In the past two years, over half a million people have arrived in Lesbos.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/refugee-flows-lesvos-evolution-humanitarian-response|title=Refugee Flows to Lesvos: Evolution of a Humanitarian Response|date=2016-01-28|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en}}</ref> Some have drowned on the journey, because of the dangerous nature of traveling by boat without lifejackets and also because they have been sold faulty lifejackets by smugglers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://theworldwidetribe.com/2016/01/fake-life-jackets/|title=Fake Life Jackets|date=2016-01-19|work=The Worldwide Tribe|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-US}}</ref> Others have suffered from hypothermia.\n\nThe number of individuals coming through Lesbos has dwindled since the signing of the controversial [[EU-Turkey deal]] which restricted the number of refugees that could legally resettle in Europe. The deal stated that persons arriving in Greece by first traveling through Turkey would, after March 20, 2016, be deported from Greece and sent back to Turkey if Greece did not confer them asylum status.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/qa-eu-turkey-deal-2090291043|title=Q&A: EU-Turkey refugee deal explained|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2017|7}}, seventy to eighty refugees are still arriving in Greece daily despite the deal and \"many of them on Lesbos\", according to Daniel Esdras, the chief of the [[International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Ukraine|International Organization for Migration (IOM)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/violence-becoming-commonplace-in-moria-refugee-camp/a-39793594|title=Violence becoming commonplace in Moria refugee camp {{!}} Germany Guide for Refugees {{!}} DW {{!}} 21.07.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-12-10}}</ref>\n\n===Moria===\nMoria ({{lang-el|\u039c\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1}} \u2013 ''M\u00f3ria'') refugee camp is the biggest refugee camp in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/protection/operations/5645ddbc6/greece-factsheet-lesvos-island.html|title=LESVOS ISLAND - GREECE|last=|first=|date=|website=UNHCR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Formerly a prison, Moria is a refugee camp located outside Moria village near Mytilene, the main city on the island.

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].
