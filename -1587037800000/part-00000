Paraparaumu was the northern terminal for Kapiti Line services from 1983 until 20 February 2011 when the electrification and Kapiti Line services were extended to [[Waikanae]]. \n\n== Services ==\nParaparaumu is the last station before Waikanae, the northern terminal for [[Kapiti Line]] commuter trains operated by [[Transdev Wellington]] under the Metlink brand operating between [[Wellington railway station|Wellington]] and [[Porirua railway station|Porirua]] or Waikanae. Services are operated by [[electric multiple unit]]s of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FT/FP class]] (Matangi). Two [[diesel locomotive|diesel-hauled]] carriage trains, the [[Capital Connection]] and the [[Northern Explorer]], stop at Paraparaumu.\n\nTravel times by train are six minutes to Waikanae, thirty-three minutes to Porirua, and fifty-four minutes to Wellington for trains stopping at all stations and forty-nine minutes for express trains that do not stop between Porirua and Wellington. Trains run every twenty minutes during daytime off-peak hours, more frequently during peak periods, and less frequently at night.<ref name=\"metlinklinden\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metlink.org.nz/timetables/train/KPL|title=Kapiti Line (Waikanae \u2013 Wellington) \u2013 Metlink|website=www.metlink.org.nz|access-date=2019-12-21}}\n\n<br /></ref> Before July 2018, off-peak passenger train services between Wellington and Waikanae ran every thirty minutes<ref>metlink ''Kapity Train Line'' timetable effective from 20 January 2016</ref> but were increased to one every twenty minutes from 15 July 2018. Off peak trains stop at all stations between Wellington and Waikanae.

It was formerly a stop on the [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] service between Auckland and Wellington, but was not retained initially when that service was replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]] in June 2012. Following public feedback, it was reinstated as a stop for the Northern Explorer in October 2012.\n\nThe station also serves as a major interchange point with [[Public transport in Wellington|Metlink]] bus services.\n\nMetlink bus routes 250, 260, 261 and 262 serve Paraparaumu station. Routes 251, 264, 280 and 290 also use Paraparaumu station less frequently<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metlink.org.nz/stop/1002|title=Stop 1002 \u2013 Metlink|website=www.metlink.org.nz|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>. \n\n== History ==\nThe station was opened on 2 August 1886 (Hoy says c1886), and was on the [[Wellington-Manawatu Line]] from Wellington to Longburn built by the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] (WMR).

The Simjurids received an [[appanage]] in the [[Kohistan District, Badakhshan|Kohistan]] region of eastern Khorasan. The Samanid generals Alp Tigin and [[Abu al-Hasan Simjuri]] competed for the governorship of Khorasan and control of the Samanid Empire by placing on the throne [[emir]]s they could dominate after the death of [[Abd al-Malik I (Samanid emir)|Abd al-Malik I]] in 961. His death created a succession crisis between his brothers. A court party instigated by men of the scribal class \u2014 civilian ministers rather than Turkic generals \u2014 rejected the candidacy of Alp Tigin for the Samanid throne. [[Mansur I]] was installed instead, and Alp Tigin prudently retired to south of the [[Hindu Kush]], where he captured Ghazna and became the ruler of the city as a Samanid authority.<ref name=\"EIranica\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ghaznavids \"Ghaznavids\"], by C.

Samanid weakness attracted into Transoxiana the [[Karluks]], a Turkic people who had recently converted to Islam. They occupied [[Bukhara]] in 992, establishing in Transoxania the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAfter Alp Tigin's death in 963, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, followed by his slave [[Sabuktigin]], took the throne. Sabuktigin's son [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] made an agreement with the Kara-Khanid Khanate whereby the Amu Darya was recognised as their mutual boundary. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Domination==\n\n===Sabuktigin===\n{{Main|Sabuktigin}}\nSabuktigin, son-in-law of Alp Tigin and founder of the Ghaznavid Empire, began expanding it by capturing Samanid and [[Kabul Shahi]] territories, including most of what is now Afghanistan and part of Pakistan. The 16th century Persian historian, [[Firishta]], records Sabuktigin's [[genealogy]] as descended from the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian kings]]: \"Subooktu-geen, the son of Jookan, the son of Kuzil-Hukum, the son of Kuzil-Arslan, the son of Ferooz, the son of [[Yazdegerd III|Yezdijird]], king of Persia.\" However, modern historians believe this was an attempt to connect himself with the history of old Persia.<ref>''The Development of Persian Culture under the Early Ghaznavids'', C. E. Bosworth, '''Iran''', Vol. 6, (1968), 40.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Sabuktigin, his son [[Ismail of Ghazni|Ismail]] claimed the throne for a temporary period, but he was defeated and captured by Mahmud in 998 at the [[Battle of Ghazni (998)|Battle of Ghazni]].\n\n===Mahmud son of Sabuktigin===\n{{Main|Mahmud of Ghazni}}\nIn 997, [[Mahmud of Ghaznavid|Mahmud]], another son of Sebuktigin, succeeded the throne,<ref>John Clark Marshman. The history of India ... to the accession of the Mogul dynasty, page 94</ref> and Ghazni and the Ghaznavid dynasty have become perpetually associated with him. He completed the conquest of the Samanid and Shahi territories, including the [[Ismaili]] Kingdom of [[Multan]], [[Sindh]], as well as some [[Buyid dynasty|Buwayhid]] territory. By all accounts, the rule of Mahmud was the golden age and height of the Ghaznavid Empire. Mahmud carried out seventeen expeditions through northern India to establish his control and set up tributary states, and his raids also resulted in the looting of a great deal of plunder. He established his authority from the borders of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] to [[Samarkand]], from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Yamuna]].\n\nDuring Mahmud's reign (997\u20131030), the Ghaznavids settled 4,000 [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] families near Farana in Khorasan. By 1027, due to the Turkmen raiding neighbouring settlements, the governor of Tus, Abu l'Alarith Arslan Jadhib, led military strikes against them. The Turkmen were defeated and scattered to neighbouring lands.<ref>C.E. Bosworth, ''The Ghaznavids:994\u20131040'', (Edinburgh University Press, 1963), 224.</ref> Although, as late as 1033, Ghaznavid governor [[Tash Farrash]] executed fifty Turkmen chiefs for raids into Khorasan.<ref>C.E. Bosworth, ''The Ghaznavids:994\u20131040'', 225.</ref>\n\nThe wealth brought back from the Mahmud's [[India]]n expeditions to Ghazni was enormous, and contemporary historians (e.g. [[Abolfazl Beyhaghi]], [[Ferdowsi]]) give glowing descriptions of the magnificence of the capital and of the conqueror's munificent support of literature. Mahmud died in 1030.\n\n==Decline==\n\n===Twin sons of Mahmud===\n\nMahmud left the empire to his son Mohammed, who was mild, affectionate and soft. His brother, [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni|Mas'ud]], asked for three provinces that he had won by his sword, but his brother did not consent. Mas'ud had to fight his brother, and he became king, blinding and imprisoning Mohammed as punishment. Mas'ud was unable to preserve the empire and following a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] in 1040, he lost all the Ghaznavid lands in [[Iran]] and Central Asia to the Seljuks, plunging the realm into a \"time of troubles\".<ref name=\"EB\"/><ref name=\"Iranica\">''Encyclopedia Iranica'', [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ghaznavids \"Ghaznavids\"], Edmund Bosworth, Online Edition 2007</ref> His last act was to collect all his treasures from his forts in hope of assembling an army and ruling from India, but his own forces plundered the wealth and he proclaimed his blind brother as king again. The two brothers now exchanged positions: Mohammed was elevated from prison to the throne, while Mas'ud was consigned to a dungeon after a reign of ten years and was assassinated in 1040. Mas'ud's son, Madood, was governor of Balkh, and in 1040, after hearing of his father's death, he came to Ghazni to claim his kingdom. He fought with the sons of the blind Mohammed and was victorious. However, the empire soon disintegrated and most kings did not submit to Madood. In a span of nine years, four more kings claimed the throne of Ghazni.\n\n===Ibrahim===\nIn 1058, Mas'ud's son Ibrahim, a great calligrapher who wrote the Koran with his own pen, became king. Ibrahim re-established a truncated empire on a firmer basis by arriving at a peace agreement with the Seljuks and a restoration of cultural and political linkages.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> Under Ibrahim and his successors the empire enjoyed a period of sustained tranquility. Shorn of its western land, it was increasingly sustained by riches accrued from raids across Northern India, where it faced stiff resistance from Indian rulers such as the [[Paramara]] of [[Malwa]] and the [[Gahadvala]] of [[Kannauj]].<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> He ruled until 1098.\n\n===Masud===\nMasud III became king for sixteen years, with no major event in his lifetime.

In 1148 he was [[Battle of Ghazni (1148)|defeated in Ghazni]] by [[Sayf al-Din Suri]], but he recaptured the capital the next year. [[Ala al-Din Husayn]], a [[Ghorid]] King, [[Battle of Ghazni (1151)|conquered the city]] in 1151, for the revenge of his brother Kutubbuddin's death, who was son-in-law of the king but was publicly punished and killed for a minor offence. Ala al-Din Husayn then razed the city and burned it for 7 days, after which he became known as ''\"Jah\u0101nsuz\"'' (''World Burner''). Ghazni was restored to the Ghaznavids by the intervention of the Seljuks, who came to the aid of Bahram.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> Ghaznavid struggles with the Ghurids continued in subsequent years as they nibbled away at Ghaznavid territory, and Ghazni and [[Zabulistan]] was lost to a group of [[Oghuz Turks]] before captured by the Ghurids.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> Ghaznavid power in northwestern India continued until the Ghurid conquest of [[Lahore]] from Khusrau Malik in 1186.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/>\n\n==Military and tactics==\nThe core of the Ghaznavid army was primarily made up of Turks,<ref>Andre Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World'', Vol.2, (Brill, 2002), 114. {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> as well as thousands of native [[Afghan]]s who were trained and assembled from the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] in what is now Afghanistan.<ref name=\"Houtsma\">{{Cite book|title=E.J.

The Arabian horses, at least in the earliest campaign were still substansial in Ghaznavid military incursions especially in dashing raids deep into hostile territory. As evidenced there is a record about '6000 Arab horse' were sent against king Anandapala in 1008 AD and the existence of this Arabian cavalry persist until 1118 under Ghaznavid governor in [[Lahore]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wink |first1=Andr\u00e9 |title=Al-Hind: The Slavic Kings and the Islamic conquest, 11th-13th centuries |publisher=BRILL |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-391-04174-5 |pages=428 |edition=illustrated, reprint |url=https://books.google.com/?id=uQ7k2vQlYxEC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=ghurid+al+ansab |accessdate=22 June 2016 |ref=Bosworth, Ghaznavids, pp. 111-112; al Hind I, p. 111; TF p. 26; TYA p.332; TF p.50}}</ref>\n\nThere were, however, unique changes adopted that met the demands of the geographic situation of the Ghaznavid dynasty. Due to their access to the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Indus-Ganges plains]], the Ghaznavids, during the 11th and 12th centuries, developed the first Muslim army to use [[war elephants]] in battle. The elephants were protected by armour plating on their fronts.

New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.]]\nAccording to [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]:{{quote|The Ghaznavid sultans were ethnically [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]], but the sources, all in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Persian language|Persian]], do not allow us to estimate the persistence of Turkish practices and ways of thought amongst them. Yet given the fact that the essential basis of the Ghaznavids\u2019 military support always remained their Turkish soldiery, there must always have been a need to stay attuned to their troops\u2019 needs and aspirations; also, there are indications of the persistence of some Turkish literary culture under the early Ghaznavids (K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade, pp. 56\u201357). The sources do make it clear, however, that the sultans\u2019 exercise of political power and the administrative apparatus which gave it shape came very speedily to be within the Perso-Islamic tradition of statecraft and monarchical rule, with the ruler as a distant figure, buttressed by divine favor, ruling over a mass of traders, artisans, peasants, etc., whose prime duty was obedience in all respects but above all in the payment of taxes. The fact that the personnel of the [[bureaucracy]] which directed the day-to-day running of the state, and which raised the revenue to support the sultans\u2019 life-style and to finance the professional army, were [[Persian people|Persians]] who carried on the administrative traditions of the Samanids, only strengthened this conception of secular power.\n<br/>\n[[Persianization|Persianisation]] of the state apparatus was accompanied by the Persianisation of high culture at the Ghaznavid court... The level of literary creativity was just as high under Ebr\u0101h\u012bm and his successors up to Bahr\u0101m\u0161\u0101h, with such poets as Abu\u2019l-Faraj R\u016bn\u012b, San\u0101\u02be\u012b, \u02bfO\u1e6fm\u0101n Mo\u1e35t\u0101r\u012b, Mas\u02bf\u016bd-e Sa\u02bfd-e Salm\u0101n, and Sayyed \u1e24asan \u1e20aznav\u012b (Rypka, Hist. Iran. Lit., pp. 196\u201397; Bosworth, Later Ghaznavids, pp. 75\u201377, 107\u201310). We know from the biographical dictionaries of poets (ta\u1e0fkera-ye \u0161o\u02bfar\u0101) that the court in Lahore of \u1e34osrow Malek had an array of fine poets, none of whose d\u012bv\u0101ns has unfortunately survived, and the translator into elegant Persian prose of Ebn Moqaffa\u02bf\u2019s Kal\u012bla wa Demna, namely Abu\u2019l-Ma\u02bf\u0101l\u012b Na\u1e63r-All\u0101h b. Mo\u1e25ammad, served the sultan for a while as his chief secretary (Bosworth, Later Ghaznavids, pp. 127\u201328). The Ghaznavids thus present the phenomenon of a dynasty of Turkish slave origin which became culturally Persianised to a perceptibly higher degree than other contemporary dynasties of Turkish origin such as [[Seljuq Empire|Saljuqs]] and [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Qarakhanids]].<ref name=\"Ghaznavids\">[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E.

The Ghaznavid rulers are generally credited with spreading Islam into the [[Indian subcontinent]]. In addition to the wealth accumulated through raiding Indian cities, and exacting tribute from Indian [[raja]]s, the Ghaznavids also benefited from their position as an intermediary along the trade routes between China and the [[Mediterranean]]. They were, however, unable to hold power for long and by 1040 the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]]s had taken over their [[Persian Empire|Persian]] domains and a century later the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]] took over their remaining sub-continental lands.\n\n==List of rulers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | #\n! width=\"20%\" | Laqab\n! width=\"20%\" | Personal Name\n! width=\"15%\" | Reign\n! width=\"15%\" | Succession right\n! width=\"25%\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1\n| Nasir-ud-din\n{{Nastaliq|{{Nastaliq|\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646}}}}<br>''Defender of the Faith''\n| [[Sabuktigin]]\n| 977\u2013997\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2\n| No title\n| [[Ismail of Ghazni|Ismail]]\n| 997\u2013998\n| son of Sabuktigin\n|\n|-\n| 3\n| Yamin ad-Dawlah Abu Qasim<br>{{Nastaliq|\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633\u0645}}<br>''Right-hand man of the State''\n| [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]]\n| 998\u20131030\n| first son of Sabuktigin\n|\n|-\n| 4\n| Jalal ad-Dawlah<br>{{Nastaliq|\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1}}<br>''Dignity of the State''\n| [[Mohammad Ghaznavi|Muhammad]]\n| 1030<br>''1st reign''\n| second son of Mahmud\n|\n|-\n| 5\n| Shihab ad-Dawlah<br>{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06be\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1}}<br>''Star of the State''\n| [[Ma'sud I of Ghazni|Masud I]]\n| 1030\u20131041\n| first son of Mahmud\n| Was overthrown, imprisoned and executed, following the [[battle of Dandanaqan]]\n|-\n| \u2014\n| Jalal ad-Dawlah<br>{{Nastaliq|\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1}}<br>''Dignity of the State''\n| [[Mohammad Ghaznavi|Muhammad]]\n| 1041<br>''2nd reign''\n| second son of Mahmud\n| Raised to the throne following the removal of Masud I.\n|-\n| 6\n| Shihab ad-Dawlah<br>{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06be\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1}}<br>''Star of the State''\n| [[Maw'dud Ghaznavi|Mawdud]]\n| 1041\u20131048\n| son of Masud I\n| Defeated Muhammad at the battle of Nangrahar and gained the throne.<ref>C.E.

Samanid weakness attracted into Transoxiana the [[Karluks]], a Turkic people who had recently converted to Islam. They occupied [[Bukhara]] in 992, establishing in Transoxania the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAfter Alp Tigin's death in 963, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, followed by his slave [[Sabuktigin]], took the throne.

The 16th century Persian historian, [[Firishta]], records Sabuktigin's [[genealogy]] as descended from the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian kings]]: \"Subooktu-geen, the son of Jookan, the son of Kuzil-Hukum, the son of Kuzil-Arslan, the son of Ferooz, the son of [[Yazdegerd III|Yezdijird]], king of Persia.\" However, modern historians believe this was an attempt to connect himself with the history of old Persia.<ref>''The Development of Persian Culture under the Early Ghaznavids'', C. E. Bosworth, '''Iran''', Vol. 6, (1968), 40.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Sabuktigin, his son [[Ismail of Ghazni|Ismail]] claimed the throne for a temporary period, but he was defeated and captured by Mahmud in 998 at the [[Battle of Ghazni (998)|Battle of Ghazni]].\n\n===Mahmud son of Sabuktigin===\n{{Main|Mahmud of Ghazni}}\nIn 997, [[Mahmud of Ghaznavid|Mahmud]], another son of Sebuktigin, succeeded the throne,<ref>John Clark Marshman. The history of India ... to the accession of the Mogul dynasty, page 94</ref> and Ghazni and the Ghaznavid dynasty have become perpetually associated with him. He completed the conquest of the Samanid and Shahi territories, including the [[Ismaili]] Kingdom of [[Multan]], [[Sindh]], as well as some [[Buyid dynasty|Buwayhid]] territory. By all accounts, the rule of Mahmud was the golden age and height of the Ghaznavid Empire. Mahmud carried out seventeen expeditions through northern India to establish his control and set up tributary states, and his raids also resulted in the looting of a great deal of plunder. He established his authority from the borders of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] to [[Samarkand]], from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Yamuna]].\n\nDuring Mahmud's reign (997\u20131030), the Ghaznavids settled 4,000 [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] families near Farana in Khorasan. By 1027, due to the Turkmen raiding neighbouring settlements, the governor of Tus, Abu l'Alarith Arslan Jadhib, led military strikes against them. The Turkmen were defeated and scattered to neighbouring lands.<ref>C.E. Bosworth, ''The Ghaznavids:994\u20131040'', (Edinburgh University Press, 1963), 224.</ref> Although, as late as 1033, Ghaznavid governor [[Tash Farrash]] executed fifty Turkmen chiefs for raids into Khorasan.<ref>C.E. Bosworth, ''The Ghaznavids:994\u20131040'', 225.</ref>\n\nThe wealth brought back from the Mahmud's [[India]]n expeditions to Ghazni was enormous, and contemporary historians (e.g. [[Abolfazl Beyhaghi]], [[Ferdowsi]]) give glowing descriptions of the magnificence of the capital and of the conqueror's munificent support of literature. Mahmud died in 1030.\n\n==Decline==\n\n===Twin sons of Mahmud===\n\nMahmud left the empire to his son Mohammed, who was mild, affectionate and soft. His brother, [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni|Mas'ud]], asked for three provinces that he had won by his sword, but his brother did not consent. Mas'ud had to fight his brother, and he became king, blinding and imprisoning Mohammed as punishment. Mas'ud was unable to preserve the empire and following a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] in 1040, he lost all the Ghaznavid lands in [[Iran]] and Central Asia to the Seljuks, plunging the realm into a \"time of troubles\".<ref name=\"EB\"/><ref name=\"Iranica\">''Encyclopedia Iranica'', [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ghaznavids \"Ghaznavids\"], Edmund Bosworth, Online Edition 2007</ref> His last act was to collect all his treasures from his forts in hope of assembling an army and ruling from India, but his own forces plundered the wealth and he proclaimed his blind brother as king again. The two brothers now exchanged positions: Mohammed was elevated from prison to the throne, while Mas'ud was consigned to a dungeon after a reign of ten years and was assassinated in 1040. Mas'ud's son, Madood, was governor of Balkh, and in 1040, after hearing of his father's death, he came to Ghazni to claim his kingdom. He fought with the sons of the blind Mohammed and was victorious. However, the empire soon disintegrated and most kings did not submit to Madood. In a span of nine years, four more kings claimed the throne of Ghazni.\n\n===Ibrahim===\nIn 1058, Mas'ud's son Ibrahim, a great calligrapher who wrote the Koran with his own pen, became king. Ibrahim re-established a truncated empire on a firmer basis by arriving at a peace agreement with the Seljuks and a restoration of cultural and political linkages.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> Under Ibrahim and his successors the empire enjoyed a period of sustained tranquility. Shorn of its western land, it was increasingly sustained by riches accrued from raids across Northern India, where it faced stiff resistance from Indian rulers such as the [[Paramara]] of [[Malwa]] and the [[Gahadvala]] of [[Kannauj]].<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> He ruled until 1098.\n\n===Masud===\nMasud III became king for sixteen years, with no major event in his lifetime.

[[Ala al-Din Husayn]], a [[Ghorid]] King, [[Battle of Ghazni (1151)|conquered the city]] in 1151, for the revenge of his brother Kutubbuddin's death, who was son-in-law of the king but was publicly punished and killed for a minor offence. Ala al-Din Husayn then razed the city and burned it for 7 days, after which he became known as ''\"Jah\u0101nsuz\"'' (''World Burner'').

The Arabian horses, at least in the earliest campaign were still substansial in Ghaznavid military incursions especially in dashing raids deep into hostile territory.

New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.]]\nAccording to [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]:{{quote|The Ghaznavid sultans were ethnically [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]], but the sources, all in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Persian language|Persian]], do not allow us to estimate the persistence of Turkish practices and ways of thought amongst them. Yet given the fact that the essential basis of the Ghaznavids\u2019 military support always remained their Turkish soldiery, there must always have been a need to stay attuned to their troops\u2019 needs and aspirations; also, there are indications of the persistence of some Turkish literary culture under the early Ghaznavids (K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade, pp. 56\u201357). The sources do make it clear, however, that the sultans\u2019 exercise of political power and the administrative apparatus which gave it shape came very speedily to be within the Perso-Islamic tradition of statecraft and monarchical rule, with the ruler as a distant figure, buttressed by divine favor, ruling over a mass of traders, artisans, peasants, etc., whose prime duty was obedience in all respects but above all in the payment of taxes. The fact that the personnel of the [[bureaucracy]] which directed the day-to-day running of the state, and which raised the revenue to support the sultans\u2019 life-style and to finance the professional army, were [[Persian people|Persians]] who carried on the administrative traditions of the Samanids, only strengthened this conception of secular power.\n<br/>\n[[Persianization|Persianisation]] of the state apparatus was accompanied by the Persianisation of high culture at the Ghaznavid court... The level of literary creativity was just as high under Ebr\u0101h\u012bm and his successors up to Bahr\u0101m\u0161\u0101h, with such poets as Abu\u2019l-Faraj R\u016bn\u012b, San\u0101\u02be\u012b, \u02bfO\u1e6fm\u0101n Mo\u1e35t\u0101r\u012b, Mas\u02bf\u016bd-e Sa\u02bfd-e Salm\u0101n, and Sayyed \u1e24asan \u1e20aznav\u012b (Rypka, Hist. Iran. Lit., pp. 196\u201397; Bosworth, Later Ghaznavids, pp. 75\u201377, 107\u201310). We know from the biographical dictionaries of poets (ta\u1e0fkera-ye \u0161o\u02bfar\u0101) that the court in Lahore of \u1e34osrow Malek had an array of fine poets, none of whose d\u012bv\u0101ns has unfortunately survived, and the translator into elegant Persian prose of Ebn Moqaffa\u02bf\u2019s Kal\u012bla wa Demna, namely Abu\u2019l-Ma\u02bf\u0101l\u012b Na\u1e63r-All\u0101h b. Mo\u1e25ammad, served the sultan for a while as his chief secretary (Bosworth, Later Ghaznavids, pp. 127\u201328). The Ghaznavids thus present the phenomenon of a dynasty of Turkish slave origin which became culturally Persianised to a perceptibly higher degree than other contemporary dynasties of Turkish origin such as [[Seljuq Empire|Saljuqs]] and [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Qarakhanids]].<ref name=\"Ghaznavids\">[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E.

The Ghaznavid rulers are generally credited with spreading Islam into the [[Indian subcontinent]]. In addition to the wealth accumulated through raiding Indian cities, and exacting tribute from Indian [[raja]]s, the Ghaznavids also benefited from their position as an intermediary along the trade routes between China and the [[Mediterranean]]. They were, however, unable to hold power for long and by 1040 the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]]s had taken over their [[Persian Empire|Persian]] domains and a century later the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]] took over their remaining sub-continental lands.\n\n==List of rulers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | #\n! width=\"20%\" | Laqab\n! width=\"20%\" | Personal Name\n! width=\"15%\" | Reign\n! width=\"15%\" | Succession right\n! width=\"25%\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1\n| Nasir-ud-din\n{{Nastaliq|{{Nastaliq|\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646}}}}<br>''Defender of the Faith''\n| [[Sabuktigin]]\n| 977\u2013997\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2\n| No title\n| [[Ismail of Ghazni|Ismail]]\n| 997\u2013998\n| son of Sabuktigin\n|\n|-\n| 3\n| Yamin ad-Dawlah Abu Qasim<br>{{Nastaliq|\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633\u0645}}<br>''Right-hand man of the State''\n| [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]]\n| 998\u20131030\n| first son of Sabuktigin\n|\n|-\n| 4\n| Jalal ad-Dawlah<br>{{Nastaliq|\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1}}<br>''Dignity of the State''\n| [[Mohammad Ghaznavi|Muhammad]]\n| 1030<br>''1st reign''\n| second son of Mahmud\n|\n|-\n| 5\n| Shihab ad-Dawlah<br>{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06be\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1}}<br>''Star of the State''\n| [[Ma'sud I of Ghazni|Masud I]]\n| 1030\u20131041\n| first son of Mahmud\n| Was overthrown, imprisoned and executed, following the [[battle of Dandanaqan]]\n|-\n| \u2014\n| Jalal ad-Dawlah<br>{{Nastaliq|\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1}}<br>''Dignity of the State''\n| [[Mohammad Ghaznavi|Muhammad]]\n| 1041<br>''2nd reign''\n| second son of Mahmud\n| Raised to the throne following the removal of Masud I.\n|-\n| 6\n| Shihab ad-Dawlah<br>{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06be\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06c1}}<br>''Star of the State''\n| [[Maw'dud Ghaznavi|Mawdud]]\n| 1041\u20131048\n| son of Masud I\n| Defeated Muhammad at the battle of Nangrahar and gained the throne.<ref>C.E.

{"title_page": "Player efficiency rating", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\nThe '''player efficiency rating''' (PER) is [[John Hollinger]]'s all-in-one [[basketball]] rating, which attempts to boil down all of a player's contributions into one number. Using a detailed formula, Hollinger developed a system that rates every player's statistical performance.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html |title = Calculating PER |website =Basketball Reference|accessdate = 5 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nPER strives to measure a player's per-minute performance, while adjusting for pace.  A league-average PER is always 15.00, which permits comparisons of player performance across seasons.\n\nPER takes into account accomplishments, such as field goals, free throws, 3-pointers, assists, rebounds, blocks and steals, and negative results, such as missed shots, turnovers and personal fouls. The formula adds positive stats and subtracts negative ones through a statistical point value system. The rating for each player is then adjusted to a per-minute basis so that, for example, substitutes can be compared with starters in playing time debates. It is also adjusted for the team's pace. In the end, one number sums up the players' statistical accomplishments for that season.\n\n===Relationship to baseball sabermetrics ===\nHollinger's work has benefitted from the observations of [[sabermetric]] baseball analysts, such as [[Bill James]].  One of the primary observations is that traditional counting statistics in baseball, like runs batted in and wins, are not reliable indicators of a player's value.  For example, runs batted in is highly dependent upon opportunities created by a player's teammates.  PER extends this critique of counting statistics to basketball, noting that a player's opportunities to accumulate statistics are dependent upon the number of minutes played as well as the pace of the game.\n\n== Problems with PER ==\nPER largely measures offensive performance. Hollinger freely admits that two of the defensive statistics it incorporates\u2014blocks and steals (which was not tracked as an official stat until 1973)\u2014can produce a distorted picture of a player's value and that PER is not a reliable measure of a player's defensive acumen. For example, [[Bruce Bowen]], widely regarded as one of the best defenders in the NBA through the 2006\u201307 season, routinely posted single-digit PERs.\n\n<blockquote>Bear in mind that this rating is not the final, once-and-for-all answer for a player's accomplishments during the season. This is especially true for players such as Bruce Bowen and [[Trenton Hassell]] who are defensive specialists but don't get many blocks or steals.</blockquote>\n\nSome have argued that PER gives undue weight to a player's contribution in limited minutes, or against a team's second unit, and it undervalues players who have enough diversity in their game to play starter's minutes.\n\nPER has been said to reward inefficient shooting. To quote [[David Berri|Dave Berri]], the author of ''The Wages of Wins'':\n\n<blockquote>Hollinger argues that each two point field goal made is worth about 1.65 points. A three point field goal made is worth 2.65 points. A missed field goal, though, costs a team 0.72 points. Given these values, with a bit of math we can show that a player will break even on his two point field goal attempts if he hits on 30.4% of these shots. On three pointers the break-even point is 21.4%. If a player exceeds these thresholds, and virtually every NBA player does so with respect to two-point shots, the more he shoots the higher his value in PERs. So a player can be an inefficient scorer and simply inflate his value by taking a large number of shots.</blockquote>\n\nHollinger responded via a post on ESPN's TrueHoop blog:\n\n<blockquote>Berri leads off with a huge misunderstanding of PER\u2014that the credits and debits it gives for making and missing shots equate to a \u201cbreak-even\u201d shooting mark of 30.4% on 2-point shots. He made this assumption because he forgot that PER is calibrated against the rest of the league at the end of the formula.\n\nActually, if we took a player that was completely average in every other respect for the 2006\u201307 season\u2014rebounds, free throws, assists, turnovers, etc.\u2014and gave him a league-average rate of shots, and all of them were 2-pointers, and he shot 30.4%, he'd end up with a PER of 7.18. As long-time PER fans know, that would make him considerably worse than nearly every player in the league.\n\nTo end up with a league-average PER of 15.00, the actual break-even mark in this case is 48.5%, which is exactly what the league average is on 2-point shots this season.</blockquote>\n\n=== Reference guide ===\nHollinger has set up PER so that the league average, every season, is 15.00, which produces sort of a handy reference guide:<ref>[http://hardwoodparoxysm.com/2012/03/07/understanding-advanced-statistics-player-efficiency-rating/ Hardwood Paroxysm]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|All-time great season\n|35.0+\n|-\n|Runaway MVP candidate\n|30.0\u201335.0\n|-\n|Strong MVP candidate\n|27.5\u201330.0\n|-\n|Weak MVP candidate\n|25.0\u201327.5\n|-\n|Definite All-Star\n|22.5\u201325.0\n|-\n|Borderline All-Star\n|20.0\u201322.5\n|-\n|Second offensive option\n|18.0\u201320.0\n|-\n|Third offensive option\n|16.5\u201318.0\n|-\n|Slightly above-average player\n|15.0\u201316.5\n|-\n|Rotation player\n|13.0\u201315.0\n|-\n|Non-rotation player\n|11.0\u201313.0\n|-\n|Fringe roster player\n|9.0\u201311.0\n|-\n|Player who won't stick in the league\n|0\u20139.0\n|}\nOnly 21 times has a player posted a season efficiency rating over 30.0 (with more than 15 games played in that season), with the highest score being 31.82 ([[Wilt Chamberlain]]).

Some of the more important rule changes that should be considered include; some of the players on this list played before the three-point shot, blocks, and steals stats were officially recorded ([[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Bill Russell]], etc.). Blocked shots and steals were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1973\u201374 season. The three-point shot entered the league in 1979\u201380 season. During the 1990s and 2000s numerous rule changes were incorporated, the \"three point foul\" and \"clear path\" rules were both introduced in the 1995\u201396 season with the effect of increasing the number of free throws, hand-checking (the amount of contact a defender may make with an opposing player) was banned in 1994 and the use of elbows was banned in 1997 (both rules had seen various degrees of limitation by earlier rule changes) although neither was fully implemented until 2004. The 2004 rule changes, which also included calling the defensive 3 second rule (\"[...] a defensive player may not station himself in the key area longer than three seconds\"\u2014a longstanding rule which had been ignored by referees) had a major effect, opening up the game and allowing a more free-flowing offense; it encouraged aggressive inside attack based plays (to draw fouls), and has increased the number of fouls given when contact is made on players who drive to the basket.<ref>NBA.com - [http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_history.html NBA Rules History].

Using a detailed formula, Hollinger developed a system that rates every player's statistical performance.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html |title = Calculating PER |website =Basketball Reference|accessdate = 5 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nPER strives to measure a player's per-minute performance, while adjusting for pace.  A league-average PER is always 15.00, which permits comparisons of player performance across seasons.\n\nPER takes into account accomplishments, such as field goals, free throws, 3-pointers, assists, rebounds, blocks and steals, and negative results, such as missed shots, turnovers and personal fouls. The formula adds positive stats and subtracts negative ones through a statistical point value system. The rating for each player is then adjusted to a per-minute basis so that, for example, substitutes can be compared with starters in playing time debates. It is also adjusted for the team's pace. In the end, one number sums up the players' statistical accomplishments for that season.\n\n===Relationship to baseball sabermetrics ===\nHollinger's work has benefitted from the observations of [[sabermetric]] baseball analysts, such as [[Bill James]].  One of the primary observations is that traditional counting statistics in baseball, like runs batted in and wins, are not reliable indicators of a player's value.  For example, runs batted in is highly dependent upon opportunities created by a player's teammates.  PER extends this critique of counting statistics to basketball, noting that a player's opportunities to accumulate statistics are dependent upon the number of minutes played as well as the pace of the game.\n\n== Problems with PER ==\nPER largely measures offensive performance. Hollinger freely admits that two of the defensive statistics it incorporates\u2014blocks and steals (which was not tracked as an official stat until 1973)\u2014can produce a distorted picture of a player's value and that PER is not a reliable measure of a player's defensive acumen. For example, [[Bruce Bowen]], widely regarded as one of the best defenders in the NBA through the 2006\u201307 season, routinely posted single-digit PERs.\n\n<blockquote>\"Bear in mind that this rating is not the final, once-and-for-all answer for a player's accomplishments during the season. This is especially true for players such as Bruce Bowen and [[Trenton Hassell]] who are defensive specialists but don't get many blocks or steals.\"</blockquote>\n\nSome have argued that PER gives undue weight to a player's contribution in limited minutes, or against a team's second unit, and it undervalues players who have enough diversity in their game to play starter's minutes.\n\nPER has been said to reward inefficient shooting. To quote [[David Berri|Dave Berri]], the author of ''The Wages of Wins'':\n\n<blockquote>\"Hollinger argues that each two point field goal made is worth about 1.65 points. A three point field goal made is worth 2.65 points. A missed field goal, though, costs a team 0.72 points. Given these values, with a bit of math we can show that a player will break even on his two point field goal attempts if he hits on 30.4% of these shots. On three pointers the break-even point is 21.4%. If a player exceeds these thresholds, and virtually every NBA player does so with respect to two-point shots, the more he shoots the higher his value in PERs. So a player can be an inefficient scorer and simply inflate his value by taking a large number of shots.\"</blockquote>\n\nHollinger responded via a post on ESPN's TrueHoop blog:\n\n<blockquote>Berri leads off with a huge misunderstanding of PER\u2014that the credits and debits it gives for making and missing shots equate to a \u201cbreak-even\u201d shooting mark of 30.4% on 2-point shots. He made this assumption because he forgot that PER is calibrated against the rest of the league at the end of the formula.\n\nActually, if we took a player that was completely average in every other respect for the 2006\u201307 season\u2014rebounds, free throws, assists, turnovers, etc.\u2014and gave him a league-average rate of shots, and all of them were 2-pointers, and he shot 30.4%, he'd end up with a PER of 7.18. As long-time PER fans know, that would make him considerably worse than nearly every player in the league.\n\nTo end up with a league-average PER of 15.00, the actual break-even mark in this case is 48.5%, which is exactly what the league average is on 2-point shots this season.</blockquote>\n\n=== Reference guide ===\nHollinger has set up PER so that the league average, every season, is 15.00, which produces sort of a handy reference guide:<ref>[http://hardwoodparoxysm.com/2012/03/07/understanding-advanced-statistics-player-efficiency-rating/ Hardwood Paroxysm]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|All-time great season\n|35.0+\n|-\n|Runaway MVP candidate\n|30.0\u201335.0\n|-\n|Strong MVP candidate\n|27.5\u201330.0\n|-\n|Weak MVP candidate\n|25.0\u201327.5\n|-\n|Definite All-Star\n|22.5\u201325.0\n|-\n|Borderline All-Star\n|20.0\u201322.5\n|-\n|Second offensive option\n|18.0\u201320.0\n|-\n|Third offensive option\n|16.5\u201318.0\n|-\n|Slightly above-average player\n|15.0\u201316.5\n|-\n|Rotation player\n|13.0\u201315.0\n|-\n|Non-rotation player\n|11.0\u201313.0\n|-\n|Fringe roster player\n|9.0\u201311.0\n|-\n|Player who won't stick in the league\n|0\u20139.0\n|}\nOnly 21 times has a player posted a season efficiency rating over 30.0 (with more than 15 games played in that season), with the highest score being 31.82 ([[Wilt Chamberlain]]).

As the metric is averaged over the length of a player's entire career a decrease in efficiency later in his career means a player can move down in the ranking. For example, Jordan's PER took a big hit in the final two years of his career when he returned to the game with the [[Washington Wizards]], posting 20.7 in his penultimate season and 19.3 in his final season, compared to his career high of 31.7).<ref>Basketball Reference, \"[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html Michael Jordan]\" - Accessed 6 October 2013.</ref> The debate was intensified on 1 October 2013, with Jordan stating that he would have liked to have played against LeBron, and believes he would have won a one-on-one encounter.<ref>NBA.com - \"[http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/01/jordan-in-prime.ap/index.html Jordan proclaims he could beat LeBron in prime]\".

Some of the more important rule changes that should be considered include; some of the players on this list played before the three-point shot, blocks, and steals stats were officially recorded ([[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Bill Russell]], etc.). Blocked shots and steals were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1973\u201374 season. The three-point shot entered the league in 1979\u201380 season. During the 1990s and 2000s numerous rule changes were incorporated, the \"three point foul\" and \"clear path\" rules were both introduced in the 1995\u201396 season with the effect of increasing the number of free throws, hand-checking (the amount of contact a defender may make with an opposing player) was banned in 1994 and the use of elbows was banned in 1997 (both rules had seen various degrees of limitation by earlier rule changes) although neither was fully implemented until 2004. The 2004 rule changes, which also included calling the defensive 3 second rule (\"[...] a defensive player may not station himself in the key area longer than three seconds\"\u2014a longstanding rule which had been ignored by referees) had a major effect, opening up the game and allowing a more free-flowing offense; it encouraged aggressive inside attack based plays (to draw fouls), and has increased the number of fouls given when contact is made on players who drive to the basket.<ref>NBA.com - [http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_history.html NBA Rules History].

He has been a much-cited social scientist and one of the few individuals appointed permanent Academy Professor of the [[Academy of Finland]]. He retired in 2007 [http://117.53.171.142/aspr2008/docs/ASPR2008_Registration_Brochure.pdf], retaining a title of Academy Professor emeritus of the Academy of Finland.

A retirement symposium was held in his honor in 2008. Since 2008, he has been a Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the [[University of Tartu]], [[Estonia]], Visiting Professor at the Centre of Functionally Integrative Neurosciences (CFIN) of the [[Aarhus University|University of \u00c5rhus]], [[Denmark]], retaining a tertiary affiliation at the [[University of Helsinki]] as of May 2014,<ref>N\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen, R., Sussman, E., Salisbury, D., & L.

Gaillard]], and [[Sirkka M\u00e4ntysalo]] in reinterpretion of the prior findings of an early selective attention effect - discovered by Steven Hillyard<ref>Hillyard, S. A., Hink, R. F., Schwent, V.

MMN was shown to be elicited by deviant stimuli interspersed amongst a series of standards.\n\nMMN has influenced theories of language perception, together with studies of cognitive development and [[Theory of multiple intelligences|musical intelligence]]. Risto N\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen has been most interested in the clinical scope: abnormalities of MMN have been associated with [[alcoholism]], [[psychosis]] in [[schizophrenia]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[dyslexia]]. Facets of MMN have been associated with the prediction of waking in [[coma]]tose individuals - as has been hailed as a [http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/32514_en.html breakthrough] - yet MMN has remained a research tool and has not met criteria to determine clinical decisions about the continuation of life support.<ref>Morlet, D., & Fischer, C.
