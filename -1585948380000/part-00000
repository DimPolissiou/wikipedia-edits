Some men sing tenor even if they lack the full range, and sometimes low altos sing the tenor part.<ref name=Smith />{{page needed|date=April 2017}} In men's choruses that consist of four male vocal parts TTBB (tenor 1, tenor 2, bass 1, bass 2), tenors will often sing both in chest tone and falsetto, extending the vocal range of the choir.\n\n== Subtypes and roles in opera ==\nWithin the tenor voice type category are seven generally recognized subcategories: ''leggero'' tenor, lyric tenor, [[spinto]] tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, Mozart tenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. There is considerable overlap between the various categories of role and of voice-type; some tenor singers have begun with lyric voices but have transformed with time into spinto or even dramatic tenors.\n\n=== Leggero ===\nAlso known as the ''[[tenore di grazia]]'', the ''leggero'' tenor is essentially the male equivalent of a [[Coloratura soprano|lyric coloratura]]. This voice is light, agile, and capable of executing difficult passages of [[fioritura]]. The typical ''leggero'' tenor possesses a range spanning from approximately C3 to E5, with a few being able to sing up to F<sub>5</sub> or higher in [[Modal voice|full voice]]. In some cases, the chest register of the ''leggero'' tenor may extend below C<sub>3</sub>. Voices of this type are utilized frequently in the operas of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and in music dating from the [[Baroque]] period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n''Leggero'' tenor roles in operas:<ref name=Boldrey />{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n{{column list|colwidth=30em|\n* Arturo, ''[[I puritani]]'' ([[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]])\n* Count Almaviva, ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' (Rossini)\n* Count Ory, ''[[Le comte Ory]]'' (Rossini)\n* Ernesto, ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' ([[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]])\n* Elvino, ''[[La sonnambula]]'' (Bellini)\n* Henry Morosus, ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' ([[Richard Strauss|Strauss]])\n* Lindoro, ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' (Rossini)\n* Don Ramiro, ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' (Rossini)\n* Tonio, ''[[La fille du r\u00e9giment]]'' (Donizetti)\n}}\n\n=== {{anchor|Lyric tenor}} Lyric ===\nThe lyric tenor is a warm graceful voice with a bright, full timbre that is strong but not heavy and can be heard over an orchestra. Lyric tenors have a range from approximately the C one octave below middle C (C<sub>3</sub>) to the D one octave above middle C (D<sub>5</sub>). Similarly, their lower range may extend a few notes below the C<sub>3</sub>.

Spinto tenors have a darker timbre than a lyric tenor, without having a vocal color as dark as many (not all) dramatic tenors. The German equivalent of the Spinto ''[[fach]]'' is the ''{{Lang|de|Jugendlicher Heldentenor}}'' and encompasses many of the Dramatic tenor roles as well as some Wagner roles such as Lohengrin and Stolzing. The difference is often the depth and metal in the voice where some lyric tenors age or push their way into singing as a Spinto giving them a lighter tone and a ''{{Lang|de|Jugendlicher Heldentenor}}'' tends to be either a young heldentenor or true lyric spinto. Spinto tenors have a range from approximately the C one octave below middle C (C<sub>3</sub>) to the C one octave above middle C (C<sub>5</sub>).\n\nSpinto tenor roles in operas:<ref name=Boldrey />{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n{{column list|colwidth=30em|\n* Andrea Ch\u00e9nier, ''[[Andrea Ch\u00e9nier]]'' ([[Umberto Giordano|Giordano]])\n* Calaf, '' [[Turandot]]'' ([[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]])\n* Des Grieux, ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'' (Puccini)\n* Don Carlo, ''[[Don Carlos]]'' ([[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]])\n* Don Jos\u00e9, ''[[Carmen]]'' ([[Georges Bizet|Bizet]])\n* Erik, ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Der Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder]]'' ([[Richard Wagner|Wagner]])\n* Ernani, ''[[Ernani]]'' (Verdi)\n* Hermann, ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|Queen of Spades]]'' ([[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]])\n* Macduff, ''[[Macbeth (opera)]]'' (Verdi)\n* Manrico, ''[[Il trovatore]]'' (Verdi)\n* Mario Cavaradossi, ''[[Tosca]]'' (Puccini)\n* Max, ''[[Der Freisch\u00fctz]]'' ([[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]])\n* Pollione ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' ([[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]])\n* Radames ''[[Aida]]'' (Verdi)\n* Stiffelio ''[[Stiffelio]]'' (Verdi)\n* Gustavo, ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' (Verdi)\n* Turiddu, ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' ([[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]])\n}}\n\n=== {{anchor|Dramatic tenor}} Dramatic===\nAlso \"tenore di forza\" or \"robusto\", the dramatic tenor has an emotive, ringing and very powerful, clarion, heroic tenor sound.

As its name implies, the heldentenor vocal ''[[fach]]'' features in the German [[Romantische Oper|romantic operatic]] repertoire. The heldentenor is the German equivalent of the tenore drammatico, however with a more baritonal quality: the typical [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] protagonist. The keystone of the heldentenor's repertoire is arguably Wagner's ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'', an extremely demanding role requiring a wide vocal range and great power, plus tremendous stamina and acting ability. Often the heldentenor is a baritone who has transitioned to this ''fach'' or tenors who have been misidentified as baritones. Therefore, the heldentenor voice might or might not have facility up to high B or C.

Spinto tenors have a darker timbre than a lyric tenor, without having a vocal color as dark as many (not all) dramatic tenors. The German equivalent of the Spinto ''[[fach]]'' is the ''{{Lang|de|Jugendlicher Heldentenor}}'' and encompasses many of the Dramatic tenor roles as well as some Wagner roles such as Lohengrin and Stolzing. The difference is often the depth and metal in the voice where some lyric tenors age or push their way into singing as a Spinto giving them a lighter tone and a ''{{Lang|de|Jugendlicher Heldentenor}}'' tends to be either a young heldentenor or true lyric spinto.

Their lower range tends to extend into the baritone tessitura or, a few notes below the C3, even down to A\u266d2. Some dramatic tenors have a rich and dark tonal colour to their voice (such as the mature [[Enrico Caruso]]) while others (like [[Francesco Tamagno]]) possess a bright, steely timbre.\n\nDramatic tenor roles in operas:<ref name=Boldrey />{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n{{column list|colwidth=30em|\n* Canio, ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ([[Ruggero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]])\n* Dick Johnson, ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'' (Puccini)\n* Don Alvaro, ''[[La forza del destino]]'' ([[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]])\n* Florestan, ''[[Fidelio]]'' ([[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]])\n* En\u00e9e, ''[[Les Troyens]]'' ([[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]])\n* Otello, ''[[Otello]]'' (Verdi)\n* Peter Grimes, ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' ([[Benjamin Britten|Britten]])\n* Samson, ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson et Dalila]]'' ([[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]])\n}}\n\n=== Heldentenor ===\nThe heldentenor (English: ''heroic tenor'') has a rich, dark, powerful and dramatic voice. As its name implies, the heldentenor vocal ''[[fach]]'' features in the German [[Romantische Oper|romantic operatic]] repertoire. The heldentenor is the German equivalent of the tenore drammatico, however with a more baritonal quality: the typical [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] protagonist. The keystone of the heldentenor's repertoire is arguably Wagner's ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'', an extremely demanding role requiring a wide vocal range and great power, plus tremendous stamina and acting ability. Often the heldentenor is a baritone who has transitioned to this ''fach'' or tenors who have been misidentified as baritones. Therefore, the heldentenor voice might or might not have facility up to high B or C. The repertoire, however, rarely calls for such high notes.\n\nHeldentenor roles in operas:<ref name=Boldrey />{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n{{column list|colwidth=30em|\n* Florestan, ''[[Fidelio]]'' ([[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]])\n* Tannh\u00e4user, ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' ([[Richard Wagner|Wagner]])\n* Lohengrin, ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' (Wagner)\n* Siegmund, ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'' (Wagner)\n* Siegfried, ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'' (Wagner)\n* Siegfried, ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'' (Wagner)\n* Walther von Stolzing, ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'' (Wagner)\n* Tristan, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' (Wagner)\n* Parsifal, ''[[Parsifal]]'' (Wagner)\n* Aegisth, ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' ([[Richard Strauss|R.

In Mozart singing, the most important element is the instrumental approach of the vocal sound which implies: flawless and slender emission of sound, perfect intonation, legato, diction and phrasing, capability to cope with the dynamic requirements of the score, beauty of timbre, secure line of singing through perfect support and absolute breath control, musical intelligence, body discipline, elegance, nobility, agility and, most importantly, ability for dramatic expressiveness within the narrow borders imposed by the strict Mozartian style.\n\nThe German Mozart tenor tradition goes back to the end of the 1920s, when Mozart tenors started making use of Caruso's technique (a tenor who rarely sang Mozart) to achieve and improve the required dynamics and dramatic expressiveness.\n\nMozart tenor roles in operas:<ref name=Boldrey />{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n{{column list|colwidth=30em|\n* Spirit of Christianity, ''[[Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots]]''\n* Oebalus, ''[[Apollo et Hyacinthus]]''\n* Bastien, ''[[Bastien und Bastienne]]''\n* Fracasso, ''[[La finta semplice]]''\n* Mitridate, ''[[Mitridate, re di Ponto]]''\n* Aceste, ''[[Ascanio in Alba]]''\n* Scipione, ''[[Il sogno di Scipione]]''\n* Lucio Silla, ''[[Lucio Silla]]''\n* Belfiore, ''[[La finta giardiniera]]''\n* Don Anchise/ Il Podest\u00e0, ''[[La finta giardiniera]]''\n* Alessandro, ''[[Il re pastore]]''\n* Idomeneo, Idamante, ''[[Idomeneo]]''\n* Belmonte, ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]''\n* Pedrillo, ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' \n* Don Basilio, ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''\n* Don Curzio, ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''\n* Don Ottavio, ''[[Don Giovanni]]''\n* Ferrando, ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]''\n* Tito, ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]''\n* Tamino, ''[[The Magic Flute]]''\n* Monostatos, ''[[The Magic Flute]]''\n}}\n\n=== Tenor buffo or spieltenor ===\nA Tenor buffo or spieltenor is a tenor with good acting ability, and the ability to create distinct voices for his characters.
