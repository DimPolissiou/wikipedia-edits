It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

A panoramic view of a brightly-lit city is displayed, panning inside a confined apartment containing Janet Jackson and an AIBO. Jackson sings on top of the bed as objects in the room are individually displayed, including a descending glass shelf, a digital alarm clock, a magazine container, a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. During the chorus, Jackson grabs a beverage from the fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four women appear outside the door as Jackson exits her room, when the room darkens.\n\nThe five women dance through the apartment hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform. Beginning from the song's breakdown, the women perform a choreographed dance routine on the platform while it tilts in different directions. The scenes are interspersed with Jackson drawing an orange swirl towards the camera and the AIBO watching the film in the apartment, while in the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], various people are seen drawing orange swirls. Jackson is positioned inside the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from the film are displayed as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto the bed, with the AIBO resting in front.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

A panoramic view of a brightly-lit city is displayed, panning inside a confined apartment containing Janet Jackson and an AIBO. Jackson sings on top of the bed as objects in the room are individually displayed, including a descending glass shelf, a digital alarm clock, a magazine container, a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. During the chorus, Jackson grabs a beverage from the fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four women appear outside the door as Jackson exits her room, when the room darkens.\n\nThe five women dance through the apartment hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform. Beginning from the song's breakdown, the women perform a choreographed dance routine on the platform while it tilts in different directions. The scenes are interspersed with Jackson drawing an orange swirl towards the camera and the AIBO watching the film in the apartment, while in the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], various people are seen drawing orange swirls.

The issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective (see [[#Conditions_for_obtaining_a_Carrying_Permit]]).\n\nHowever, it is permissible to carry firearms in public or outdoors if the holder (art. 27 \u00a7 4 WG/LArm):\n* Has a valid hunting license and is carrying the firearm for hunting.\n* Is participating in a demonstration and is carrying the firearm in reference to a historical event.\n* Is participating in a shooting competition for air-soft guns, provided that the competition has a secure perimeter.\n* Is an airport security officer for an authorized country, a border patrol officer, or a game warden, who is carrying the firearm in the course of their employment.\n\nFurthermore, any licensed holder of a gun may ''transport'' an unloaded firearm for special situations (see [[#Transporting guns]]).\n\n====Conditions for obtaining a Carrying Permit====\nThere are three conditions (art. 27 \u00a7 2 WG/LArm):\n* fulfilling the conditions for a buying permit (see section above).\n* stating plausibly the need to carry firearms to protect oneself, other people, or real property from a specified danger.\n* passing an examination proving both weapon handling skills and knowledge regarding lawful use of the weapon.\n\nThe carrying permit remains valid for a term of five years (unless otherwise surrendered or revoked), and applies only to the type of firearm for which the permit was issued. Additional constraints may be invoked to modify any specific permit. (art. 27 \u00a7 3 WG/LArm).\n\n===Transporting guns===\nGuns may be transported in public as long as an appropriate justification is present. This means to transport a gun in public, the following requirements apply (art. 28 WG/LArm):\n* The gun must be unloaded and transported separately from any ammunition, with no ammunition being transported in a magazine.\n* The transport must be by a reasonable route and requires a valid purpose:\n** To or from courses or exercises in marksmanship, hunting or for military purposes.\n** To or from an army warehouse.\n** To show the gun to a possible buyer.\n** To or from a holder of a valid arms trade permit.\n** To or from a specific event, e.g. gun shows.\n** During change of residence.\n\n===EU firearm ban===\n{{Main|European Firearms Directive\n|European Firearms Directive#Amending Directive (EU) 2017/853}}\n\nA 2017 amendment to the [[European Firearms Directive]], known as the \"'''EU Gun Ban'''\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-security-finland-idUKKBN0TZ1L820151216| title=Finland seeks exception from EU gun ban  |work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseaa.ch/fr/33-news/63-eu-gun-ban-intervention-suisse-a-bruxelles| title=EU Gun Ban : Intervention Suisse \u00e0 Bruxelles |publisher=ASEAA|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://firearms-united.com/de/2016/12/22/trilogue-ends-eu-gun-ban/|title=Trilog schlie\u00dft die Verhandlungen zum \"EU-Gun ban\"|publisher=Firearms United|accessdate=2017-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312060112/https://firearms-united.com/de/2016/12/22/trilogue-ends-eu-gun-ban/|archive-date=12 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-gun-lobby-mobilizing-against-new-firearms-guns-weapons-rules/| title=Gun lobby stirs to life in Europe |publisher=Politico|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref> introduces new restrictions on firearms possession and acquisition, especially on semi-automatic firearms, personal defense weapons, magazine capacity, blank firing guns and historical firearms.

The issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective (see [[#Conditions_for_obtaining_a_Carrying_Permit]]).\n\nHowever, it is permissible to carry firearms in public or outdoors if the holder (art. 27 \u00a7 4 WG/LArm):\n* Has a valid hunting license and is carrying the firearm for hunting.\n* Is participating in a demonstration and is carrying the firearm in reference to a historical event.\n* Is participating in a shooting competition for air-soft guns, provided that the competition has a secure perimeter.\n* Is an airport security officer for an authorized country, a border patrol officer, or a game warden, who is carrying the firearm in the course of their employment.\n\nFurthermore, any licensed holder of a gun may ''transport'' an unloaded firearm for special situations (see [[#Transporting guns]]).\n\n====Conditions for obtaining a Carrying Permit====\nThere are three conditions (art. 27 \u00a7 2 WG/LArm):\n* fulfilling the conditions for a buying permit (see section above).\n* stating plausibly the need to carry firearms to protect oneself, other people, or real property from a specified danger.\n* passing an examination proving both weapon handling skills and knowledge regarding lawful use of the weapon.\n\nThe carrying permit remains valid for a term of five years (unless otherwise surrendered or revoked), and applies only to the type of firearm for which the permit was issued. Additional constraints may be invoked to modify any specific permit. (art. 27 \u00a7 3 WG/LArm).\n\n===Transporting guns===\nGuns may be transported in public as long as an appropriate justification is present. This means to transport a gun in public, the following requirements apply (art. 28 WG/LArm):\n* The gun must be unloaded and transported separately from any ammunition, with no ammunition being transported in a magazine.\n* The transport must be by a reasonable route and requires a valid purpose:\n** To or from courses or exercises in marksmanship, hunting or for military purposes.\n** To or from an army warehouse.\n** To show the gun to a possible buyer.\n** To or from a holder of a valid arms trade permit.\n** To or from a specific event, e.g. gun shows.\n** During change of residence.\n\n===EU firearm ban===\n{{Main|European Firearms Directive\n|European Firearms Directive#Amending Directive (EU) 2017/853}}\n\nA 2017 amendment to the [[European Firearms Directive]], known as the \"'''EU Gun Ban'''\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-security-finland-idUKKBN0TZ1L820151216| title=Finland seeks exception from EU gun ban  |work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseaa.ch/fr/33-news/63-eu-gun-ban-intervention-suisse-a-bruxelles| title=EU Gun Ban : Intervention Suisse \u00e0 Bruxelles |publisher=ASEAA|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://firearms-united.com/de/2016/12/22/trilogue-ends-eu-gun-ban/|title=Trilog schlie\u00dft die Verhandlungen zum \"EU-Gun ban\"|publisher=Firearms United|accessdate=2017-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312060112/https://firearms-united.com/de/2016/12/22/trilogue-ends-eu-gun-ban/|archive-date=12 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-gun-lobby-mobilizing-against-new-firearms-guns-weapons-rules/| title=Gun lobby stirs to life in Europe |publisher=Politico|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref> introduces new restrictions on firearms possession and acquisition, especially on semi-automatic firearms, personal defense weapons, magazine capacity, blank firing guns and historical firearms.

This was so that, in the case of an emergency, the militia could respond quickly.\n\n[[File:Stand-tir-p1000496.jpg|thumb|right|The federal shooting range of [[Versoix]], Switzerland; people come to such ranges to complete mandatory training (''Obligatorischeschiessen'') with service arms, or to shoot for sport and competition.]]\nIn December 2007, the [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided that the distribution of ammunition to soldiers would stop and that previously issued ammo would be returned. By March 2011, more than 99% of the ammo has been received.
