The station is the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] TV property of [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|Rajah Broadcasting Network, Inc.]], a broadcast company owned by long-time guitarist/musician [[Ramon Jacinto|Ramon \"RJ\" Jacinto]]. The station's broadcast facilities are located at the Ventures I Bldg., Makati Ave. cor. Gen. Luna St., [[Makati City]]; and the transmitter is situated at Brgy. San Roque, [[Antipolo City]], [[Rizal]].\n\nDZRJ-DTV began in 1993 as DZRJ-TV; which operated on analog channel 29 from 1993 to 2018. The RJ DigiTV network currently airs on test broadcast; and operates daily from 5:00 AM to 2:00 AM of the next day on DTTV, on cable and satellite TV.\n\n==Background==\n===First Years (1993-2008)===\nRamon \"RJ\" Jacinto's TV property began its test broadcast in April 1993 through UHF TV channel 29. The station then launched a month later as '''RJTV''' ('''R'''amon '''J'''acinto '''T'''ele'''V'''ision), an independent television channel focusing on music oriented shows, local news, talk shows, and the very first local ''Home TV Shopping'' program. \n\nOn July 3, 1995, RJTV went into niche programming and timeless television series, shopping and animation programs for children. At the time, the target market was kids during the day, and baby boomers at night. In 1997, due to the emergence of UHF competitors such as [[DWAC-TV]] and [[DWKC-TV]], RJTV went from traditional TV programming to specialized programs such as direct response companies and religious sectors. RJTV recognized the advent of specialized television \u2013 niche markets that identify specific needs of certain sectors.\n\nIn 2003, RJTV experimented with its new programming approach, as it simulcasted its sister FM station [[DZRJ-FM|RJ 100]], which started its new trend called the 'TeleRadyo' concept through RJ's own program ''RJ Online'' (now known as ''RJ Sunday Jam''; though it remains to air up to this day). It also became one of the channels who tried to conceptualize its interactive television approach, as it became a text-oriented interactive channel, first airing music videos, combined with the power of SMS messaging. Eventually, it aired programs simulcasted over RBN's radio station [[DZRJ-AM|DZRJ AM]] during mornings, shopping programs during afternoons and live entertainment programming during primetime, thus, the station adopted its slogan \"Interactive TV Station\".\n\n===Affiliation with Solar Entertainment (2008-2018)===\nOn January 1, 2008, [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]] approached RJTV to blocktime one of the former's television channels to the latter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&story_id=102344 |title=Solar joins ABC 5 And RJTV 29 |access-date=2007-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202173715/http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&story_id=102344 |archive-date=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=102946 2nd Avenue on free TV on RJTV 29] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121011426/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=102946 |date=2008-01-21 }}</ref> Months prior to the deal, [[SkyCable]] stated that they would offer less \"redundant\" programming and feature more series that had never been aired in the country before, but reports surfaced that channels operated by Solar were pulled due to a carriage dispute; SkyCable's owner, [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBN Corporation]], believed that Solar's lower fees for advertising on its channels were causing ABS-CBN to lose revenue. The new blocktime deal between RJTV, [[Radio Philippines Network]], [[Southern Broadcasting Network]], and Solar is said to be a part of the latter's retaliation to Sky. As a result, DZRJ-TV became a network-affiliated station for the first time in its history. The blocktime deal integrated Solar's [[2nd Avenue (television network)|2nd Avenue]] to RJTV's programming. The said deal, however, closed down the station's Venture I broadcast facility and initially transferred its master control to Solar Entertainment's downlink facility in Antipolo prior to another transfer in 2012 to Solar's current playout facilities at Worldwide Corporate Center in [[Mandaluyong]].\n\nOn September 9, 2012, the station temporarily ceased broadcasting together with [[DWVN-TV|DWVN-TV 45]]. It was found out that the channel 45 facility was struck by a lightning bolt, and had to shut off both station's transmitters for repair and inspection. The station returned on-air in the morning of November 21.\n\nIn 2015, DZRJ-TV shut down its former in-house transmitter, and began leasing transmission from the Solar-owned transmitter tower also within [[Antipolo City]], sharing transmission with Solar's subsidiary, [[Southern Broadcasting Network]]. Solar provided the upgrade to provide a clearer and better signal reception for SBN and RJTV in both analog and digital signals.\n\n===Return to independent broadcasting (2018-present) ===\nIn May 2018, Solar Entertainment launched its own premium digital terrestrial TV service [[Easy TV (Philippines)|Easy TV]]. When the service promoted ETC and most of Solar's operated and distributed channels, 2nd Avenue was not included into the lineup. Solar and RJTV later announced their plans for the channel: 2nd Avenue would end all regularly scheduled programming (coinciding the mid-season break of US Television's primetime programming) and terrestrial transmission by June 5, while provincial cable and satellite providers would be provided with a lifeline service until June 30 featuring marathons of the channel's former inventory; after June 5, RJTV's affiliation deal with Solar would expire and would return to independence.\n\nThe newly-reformatted RJTV began airing at 12 midnight of June 5, with TV Shop Philippines as its first program to air during the test broadcast, followed by re-run of some of the local programs from RJTV's inventory, including Pinoy Wrestling and RJ's concert specials. RJAM and RJFM's programs were also aired on the new channel. During its initial run, RJDigiTV operated 24/7.\n\nOriginally scheduled in July 2018, RJTV relaunched on January 3, 2019 with the first 2 subchannels, the main RJTV channel and Oras ng Himala channel, and later, the TeleRadyo channels of their sister radio stations [[DZRJ-AM]] and [[DZRJ-FM]]. It became the 2nd television station in the Philippines to end its analog transmission and went full-blown on its digital television broadcasts (more than a year after [[DZOZ-DTV|Light TV 33]], though it still beams on analog through its provincial UHF stations).\n\n==Current programming==\n{{main|List of programs broadcast by RJTV}}\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE INFORMATION BEYOND THIS AREA.-->\nDZRJ-TV operates on UHF Channel 29 (563.143&nbsp;MHz), and is multiplexed thru the following subchannels:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n![[Digital subchannel#United States|Channel]]\n![[Display resolution|Video]]\n![[Aspect ratio (image)|Aspect]]\n![[Program and System Information Protocol#What PSIP does|PSIP Short Name]]\n!

During its initial test, Solar placed both SBN and RJTV in its DWCP-TV digital signal on channel 22. For unknown reasons, the transmitter's encryption system was activated throughout its run, making two of the station's subchannels receivable only on set-top boxes with this capability. The technical issue was fixed by September 25, 2017.\n\nAround the last quarter of 2017, Solar launched a second test transmission signal (on behalf of RJTV) on channel 30, although it remained sharing transmitter facilities with SBN. However, RJTV announced in May 2018 that the station's analog signal would be shut down after 2nd Avenue programming closed down.\n\nDZRJ-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 29, at 1:05 am of June 5, 2018. Its subchannels on digital channel 30, including the license, was returned immediately to Solar after the analog shutoff. The shutdown was rumored to be done at midnight of the same day after a short promo of 2nd Avenue's impending closure, but miscommunication on when to pull the plug resulted in the station to be shut off on its regular 1:00 am sign off.\n\nInitially, the station would flash cut its digital signal on July 15, 2018 to the former analog channel, but numerous delays in the installation of their digital transmitter postponed the transmission during the 1st quarter of 2019. On January 3, 2019, RJTV finally made a flash cut sequence on its digital signal for post-transition operations, yet technical modifications were made to address audio issues with several integrated TV sets, mobile DTVs, and digital set-top box devices. Currently, DZRJ-DTV started broadcasting digitally with first 3 channels, the main RJTV channel the Oras ng Himala channel, [[DZRJ-AM|DZRJ RadioVision]] and Rock of Manila TV. The upcoming subchannels of [[DZRJ-FM|RJFM 100.3]] and TV Shop Philippines shall be commenced on 2nd Quarter of 2020.\n\n==RJTV Previous Programs==\n{{main|List of programs previously broadcast by RJTV}}\n\n==RJTV stations nationwide==\n{{Main|Rajah Broadcasting Network#RBN Stations nationwide}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rajah Broadcasting Network]]\n* [[DZRJ-AM|DZRJ-AM 810 kHz]]\n* [[DZRJ-FM|RJFM 100.3]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|www.rjplanet.com}}\n\n{{Television in the Philippines}}\n{{Metro Manila TV}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:DZRJ-TV}}\n[[Category:1993 establishments in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Metro Manila]]\n[[Category:2nd Avenue (television channel) stations]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1993]]\n[[Category:Digital television stations in the Philippines]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox broadcast \n| call_letters             = DZRJ-DTV (RJ DigiTV)\n| location                 = [[Metro Manila]]\n| city                     = [[Makati|Makati City]]\n| station_branding         = ''RJTV''<br>''RJ DigiTV''\n| digital                  = 29 ([[UHF]]) (''[[ISDB-T]]'') (Test Broadcast)\n| virtual                  = 29\n| subchannels              = 29.01: RJ DigiTV<br>29.02: Oras ng Himala Channel<br>29.03: [[DZRJ-AM|Radyo Bandido TV]]<br>29.04: RJ Rock TV<br>29.05: [[TV Maria]]<br>29.06: \n[[Nickelodeon Asia]]<br>29.07: [[MTV Asia]]<br>29.31: RJTV <small>([[1seg]])</small>\n| affiliations             =  [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|RJTV]] ([[Independent station|Independent]])\n| owner                    = [[Rajah Broadcasting Network]]\n| founded                  = {{Start date and age|1993|05}} (analog) \n| airdate = May 1993 (analog)<br>January 3, 2019 (digital)\n| enddate = {{Start date and age|2018|06|04}} (analog)\n| callsign_meaning         = '''DZ'''<br />'''R'''amon<br /> '''J'''acinto<br />(owner and founder of RBN, also taken from sister [[DZRJ-AM|AM]] and [[DZRJ-FM|FM radio stations]])\n| sister_stations            =[[DZRJ-AM]], [[DZRJ-FM]] \n| former_affiliations      = [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]] (2008-2018) \n| former_callsigns = DZRJ-TV (1993-2018)\n| former_channel_numbers =  {{ubl|'''Analog:'''|29 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]], 1993\u20132018)}}\n| effective_radiated_power = 5&nbsp;KW TPO <br> (10&nbsp;kW ERP)\n| homepage                 = [http://www.rjplanet.com www.RJplanet.com] |\n}}\n\n'''DZRJ-DTV''' (digital [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and virtual channel 29) is an [[Independent station|independent]] television station licensed to [[Makati|Makati City, Philippines]]. The station is the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] TV property of [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|Rajah Broadcasting Network, Inc.]], a broadcast company owned by long-time guitarist/musician [[Ramon Jacinto|Ramon \"RJ\" Jacinto]]. The station's broadcast facilities are located at the Ventures I Bldg., Makati Ave. cor. Gen. Luna St., [[Makati City]]; and the transmitter is situated at Brgy. San Roque, [[Antipolo City]], [[Rizal]].\n\nDZRJ-DTV began in 1993 as DZRJ-TV; which operated on analog channel 29 from 1993 to 2018. The RJ DigiTV network currently airs on test broadcast; and operates daily from 5:00 AM to 2:00 AM of the next day on DTTV, on cable and satellite TV.\n\n==Background==\n===First Years (1993-2008)===\nRamon \"RJ\" Jacinto's TV property began its test broadcast in April 1993 through UHF TV channel 29. The station then launched a month later as '''RJTV''' ('''R'''amon '''J'''acinto '''T'''ele'''V'''ision), an independent television channel focusing on music oriented shows, local news, talk shows, and the very first local ''Home TV Shopping'' program. \n\nOn July 3, 1995, RJTV went into niche programming and timeless television series, shopping and animation programs for children. At the time, the target market was kids during the day, and baby boomers at night. In 1997, due to the emergence of UHF competitors such as [[DWAC-TV]] and [[DWKC-TV]], RJTV went from traditional TV programming to specialized programs such as direct response companies and religious sectors. RJTV recognized the advent of specialized television \u2013 niche markets that identify specific needs of certain sectors.\n\nIn 2003, RJTV experimented with its new programming approach, as it simulcasted its sister FM station [[DZRJ-FM|RJ 100]], which started its new trend called the 'TeleRadyo' concept through RJ's own program ''RJ Online'' (now known as ''RJ Sunday Jam''; though it remains to air up to this day). It also became one of the channels who tried to conceptualize its interactive television approach, as it became a text-oriented interactive channel, first airing music videos, combined with the power of SMS messaging. Eventually, it aired programs simulcasted over RBN's radio station [[DZRJ-AM|DZRJ AM]] during mornings, shopping programs during afternoons and live entertainment programming during primetime, thus, the station adopted its slogan \"Interactive TV Station\".\n\n===Affiliation with Solar Entertainment (2008-2018)===\nOn January 1, 2008, [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]] approached RJTV to blocktime one of the former's television channels to the latter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&story_id=102344 |title=Solar joins ABC 5 And RJTV 29 |access-date=2007-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202173715/http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&story_id=102344 |archive-date=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=102946 2nd Avenue on free TV on RJTV 29] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121011426/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=102946 |date=2008-01-21 }}</ref> Months prior to the deal, [[SkyCable]] stated that they would offer less \"redundant\" programming and feature more series that had never been aired in the country before, but reports surfaced that channels operated by Solar were pulled due to a carriage dispute; SkyCable's owner, [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBN Corporation]], believed that Solar's lower fees for advertising on its channels were causing ABS-CBN to lose revenue. The new blocktime deal between RJTV, [[Radio Philippines Network]], [[Southern Broadcasting Network]], and Solar is said to be a part of the latter's retaliation to Sky. As a result, DZRJ-TV became a network-affiliated station for the first time in its history. The blocktime deal integrated Solar's [[2nd Avenue (television network)|2nd Avenue]] to RJTV's programming. The said deal, however, closed down the station's Venture I broadcast facility and initially transferred its master control to Solar Entertainment's downlink facility in Antipolo prior to another transfer in 2012 to Solar's current playout facilities at Worldwide Corporate Center in [[Mandaluyong]].\n\nOn September 9, 2012, the station temporarily ceased broadcasting together with [[DWVN-TV|DWVN-TV 45]]. It was found out that the channel 45 facility was struck by a lightning bolt, and had to shut off both station's transmitters for repair and inspection. The station returned on-air in the morning of November 21.\n\nIn 2015, DZRJ-TV shut down its former in-house transmitter, and began leasing transmission from the Solar-owned transmitter tower also within [[Antipolo City]], sharing transmission with Solar's subsidiary, [[Southern Broadcasting Network]]. Solar provided the upgrade to provide a clearer and better signal reception for SBN and RJTV in both analog and digital signals.\n\n===Return to independent broadcasting (2018-present) ===\nIn May 2018, Solar Entertainment launched its own premium digital terrestrial TV service [[Easy TV (Philippines)|Easy TV]]. When the service promoted ETC and most of Solar's operated and distributed channels, 2nd Avenue was not included into the lineup. Solar and RJTV later announced their plans for the channel: 2nd Avenue would end all regularly scheduled programming (coinciding the mid-season break of US Television's primetime programming) and terrestrial transmission by June 5, while provincial cable and satellite providers would be provided with a lifeline service until June 30 featuring marathons of the channel's former inventory; after June 5, RJTV's affiliation deal with Solar would expire and would return to independence.\n\nThe newly-reformatted RJTV began airing at 12 midnight of June 5, with TV Shop Philippines as its first program to air during the test broadcast, followed by re-run of some of the local programs from RJTV's inventory, including Pinoy Wrestling and RJ's concert specials. RJAM and RJFM's programs were also aired on the new channel. During its initial run, RJDigiTV operated 24/7.\n\nOriginally scheduled in July 2018, RJTV relaunched on January 3, 2019 with the first 2 subchannels, the main RJTV channel and Oras ng Himala channel, and later, the TeleRadyo channels of their sister radio stations [[DZRJ-AM]] and [[DZRJ-FM]]. It became the 2nd television station in the Philippines to end its analog transmission and went full-blown on its digital television broadcasts (more than a year after [[DZOZ-DTV|Light TV 33]], though it still beams on analog through its provincial UHF stations).\n\n==Current programming==\n{{main|List of programs broadcast by RJTV}}\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE INFORMATION BEYOND THIS AREA.-->\nDZRJ-TV operates on UHF Channel 29 (563.143&nbsp;MHz), and is multiplexed thru the following subchannels:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n![[Digital subchannel#United States|Channel]]\n![[Display resolution|Video]]\n![[Aspect ratio (image)|Aspect]]\n![[Program and System Information Protocol#What PSIP does|PSIP Short Name]]\n!

During its initial test, Solar placed both SBN and RJTV in its DWCP-TV digital signal on channel 22. For unknown reasons, the transmitter's encryption system was activated throughout its run, making two of the station's subchannels receivable only on set-top boxes with this capability. The technical issue was fixed by September 25, 2017.\n\nAround the last quarter of 2017, Solar launched a second test transmission signal (on behalf of RJTV) on channel 30, although it remained sharing transmitter facilities with SBN. However, RJTV announced in May 2018 that the station's analog signal would be shut down after 2nd Avenue programming closed down.\n\nDZRJ-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 29, at 1:05 am of June 5, 2018. Its subchannels on digital channel 30, including the license, was returned immediately to Solar after the analog shutoff. The shutdown was rumored to be done at midnight of the same day after a short promo of 2nd Avenue's impending closure, but miscommunication on when to pull the plug resulted in the station to be shut off on its regular 1:00 am sign off.\n\nInitially, the station would flash cut its digital signal on July 15, 2018 to the former analog channel, but numerous delays in the installation of their digital transmitter postponed the transmission during the 1st quarter of 2019. On January 3, 2019, RJTV finally made a flash cut sequence on its digital signal for post-transition operations, yet technical modifications were made to address audio issues with several integrated TV sets, mobile DTVs, and digital set-top box devices. Currently, DZRJ-DTV started broadcasting digitally with first 3 channels, the main RJTV channel the Oras ng Himala channel, [[DZRJ-AM|DZRJ RadioVision]] and Rock of Manila TV.

Instead of taking the Kassala Road, a well established track leading southward out of Suakin and thence diverting southwest along a route that Graham had taken the year before (1884) when he fought against Osman Digna at the [[Battle of Tamai]], he instructed McNeill to head southwestwards out of Suakin into virgin country.<ref name=\"galloway31\">Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ.

Indian troops were positioned along the northern, southern and western perimeters of the (unfinished) zeriba.  The two redoubts were manned by British troops \u2013 the Royal Marine Light Infantry in the completed northern redoubt and half of the Berkshire battalion in the uncompleted southern one.  Working parties of engineers and others were completing the zeriba's walls.  Outside the zeriba, on the eastern side, the other half the Berkshire battalion guarded the camels and mules, preventing them from straying into the bush as they awaited the march back to Suakin.<ref name=\"Galloway W. 1885, p.64\"/>\n\nBy 2:00pm, the northeastern redoubt was largely complete, and work was concentrated on the southern one.  With their rifles piled inside the redoubt, parties of men were at work out on the western edge of the clearing out in front of the Sikh lines, felling trees to complete the redoubt.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.65</ref>  It was expected that the southern redoubt would have been completed by 3:00pm, when the second half of the Berkshire battalion would withdraw inside it while the transport returned to Suakin under the protection of the Cavalry, Engineers, Indian battalions and others.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.66</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nAround 2:45 pm scouting Lancers reported to McNeill that the enemy was gathering south and west of the zeriba and advancing towards it.  McNeill immediately ordered all working parties to retreat back into the zeriba and to take up their arms, when at the same moment the Cavalry galloped into the clearing with large numbers of Arabs hard on their heels.<ref name=\"galloway68\">Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.68</ref>\n\nThe main attack came from the south and west of the zeriba.  The British and Indian troops held their ground except for the Bengal contingent lined up on the south side, who were thrown into disorder by the Cavalry and Arabs charging through their lines.  After firing a few scattered volleys, the Bengalese turned and fled for cover inside the zeriba.<ref name=\"galloway68\"/>\n\nLarge numbers of Arabs who had forced entry into the southern redoubt were quickly dispatched by the half-battalion of Berkshires defending it, 112 bodies later being counted inside the enclosure.  Meanwhile, the Arabs succeeded in stampeding the transport animals towards the central square and the northern redoubt, thereby gaining cover for themselves as they attacked from the eastern side.  An eyewitness recalled: \"Everything seemed to come at once: camels, transport of all kinds, water carts, ammunition mules, 17th Native Infantry, Madras Sappers, sick-bearers, Transport Corps, Cavalry and Arabs fighting in the midst.  All these passed close to me, and went out on the other side of the zeriba, carrying away with them a number of the Marines and Officers who eventually got together and returned.  The dust raised by this crowd was so great that I couldn't see anything beyond our zeriba for a minute or two, and it was impossible to see who was standing or what was likely to happen.  The men behaved splendidly and stood quite still.  It was the highest test of discipline I shall ever see.\"<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.74</ref>\n\nBy 3:15pm after an engagement lasting no more than 25 minutes, the battle ended.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.77</ref>  The Arabs lingered for another hour threatening further action, but at 4:15 they finally withdrew leaving large numbers of their dead and wounded behind.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.79</ref>  Further isolated attacks were made by injured Arabs and by some feigning death, it being reported that \"when our men sought to afford aid to some of the enemy who could not walk, the latter crawled towards them with their spears between their teeth, striving even yet to slay a Kaffir.\"<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ.

Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.88</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIt was estimated that over 1000 Mahdists died out of an attacking force in excess of 2000.  The tally of dead and wounded amongst the British and Indian troops was more accurately estimated as follows:\n* Killed: 4 officers, 66 men, plus 34 \"followers\";\n* Injured: 8 officers, 125 men, plus 18 \"followers\";\n* Missing: 1 officer, 35 men, plus 122 \"followers\".<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.335.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the missing, including large numbers of \"followers\" (camel drivers etc.) were subsequently found, however the above figures for dead and wounded were almost certainly underestimates since they were produced immediately after the battle and therefore did not include those who subsequently died of their injuries, or those among the missing who were later found dead or injured.\n\nThe following day the British buried their dead to the northern and western sides of the zeriba, while the Indians cremated theirs according to their custom.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.89.</ref>  The bulk of the force then returned to Suakin bringing the wounded with them.\n\nThe zeriba remained garrisoned until 6 April after which it was abandoned.  On 1 May, a reconnaissance party passed by the site to find that the zeriba had been burned and destroyed by the enemy, ending its short and rather purposeless existence.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ.

It appears that the writer's intention was to correct several erroneous statements that appeared in both official and press reports of the battle.  Galloway was particularly critical of General Graham's planning of the Tofrek expedition on three counts:<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. pp.24\u201325.</ref>\n\n# Compared to the earlier expedition to Hashin which Graham commanded himself, which had been protected by four squadrons of British cavalry and a regiment of Bengal cavalry acting as scouts, the Tofrek expedition which he delegated to the command of General McNeill had only one squadron of Lancers plus a company of Mounted Infantry to provide warning of enemy activity;\n# Whereas Graham had the protection of a battery of Royal Horse Artillery able to shell the enemy at long range, no artillery was assigned to McNeill's force;\n# Whereas the ratio of men to transport animals had been over 5:1 in the earlier expedition, it was no more than 2:1 for the later one, resulting in much greater difficulties in keeping control of the animals.\n\nGalloway was even more critical of Graham for his last-minute change to McNeill's marching orders when he instructed the column to march southwestwards into uncharted territory instead of following the established track towards Tamai as originally planned, and which Graham himself had used when attacking [[Battle of Tamai|Tamai]] the year before.<ref name=\"galloway31\"/>  In consequence McNeill and his troops found themselves struggling through a jungle of mimosa bushes with long low-lying branches covered in sharp thorns which made progress both slow and difficult while affording the enemy excellent cover for the surprise attack that they launched later in the day.\n\nGalloway also claimed that intelligence reports that the enemy was planning a major attack on the 22nd March were not passed on to McNeill before he left Suakin.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ.

Outside the zeriba, on the eastern side, the other half the Berkshire battalion guarded the camels and mules, preventing them from straying into the bush as they awaited the march back to Suakin.<ref name=\"Galloway W. 1885, p.64\"/>\n\nBy 2:00pm, the northeastern redoubt was largely complete, and work was concentrated on the southern one.  With their rifles piled inside the redoubt, parties of men were at work out on the western edge of the clearing out in front of the Sikh lines, felling trees to complete the redoubt.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.65</ref>  It was expected that the southern redoubt would have been completed by 3:00pm, when the second half of the Berkshire battalion would withdraw inside it while the transport returned to Suakin under the protection of the Cavalry, Engineers, Indian battalions and others.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.66</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nAround 2:45 pm scouting Lancers reported to McNeill that the enemy was gathering south and west of the zeriba and advancing towards it.  McNeill immediately ordered all working parties to retreat back into the zeriba and to take up their arms, when at the same moment the Cavalry galloped into the clearing with large numbers of Arabs hard on their heels.<ref name=\"galloway68\">Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.68</ref>\n\nThe main attack came from the south and west of the zeriba.  The British and Indian troops held their ground except for the Bengal contingent lined up on the south side, who were thrown into disorder by the Cavalry and Arabs charging through their lines.  After firing a few scattered volleys, the Bengalese turned and fled for cover inside the zeriba.<ref name=\"galloway68\"/>\n\nLarge numbers of Arabs who had forced entry into the southern redoubt were quickly dispatched by the half-battalion of Berkshires defending it, 112 bodies later being counted inside the enclosure.  Meanwhile, the Arabs succeeded in stampeding the transport animals towards the central square and the northern redoubt, thereby gaining cover for themselves as they attacked from the eastern side.  An eyewitness recalled: \"Everything seemed to come at once: camels, transport of all kinds, water carts, ammunition mules, 17th Native Infantry, Madras Sappers, sick-bearers, Transport Corps, Cavalry and Arabs fighting in the midst.  All these passed close to me, and went out on the other side of the zeriba, carrying away with them a number of the Marines and Officers who eventually got together and returned.  The dust raised by this crowd was so great that I couldn't see anything beyond our zeriba for a minute or two, and it was impossible to see who was standing or what was likely to happen.  The men behaved splendidly and stood quite still.  It was the highest test of discipline I shall ever see.\"<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.74</ref>\n\nBy 3:15pm after an engagement lasting no more than 25 minutes, the battle ended.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.77</ref>  The Arabs lingered for another hour threatening further action, but at 4:15 they finally withdrew leaving large numbers of their dead and wounded behind.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.79</ref>  Further isolated attacks were made by injured Arabs and by some feigning death, it being reported that \"when our men sought to afford aid to some of the enemy who could not walk, the latter crawled towards them with their spears between their teeth, striving even yet to slay a Kaffir.\"<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.82</ref>  One officer was killed by an Arab who had lain outside the zeriba pretending to be dead.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.88</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIt was estimated that over 1000 Mahdists died out of an attacking force in excess of 2000.  The tally of dead and wounded amongst the British and Indian troops was more accurately estimated as follows:\n* Killed: 4 officers, 66 men, plus 34 \"followers\";\n* Injured: 8 officers, 125 men, plus 18 \"followers\";\n* Missing: 1 officer, 35 men, plus 122 \"followers\".<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.335.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the missing, including large numbers of \"followers\" (camel drivers etc.) were subsequently found, however the above figures for dead and wounded were almost certainly underestimates since they were produced immediately after the battle and therefore did not include those who subsequently died of their injuries, or those among the missing who were later found dead or injured.\n\nThe following day the British buried their dead to the northern and western sides of the zeriba, while the Indians cremated theirs according to their custom.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.89.</ref>  The bulk of the force then returned to Suakin bringing the wounded with them.\n\nThe zeriba remained garrisoned until 6 April after which it was abandoned.  On 1 May, a reconnaissance party passed by the site to find that the zeriba had been burned and destroyed by the enemy, ending its short and rather purposeless existence.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. pp.343\u2013344.</ref>\n\nWithin two months, the [[William Ewart Gladstone#Second premiership (1880\u20131885)|Gladstone government]], in pursuing its anti-imperialist policies, took the opportunity provided by the [[Panjdeh incident|Panjdeh crisis]] to abandon both the railway and Britain's military campaign in Sudan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=R.|last2=Hill|first2=R.H.|jstor=41716376|title=The Suakin-Berber Railway, 1885 |journal=Sudan Notes and Records|volume= 20|issue= 1|year=1937|publisher=University of Khartoum|p=119}}</ref>  General Graham and his Suakin Field Force were evacuated from the port city on 17 May 1885.\n\n===Post Mortem===\nThe book \"The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885\" by William Galloway was written shortly after the battle.  It appears that the writer's intention was to correct several erroneous statements that appeared in both official and press reports of the battle.  Galloway was particularly critical of General Graham's planning of the Tofrek expedition on three counts:<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. pp.24\u201325.</ref>\n\n# Compared to the earlier expedition to Hashin which Graham commanded himself, which had been protected by four squadrons of British cavalry and a regiment of Bengal cavalry acting as scouts, the Tofrek expedition which he delegated to the command of General McNeill had only one squadron of Lancers plus a company of Mounted Infantry to provide warning of enemy activity;\n# Whereas Graham had the protection of a battery of Royal Horse Artillery able to shell the enemy at long range, no artillery was assigned to McNeill's force;\n# Whereas the ratio of men to transport animals had been over 5:1 in the earlier expedition, it was no more than 2:1 for the later one, resulting in much greater difficulties in keeping control of the animals.\n\nGalloway was even more critical of Graham for his last-minute change to McNeill's marching orders when he instructed the column to march southwestwards into uncharted territory instead of following the established track towards Tamai as originally planned, and which Graham himself had used when attacking [[Battle of Tamai|Tamai]] the year before.<ref name=\"galloway31\"/>  In consequence McNeill and his troops found themselves struggling through a jungle of mimosa bushes with long low-lying branches covered in sharp thorns which made progress both slow and difficult while affording the enemy excellent cover for the surprise attack that they launched later in the day.\n\nGalloway also claimed that intelligence reports that the enemy was planning a major attack on the 22nd March were not passed on to McNeill before he left Suakin.<ref>Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ.

Fiat launched right-hand drive models for the UK market in May 1981.\n\n===Development===\nGiugiaro and Mantovani spent their 1976 summer vacation in [[Porto Cervo]], Sardinia designing the Panda \u2014 using the working name ''Zero''.<ref name=\"tribe1\">{{cite web\n |title        = History of the Fiat Panda - Part 1: The Origins\n |publisher    = Drivetribe\n |author       =\n |date         =\n |url          = https://drivetribe.com/p/history-of-the-fiat-panda-part-UcTxxd5uRbChwYBrICN6mA?iid=HalyBMdiS-GNQUexQ-oD_A}}</ref> Fiat CEO Carlo De Benedetti's design brief specified straightforward packaging with a spacious and spartan interior, weighing no more than the [[Fiat 126]] it was replacing.

Under the prototyping designation ''Progetto 141,''<ref name=\"tribe1\"/> Fiat subsequently commissioned Italdesign to create production studies, a master model, provisional tooling and pre-production prototypes.

On response cards distributed by FIAT's sales department, participants gauged the design's exterior and interior appearance and finish, spaciousness, instruments and controls, engine size, price, and its provisional name: ''Rustica''.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nIn January 1979, production was delayed by protracted union negotiations, specifically over Fiat's plans to move production from plants in Cassino, Sulmona and Termini Imerese to Turin and Desio. An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nOn February 26, 1980, Fiat presented the Panda to President [[Sandro Pertini]], in the gardens of Rome's [[Quirinal Palace]], and the car officially debuted in Geneva on March 5th \u2014 carrying the ''Panda'' name. \n\nIn the two months following the Geneva motor show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders for the Panda.\n\n===Design===\nItaldesign's work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Seat covers, door trim could be removed and washed. Likewise, the dashboard used a padded, washable fabric supported by a simple tube, creating a long, flexible storage pocket. \n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock-up was missing. Fiat's new CEO, Nicola Tufarelli clarified that the rustic interiors were in fact the final design, ready for launch.<ref name=\"stampa01\">{{cite web\n |title        = Forty years of Panda: the secret stories of the Fiat city car\n |publisher    = La Stampa\n |author       =\n |date         = October 12, 2019\n |url          = https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastampa.it%2Fmotori%2Fattualita%2F2020%2F02%2F25%2Fnews%2Fl-alfa-romeo-torna-a-pomigliano-d-arco-produrra-la-tonale-dal-2021-1.38516408}}</ref>\n\nWith an overall aerodynamic coefficient, despite the blocky shape, better than the [[Fiat 127]]'s,<ref name=\"stampa01\"/> the first Pandas featured a recess in the adjacent bodywork rather than door handles;<ref name=\"tribe1\"/> and completely flat glass in all windows \u2014 weighing less and making them inexpensive to manufacture, as well as easy to replace and interchangeable left to right.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The Active model also received new darker seat fabrics of better quality and the addition of a CD player as standard. The new dark red Fiat badge replaced the blue roundel on the Panda in Summer 2007.\n\n===2009 revisions===\nThe Panda range was mildly rearranged again in 2009, with the addition of Active Eco and Dynamic Eco models. These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system.

This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

Due to the cylinders being both located under the [[floorpan]], the boot's volume is reduced only by 25 liters - 200 L instead of the monofuel's 225. On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4.

On response cards distributed by FIAT's sales department, participants gauged the design's exterior and interior appearance and finish, spaciousness, instruments and controls, engine size, price, and its provisional name: ''Rustica''.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nIn January 1979, production was delayed by protracted union negotiations, specifically over Fiat's plans to move production from plants in Cassino, Sulmona and Termini Imerese to Turin and Desio. An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nOn February 26, 1980, Fiat presented the Panda to President [[Sandro Pertini]], in the gardens of Rome's [[Quirinal Palace]], and the car officially debuted in Geneva on March 5th \u2014 carrying the ''Panda'' name. \n\nIn the two months following the Geneva motor show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders for the Panda.\n\n===Design===\nItaldesign's work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Seat covers, door trim could be removed and washed. Likewise, the dashboard used a padded, washable fabric supported by a simple tube, creating a long, flexible storage pocket. \n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock=up was missing. Fiat's new CEO, Nicola Tufarelli clarified that the rustic interiors were in fact the final design, ready for launch.<ref name=\"stampa01\">{{cite web\n |title        = Forty years of Panda: the secret stories of the Fiat city car\n |publisher    = La Stampa\n |author       =\n |date         = October 12, 2019\n |url          = https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastampa.it%2Fmotori%2Fattualita%2F2020%2F02%2F25%2Fnews%2Fl-alfa-romeo-torna-a-pomigliano-d-arco-produrra-la-tonale-dal-2021-1.38516408}}</ref>\n\nWith an overall aerodynamic coefficient, despite the blocky shape, better than the [[Fiat 127]]'s,<ref name=\"stampa01\"/> the first Pandas featured a recess in the adjacent bodywork rather than door handles;<ref name=\"tribe1\"/> and completely flat glass in all windows \u2014 weighing less and making them inexpensive to manufacture, as well as easy to replace and interchangeable left to right.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]].

The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

He became [[Attorney General for Ireland]] and formulated many of the legal principles that underpinned the [[British Empire]].\n\n==Early life==\nDavies was born in [[Wiltshire]], possibly at Chicksgrove Manor at [[Lower Chicksgrove]],<ref>{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Freeman |first2=Janet H. |last2=Stevenson |editor-first=D.A |editor-last=Crowley |year=1987| chapter=Parishes: Tisbury |title=A History of the County of Wiltshire: South-west Wiltshire: Chalke and Dunworth hundreds|volume=13|pages=195\u2013248|chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=116126|accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref> to John and Mary Davies. He was educated at [[Winchester College]] for four years, a period in which he showed much interest in literature. He studied there until the age of sixteen and went to further his education at [[the Queen's College, Oxford]], where he stayed for a mere eighteen months, with most historians questioning whether he received a degree. Davies spent some time at New Inn after his departure from Oxford, and it was at this point that he decided to pursue a career in law. In 1588 he enrolled in the [[Middle Temple]], where he did well academically, although suffering constant reprimands for his behaviour. Following several suspensions, his behaviour cost him his enrolment.\n\nDavies travelled to the Netherlands in 1592 with others of the Middle Temple ([[William Fleetwood (judge)|William Fleetwood]], [[Richard Martin (Recorder of London)|Richard Martin]]). There in [[Leiden]] he met the jurist [[Paul Merula]], to whom the group had a letter of introduction from [[William Camden]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hans S.

She wished him to continue his study of law at the Middle Temple and had him sworn in as a servant-in-ordinary. In the following year, his poem, ''[[Orchestra (poem)|Orchestra]]'', was published in July, prior to his call to the bar from the [[Middle Temple]]. He was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Shaftesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Shaftesbury]] in 1597.<ref name=HOP>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/davies-john-1569-1626  History of Parliament Online \u2013 John Davies]</ref>\n\nIn February 1598 Davies was disbarred for the offence of entering the dining hall of the Inns in the company of two swordsmen and striking Richard Martin with a cudgel. The victim Martin was a noted wit who had insulted him in public, and Davies immediately took a boat at the Temple steps and retired to Oxford, where he chose to write poetry. Another of his works, ''Nosce Teipsum'' (\"Know Thyself\"), was published in 1599 and found favour with the queen and with [[Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devon|Lord Mountjoy]], later [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]].\n\nDavies became a favourite of the queen, to whom he addressed his work, ''Hymns of Astraea'', in 1599. Later that year, however, his ''Epigrams'' was included in a list of published works that the state ordered to be confiscated and burned. In 1601 he was readmitted to the bar, having made a public apology to Martin, and in the same year served as the member of Parliament for [[Corfe Castle (UK Parliament constituency)|Corfe Castle]].<ref name=HOP/> In 1603, he was part of the deputation sent to bring King [[James VI of Scotland]] to London as the new monarch. The Scots king was also an admirer of Davies' poetry, and rewarded him with a knighthood and appointments (at Mountjoy's recommendation) as [[Solicitor-General for Ireland|solicitor-general]] and, later [[Attorney-General for Ireland|attorney-general]], in [[Ireland]].\n\n==Ireland==\nDavies arrived in Dublin in November 1603, where Mountjoy had accepted the submission of the rebel [[Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]] some six months earlier, at the close of the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]]. Finding pestilence and famine all over Ireland, Davies noted that the courts still commanded respect, but that the sloth of the protestant clergy and the ruin of the churches was detrimental to religion. He condemned the practice of issuing debased coinage and, in pursuit of the establishment of regular quarter-sessions of the courts, went on the [[Leinster]] circuit through seven counties in April 1604. In 1605 he travelled to England with the commendation of Sir [[Arthur Chichester]], who succeeded Mountjoy in government, and had returned to Ireland by July.\n\nDavies was very much committed to reform not just in the law but in religious affairs too. He was all for banishing Catholic clergy from Ireland and for enforcing church attendances, and strict measures to this end were taken on his return. He delivered a powerful speech on 23 November 1605 in the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], dealing with the summonsing of recusants to answer their contempt of the king's proclamations. In May 1606 he submitted his report of his circuit of the province of [[Munster]] to Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], the king's secretary, and was made [[serjeant at law]] after his appointment as Attorney General. In the summer he travelled through counties Monaghan, Fermanagh and Cavan, and a year later through Meath, Westmeath, Longford, King's county and Queen's County, both of which circuits he reported to Cecil. Davies always looked at Ireland as a stepping-stone towards major political office in England but he knew that his chances were hurt by the death of Cecil, his patron, and his own absence from the court.\n\n==Ulster==\nDavies became heavily involved in government efforts to establish a plantation in the lately rebellious province of [[Ulster]]. In September 1607, he delivered to Cecil his report of the [[Flight of the Earls]], a seminal event in Irish history and, before long, had travelled into the absent earls' territories to lay indictments against them there. In August 1608, he went with Chichester to view the escheated lands, reporting that the people, \"''wondered as much to see the king's deputy as the ghosts in Vurgil wondered to see AEneas alive in hell''[sic]\". In October he was in England, pushing for the [[Plantation of Ulster|plantation of the province]].\n\nIn May 1609, Davies was made serjeant, with a grant of lands valued at \u00a340 p.a. He revisited England in 1610 on plantation business, which had so advanced that he thought his assistance to the commission charged with bringing the project to fruition would no longer be needed. In 1610 he defended proceedings brought by the Irish against the plans for the plantation of Cavan, but in the following year he begged for recall from Ireland. At about this time he wrote the ''Discoverie of the True Causes why Ireland was never entirely subdued'' (pub.1612), a well-written \u2013 albeit polemical \u2013 account of the constitutional standing of Ireland.\n\n==Speaker of the Irish House of Commons==\n\nIn England, Davies spent much time in preparing the way for the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] of 1613, to which he was returned for [[Fermanagh (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Fermanagh]]. In the first sitting he was proposed as speaker with the Crown's approval, but he met fierce opposition from the Catholic members, who  formed a very large minority, and who nominated a former High Court judge, Sir [[John Everard (MP)|John Everard]], the [[knight of the shire]] for [[Tipperary (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Tipperary]]. Everard  was an  open [[recusant]], and despite his clownish  behaviour on this occasion, a man of good reputation. A scene of comical disorder ensued when Everard was placed in the chair and refused to vacate in favour of the government candidate. Davies, always a very heavy man, was seized by his own supporters and lifted bodily into his opponent's lap; Everard, half crushed by Davies' bulk, was then ejected from the chair and withdrew himself from the chamber with 98 supporters, whereupon the vote was taken in their absence. Davies was approved as speaker by Chichester, and delivered a memorable speech on the history and role of parliament in Ireland. Everard, his rival, was summoned to England and briefly imprisoned, but was quickly pardoned and thereafter  loyally supported the  Crown.\n\nIn 1615, Davies' reports of Irish cases were published; he had appeared as counsel in many of these, including the case of the [[River Bann|Bann]] fishery and the cases of [[tanistry]] and [[gavelkind]], which set precedents in Irish constitutional law, with wider implications for British colonial policy.\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1617 Davies failed to win the position of  [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]] and consequently resigned as Attorney-General in Ireland. In 1619 he returned to England permanently, in the expectation that his chance of gaining office there would be improved by his presence. He practised as king's serjeant, and eventually went on circuit as a judge. He was a founder member of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]. In 1621, he was elected MP for [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon]],<ref name=HOP/> and Newcastle-under-Lyme, choosing to sit for the latter constituency.  He occasionally spoke in parliament on Irish matters. Davies retired to [[Englefield House]] in [[Berkshire]],<ref name=rbhjde>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/jdavies.html |title=Biography: Sir John Davies (1569\u20131626) |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2010 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=rbheh>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/englefield_house.html |title=Englefield House |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2001 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> but was then appointed [[Lord Chief Justice]]. He had always been corpulent, and on 7 December 1626 he died in his bed of apoplexy brought on after a supper party, and thus never enjoyed the appointment he had been angling for throughout his career.\n\n==Poetry==\nDavies wrote poetry in numerous forms, but is best known for his epigrammes and sonnets. In 1599 he published ''Nosce Teipsum'' (Know thyself) and ''Hymnes of Astraea''. Queen Elizabeth became an admirer of Davies' work, and these poems contain acrostics that spell out the phrase ''Elisabetha Regina''.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Acrostic|volume=1|page=156}}</ref><ref group=nb>A list of his works can be found at: {{cite web|first=Anniina |last=Jokinen|date=1 November 2009|origyear=1996|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/daviebib.htm |title=The Works of Sir John Davies |publisher=Luminarium Encyclopedia|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nDavies is a great example{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} of \"new\" poetry in the 1590s. This was a poetry characterized by a burning delight in intellectual analysis and a pure passion for knowledge. Davies' works are very well represented in Elizabethan anthologies. The last complete edition of his poems appeared in 1876 and is long out of print.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis most famous poem, ''Nosce Teipsum'', was reprinted numerous times, and was one of the first English poems to use the [[decasyllabic quatrain]] instead of the [[heroic couplet]] for a poem of its scope. It gained him the favor of James I, by which he won promotion in Ireland. The poem summarizes the main issues in religious thought in the [[Elizabethan Era]], addressing the relation of body to soul, and of [[Materialism]] to [[Idealism]]. A. H. Bullen described it as being \"singularly readable for such a subject: highly accomplished verse, no Elizabethan quaintness, bothe subtle and terse\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/humane.htm | title=Nosce Teipsum | publisher=Luminarium Encyclopedia | date=25 July 2006 | accessdate=24 November 2010 | last=Jokinen | first=Anniina}}</ref>\n\nBullen also described Davies' ''Orchestra, or a Poem of Dancing'' as \"brilliant and graceful\".  This poem, written in [[rhyme royal]], reveals a typical Elizabethan pleasure: contemplating and trying to understand the relationship between the natural order and human activity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sir John|first1=Davies|title=Orchestra|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/davies1.html|website=Luminarium|publisher=University of Oregon|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn political terms, Davies was significant in his work on constitutional law and in framing the terms of the [[Plantation of Ulster]], a model that served the English crown as it extended its colonial reach in North America and elsewhere. In literary terms, he was a fine poet who lay quite neglected from the mid-17th century, until his cause was championed by [[T. S. Eliot]]. Davies's poem \"I know my soul hath power to know all things\" was set to music by the composer [[Hubert Parry]]  in his choral work, [[Songs of Farewell]] (1916\u201318).<ref name=\"shrock\">{{cite book |last1=Shrock |first1=Dennis |title=Choral Repertoire |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195327786 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-SVnDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA536&dq=My%20soul%2C%20there%20is%20a%20country&pg=PA536#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nDavies married [[Eleanor Davies (poet)|Eleanor Touchet]], daughter of the [[George Tuchet, 1st Earl of Castlehaven|first Earl of Castlehaven]], in March of 1609.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/lady-eleanor-davies |title=Lady Eleanor Davies (1603\u20131652)|encyclopedia=Occultism & Parapsychology Encyclopedia|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=rbhet>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/etouchet.html |title=Eleanor Touchet, Lady Davies (1590\u20131652) |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2010 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> She was one of the most prolific women writing in early seventeenth-century England, author of almost seventy pamphlets and prophecies, and one of the first women in England to see her works through to print.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Davies [n\u00e9e Touchet; other married name Douglas], Lady Eleanor (1590\u20131652), prophetess {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Watt|first=Diane|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/7233|year = 2004}}</ref> \n\nDuring the marriage, Eleanor published numerous books of prophecy, particularly anagrammatic prophecies; her prophetic writings were a source of conflict in the marriage and Davies burned a set of the prophecies that Eleanor had been writing.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"rbhet\" /> Davies was exasperated by his wife's excesses and once addressed her, \"I pray you weep not while I am alive, and I will give you leave to laugh when I am dead\".

His only son to survive infancy John (Jack), was deaf and dumb but [[Lucy Hastings|his daughter]] married [[Ferdinando Hastings, 6th Earl of Huntingdon|Ferdinando Hastings]] and became [[Earl of Huntingdon|Countess of Huntingdon]].<ref name=rbhjde/> It is thought by many that his wife Eleanor may have been one of Davies's biggest problems in getting a job.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} On 28 July 1625 she was working on a commentary of the [[Book of Daniel]] and believed she heard the voice of the prophet; she wrote about the experience and took it to the Archbishop of Canterbury. When Davies found and burned her writing she predicted he would die within three years, and went into mourning. In November 1626 Davies was appointed to high office in England. In early December, following her husband's appointment, Eleanor started weeping during a dinner with friends. When asked why, she explained it was in anticipation of Davies' funeral. Davies was found in his home, dead of apoplexy on the morning of 8 December.\n\nIn 1633, Eleanor was brought before the high commission in England on charges relating to her religious anagram practices.

He became [[Attorney General for Ireland]] and formulated many of the legal principles that underpinned the [[British Empire]].\n\n==Early life==\nDavies was born in [[Wiltshire]], possibly at Chicksgrove Manor at [[Lower Chicksgrove]],<ref>{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Freeman |first2=Janet H. |last2=Stevenson |editor-first=D.A |editor-last=Crowley |year=1987| chapter=Parishes: Tisbury |title=A History of the County of Wiltshire: South-west Wiltshire: Chalke and Dunworth hundreds|volume=13|pages=195\u2013248|chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=116126|accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref> to John and Mary Davies. He was educated at [[Winchester College]] for four years, a period in which he showed much interest in literature. He studied there until the age of sixteen and went to further his education at [[the Queen's College, Oxford]], where he stayed for a mere eighteen months, with most historians questioning whether he received a degree. Davies spent some time at New Inn after his departure from Oxford, and it was at this point that he decided to pursue a career in law. In 1588 he enrolled in the [[Middle Temple]], where he did well academically, although suffering constant reprimands for his behaviour. Following several suspensions, his behaviour cost him his enrolment.\n\nDavies travelled to the Netherlands in 1592 with others of the Middle Temple ([[William Fleetwood (judge)|William Fleetwood]], [[Richard Martin (Recorder of London)|Richard Martin]]). There in [[Leiden]] he met the jurist [[Paul Merula]], to whom the group had a letter of introduction from [[William Camden]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hans S.

She wished him to continue his study of law at the Middle Temple and had him sworn in as a servant-in-ordinary. In the following year, his poem, ''[[Orchestra (poem)|Orchestra]]'', was published in July, prior to his call to the bar from the [[Middle Temple]]. He was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Shaftesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Shaftesbury]] in 1597.<ref name=HOP>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/davies-john-1569-1626  History of Parliament Online - John Davies]</ref>\n\nIn February 1598 Davies was disbarred for the offence of entering the dining hall of the Inns in the company of two swordsmen and striking Richard Martin with a cudgel. The victim Martin was a noted wit who had insulted him in public, and Davies immediately took a boat at the Temple steps and retired to Oxford, where he chose to write poetry. Another of his works, ''Nosce Teipsum'' (\"Know Thyself\"), was published in 1599 and found favour with the queen and with [[Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devon|Lord Mountjoy]], later [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]].\n\nDavies became a favourite of the queen, to whom he addressed his work, ''Hymns of Astraea'', in 1599. Later that year, however, his ''Epigrams'' was included in a list of published works that the state ordered to be confiscated and burned. In 1601 he was readmitted to the bar, having made a public apology to Martin, and in the same year served as the member of Parliament for [[Corfe Castle (UK Parliament constituency)|Corfe Castle]].<ref name=HOP/> In 1603, he was part of the deputation sent to bring King [[James VI of Scotland]] to London as the new monarch. The Scots king was also an admirer of Davies' poetry, and rewarded him with a knighthood and appointments (at Mountjoy's recommendation) as [[Solicitor-General for Ireland|solicitor-general]] and, later [[Attorney-General for Ireland|attorney-general]], in [[Ireland]].\n\n==Ireland==\nDavies arrived in Dublin in November 1603, where Mountjoy had accepted the submission of the rebel [[Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]] some six months earlier, at the close of the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]]. Finding pestilence and famine all over Ireland, Davies noted that the courts still commanded respect, but that the sloth of the protestant clergy and the ruin of the churches was detrimental to religion. He condemned the practice of issuing debased coinage and, in pursuit of the establishment of regular quarter-sessions of the courts, went on the [[Leinster]] circuit through seven counties in April 1604. In 1605 he travelled to England with the commendation of Sir [[Arthur Chichester]], who succeeded Mountjoy in government, and had returned to Ireland by July.\n\nDavies was very much committed to reform not just in the law but in religious affairs too. He was all for banishing Catholic clergy from Ireland and for enforcing church attendances, and strict measures to this end were taken on his return. He delivered a powerful speech on 23 November 1605 in the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], dealing with the summonsing of recusants to answer their contempt of the king's proclamations. In May 1606 he submitted his report of his circuit of the province of [[Munster]] to Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], the king's secretary, and was made [[serjeant at law]] after his appointment as Attorney General. In the summer he travelled through counties Monaghan, Fermanagh and Cavan, and a year later through Meath, Westmeath, Longford, King's county and Queen's County, both of which circuits he reported to Cecil. Davies always looked at Ireland as a stepping-stone towards major political office in England but he knew that his chances were hurt by the death of Cecil, his patron, and his own absence from the court.\n\n==Ulster==\nDavies became heavily involved in government efforts to establish a plantation in the lately rebellious province of [[Ulster]]. In September 1607, he delivered to Cecil his report of the [[Flight of the Earls]], a seminal event in Irish history and, before long, had travelled into the absent earls' territories to lay indictments against them there. In August 1608, he went with Chichester to view the escheated lands, reporting that the people, \"''wondered as much to see the king's deputy as the ghosts in Vurgil wondered to see AEneas alive in hell''[sic]\". In October he was in England, pushing for the [[Plantation of Ulster|plantation of the province]].\n\nIn May 1609, Davies was made serjeant, with a grant of lands valued at \u00a340 p.a. He revisited England in 1610 on plantation business, which had so advanced that he thought his assistance to the commission charged with bringing the project to fruition would no longer be needed. In 1610 he defended proceedings brought by the Irish against the plans for the plantation of Cavan, but in the following year he begged for recall from Ireland. At about this time he wrote the ''Discoverie of the True Causes why Ireland was never entirely subdued'' (pub.1612), a well-written - albeit polemical - account of the constitutional standing of Ireland.\n\n==Speaker of the House of Commons==\n\nIn England, Davies spent much time in preparing the way for the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] of 1613, to which he was returned for [[Fermanagh (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Fermanagh]]. In the first sitting he was proposed as speaker with the Crown's approval, but he met fierce opposition from the Catholic members, who  formed a very large minority, and who nominated a former High Court judge, Sir [[John Everard (MP)|John Everard]], the [[knight of the shire]] for [[Tipperary (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Tipperary]]. Everard  was an  open [[recusant]], and despite his clownish  behaviour on this occasion, a man of good reputation. A scene of comical disorder ensued when Everard was placed in the chair and refused to vacate in favour of the government candidate. Davies, always a very heavy man, was seized by his own supporters and lifted bodily into his opponent's lap; Everard, half crushed by Davies' bulk, was then ejected from the chair and withdrew himself from the chamber with 98 supporters, whereupon the vote was taken in their absence. Davies was approved as speaker by Chichester, and delivered a memorable speech on the history and role of parliament in Ireland. Everard, his rival, was summoned to England and briefly imprisoned, but was quickly pardoned and thereafter  loyally supported the  Crown.\n\nIn 1615, Davies' reports of Irish cases were published; he had appeared as counsel in many of these, including the case of the [[River Bann|Bann]] fishery and the cases of [[tanistry]] and [[gavelkind]], which set precedents in Irish constitutional law, with wider implications for British colonial policy.\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1617 Davies failed to win the position of  [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]] and consequently resigned as Attorney-General in Ireland. In 1619 he returned to England permanently, in the expectation that his chance of gaining office there would be improved by his presence. He practised as king's serjeant, and eventually went on circuit as a judge. He was a founder member of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]. In 1621, he was elected MP for [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon]],<ref name=HOP/> and Newcastle-under-Lyme, choosing to sit for the latter constituency.  He occasionally spoke in parliament on Irish matters. Davies retired to [[Englefield House]] in [[Berkshire]],<ref name=rbhjde>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/jdavies.html |title=Biography: Sir John Davies (1569-1626) |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2010 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=rbheh>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/englefield_house.html |title=Englefield House |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2001 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> but was then appointed [[Lord Chief Justice]]. He had always been corpulent, and on 7 December 1626 he died in his bed of apoplexy brought on after a supper party, and thus never enjoyed the appointment he had been angling for throughout his career.\n\n==Poetry==\nDavies wrote poetry in numerous forms, but is best known for his epigrammes and sonnets. In 1599 he published ''Nosce Teipsum'' (Know thyself) and ''Hymnes of Astraea''. Queen Elizabeth became an admirer of Davies' work, and these poems contain acrostics that spell out the phrase ''Elisabetha Regina''.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Acrostic|volume=1|page=156}}</ref><ref group=nb>A list of his works can be found at: {{cite web|first=Anniina |last=Jokinen|date=1 November 2009|origyear=1996|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/daviebib.htm |title=The Works of Sir John Davies |publisher=Luminarium Encyclopedia|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nDavies is a great example{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} of \"new\" poetry in the 1590s. This was a poetry characterized by a burning delight in intellectual analysis and a pure passion for knowledge. Davies' works are very well represented in Elizabethan anthologies. The last complete edition of his poems appeared in 1876 and is long out of print.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis most famous poem, ''Nosce Teipsum'', was reprinted numerous times, and was one of the first English poems to use the [[decasyllabic quatrain]] instead of the [[heroic couplet]] for a poem of its scope. It gained him the favor of James I, by which he won promotion in Ireland. The poem summarizes the main issues in religious thought in the [[Elizabethan Era]], addressing the relation of body to soul, and of [[Materialism]] to [[Idealism]]. A. H. Bullen described it as being \"singularly readable for such a subject: highly accomplished verse, no Elizabethan quaintness, bothe subtle and terse\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/humane.htm | title=Nosce Teipsum | publisher=Luminarium Encyclopedia | date=25 July 2006 | accessdate=24 November 2010 | last=Jokinen | first=Anniina}}</ref>\n\nBullen also described Davies' ''Orchestra, or a Poem of Dancing'' as \"brilliant and graceful\".  This poem, written in [[rhyme royal]], reveals a typical Elizabethan pleasure: contemplating and trying to understand the relationship between the natural order and human activity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sir John|first1=Davies|title=Orchestra|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/davies1.html|website=Luminarium|publisher=University of Oregon|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn political terms, Davies was significant in his work on constitutional law and in framing the terms of the [[Plantation of Ulster]], a model that served the English crown as it extended its colonial reach in North America and elsewhere. In literary terms, he was a fine poet who lay quite neglected from the mid-17th century, until his cause was championed by [[T. S. Eliot]]. Davies's poem \"I know my soul hath power to know all things\" was set to music by the composer [[Hubert Parry]]  in his choral work, [[Songs of Farewell]] (1916-18).<ref name=\"shrock\">{{cite book |last1=Shrock |first1=Dennis |title=Choral Repertoire |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195327786 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-SVnDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA536&dq=My%20soul%2C%20there%20is%20a%20country&pg=PA536#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nDavies married [[Eleanor Davies (poet)|Eleanor Touchet]], daughter of the [[George Tuchet, 1st Earl of Castlehaven|first Earl of Castlehaven]], in March of 1609.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/lady-eleanor-davies |title=Lady Eleanor Davies (1603-1652)|encyclopedia=Occultism & Parapsychology Encyclopedia|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=rbhet>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/etouchet.html |title=Eleanor Touchet, Lady Davies (1590-1652) |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2010 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> She was one of the most prolific women writing in early seventeenth-century England, author of almost seventy pamphlets and prophecies, and one of the first women in England to see her works through to print.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Davies [n\u00e9e Touchet; other married name Douglas], Lady Eleanor (1590\u20131652), prophetess {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Watt|first=Diane|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/7233|year = 2004}}</ref> \n\nDuring the marriage, Eleanor published numerous books of prophecy, particularly anagrammatic prophecies; her prophetic writings were a source of conflict in the marriage and Davies burned a set of the prophecies that Eleanor had been writing.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"rbhet\" /> Davies was exasperated by his wife's excesses and once addressed her, \"I pray you weep not while I am alive, and I will give you leave to laugh when I am dead\". She is said to have accurately foretold the date of his death and wore mourning clothes for the three years leading up to the predicted time: as the date approached \u2013 three days before \u2013 she \"gave him pass to take his long sleep\".<ref name=rbhet/>\n\nDavies had three children by his marriage. His only son to survive infancy John (Jack), was deaf and dumb but [[Lucy Hastings|his daughter]] married [[Ferdinando Hastings, 6th Earl of Huntingdon|Ferdinando Hastings]] and became [[Earl of Huntingdon|Countess of Huntingdon]].<ref name=rbhjde/> It is thought by many that his wife Eleanor may have been one of Davies's biggest problems in getting a job. On 28 July 1625 she was working on a commentary of the book of Daniel and believed she heard the voice of the prophet. Following this experience she wrote about it and took it to the Archbishop of Canterbury. When Davies found and burned her writing she predicted he would die within three years and went into mourning. In November 1626 Davies was appointed to high office in England. In early December, following Davies' new appointment, Eleanor started weeping during a dinner with friends. When asked why, she explained it was in anticipation of Davies' funeral. Davies was found in his home, dead of apoplexy on the morning of 8 December. In 1633, Eleanor was brought before the high commission in England on charges relating to her religious anagram practices. During a fruitless examination of her under oath, one of the commissioners devised an anagram of his own: ''[[Anagram#Early modern period|Dame Eleanor Davys - never so mad a ladye]]''. She was sent to prison, and afterwards remarried, but was deserted by her new husband and buried next to Davies on her death in 1652.<ref>An account of the legal proceedings is given in Ballard at p.277ff. https://books.google.com/books?id=GnxBAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=ballard+memoirs+of+several+ladies&source=bl&ots=WftsjTqnOl&sig=pYoQHMOeDUC2Ak51cC2RcHEQghA&hl=en&ei=g09xTdf8PIbHsgbUh5WEDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=fitzwilliam&f=false</ref>\nShe continued to make prophesies until her death.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|2}}\n;Attribution\n{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Davies, Sir John|volume=7|pages=864\u2013865}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |first=Nicholas P. |last=Canny |title=Making Ireland British, 1580\u20131650 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-820091-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/makingirelandbri00cann }}\n*''Dictionary of National Biography'' 22 vols.

In 1981 she moved again to [[Gateshead]], but a series of major faults caused withdrawal in 1984. Narrowly escaping scrap, she was purchased for preservation at Llangollen in 1993. After several years of service she was offered a new home at Ruddington and has been actively based there since 2009.

She spent 42 months in store at Basford Hall yard in Crewe before leaving by low loader for preservation at the GCRN at Ruddington in 2007. She made her debut in passenger service over the August Bank Holiday 2007 weekend and has been in service since including visits to the East Lancashire Railway in July 2009, Mid-Norfolk Railway in September 2012, Swanage Railway and Didcot Railway Centre in May 2014.\n|[[British Rail corporate liveries#Moving away from Rail Blue|BR Large Logo Blue (half-yellow ends)]].\n|Private owner.\n|1966\n|[[File:47292 Ruddington.JPG|175px]]\n|-\n|[[British Rail Class 50|No. 50017]] [[HMS Royal Oak (08)|Royal Oak]]\n|[[British Rail Class 50]] Co-Co\n|50017 was built at [[Vulcan Foundry]] in [[Newton-le-Willows]] in April 1968. The class were first allocated to the [[West Coast Main Line]] to work express trains north of [[Crewe]] to [[Glasgow]] via [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and [[Carlisle]] as the north of the WCML beyond Crewe was not yet electrified. From 1974 the northern half of the WCML was electrified and 50017 plus its classmates were transferred to the [[Western Region of British Railways|Western Region]] working mainline passenger services from [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] along the [[Great Western Main Line]] (GWML). These services ran to places like [[Oxford]], [[Bristol]] as well as [[Plymouth]] and [[Penzance]].\n\n50017 was withdrawn from service in September 1991. Following spells at Tyseley and the [[Plym Valley Railway]], it operated on the mainline for a period of time.

In its early years of service it was primarily a Yorkshire coalfield locomotive but its sphere of operation widened in later years and it also spent time allocated to Toton, Thornaby and Immingham depots. It was purchased from EWS in 2002 and overhauled by a very small team initially at the former Cathays Depot in Cardiff, and subsequently at the Ruddington site of the GCRN. The power unit was overhauled off site by North Lincs Engineering and then reinstalled at Brush Traction where a bogie swap was also undertaken. Following load banking on site at Ruddington 56097 entered service in 2008. Since then it has seen use on passenger services and on one occasion a freight train. On 23 October 2010 56097 hauled an incoming train of gypsum from Loughborough to East Leake Gypsum works with a trailing load of 1450t plus a GBRf class 66/7. 56097 was not used on timetabled passenger services during 2014 due to the unavailability of the GCRN's rake of air braked stock. It is nevertheless serviceable and available for traffic. 56097 has visited galas at the East Lancs Railway and the Mid Norfolk Railway, and is available for hire.\n|[[Trainload Freight|Trainload Coal (half-yellow ends)]].\n|Private owner.\n|1981\n|[[File:56097 bringing up the rear of 0Z49.jpg|175px]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs'''\n|-\n|[[British Rail Class 27#Preservation|No. D5401]]\n|[[British Rail Class 27|British Rail Class 27<br /> Bo-Bo]]\n|D5401 was built at Birmingham Carriage and Wagon Works of [[Smethwick]].

The idea of preserving a long train of mineral wagons was first aired in Steam Railway early in 1992 and following an encouraging initial response an appeal was launched in the August issue to purchase suitable wagons for use on the Great Central Railway. The appeal was a huge success, Steam Railway readers and supporters of GCR raised over \u00a314,000 to purchase and restore the wagons.\n\nWith the exception of the two un-restored wagons, all the mineral wagons in the \u2018Windcutter\u2019 fleet are either fitted with vacuum brake or have been through piped to run in a vacuum braked train. This means that to be fully authentic all the wagons should carry British Railways \u2018Bauxite\u2019 livery. However the original aim of the project was to recreate the sight of long trains of unfitted mineral wagons as seen on the GCR in BR days and all over the BR network in the days of steam, and in some areas even as late as the early 1980s. All BR un-fitted freight vehicles were painted grey and hence to recreate the overall appearance of a steam era mineral train the majority of the wagons in the \u2018Windcutter\u2019 fleet have been restored in this colour.<ref>http://www.gcrailway.co.uk/the-railway/rolling-stock/windcutter-wagons/</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was purchased from EWS in 2002 and overhauled by a very small team initially at the former Cathays Depot in Cardiff, and subsequently at the Ruddington site of the GCRN. The power unit was overhauled off site by North Lincs Engineering and then reinstalled at Brush Traction where a bogie swap was also undertaken.

The idea of preserving a long train of mineral wagons was first aired in Steam Railway early in 1992 and following an encouraging initial response an appeal was launched in the August issue to purchase suitable wagons for use on the Great Central Railway. The appeal was a huge success, Steam Railway readers and supporters of GCR raised over \u00a314,000 to purchase and restore the wagons.\n\nWith the exception of the two un-restored wagons, all the mineral wagons in the \u2018Windcutter\u2019 fleet are either fitted with vacuum brake or have been through piped to run in a vacuum braked train. This means that to be fully authentic all the wagons should carry British Railways \u2018Bauxite\u2019 livery. However the original aim of the project was to recreate the sight of long trains of unfitted mineral wagons as seen on the GCR in BR days and all over the BR network in the days of steam, and in some areas even as late as the early 1980s. All BR un-fitted freight vehicles were painted grey and hence to recreate the overall appearance of a steam era mineral train the majority of the wagons in the \u2018Windcutter\u2019 fleet have been restored in this colour.<ref>http://www.gcrailway.co.uk/the-railway/rolling-stock/windcutter-wagons/</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
