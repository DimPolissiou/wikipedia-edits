{"title_page": "List of Parseval airships", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2015}}\nThe '''Parsevals''' were 22 [[airship]]s built between 1909 and 1919 by the [[Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft]] (LFG) following the design of [[August von Parseval]]. In the 1920s and 1930s, three more airships were built following the Parseval-Naatz (PN) design.\n\nAs with the rival [[Zeppelin]]s, the airships were, in both [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], referred to by the name of the inventor. (In German, [[Grammatical gender|the nouns were masculine]], that is, \"''der Parseval''\", \"''der Zeppelin''\".)\n\nIn contrast to the Zeppelins, the Parsevals were non-rigid or [[semi-rigid airship]]s, with little or no stiffening structure inside the fabric envelope. The Zeppelins had a rigid internal framework made of [[duralumin]]. Both types relied on [[hydrogen]] gas to provide lift.\n\n[[File:L-Luftschiff2.png|thumb|Diagram of an early Parseval airship. The two internal balloons were not for lift generation. They were ordinarily pumped with air when a vessel began losing its shape due to hydrogen's pressure changes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Mastery of the Air|year=1918|isbn=1-4068-4626-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYlxRC-i2uwC&lpg=PA1&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=William J.

In the 1920s and 1930s, three more airships were built following the Parseval-Naatz (PN) design.\n\nAs with the rival [[Zeppelin]]s, the airships were, in both [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], referred to by the name of the inventor. (In German, [[Grammatical gender|the nouns were masculine]], that is, \"''der Parseval''\", \"''der Zeppelin''\".)\n\nIn contrast to the Zeppelins, the Parsevals were non-rigid or [[semi-rigid airship]]s, with little or no stiffening structure inside the fabric envelope. The Zeppelins had a rigid internal framework made of [[duralumin]]. Both types relied on [[hydrogen]] gas to provide lift.\n\n[[File:L-Luftschiff2.png|thumb|Diagram of an early Parseval airship.

The major difference from its predecessor PL 26 was the specification of the gondola. Because it no longer met increased military requirements, it was not put to military service but instead converted to a passenger airship in 1919. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] resulted in its dismantlement in 1920.\n*Length: 157 m, maximum diameter: 19.5 m\n*Volume: 31,300 m\u00b3\n*Maximum speed: 100&nbsp;km/h\n*Power plant: four 177&nbsp;kW (240 PS) Maybach-engines\n*Lifting capacity 18 [[tonne]]\n\n==Parseval-Naatz PN 28==\n*Semirigid airship\n*Trumpf-advertising airship, (like the Raab-Katzenstein RK 27)\n*Built in Seddin/Pommern by the Berlin \"Wasser- und Luftfahrzeug GmbH\"\n*Maiden flighton 1929-06-06 in Berlin\n*Official marking: D-PN28\n*Volume: 1800 m\u00b3\n\n==Parseval-Naatz PN 29 Sidenhuset==\n*Semirigid airship\n*Built in 1929 as D-PN 29 with a passenger capacity of 5\n*Volume: 2300 m\u00b3\n*Length: 44 m, diameter: 10 m\n*Power plant: one Siemens-Halske-engine of 75&nbsp;kW (100 PS)\n*Max speed  82&nbsp;km/h\n*Total flying time: about 600 hours in 200 flights\n\nOn 1930-05-21 PN 29 acquired the Swedish call-sign \"SE-ACG Sidenhuset\", after the then well-known ladies boutique from Stockholm.

A teacher, experimenter and theorist, he made a lasting contribution to science in his lengthy career, throughout which he sought to encourage specialists in different fields to meet and share insights.\n\nPaul Weiss was born in Vienna, the son of a Jewish couple, Carl S. Weiss, a businessman, and Rosalie Kohn Weiss. His background favoured music, poetry, and philosophy \u2013 Weiss himself was a violinist \u2013 but an uncle encouraged an interest in science. Weiss received his baccalaureate in 1916. In his younger years before all the science bullshit he was a major cum addict and spent most of his weekends giving blowjobs to the local fisherman of Vienna. His nickname from all the blowjobs he gave to the local fisherman was \"whale semen weiss\". Hes also famous for being raped by a gorilla and a bull at the same time. He permantly walked with a limp after that event. \n\nAfter the end of the [[First World War]], having served for three years as an officer in the artillery, he commenced studies in mechanical engineering at the [[Technische Hochschule]] in Vienna, (now [[Vienna University of Technology]]). He then shifted his focus to [[biology]] with a minor in [[physics]]. He absorbed the studies of Edmond B. Wilson, Edwin G. Concklin, and Theodor Bovari and completed his doctoral thesis in 1922 under [[Hans Leo Przibram]], then director of the Biological Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna, on the responses of butterflies to light and gravity.\n\nAfter completing his thesis he traveled widely in Europe, becoming an assistant director of the Biological Research Institute of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. In 1926 he married Maria Helen Blaschka.\n\nHis studies of limb regeneration in [[newt]]s showed that a complete limb could regenerate even if particular tissue forms were removed from the stump: the required types of tissue would reform. He studied cell differentiation and the transplanting and reforming of connections in the nerves of limbs, using newts and frogs for his experiments. He went on to consider neurobiology and morphogenesis. He introduced the idea of the \"natural experiment\" \u2013 the quest for suggestive examples  from nature \u2013 and this became a favourite teaching device.\n\nIn 1930 a prospective post at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] was lost due to the depression and Weiss moved to the United States. In 1931, after studying developing cell cultures for some time, Weiss won a Sterling fellowship to work with [[Ross Granville Harrison]] at [[Yale]]. He took US citizenship in 1939, publishing his ''Principles of Development'' the same year.<ref>P.A. Weiss, ''Principles of Development'', Henry Holt and Company, 1939</ref> From 1933 to 1954, after working briefly at Yale, he taught at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nIn his work on tissue cultures Weiss outlined several features of cell proliferation: he showed how cell-patterns are affected by their substrate and, through grafts, proved that basic neural patterns of coordination were self-differentiating rather than learned, though higher vertebrates can \"retrain\" reflexes.\n\nDuring World War II he worked with the American government on nerve injury. In 1947 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1954 he became one of the first professors at the new [[Rockefeller University]] in New York, where he remained for fifteen years.

Australian and United States forces sought to capture two major [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] bases, one in the town of [[Lae]], and another one at [[Salamaua]]. The campaign to take the Salamaua and Lae area began after the successful [[Battle of Wau|defence of Wau]] in late January, which was followed up by an Australian advance towards [[Battle of Mubo|Mubo]] as the Japanese troops that had attacked Wau withdrew to positions around Mubo. A series of actions followed over the course of several months as the Australian [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] advanced north-east towards Salamaua. After an amphibious [[landing at Nassau Bay]], the Australians were reinforced by a US regimental combat team, which subsequently advanced north up the coast.\n\nAs the Allies kept up the pressure on the Japanese around Salamaua, in early September they launched an [[Landing at Nadzab|airborne assault on Nadzab]], and a [[Landing at Lae|seaborne landing near Lae]], subsequently taking the town with simultaneous drives from the east and north-west. As the situation around Lae grew more desperate, the Salamaua garrison withdrew, and it was captured on 11 September 1943, while Lae fell shortly afterwards on 16 September, bringing the campaign to an end.\n\n==Background==\nIn March 1942, the Japanese [[Invasion of Salamaua\u2013Lae|secured Salamaua and Lae]] and subsequently established major bases on the north coast of [[New Guinea]], in the large town of Lae, and in Salamaua, a small administrative town and port 35 kilometres (22&nbsp;mi) to the south. Salamaua was a staging post for [[Operation Mo|attacks on Port Moresby]], such as the [[Kokoda Track campaign]], and a forward operating base for Japanese aviation.{{sfn|James|2014|p=189}} When the attacks failed, the Japanese turned the port into a major supply base. Logistical limitations meant that the Salamaua\u2013Lae area could garrison only 10,000 Japanese personnel: 2,500 seamen and 7,500 soldiers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/pages/NT000091A6?openDocument |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525235719/http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/pages/NT000091A6?openDocument |archivedate=25 May 2010 |title=Attitudes to the War \u2013 Southern Cross: X The Attack and Defence at Lae and Salamaua |website=Australia-Japan Research Project |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> The defences were centred on the Okabe Detachment, a [[brigade]]-sized force from the [[51st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|51st Division]] under Major General [[Toru Okabe]].{{sfn|Trigellis-Smith|1994|pp=313\u2013316}}\n\nIn January 1943, the Okabe Detachment was defeated in an [[Battle of Wau|attack on the Australian base of Wau]], about 40 kilometres (25&nbsp;mi) away.

This also diverted attention from Lae, which was a major objective of [[Operation Cartwheel]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] grand strategy for the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific]]. It was decided that the Japanese would be pursued towards Salamaua by the [[Australian 3rd Division (World War II)|Australian 3rd Division]], which had been formed at Wau, under the command of Major General [[Stanley Savige]],{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p= 16}}{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=298 & 304}} who were to link up with elements of the US [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Morison|1975|p=258}}\n\n==Salamaua==\n[[Image:Salamaua-Lae.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Salamaua\u2013Lae area.

The battle turned when they were assisted by the 162nd RCT.{{sfn|Maitland|1999|pp=72\u201374}} Throughout July, the Japanese sought to reinforce the Salamaua area, drawing troops away from Lae; by the end of the month there were around 8,000 Japanese around Salamaua.{{sfn|Morison|1975|p=258}}\n\nOn 23 August, Savige and the 3rd Division handed over the Salamaua operation to the [[Australian 5th Division (World War II)|Australian 5th Division]] under Major General [[Edward James Milford|Edward Milford]]. Throughout late August and into early September the Japanese in the Salamaua region fought to hold the advancing Allies along their final line of defence in front of Salamaua, nevertheless the 58th/59th Infantry Battalion succeeded in crossing the Francisco River and the 42nd Infantry Battalion subsequently captured the main Japanese defensive position around Charlie Hill.{{sfn|Tanaka|1980|pp=171\u2013175}} After Allied landings near Lae in the first week of September, the [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|18th Army]] commander, [[Hataz\u014d Adachi]], ordered Nakano to abandon Salamaua and subsequently his forces withdrew to the north disinvesting the town and transferring between 5,000 and 6,000 troops by barge, while other troops marched out along the coastal road.

Five [[United States Navy|US Navy]] destroyers provided artillery support.

They came to a halt at the [[Busu River]], which could not be bridged for two reasons: the 9th lacked heavy equipment, and the far bank was occupied by Japanese soldiers. On 9 September, the [[2/28th Battalion (Australia)|2/28th Infantry Battalion]] led the attack across the Busu River and secured a bridgehead after fierce fighting.{{sfn|Maitland |1999|p= 78}}\n\n===Nadzab===\n{{Main|Landing at Nadzab}}\n[[Image:Awm 128387 nadzab.jpg|250px|thumb|right|5 September 1943.

The [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] was the result, and a quick follow up landing was subsequently undertaken at [[Battle of Scarlet Beach|Scarlet Beach]] by the [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]].{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=315}}\n\nDespite initial plans to do so, Salamaua was not developed as a base.  The Australian I Corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, visited Salamaua by [[PT boat]] on 14 September 1943, three days after its capture, and found little more than bomb craters and corrugated iron.  He recommended cancelling the development of Salamaua and concentrating all available resources on Lae. The base that had originally been envisaged now looked like a waste of effort, because Salamaua was a poor site for a port or airbase. However, in drawing the Japanese attention away from Lae at a critical time, the assault on Salamaua had already served its purpose.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}\n\nLae, on the other hand, was subsequently transformed into two bases: the Australian Lae Base Sub Area and the [[USASOS]] Base E. Herring combined the two as the Lae Fortress, under Milford. Because Blamey had launched Postern before the logistical preparations were complete, most of the units needed to operate the base were not yet available.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/documents/wwii/lae-port.htm |author=Historical Section, Army Forces Western Pacific |title=Military History of the United States Army Services of Supply in the Southwest Pacific: Chapter 18: Base at Lae Until March 1944 |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of Lae as a port was to supply the airbase at Nadzab, but this was compromised because the Markham Valley Road was found to be in poor condition. To expedite the development of Nadzab, minimal efforts were made to repair it, and heavy military traffic bound for Nadzab was permitted to use it. The road was closed following heavy rains on 7 October and did not reopen until December. Until then, Nadzab had to be supplied by air, and its development was slow because heavy engineer units could not get through.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Bradley |first=Phillip |title=To Salamaua |publisher=Cambridge University Press  |location= Port Melbourne, Victoria  |year= 2010 |isbn=9780521763905|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Buggy |first=Hugh |title=Pacific Victory: A Short History of Australia's Part in the War Against Japan |year=1945 |publisher=Victorian Railway Printing Works |location=North Melbourne, Victoria |oclc=2411075 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Coulthard-Clark|first=Chris|title=The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|year=1998|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=Sydney, New South Wales |isbn=1-86448-611-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dexter |first=David |title=The New Guinea Offensives |series=[[Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945]].

War II. Australian and United States forces sought to capture two major [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] bases, one in the town of [[Lae]], and another one at [[Salamaua]]. The campaign to take the Salamaua and Lae area began after the successful [[Battle of Wau|defence of Wau]] in late January, which was followed up by an Australian advance towards [[Battle of Mubo|Mubo]] as the Japanese troops that had attacked Wau withdrew to positions around Mubo. A series of actions followed over the course of several months as the Australian [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] advanced north-east towards Salamaua. After an amphibious [[landing at Nassau Bay]], the Australians were reinforced by a US regimental combat team, which subsequently advanced north up the coast.\n\nAs the Allies kept up the pressure on the Japanese around Salamaua, in early September they launched an [[Landing at Nadzab|airborne assault on Nadzab]], and a [[Landing at Lae|seaborne landing near Lae]], subsequently taking the town with simultaneous drives from the east and north-west. As the situation around Lae grew more desperate, the Salamaua garrison withdrew, and it was captured on 11 September 1943, while Lae fell shortly afterwards on 16 September, bringing the campaign to an end.\n\n==Background==\nIn March 1942, the Japanese [[Invasion of Salamaua\u2013Lae|secured Salamaua and Lae]] and subsequently established major bases on the north coast of [[New Guinea]], in the large town of Lae, and in Salamaua, a small administrative town and port 35 kilometres (22&nbsp;mi) to the south. Salamaua was a staging post for [[Operation Mo|attacks on Port Moresby]], such as the [[Kokoda Track campaign]], and a forward operating base for Japanese aviation.{{sfn|James|2014|p=189}} When the attacks failed, the Japanese turned the port into a major supply base. Logistical limitations meant that the Salamaua\u2013Lae area could garrison only 10,000 Japanese personnel: 2,500 seamen and 7,500 soldiers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/pages/NT000091A6?openDocument |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525235719/http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/pages/NT000091A6?openDocument |archivedate=25 May 2010 |title=Attitudes to the War \u2013 Southern Cross: X The Attack and Defence at Lae and Salamaua |website=Australia-Japan Research Project |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> The defences were centred on the Okabe Detachment, a [[brigade]]-sized force from the [[51st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|51st Division]] under Major General [[Toru Okabe]].{{sfn|Trigellis-Smith|1994|pp=313\u2013316}}\n\nIn January 1943, the Okabe Detachment was defeated in an [[Battle of Wau|attack on the Australian base of Wau]], about 40 kilometres (25&nbsp;mi) away. Allied commanders turned their attention to Salamaua, which could be attacked by troops flown into [[Wau, Papua New Guinea|Wau]]. This also diverted attention from Lae, which was a major objective of [[Operation Cartwheel]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] grand strategy for the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific]]. It was decided that the Japanese would be pursued towards Salamaua by the [[Australian 3rd Division (World War II)|Australian 3rd Division]], which had been formed at Wau, under the command of Major General [[Stanley Savige]],{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p= 16}}{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=298 & 304}} who were to link up with elements of the US [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Morison|1975|p=258}}\n\n==Salamaua==\n[[Image:Salamaua-Lae.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Salamaua\u2013Lae area.

In May, the 2/7th repelled a number of strong Japanese counterattacks.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|pp=239\u2013240}}\n\nAt the same time as the [[Battle of Mubo|first battle at Mubo]], the Australian [[24th Battalion (Australia)|24th Infantry Battalion]], which had been defending the [[Wampit Valley]] in an effort to prevent Japanese movement into the area from [[Bulolo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/unit/U56105/|title=24th Battalion (Kooyong Regiment)|work=Second World War, 1939\u20131945 units  |publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=23 January 2016}}</ref> detached several platoons to reinforce the 2/3rd Independent Company.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=50}} During the month of May, they were heavily engaged in patrolling the 3rd Division's northern flank, around the [[Markham River]], and the area around Missim, and one patrol succeeded in reaching the mouth of the Bituang River, to the north of Salamaua.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=53}}\n\nIn response to the Allied moves, the [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|Japanese Eighteenth Army]] commander, Lieutenant General [[Hataz\u014d Adachi]], sent the [[66th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|66th Infantry Regiment]] from [[Finschhafen]] to reinforce the Okabe Detachment and launch an offensive. The 1,500-strong 66th attacked at [[Battle of Lababia Ridge|Lababia Ridge]], on 20\u201323 June.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=240}} The battle has been described as one of the Australian Army's \"classic engagements\" of World War II.<ref name=onthisday>{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/ARMY/ahu/On_This_Day/June/20_June.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808220637/http://www.army.gov.au/AHU/On_This_Day/June/20_June.htm |title=On This Day&nbsp;\u2013 20 June |work=Army History Unit |publisher=Australian Army |archivedate=8 August 2008}}</ref> The ridge's only defenders were \"D\" Company of the [[2/6th Battalion (Australia)|2/6th Battalion]].

The operation was opened with an assault by the inexperienced [[58th/59th Battalion (Australia)|58th/59th Infantry Battalion]], and included [[hand-to-hand combat]].{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=107\u2013113}} At the same time as the second Australian assault on Bobdubi, on 30 June&nbsp;\u2013 4 July, the US [[162nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|162nd Regimental Combat Team]] (162nd RCT), supported by engineers from the [[2nd Engineer Special Brigade]],{{sfn|Morison|1975|p=258}} made an unopposed amphibious [[landing at Nassau Bay]] and established a [[beachhead]] there,{{sfn|Trigellis-Smith|1994|p=221}} to launch a drive along the coast, as well as bringing ashore heavy guns with which to reduce the Japanese positions.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=138}}\n\n[[Image:Commandos from the Australian 2-3rd Independent Company take up positions in weapon pits during an attack on Timbered Knoll, north of Orodubi (between Mubo and Salamaua), New Guinea.jpg|200px|thumb|left|29 July 1943.

(A still from the film ''Assault on Salamaua'' by [[Damien Parer]])]]\n\nA week after the Bobdubi attack and Nassau Bay landing, the [[6th Division (Australia)|Australian 17th Brigade]] launched another assault on Japanese positions at Mubo.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=107}} With the Allies making ground closer to Salamaua, the Japanese withdrew to avoid encirclement. The Japanese divisional commander, [[Hidemitsu Nakano]], subsequently determined to concentrate his forces in the Komiatum area, which was an area of high ground to the south of Salamaua.{{sfn|Tanaka|1980|p=161}}\n\nMeanwhile, the main body of the 162nd RCT followed a flanking route along the coast, before encountering fierce resistance at [[Battle of Roosevelt Ridge|Roosevelt Ridge]]\u2014named after its commander, Lieutenant Colonel [[Archibald Roosevelt]]{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=183\u2013184}}\u2014between 21 July and 14 August. Between 16 July and 19 August, the [[42nd Battalion (Australia)|42nd]] and [[2/5th Battalion (Australia)|2/5th Infantry Battalions]] gained a foothold on [[Battle of Mount Tambu|Mount Tambu]]. They held on despite fierce Japanese counter-attacks. The battle turned when they were assisted by the 162nd RCT.{{sfn|Maitland|1999|pp=72\u201374}} Throughout July, the Japanese sought to reinforce the Salamaua area, drawing troops away from Lae; by the end of the month there were around 8,000 Japanese around Salamaua.{{sfn|Morison|1975|p=258}}\n\nOn 23 August, Savige and the 3rd Division handed over the Salamaua operation to the [[Australian 5th Division (World War II)|Australian 5th Division]] under Major General [[Edward James Milford|Edward Milford]]. Throughout late August and into early September the Japanese in the Salamaua region fought to hold the advancing Allies along their final line of defence in front of Salamaua, nevertheless the 58th/59th Infantry Battalion succeeded in crossing the Francisco River and the 42nd Infantry Battalion subsequently captured the main Japanese defensive position around Charlie Hill.{{sfn|Tanaka|1980|pp=171\u2013175}} After Allied landings near Lae in the first week of September, the [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|18th Army]] commander, [[Hataz\u014d Adachi]], ordered Nakano to abandon Salamaua and subsequently his forces withdrew to the north disinvesting the town and transferring between 5,000 and 6,000 troops by barge, while other troops marched out along the coastal road. The 5th Division subsequently occupied Salamaua on 11 September, securing its airfield.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=241}}{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=309\u2013310}}\n\nThe fighting between April and September in the Salamaua region cost the Australians 1,083 casualties, including 343 dead. The Japanese lost 2,722 killed and a further 5,378 wounded, for a total of 8,100 casualties.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=241}} The US 162nd lost 81 killed and 396 wounded.{{sfn|James|2014|p=206}} Throughout the fighting, Allied aircraft and US [[PT boat]]s supported the troops ashore, enforcing a blockade of the Huon Gulf and the [[Vitiaz Strait|Vitiaz]] and [[Dampier Strait (Papua New Guinea)|Dampier Straits]].{{sfn|Morison|1975|p=258}}\n\n==Operation Postern==\n[[Image:Australian 9th Division amphibious landing east of Lae September 1943 (AWM photo 042371).jpg|300px|thumb|right|4 September 1943.

Planned as part of wider operations to eventually secure the [[Huon Peninsula campaign|Huon Peninsula]], the operation to capture Lae was planned by General [[Thomas Blamey]], who assumed command of the Allied [[New Guinea Force]], and [[I Corps (Australia)|Australian I Corps]] commander, Lieutenant General Sir [[Edmund Herring]].{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=407\u2013409}} This was a classic [[pincer movement]], involving an [[landing at Lae|amphibious assault east of the town]], and an [[Landing at Nadzab|airborne landing near Nadzab]], 50 kilometres (30&nbsp;mi) to the west.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=298\u2013311}}{{sfn|Bradley|2010|p=48}} Battle casualties for the 9th Division during Operation Postern amounted to 547, of which 115 were killed and 73 were posted as missing, and 397 were wounded, while the 7th Division suffered 142 casualties, of which 38 were killed.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=392}} The Japanese lost about 1,500 killed, while a further 2,000 were captured.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=241}}\n\n===Lae===\n{{Main|Landing at Lae}}\nOn 4 September, the [[Australian 9th Division]], under Major General [[George Wootten]], landed east of [[Lae]], on \"Red Beach\" and \"Yellow Beach\", near [[Malahang, Papua New Guinea|Malahang]] beginning an attempt to encircle Japanese forces in the town. Five [[United States Navy|US Navy]] destroyers provided artillery support. The landings were not opposed by land forces but were attacked by Japanese bombers, which inflicted numerous casualties amongst the naval and military personnel on board several landing craft.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=306\u2013307}}\n\nThe [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]] led the assault, with the [[26th Brigade (Australia)|26th]] following them up while the [[24th Brigade (Australia)|24th]] formed the divisional reserve.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=305}} The 9th Division faced formidable natural barriers in the form of rivers swollen by recent rain. They came to a halt at the [[Busu River]], which could not be bridged for two reasons: the 9th lacked heavy equipment, and the far bank was occupied by Japanese soldiers. On 9 September, the [[2/28th Battalion (Australia)|2/28th Infantry Battalion]] led the attack across the Busu River and secured a bridgehead after fierce fighting.{{sfn|Maitland |1999|p= 78}}\n\n===Nadzab===\n{{Main|Landing at Nadzab}}\n[[Image:Awm 128387 nadzab.jpg|250px|thumb|right|5 September 1943.

The airborne forces secured Nadzab Airfield, so that the [[Australian 7th Division]], under Major General [[George Alan Vasey|George Vasey]], could be flown in, to cut off any possible Japanese retreat into the [[Markham Valley]]. The 7th Division suffered its worst casualties of the campaign on 7 September, as they were boarding planes at Port Moresby: a [[B-24 Liberator]] bomber crashed while taking off, hitting five trucks carrying members of the [[2/33rd Battalion (Australia)|2/33rd Infantry Battalion]]: 60 died and 92 were injured.<ref name=AWM>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11284.asp |title=2/33rd Battalion |work=Second World War units, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Tragic Story of Nadzab |author=Morley, Dave |newspaper=Army News: The Soldiers' Newspaper |edition=1314 |date=26 September 2013 |page=21}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 September, the 7th Division's [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Infantry Brigade]] engaged about 200 Japanese soldiers entrenched at Jensen's Plantation in a firefight, at a range of {{convert|50|yd}},<ref name=LG/> with the 2/4th Field Regiment providing artillery support.

The [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] was the result, and a quick follow up landing was subsequently undertaken at [[Battle of Scarlet Beach|Scarlet Beach]] by the [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]].{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=315}}\n\nDespite initial plans to do so, Salamaua was not developed as a base.  The Australian I Corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, visited Salamaua by [[PT boat]] on 14 September 1943, three days after its capture, and found little more than bomb craters and corrugated iron.  He recommended cancelling the development of Salamaua and concentrating all available resources on Lae. The base that had originally been envisaged now looked like a waste of effort, because Salamaua was a poor site for a port or airbase. However, in drawing the Japanese attention away from Lae at a critical time, the assault on Salamaua had already served its purpose.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}\n\nLae, on the other hand, was subsequently transformed into two bases: the Australian Lae Base Sub Area and the [[USASOS]] Base E. Herring combined the two as the Lae Fortress, under Milford. Because Blamey had launched Postern before the logistical preparations were complete, most of the units needed to operate the base were not yet available.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/documents/wwii/lae-port.htm |author=Historical Section, Army Forces Western Pacific |title=Military History of the United States Army Services of Supply in the Southwest Pacific: Chapter 18: Base at Lae Until March 1944 |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of Lae as a port was to supply the airbase at Nadzab, but this was compromised because the Markham Valley Road was found to be in poor condition. To expedite the development of Nadzab, minimal efforts were made to repair it, and heavy military traffic bound for Nadzab was permitted to use it.

He gave sustained military service and leadership through the Scottish and Welsh campaigns of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and was summoned to parliament from 1295 to 1315. His marriage in c. 1282 brought him other manors including [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]] in Northumberland and its appurtenances. In 1297 he was enfeoffed as [[tenant-in-chief]] (feudal lord) of the entire [[English feudal barony|barony]] of [[Baron Greystoke|Greystoke]], seated at [[Greystoke, Cumbria|Greystoke in Cumberland]] but with Yorkshire estates, through his [[matrilineal]] Greystok descent. He entered upon these in his own right in 1306. Having served in the retinue of [[Aymer de Valence]], during the first decade of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]'s reign he remained dependable as a military leader and royal lieutenant in the defence administration of the northern counties and Scottish marches. His descendants adopted the Greystoke name, and their inheritance continued in the male line until the end of the 15th century.<ref>T.F. Tout, revised J.S.
