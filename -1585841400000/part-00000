During [[World War II]], authorities banned most Western music, but fans and players kept it alive in secret, and it resumed popularity after the war.

Cheaper {{okina}}ukuleles are generally made from [[plywood]] or [[laminate]] woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a [[tonewood]] such as [[spruce]]. More expensive {{okina}}ukuleles are made of solid hardwoods such as [[mahogany]]. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is a type of acacia endemic to Hawai{{okina}}i, called [[koa]].\n\nTypically, {{okina}}ukuleles have a figure-eight body shape similar to that of a small [[acoustic guitar]]. They are also often seen in non-standard shapes, such as cutaway shape and an oval, usually called a \"pineapple\" {{okina}}ukulele, invented by the [[Kamaka Ukulele]] company, or a boat-paddle shape, and occasionally a square shape, often made out of an old wooden cigar box.\n\nThese instruments usually have four strings; some strings may be paired in [[Course (music)|courses]], giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings (primarily for greater strumming volume.)  The strings themselves were originally made of [[catgut]].  Modern {{okina}}ukuleles use [[nylon]] [[polymer]] strings, with many variations in the material, such as [[fluorocarbon]], [[aluminium]] (as winding on lower-pitched strings),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.martinguitar.com/strings/ukulele/|title=Ukulele Strings - C.F. Martin & Co.|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and Nylgut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquilausa.com/uke_strings.html|title=Aquila Nylgut Ukulele Strings, wholesale source for retailers and dealers|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nInstruments with 6 or 8 strings in four courses are often called taropatches, or taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. They were once common in a concert size, but now the tenor size is more common for six-string taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. The six string, four course version, has two single and two double courses, and is sometimes called a Lili'u, though this name also applies to the eight-string version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|title=110mb.com - Want to start a website?|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621113819/http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|archive-date=2013-06-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Eight-string baritone taropatches exist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/kamaka-baritone-8-string-hf-48.html|title=Kamaka Baritone 8 String HF-48|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and, 5-string tenors have also been made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/shop-by/popular-models/kala-ka-atp5-ctg-solid-cedar-top-5-string-tenor.html|title=Kala -KA-ATP-CTG Solid Cedar Top Tenor Slothead -Gloss Finish|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> A Javanese {{okina}}ukulele commonly has only three strings.

Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or \"pocket uke\"), bass, and [[Contrabass|contrabass]] {{okina}}ukuleles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamorindamusic.com/uke_101.htm|title=Lamorinda Music|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> The soprano, often called \"standard\" in Hawaii, is the second-smallest and was the original size. The concert size was developed in the 1920s as an enhanced soprano, slightly larger and louder with a deeper tone. Shortly thereafter, the tenor was created, having more volume and deeper bass tone. The baritone (resembling a smaller [[tenor guitar]]) was created in the 1940s, and the contrabass and bass are recent innovations (2010 and 2014, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/news-features-the-story-behind-the-kala-u-bass/|title=The story behind the wildly popular Kala U-Bass|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunaguitars.com/query?upc=819998182960|title=Uke Baritone Bass w/Preamp Tattoo - Luna Guitars|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Size and popular tunings of standard {{okina}}ukulele types:'''\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px\"   | Type\n! style=\"width:96px\"   | Alternate<br/>names\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | Typical<br/>length\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | [[Scale (string instruments)|Scale<br/> length]]<ref>The \u201cscale\u201d is the length of the playable part of the strings, from the nut at the top to the bridge at the bottom.</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"  | Frets\n! style=\"width:60px;\"  | Range<ref>Exact range depends on the tuning and the number of frets.</ref>\n! style=\"width:100px;\" | Common<br />tuning<ref>On the soprano, concert, and tenor instruments, the most common tuning results in a \"bottom\" string that is ''not'' the lowest in ''pitch'', as it is tuned a 5th&nbsp;higher than the next string (and a major&nbsp;2nd below the \"top\" string).

The examples shown in the chart reflect the range of each instrument from the lowest standard tuning, to the highest fret in the highest standard tuning.\n\n==Tuning==<!--[[My dog has fleas]] links directly here-->\n[[File:Ukulele standard tuning.png|thumb|Ukulele C<sup>6</sup> tuning {{audio|Ukulele standard tuning.mid|Play}}.]]\n[[File:My dog has fleas.png|thumb|\"My dog has fleas\" tuning. {{audio|My dog has fleas.mid|Play}}]]\n\nOne of the most common tunings for the standard or soprano {{okina}}ukulele is [[Sixth chord|C<sup>6</sup>]] tuning: G<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, which is often remembered by the notes in the \"My dog has fleas\" jingle (see sidebar).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ukuleleintheclassroom.com/tunings.htm|title=Ukulele in the Classroom|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>  The G string is tuned an octave higher than might be expected, so this is often called \"high G\" tuning. This is known as a \"[[reentrant tuning]]\"; it enables uniquely close-harmony chording. \n\nMore rarely used with the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is C<sup>6</sup> linear tuning, or \"low G\" tuning, which has the G in sequence an octave lower:  G<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to playing the top four strings (DGBE) of a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret. \n\nAnother common tuning for the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is the higher string-tension D<sup>6</sup> tuning (or simply D tuning), A<sub>4</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, one step higher than the G<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub> tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s.  D<sup>6</sup> tuning is said by some{{by whom|date=November 2019}} to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D<sup>6</sup> tuning with a low fourth string, A<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, is sometimes called \"Canadian tuning\" after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, and extensive use by [[James Hill (Canadian musician)|James Hill]] and [[J. Chalmers Doane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jameshillmusic.com/faq#tuning|title=James Hill - FAQ|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhether C<sup>6</sup> or D<sup>6</sup> tuning should be the \"standard\" tuning is a matter of long and ongoing debate.  There are historic and popular ukulele methods that have used each.<ref>Tranquada, J.; ''The Ukulele:  A History''; University of Hawaii Press; Honolulu:  2012.  0824-83634-0  According to Tranquanda, \"\"This is an old and seemingly never-ending argument. While the pioneering methods of Kaai (1906) and Rollinson (1909) both use C tuning, a sampling of the methods that follow give a sense of the unresolved nature of the debate: Kealakai (1914), D tuning; Bailey (1914), C tuning; Kia (1914), D tuning; Kamiki (1916), D tuning; Guckert (1917), C tuning; Stumpf (1917), D tuning.\"</ref>\n\nFor the concert and tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, both reentrant and linear C<sup>6</sup> tunings are standard; linear tuning in particular is widely used for the tenor {{okina}}ukulele, more so than for the soprano and concert instruments.\n\nThe baritone {{okina}}ukulele usually uses linear G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>\u2013B<sub>3</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>, the same as the highest four strings of a standard 6-string guitar. \n\nBass {{okina}}ukuleles are tuned similarly to bass guitars: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub> for U-Bass style instruments (sometimes called contrabass), or an octave higher, E<sub>2</sub>\u2013A<sub>2</sub>\u2013D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>, for Ohana type metal-string basses.\n\nSopranino {{okina}}ukulele tuning is less standardized. They usually are tuned re-entrantly, but frequently at a higher pitch than C; for example, re-entrant G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>5</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>.\n\nAs is commonly the case with string instruments, other tunings may be preferred by individual players. For example, special string sets are available to tune the baritone {{okina}}ukulele in linear C<sup>6</sup>.

During [[World War II]], authorities banned most Western music, but fans and players kept it alive in secret, and it resumed popularity after the war.

Cheaper {{okina}}ukuleles are generally made from [[plywood]] or [[laminate]] woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a [[tonewood]] such as [[spruce]]. More expensive {{okina}}ukuleles are made of solid hardwoods such as [[mahogany]]. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is a type of acacia endemic to Hawai{{okina}}i, called [[koa]].\n\nTypically, {{okina}}ukuleles have a figure-eight body shape similar to that of a small [[acoustic guitar]]. They are also often seen in non-standard shapes, such as cutaway shape and an oval, usually called a \"pineapple\" {{okina}}ukulele, invented by the [[Kamaka Ukulele]] company, or a boat-paddle shape, and occasionally a square shape, often made out of an old wooden cigar box.\n\nThese instruments usually have four strings; some strings may be paired in [[Course (music)|courses]], giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings (primarily for greater strumming volume.)  The strings themselves were originally made of [[catgut]].  Modern {{okina}}ukuleles use [[nylon]] [[polymer]] strings, with many variations in the material, such as [[fluorocarbon]], [[aluminium]] (as winding on lower-pitched strings),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.martinguitar.com/strings/ukulele/|title=Ukulele Strings - C.F.

They were once common in a concert size, but now the tenor size is more common for six-string taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. The six string, four course version, has two single and two double courses, and is sometimes called a Lili'u, though this name also applies to the eight-string version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|title=110mb.com - Want to start a website?|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621113819/http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|archive-date=2013-06-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Eight-string baritone taropatches exist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/kamaka-baritone-8-string-hf-48.html|title=Kamaka Baritone 8 String HF-48|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and, 5-string tenors have also been made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/shop-by/popular-models/kala-ka-atp5-ctg-solid-cedar-top-5-string-tenor.html|title=Kala -KA-ATP-CTG Solid Cedar Top Tenor Slothead -Gloss Finish|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> A Javanese {{okina}}ukulele commonly has only three strings. Apparently, it's a modern innovation, as the first generation of  three-stringed {{okina}}ukuleles were four stringed instruments with one string removed. They are now manufactured with only three strings.\n[[File:3 ukes.jpg|thumb|140px|Soprano pineapple ukulele, baritone ukulele and taropatch baritone ukulele.]]\n\n==Types and sizes==\nCommon types of {{okina}}ukuleles include soprano (standard {{okina}}ukulele), concert, tenor, and baritone.  Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or \"pocket uke\"), bass, and [[Contrabass|contrabass]] {{okina}}ukuleles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamorindamusic.com/uke_101.htm|title=Lamorinda Music|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> The soprano, often called \"standard\" in Hawaii, is the second-smallest and was the original size. The concert size was developed in the 1920s as an enhanced soprano, slightly larger and louder with a deeper tone. Shortly thereafter, the tenor was created, having more volume and deeper bass tone. The baritone (resembling a smaller [[tenor guitar]]) was created in the 1940s, and the contrabass and bass are recent innovations (2010 and 2014, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/news-features-the-story-behind-the-kala-u-bass/|title=The story behind the wildly popular Kala U-Bass|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunaguitars.com/query?upc=819998182960|title=Uke Baritone Bass w/Preamp Tattoo - Luna Guitars|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Size and popular tunings of standard {{okina}}ukulele types:'''\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px\"   | Type\n! style=\"width:96px\"   | Alternate<br/>names\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | Typical<br/>length\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | [[Scale (string instruments)|Scale<br/> length]]<ref>The \u201cscale\u201d is the length of the playable part of the strings, from the nut at the top to the bridge at the bottom.</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"  | Frets\n! style=\"width:60px;\"  | Range<ref>Exact range depends on the tuning and the number of frets.</ref>\n! style=\"width:100px;\" | Common<br />tuning<ref>On the soprano, concert, and tenor instruments, the most common tuning results in a \"bottom\" string that is ''not'' the lowest in ''pitch'', as it is tuned a 5th&nbsp;higher than the next string (and a major&nbsp;2nd below the \"top\" string).

This is known as a \"[[reentrant tuning]]\"; it enables uniquely close-harmony chording. \n\nMore rarely used with the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is C<sup>6</sup> linear tuning, or \"low G\" tuning, which has the G in sequence an octave lower:  G<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to playing the top four strings (DGBE) of a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret. \n\nAnother common tuning for the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is the higher string-tension D<sup>6</sup> tuning (or simply D tuning), A<sub>4</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, one step higher than the G<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub> tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s.  D<sup>6</sup> tuning is said by some{{by whom|date=November 2019}} to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D<sup>6</sup> tuning with a low fourth string, A<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, is sometimes called \"Canadian tuning\" after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, and extensive use by [[James Hill (Canadian musician)|James Hill]] and [[J. Chalmers Doane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jameshillmusic.com/faq#tuning|title=James Hill - FAQ|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhether C<sup>6</sup> or D<sup>6</sup> tuning should be the \"standard\" tuning is a matter of long and ongoing debate.

While the pioneering methods of Kaai (1906) and Rollinson (1909) both use C tuning, a sampling of the methods that follow give a sense of the unresolved nature of the debate: Kealakai (1914), D tuning; Bailey (1914), C tuning; Kia (1914), D tuning; Kamiki (1916), D tuning; Guckert (1917), C tuning; Stumpf (1917), D tuning.\"</ref>\n\nFor the concert and tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, both reentrant and linear C<sup>6</sup> tunings are standard; linear tuning in particular is widely used for the tenor {{okina}}ukulele, more so than for the soprano and concert instruments.\n\nThe baritone {{okina}}ukulele usually uses linear G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>\u2013B<sub>3</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>, the same as the highest four strings of a standard 6-string guitar. \n\nBass {{okina}}ukuleles are tuned similarly to bass guitars: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub> for U-Bass style instruments (sometimes called contrabass), or an octave higher, E<sub>2</sub>\u2013A<sub>2</sub>\u2013D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>, for Ohana type metal-string basses.\n\nSopranino {{okina}}ukulele tuning is less standardized. They usually are tuned re-entrantly, but frequently at a higher pitch than C; for example, re-entrant G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>5</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>.\n\nAs is commonly the case with string instruments, other tunings may be preferred by individual players. For example, special string sets are available to tune the baritone {{okina}}ukulele in linear C<sup>6</sup>.

Unlike [[up quark|up]] and [[down quark]]s, from which everyday matter is made, [[strange quark]]s are formed in [[pair production|pair-production]] processes in collisions between constituents of the plasma. The dominant mechanism of production involves [[gluon]]s only present when matter has become a quark\u2013gluon plasma. When quark\u2013gluon plasma disassembles into [[hadron]]s in a breakup process, the high availability of strange [[quark|antiquarks]] helps to produce antimatter containing multiple strange quarks, which is otherwise rarely made. Similar considerations are at present made for the heavier [[charm quark|charm]] flavor, which is made at the beginning of the collision process in the first interactions and is only abundant in the high-energy environments of [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]].\n\n==Quark\u2013gluon plasma in the early universe and in the laboratory==\n[[File:strange production 3.svg|thumb|280px|Collision between two highly-energetic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] create an extremely dense environment, in which quarks and gluons may interact as free particles for brief moments.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>-22</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds. \n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581\u2013581|doi=10.1038/35001196|issn=0028-0836|via=}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3431330|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|issn=0031-9228|via=}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

Among these, heavy mesons composed of strange quarks and a heavy quark, such as [[Bottomness|bottom]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange B|link=yes}}) or [[Charm quark|charm]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange D|link=yes}}), are of particular interest.  The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.

The work in this field today focuses on the theoretical interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark\u2013gluon plasma at the time of breakup. The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark\u2013gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. For this reason the presentation of the experimental results was made above without a comparison of data to model, so that the results following the pattern predicted can speak for themselves. There are as many as 10 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n", "text_old": "'''Strangeness production''' is a signature and a [[diagnostic tool]] of [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] (or QGP) formation and properties.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>-22</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

The energy at RHIC is 11 times greater in the CM frame of reference compared to the earlier CERN work. The important result is that enhancement observed by STAR also increases with the number of participating nucleons. We further note that for the most peripheral events at the smallest number of participants, copper and gold systems show at the same number of participants the same enhancement as could be expected.\n\nAnother remarkable feature of these results comparing CERN and STAR is that the enhancement is of similar magnitude for the vastly different energy available in the reaction. This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark\u2013gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark\u2013gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded.\n\n==Horn in K-to-pi ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}\n[[File:NA61-NA49_horn.png|thumb||280px|The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged [[kaon]]s and [[pion]]s as a function of collision energy in collisions of two [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[proton]]\u2013proton interactions]]\nOne of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.

As the fireball of matter expands and breaks apart, this, in turn, provides a very high abundance of strange hadrons.  Among these, heavy mesons composed of strange quarks and a heavy quark, such as [[Bottomness|bottom]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange B|link=yes}}) or [[Charm quark|charm]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange D|link=yes}}), are of particular interest.  The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.  In that way, the Strangeness has turned today more generally into the Quark Flavor signature of quark\u2013gluon plasma.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=I. Kuznetsova\n |author2=J.

The work in this field today focuses on the theoretical interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark\u2013gluon plasma at the time of breakup. The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark\u2013gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. For this reason the presentation of the experimental results was made above without a comparison of data to model, so that the results following the pattern predicted can speak for themselves. There are as many as 10 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n", "name_user": "Bibliophilen", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness_production"}

After five number-one solo hits in America in the 1970s, John hit number one in a duet with [[Kiki Dee]] with 1976's \"[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]\". From then until \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", John did not record a number-one single by himself and only had two chart toppers altogether.

The song was the only number-one debut to top the Year-End Hot 100 until [[Ed Sheeran]]'s \"[[Shape of You]]\" in [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2017|2017]]. It was on the chart for 35 more weeks, making it the number 8 song of 1998, making \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" one of only three songs in the history of the chart to be ranked on the top ten of two separate Hot 100 year-end charts, along with [[Chubby Checker]]'s \"[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]\" (number 10 in 1960 and 9 in 1962) and [[LeAnn Rimes]]' \"[[How Do I Live]]\" (number 9 in 1997 and 5 in 1998); the latter had charted on the same period with the song.

After five number-one solo hits in America in the 1970s, John hit number one in a duet with [[Kiki Dee]] with 1976's \"[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]\". From then until \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", John did not record a number-one single by himself and only had two chart toppers altogether. The first of those was 1986's \"[[That's What Friends Are For]]\", where he joined forces with [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Gladys Knight]], and [[Stevie Wonder]] to form a quartet known as Dionne & Friends which helped raise money for [[AIDS]] research. Six years later John teamed with [[George Michael]] on a re-release of his earlier hit \"[[Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]\". \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" was also the only number-one song in the year-end to be number one the year after.
