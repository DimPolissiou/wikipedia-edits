{"title_page": "Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles", "text_new": "[[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|Spatial rotations in three dimensions]] can be [[Coordinate system|parametrized]] using both [[Euler angles]] and [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|unit quaternions]]. This article explains how to convert between the two representations.  Actually this simple use of \"quaternions\" was first presented by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] some seventy years earlier than [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] to solve the problem of [[magic square]]s.  For this reason the dynamics community commonly refers to quaternions in this application as \"Euler parameters\".\n\n==Definition==\nFor the rest of this article, the [[JPL]] [[quaternion]] convention<ref>W. G. Breckenridge, \"Quaternions proposed standard conventions,\" NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Technical Report, Oct. 1979.</ref> shall be used. A unit [[quaternion]] can be described as:\n:<math>\\mathbf{q} = \\begin{bmatrix} q_0 & q_1 & q_2 & q_3 \\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} q_w & q_x & q_y & q_z \\end{bmatrix}^T</math>\n:<math>|\\mathbf{q}|^2 = q_0^2 + q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2 = q_w^2 + q_x^2 + q_y^2 + q_z^2 = 1</math>\n\nWe can associate a [[quaternion]] with a rotation around an axis by the following expression\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{q}_0 = \\mathbf{q}_w = \\cos(\\alpha/2)</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{q}_1 = \\mathbf{q}_x = \\sin(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\beta_x)</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{q}_2 = \\mathbf{q}_y = \\sin(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\beta_y)</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{q}_3 = \\mathbf{q}_z = \\sin(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\beta_z)</math>\nwhere \u03b1 is a simple rotation angle (the value in radians of the [[angle of rotation]]) and cos(\u03b2<sub>''x''</sub>), cos(\u03b2<sub>''y''</sub>) and cos(\u03b2<sub>''z''</sub>) are the  \"[[direction cosine]]s\" locating the axis of rotation (Euler's Rotation Theorem).\n\n===Tait\u2013Bryan angles===\n[[Image:taitbrianzyx.svg|thumb|right|200px|Tait\u2013Bryan angles. ''z-y\u2032-x\u2033'' sequence (intrinsic rotations; ''N'' coincides with ''y\u2019''). The angle rotation sequence is ''\u03c8'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u0424''. Note that in this case ''\u03c8 > 90\u00b0'' and ''\u03b8'' is a negative angle.]]\n\nSimilarly for Euler angles, we use the [[Euler angles#Tait\u2013Bryan_angles|Tait Bryan angles]] (in terms of [[flight dynamics]]):\n* Bank \u2013 <math>\\phi</math>: rotation about the new X-axis\n* Attitude \u2013 <math>\\theta</math>: rotation about the new Y-axis\n* Heading \u2013 <math>\\psi</math>: rotation about the Z-axis\nwhere the X-axis points forward, Y-axis to the right and Z-axis downward with angles defined for clockwise/lefthand rotation. In the conversion example [[Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles#Conversion|above]] the rotation occurs in the order heading, attitude, bank (about intrinsic axes).\n\n== Rotation matrices ==\nThe [[orthogonal matrix]] (post-multiplying a column vector) corresponding to a clockwise/[[Right-hand rule|left-handed]] (looking along positive axis to origin) rotation by the unit [[quaternion]] <math>q=q_0+iq_1+jq_2+kq_3</math> is given by the [[Quaternions and spatial rotation#Quaternion-derived rotation matrix|inhomogeneous expression]]:\n\n:<math>R = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 1- 2(q_2^2 + q_3^2) &  2(q_1 q_2 - q_0 q_3) &  2(q_0 q_2 + q_1 q_3) \\\\\n2(q_1 q_2 + q_0 q_3) & 1 - 2(q_1^2 + q_3^2)  &  2(q_2 q_3 - q_0 q_1) \\\\\n2(q_1 q_3 - q_0 q_2) & 2( q_0 q_1 + q_2 q_3) &  1 - 2(q_1^2 + q_2^2)\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nor equivalently, by the [[Homogeneous coordinates|homogeneous]] expression:\n\n:<math>R = \\begin{bmatrix}\nq_0^2 + q_1^2 - q_2^2 - q_3^2 &  2(q_1 q_2 - q_0 q_3) &  2(q_0 q_2 + q_1 q_3) \\\\\n2(q_1 q_2 + q_0 q_3) & q_0^2 - q_1^2 + q_2^2 - q_3^2 &  2(q_2 q_3 - q_0 q_1) \\\\\n2(q_1 q_3 - q_0 q_2) & 2( q_0 q_1 + q_2 q_3) & q_0^2 - q_1^2 - q_2^2 + q_3^2 \n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nIf <math>q_0+iq_1+jq_2+kq_3</math> is not a unit quaternion then the homogeneous form is still a scalar multiple of a rotation matrix, while the inhomogeneous form is in general no longer an orthogonal matrix. This is why in numerical work the homogeneous form is to be preferred if distortion is to be avoided.\n\nThe direction cosine matrix (from the rotated Body XYZ coordinates to the original Lab xyz coordinates for a clockwise/lefthand rotation) corresponding to a post-multiply '''Body 3-2-1''' sequence with [[Euler angles]] (\u03c8,\u2009\u03b8, \u03c6) is given by:<ref name=nasa-rotation>{{cite web|last=NASA Mission Planning and Analysis Division|title=Euler Angles, Quaternions, and Transformation Matrices|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770024290_1977024290.pdf|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n& =\nR_z(\\psi) R_y(\\theta) R_x(\\phi) \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nX \\\\\nY \\\\\nZ \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\\\\n& = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos\\psi & -\\sin\\psi & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\psi & \\cos\\psi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta & 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\sin\\theta & 0 & \\cos\\theta \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\cos\\phi & -\\sin\\phi \\\\\n0 & \\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nX \\\\\nY \\\\\nZ \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\\\\n& = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta \\cos\\psi & -\\cos\\phi \\sin\\psi + \\sin\\phi \\sin\\theta \\cos\\psi &   \\sin\\phi \\sin\\psi + \\cos\\phi \\sin\\theta \\cos\\psi \\\\\n\\cos\\theta \\sin\\psi &  \\cos\\phi \\cos\\psi + \\sin\\phi \\sin\\theta \\sin\\psi & -\\sin\\phi \\cos\\psi + \\cos\\phi \\sin\\theta \\sin\\psi \\\\\n-\\sin\\theta         &  \\sin\\phi \\cos\\theta                              &   \\cos\\phi \\cos\\theta \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nX \\\\\nY \\\\\nZ \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n[[Image:Eulerangles.svg|right|thumb|150px|Euler angles for Body 3-1-3 Sequence \u2013 The xyz (original fixed Lab) system is shown in blue, the XYZ (rotated final Body) system is shown in red.

This article explains how to convert between the two representations.  Actually this simple use of \"quaternions\" was first presented by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] some seventy years earlier than [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] to solve the problem of [[magic square]]s.  For this reason the dynamics community commonly refers to quaternions in this application as \"Euler parameters\".\n\n==Definition==\nFor the rest of this article, the [[JPL]] [[quaternion]] convention<ref>W.

When Blount blamed the U.S. consul for providing assistance for the overthrow, Cleveland proposed to use American military force to overthrow the new government by force and reinstall Liliuokalani as an absolute monarch. When the deposed Queen refused to grant amnesty as a condition of her reinstatement, she was accused of telling an American official she would \"behead\" the current government leaders and confiscate their property,<ref>Warren Zimmermann, ''First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power'' (2004) p 290</ref> Cleveland referred the matter to Congress.\n\nThe U.S. Senate, under Democratic control but angered at being shut out of a major foreign policy issue by Cleveland, then produced its own report, written by Senator [[John Tyler Morgan]], a Democrat, and known as the [[Morgan Report]].
