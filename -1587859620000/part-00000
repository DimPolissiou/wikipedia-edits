In her youth, she was engaged to [[Les Palmer (Home and Away)|Les Palmer]] (Graham Lancaster) but he was killed in the [[Vietnam War]] and Celia never married. She is first seen talking to Alf about his relationship with [[Ailsa Stewart|Ailsa Hogan]] ([[Judy Nunn]]). Celia is judgmental and something of a gossip but ultimately well-meaning. She supports former brother-in-law Donald's attempts to have mentally disabled resident [[Nico Pappas (Home and Away)|Nico Pappas]] ([[Nicholas Papademetriou]]) sectioned but changes her mind quickly once [[Tom Fletcher (Home and Away)|Tom Fletcher]] ([[Roger Oakley]]) speaks to her. Celia unwittingly spreads the news that [[Carly Morris]] ([[Sharyn Hodgson]]) has been raped. Seeing the hurt she has caused, Celia tries to apologise to Carly and Tom but neither is willing to listen. Ailsa gives her a packet of chewing gum and advises her to use it whenever she feels like gossiping. Alf and Ailsa try to set her up by inviting her and local police sergeant [[Bob Barnett]] (Robert Baxter) to dinner. Celia spends the night getting drunk and Barnett has to escort her home. Celia invites him to watch her play tennis but assures him she only wanted to be friends with him. A bemused Barnett tells her that he has only ever seen her that way.\n\nCelia's niece, [[Roo Stewart|Roo]] ([[Justine Clarke]]), falls pregnant and, believing [[Frank Morgan (Home and Away)|Frank Morgan]] ([[Alex Papps]]) is the father, Celia tries to arrange for the pair to get married. Morag, Celia's sister, persuades Roo to admit Frank is not the father and Celia gives Roo a place to stay. Celia purchases the local store from Ailsa when she sells it.  Her first act is to try to evict Frank and his friend, [[Narelle Smart]] (Amanda Newman-Phillips), from the flat above the store.  Local doctor [[Philip Matheson]] (John Morris), a friend of the youngsters and fellow tenant, persuades Celia to give them a few months to move out. When Narelle is supportive towards Celia when her great-niece [[Martha Mackenzie|Martha]] (Burcin Kapkin) is kidnapped by her father, [[Brett Macklin]] (Gerry Sont), Celia decides not to evict her. Celia is shocked when she learns Frank's new wife [[Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)|Bobby Simpson]] ([[Nicolle Dickson]]) is Morag's daughter from an affair with Donald and, thus, her niece. Celia unwittingly reveals the truth when reporter [[James Donahue (Home and Away)|James Donahue]] ([[Richard Morgan (actor)|Richard Morgan]]) begins asking questions. Morag moves in with Celia at their parents' old house and she is annoyed but relieved when Morag moves out to the Blaxland mansion.\n\nThe store is destroyed in an arson attack by [[Dodge (Home and Away)|Brian 'Dodge' Forbes]] (Kelly Dingwall), which results in Philip's death. Celia makes arrangements with former school counsellor [[Andrew Foley (Home and Away)|Andrew Foley]] ([[Peter Bensley]]) to set up a youth advice centre in the back room of the Diner, but is disgusted when she learns Andrew is an alcoholic and he leaves town. She persuades Ailsa to let her try running it on her own but Carly, who recently had a drinking problem, pretends to be drunk to show Celia she would not know how to deal with someone with a genuine problem. Andrew returns sober and asks Celia to help by counseling [[Marilyn Chambers (Home and Away)|Marilyn Chambers]] ([[Emily Symons]]) but she panics when Marilyn takes some sleeping tablets and thinks she has attempted suicide. Celia causes more turmoil when her nephew [[Duncan Stewart (Home and Away)|Duncan]] (Allana Ellis) suffers an allergic reaction to an old family christening gown she provides.\n\nCelia befriends [[Nigel Taggart]] (Gary Down), Morag's assistant, and he becomes her dance partner. She develops feelings for him but Nigel does not reciprocate; however, in order to let her down gently, he tells her he is going to reunite with his fianc\u00e9. A spiteful Morag tells her the truth and Nigel sends her a letter of apology. Celia receives attention from [[Ian McTavish]] (Noel Trevarthen), a Scottish explorer searching for the legendary Summer Bay [[bunyip]], but quickly ends their date when she suspect he is merely after local information. She buys [[Lance Smart]] ([[Peter Vroom]]) and [[Martin Dibble]]'s (Craig Thomson) hot dog business and asks them to work for her. While showing potential buyers around Morag's house, Celia becomes convinced the place is haunted. Alf's niece [[Emma Jackson (Home and Away)|Emma Jackson]] ([[Dannii Minogue]]) and her friends decide to have some fun with the idea, convincing [[List of Home and Away characters (1988)|Reverend Flowers]] (Philip Ross) that Celia has a drinking problem when she asks him to perform an exorcism. She ends up doing the job herself with some holy water just as two bemused potential buyers turn up. Andrew, Alf, and Celia get their revenge by interrupting a party the youngsters are holding at the house with a staged haunting.\n\nCelia's judgmental streak is present when she is the only person to believe that teacher [[Grant Mitchell (Home and Away)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Craig McLachlan]]) has sexually molested his student, [[Vicki Baxter]] (Nana Coburn). Vicki's lies are exposed and Grant is cleared, forcing Celia to apologise to him. She then becomes involved in organizing African Awareness Week in the bay, persuading Alf, Ailsa, and Donald to assist her. Her efforts produce awkward results.  She is embarrassed when some cardboard cut-outs of African women she ordered are topless and covers them with strategically placed towels. Problems escalate when Celia orders some documentary videos about Africa, which turn out to be porn video that she unwittingly rents out. [[List of Home and Away characters (1990)#Reverend Christopher Goodhope|Reverend Christopher Goodhope]] (Ron Becks) arrives in the Bay and Celia decides to become a missionary and joins him in Africa. Ten years later, Celia is taken hostage in [[Nigeria]] by rebels. Alf goes over in person to negotiate her release before taking her back with him. She quickly discovers Duncan (now played by Brendan McKensy) and his new friend [[Nick Smith (Home and Away)|Nick Smith]] (Chris Egan) getting into trouble and takes them to task. This results in someone (later revealed as Nick's mother Eve (Robyn Gibbes), who has recently been released from a mental institute) throwing stones at her but she is pleased when Duncan sticks up for her against Nick. She returns to Africa. Celia returns to the Bay briefly two years later for the town's 150th anniversary celebrations and again briefly in 2005 for Alf's 60th birthday. Seven years later, Celia returns for Roo's wedding. Celia tells Alf she has no home to return to because a man has conned her. She takes a job at the Diner but she annoys the owner [[Irene Roberts (Home and Away)|Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]). Harvey challenges Celia to a game of poker and he notices that she is an experienced player. Celia steals money from the caravan park and the Diner, but soon replaces it. Alf accuses Celia, who confesses to having a gambling addiction. She decides to attend a help group but Alf soon discovers she lied. Marilyn helps Celia and Alf reconcile and she contacts Celia's ex-boyfriend [[List of Home and Away characters (2013)#Sheldon Atkinson|Sheldon Atkinson]] (Laurence Coy). He arrives and Celia gives him another chance but, when he wants to gamble again, she breaks up with him. Celia reveals that she needs to help others to occupy her time and prevent gambling. She lectures [[Heath Braxton]] ([[Dan Ewing]]) and [[Bianca Scott]] ([[Lisa Gormley]]) on public displays of affection. She changes her mind about Heath and advises him to ask Bianca to marry him. This causes trouble between them but Celia gives her old engagement ring to Heath to win Bianca back. Celia decides that she is better off helping others away from Summer Bay and leaves.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Desmond|first=Kesta|title=Home and Away Annual|year=1990|publisher=Grandreams Ltd|isbn=0-86227-787-6|ref=refdesmond|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/homeawayannual0000desm}}\n* {{cite book|last=J Clayden|first=Melanie|title=Home and Away Annual|year=1989|publisher=Grandreams Ltd|isbn=0-86227-687-X|ref=refjclayden}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hopwood|first=Clive|title=Home and Away Special|year=1990|publisher=World International Publishing LTD|isbn=0-7235-6899-5|ref=refhopwood}}\n* {{cite book|last=Oram|first=James|title=Home and away: behind the scenes|year=1989|publisher=Angus & Robertson|isbn=0-207-16315-4|ref=reforam|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/homeawaybehindsc00oram}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|title=The Who's Who of Soap Operas|year=1991|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing|Guinness Publishing Ltd]]|isbn=0-85112-966-8|ref=refhayward}}\n* {{cite book|title=Super Aussie Soaps|author=Mercado, Andrew|year=2004|publisher=Pluto Press Australia|isbn=978-1-86403-191-1|ref=refmercado}}\n* {{cite journal|title=.|journal=Home and Away Official Collector's Edition|date=5 November 2012|editor1-first=Black|editor1-last=Andrea|publisher=[[Pacific Magazines]]|ref=refblack2}}\n{{Refend}}\n{{Home and Away characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stewart, Celia}}\n[[Category:Home and Away characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional shopkeepers]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series         = Home and Away\n| name           = Celia Stewart\n| image          = Celia Stewart.jpg\n| imagesize      = 200px\n| portrayer      = [[Fiona Spence]]<br>Gilda Ferguson (flashback)<br>Tatham Lennox (flashback)<br>Annie Buckley (flashback)\n| introducer     = Alan Bateman (1988)<br />John Holmes (2000)<br />Julie McGauran (2002, 2005)<br />Lucy Addario (2012)\n| first          = 26 January 1988\n| last           = 5 March 2013\n| years          = 1988\u20131990, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2012\u20132013\n| classification = [[List of Home and Away characters#S|Former, regular]]\n| occupation     = Shopkeeper<br />[[Missionary]]\n| home           = [[Nigeria]]\n| father         = [[Gordon Stewart (Home and Away)|Gordon Stewart]]\n| mother         = Sarah-Jane Stewart\n| brothers       = [[Alf Stewart]]\n| sisters        = [[Morag Bellingham]]<br />[[Barbara Stewart (Home and Away)|Barbara Stewart]]<br />[[Debra Stewart]]\n| halfsisters    = [[Colleen Smart]]\n| nephews        = Owen Dalby<br />[[Duncan Stewart (Home and Away)|Duncan Stewart]]<br />[[Alan Fisher (Home and Away)|Alan Fisher]]<br />[[Lance Smart]]\n| nieces         =  [[Quinn Jackson]]<br />[[Roo Stewart]]<br />Maureen Evans<br />[[Rebecca Nash]]<br />[[Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)|Bobby Marshall]] \n| grandfathers   = Angus Stewart\n| relatives      = [[Martha MacKenzie]] (great-niece)<br />[[Sam Marshall]] (great nephew through adoption)<br />[[Seb Miller]] (great-\nnephew) <br />[[Ric Dalby]] (great-nephew) <br />[[Bryce Stewart]] (great-nephew)\n}}\n'''Celia Stewart''' is a fictional original character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'' played by [[Fiona Spence]].

In her youth, she was engaged to [[Les Palmer (Home and Away)|Les Palmer]] (Graham Lancaster) but he was killed in the [[Vietnam War]] and Celia never married. She is first seen talking to Alf about his relationship with [[Ailsa Stewart|Ailsa Hogan]] ([[Judy Nunn]]). Celia is judgmental and something of a gossip but ultimately well-meaning. She supports former brother-in-law Donald's attempts to have mentally disabled resident [[Nico Pappas (Home and Away)|Nico Pappas]] ([[Nicholas Papademetriou]]) sectioned but changes her mind quickly once [[Tom Fletcher (Home and Away)|Tom Fletcher]] ([[Roger Oakley]]) speaks to her. Celia unwittingly spreads the news that [[Carly Morris]] ([[Sharyn Hodgson]]) has been raped. Seeing the hurt she has caused, Celia tries to apologise to Carly and Tom but neither is willing to listen. Ailsa gives her a packet of chewing gum and advises her to use it whenever she feels like gossiping. Alf and Ailsa try to set her up by inviting her and local police sergeant [[Bob Barnett]] (Robert Baxter) to dinner. Celia spends the night getting drunk and Barnett has to escort her home. Celia invites him to watch her play tennis but assures him she only wanted to be friends with him. A bemused Barnett tells her that he has only ever seen her that way.\n\nCelia's niece, [[Roo Stewart|Roo]] ([[Justine Clarke]]), falls pregnant and, believing [[Frank Morgan (Home and Away)|Frank Morgan]] ([[Alex Papps]]) is the father, Celia tries to arrange for the pair to get married. Morag, Celia's sister, persuades Roo to admit Frank is not the father and Celia gives Roo a place to stay. Celia purchases the local store from Ailsa when she sells it.  Her first act is to try to evict Frank and his friend, [[Narelle Smart]] (Amanda Newman-Phillips), from the flat above the store.  Local doctor [[Philip Matheson]] (John Morris), a friend of the youngsters and fellow tenant, persuades Celia to give them a few months to move out. When Narelle is supportive towards Celia when her great-niece [[Martha Mackenzie|Martha]] (Burcin Kapkin) is kidnapped by her father, [[Brett Macklin]] (Gerry Sont), Celia decides not to evict her. Celia is shocked when she learns Frank's new wife [[Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)|Bobby Simpson]] ([[Nicolle Dickson]]) is Morag's daughter from an affair with Donald and, thus, her niece. Celia unwittingly reveals the truth when reporter [[James Donahue (Home and Away)|James Donahue]] ([[Richard Morgan (actor)|Richard Morgan]]) begins asking questions. Morag moves in with Celia at their parents' old house and she is annoyed but relieved when Morag moves out to the Blaxland mansion.\n\nThe store is destroyed in an arson attack by [[Dodge (Home and Away)|Brian 'Dodge' Forbes]] (Kelly Dingwall), which results in Philip's death. Celia makes arrangements with former school counsellor [[Andrew Foley (Home and Away)|Andrew Foley]] ([[Peter Bensley]]) to set up a youth advice centre in the back room of the Diner, but is disgusted when she learns Andrew is an alcoholic and he leaves town. She persuades Ailsa to let her try running it on her own but Carly, who recently had a drinking problem, pretends to be drunk to show Celia she would not know how to deal with someone with a genuine problem. Andrew returns sober and asks Celia to help by counseling [[Marilyn Chambers (Home and Away)|Marilyn Chambers]] ([[Emily Symons]]) but she panics when Marilyn takes some sleeping tablets and thinks she has attempted suicide. Celia causes more turmoil when her nephew [[Duncan Stewart (Home and Away)|Duncan]] (Allana Ellis) suffers an allergic reaction to an old family christening gown she provides.\n\nCelia befriends [[Nigel Taggart]] (Gary Down), Morag's assistant, and he becomes her dance partner. She develops feelings for him but Nigel does not reciprocate; however, in order to let her down gently, he tells her he is going to reunite with his fianc\u00e9. A spiteful Morag tells her the truth and Nigel sends her a letter of apology. Celia receives attention from [[Ian McTavish]] (Noel Trevarthen), a Scottish explorer searching for the legendary Summer Bay [[bunyip]], but quickly ends their date when she suspect he is merely after local information. She buys [[Lance Smart]] ([[Peter Vroom]]) and [[Martin Dibble]]'s (Craig Thomson) hot dog business and asks them to work for her. While showing potential buyers around Morag's house, Celia becomes convinced the place is haunted. Alf's niece [[Emma Jackson (Home and Away)|Emma Jackson]] ([[Dannii Minogue]]) and her friends decide to have some fun with the idea, convincing [[List of Home and Away characters (1988)|Reverend Flowers]] (Philip Ross) that Celia has a drinking problem when she asks him to perform an exorcism. She ends up doing the job herself with some holy water just as two bemused potential buyers turn up. Andrew, Alf, and Celia get their revenge by interrupting a party the youngsters are holding at the house with a staged haunting.\n\nCelia's judgmental streak is present when she is the only person to believe that teacher [[Grant Mitchell (Home and Away)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Craig McLachlan]]) has sexually molested his student, [[Vicki Baxter]] (Nana Coburn). Vicki's lies are exposed and Grant is cleared, forcing Celia to apologise to him. She then becomes involved in organizing African Awareness Week in the bay, persuading Alf, Ailsa, and Donald to assist her. Her efforts produce awkward results.  She is embarrassed when some cardboard cut-outs of African women she ordered are topless and covers them with strategically placed towels. Problems escalate when Celia orders some documentary videos about Africa, which turn out to be porn video that she unwittingly rents out. [[List of Home and Away characters (1990)#Reverend Christopher Goodhope|Reverend Christopher Goodhope]] (Ron Becks) arrives in the Bay and Celia decides to become a missionary and joins him in Africa. Ten years later, Celia is taken hostage in [[Nigeria]] by rebels. Alf goes over in person to negotiate her release before taking her back with him. She quickly discovers Duncan (now played by Brendan McKensy) and his new friend [[Nick Smith (Home and Away)|Nick Smith]] (Chris Egan) getting into trouble and takes them to task. This results in someone (later revealed as Nick's mother Eve ([[Robyn Gibbes]]), who has recently been released from a mental institute) throwing stones at her but she is pleased when Duncan sticks up for her against Nick. She returns to Africa. Celia returns to the Bay briefly two years later for the town's 150th anniversary celebrations and again briefly in 2005 for Alf's 60th birthday. Seven years later, Celia returns for Roo's wedding. Celia tells Alf she has no home to return to because a man has conned her. She takes a job at the Diner but she annoys the owner [[Irene Roberts (Home and Away)|Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]). Harvey challenges Celia to a game of poker and he notices that she is an experienced player. Celia steals money from the caravan park and the Diner, but soon replaces it. Alf accuses Celia, who confesses to having a gambling addiction. She decides to attend a help group but Alf soon discovers she lied. Marilyn helps Celia and Alf reconcile and she contacts Celia's ex-boyfriend [[List of Home and Away characters (2013)#Sheldon Atkinson|Sheldon Atkinson]] (Laurence Coy). He arrives and Celia gives him another chance but, when he wants to gamble again, she breaks up with him. Celia reveals that she needs to help others to occupy her time and prevent gambling. She lectures [[Heath Braxton]] ([[Dan Ewing]]) and [[Bianca Scott]] ([[Lisa Gormley]]) on public displays of affection. She changes her mind about Heath and advises him to ask Bianca to marry him. This causes trouble between them but Celia gives her old engagement ring to Heath to win Bianca back. Celia decides that she is better off helping others away from Summer Bay and leaves.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Desmond|first=Kesta|title=Home and Away Annual|year=1990|publisher=Grandreams Ltd|isbn=0-86227-787-6|ref=refdesmond|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/homeawayannual0000desm}}\n* {{cite book|last=J Clayden|first=Melanie|title=Home and Away Annual|year=1989|publisher=Grandreams Ltd|isbn=0-86227-687-X|ref=refjclayden}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hopwood|first=Clive|title=Home and Away Special|year=1990|publisher=World International Publishing LTD|isbn=0-7235-6899-5|ref=refhopwood}}\n* {{cite book|last=Oram|first=James|title=Home and away: behind the scenes|year=1989|publisher=Angus & Robertson|isbn=0-207-16315-4|ref=reforam|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/homeawaybehindsc00oram}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|title=The Who's Who of Soap Operas|year=1991|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing|Guinness Publishing Ltd]]|isbn=0-85112-966-8|ref=refhayward}}\n* {{cite book|title=Super Aussie Soaps|author=Mercado, Andrew|year=2004|publisher=Pluto Press Australia|isbn=978-1-86403-191-1|ref=refmercado}}\n* {{cite journal|title=.|journal=Home and Away Official Collector's Edition|date=5 November 2012|editor1-first=Black|editor1-last=Andrea|publisher=[[Pacific Magazines]]|ref=refblack2}}\n{{Refend}}\n{{Home and Away characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stewart, Celia}}\n[[Category:Home and Away characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional shopkeepers]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Bradv", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing link(s):Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robyn Gibbesclosed as delete (XFDcloser)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celia_Stewart"}

Like Hayley, he was taken into care and showed little interest in Will's plan for them all to settle in [[Summer Bay]], choosing to stay with foster parents even after Hayley had gone to join Will.\n\nNick is first seen when he is fleeing from Johnno, a drug dealer and the leader of a biker gang, whom he owes a large sum of money to.\nNick runs to get help from his siblings and is beaten up by Johnno, who considers the debt paid. Nick's foster parents are initially reluctant to take him back following the revelation but after Will and Hayley coax them, Nick returns home. Nick's father [[Ken Smith (Home and Away)|Ken]] (Anthony Phelan) returns after fighting an [[alcoholism|alcohol problem]], he petitions for Nick to return home to reunite the family. Nick is not very keen on the idea he meets [[Irene Roberts (Home and Away)|Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]), Will and Hayley's foster mother and Ken's new partner. He feels that Ken is trying to replace his mother [[Eve Smith|Eve]] (Robyn Gibbes) and Nick is upset further when he learns Ken are Irene are to be engaged after Ken proposes.\n\nNick soon befriends [[Duncan Stewart (Home and Away)|Duncan Stewart]] (Brendan McKensy) and they begin causing havoc together. When Nick is accused of throwing stones at Duncan's aunt, [[Celia Stewart|Celia]] ([[Fiona Spence]]), they get into a fight but later reconcile their friendship and focus their attentions on the newly arrived Sutherland twins [[Jade Sutherland|Jade]] ([[Kate Garven]]) and [[Kirsty Sutherland|Kirsty]] ([[Christie Hayes]]), who are in their year at school. Duncan dates Jade while Nick dates Kirsty.\n\nAfter Nick saves Irene from being attacked by Eve, who has since left a mental hospital, he gives her and Ken his blessing. Ken is later killed when a car he is working on crushes him, leaving Nick and the family devastated. Nick feels isolated and things are not helped when Irene becomes distant and Will takes an authoritarian role. He becomes worried that Irene will not want him, Will and Hayley now Ken has died but she reassures him otherwise.\n\nWhen Nick runs away one night and he hides out at Ken's garage, which is about to be sold and destroyed, he is visited his father in  a dream who tells him that the garage would probably have had to close due to its location and if he returned home, everything would work out. Nick wakes up and returns home to reconcile. Nick's friendship with Duncan comes to an end when Duncan's bad behaviour spirals out of control. Nick soon becomes closer to Jade and she feels the same but rejects him when he offers to break up with Kirsty to be with her as she feels it will damage her own relationship with he sister. Kirsty, however, ends things first as she has feelings for [[Seb Miller]] ([[Mitch Firth]]). Nick briefly dates Simone Harris but it fizzles out when Simone insults Jade. After Nick returns from a visit to [[London]], he and Jade finally get together.\n\nWhen Will asks Nick to be his best man at his wedding to [[Gypsy Nash]] ([[Kimberley Cooper]]), he is pleased but panics when he realises he has lost the ring. In order to fund a replacement, he sells his games console and is annoyed when it emerges Will has taken the ring to have engraved. Will suggests that Nick gives the replacement ring to Jade. Shortly after Will and Gypsy leave, Nick clashes with Irene's son [[Nathan Roberts (Home and Away)|Nathan Roberts]] (Craig Ball) who has recently been released from prison. During a Year 10 class trip, The bus crashes and Nick is left with his legs trapped. Nathan assists the search party in rescuing the passengers and is able to save them before the bus explodes into flames.\n\nFollowing the death of local doctor, [[Charlotte Adams (Home and Away)|Charlotte Adams]] ([[Stephanie Chaves-Jacobsen]]), Nick finds Jade's phase of Living for the moment hard to take and is somewhat reluctant when she seems to want to elevate their relationship to a more physical level. Nick then gently informs her he is not ready for that step.\n\n[[Angie Russell]] ([[Laurie Foell]]), the new deputy pricinipal at Summer Bay High begins playing mind games after Nick is found arguing with her son, [[Dylan Russell|Dylan]]. She begins flirting with Nick, causing him to obsess over her. Nick's behaviour becomes erratic when he tries to get Jade to take suggestive photos of herself. Social services are called and Irene is initially accused of abusing Nick. When Nick stands up to Angie one day in class, she begins tearing at her clothes and screaming, claiming that Nick has sexually assaulted her. Nick is then charged and vilified in town. Nick flees and hides out on a hippy farm where Jade finds him high on \"[[Psilocybin mushrooms|magic mushrooms]]\", and she is only just able to get him to attend court. In spite of Dylan's testimony, Nick is found guilty and expelled from Summer Bay High. Nick then begins community service at a retirement home and is forced to attend Yabbie Creek High. Jade, Kirsty and Seb work together on a video which exposes Angie's behaviour and she is fired by Principal [[Paris Burnett]] (Rhett Giles) and Nick is reinstated. Several weeks later, Angie is killed and many people, including Nick and the Sutherlands are in the frame for murder. It is later revealed Dylan killed Angie.\n\nNick auditions for \"The Dorm\", a [[reality television]] show and is successful. Nick quickly discovers that one of the other contestants, [[List of Home and Away characters (2003)#Courtney|Courtney]] (Emily Sexton), is a plant aiming to cause trouble. Courtney climbs into bed to silence Nick but the sequence is edited to make it look like they have slept together. Jade sees the footage and begins making multiple phone calls in order to vote Nick out of the show and he returns home in disgrace. Nick tells his side of the story in a newspaper interview but has a hard time convincing people that he was the innocent party. After learning of Irene's relationship with Paris, Nick steals a car and tries to leave town. [[Jesse McGregor]] ([[Ben Unwin]]) catches him but is arrested for the crime himself.

Like Hayley, he was taken into care and showed little interest in Will's plan for them all to settle in [[Summer Bay]], choosing to stay with foster parents even after Hayley had gone to join Will.\n\nNick is first seen when he is fleeing from Johnno, a drug dealer and the leader of a biker gang, whom he owes a large sum of money to.\nNick runs to get help from his siblings and is beaten up by Johnno, who considers the debt paid. Nick's foster parents are initially reluctant to take him back following the revelation but after Will and Hayley coax them, Nick returns home. Nick's father [[Ken Smith (Home and Away)|Ken]] (Anthony Phelan) returns after fighting an [[alcoholism|alcohol problem]], he petitions for Nick to return home to reunite the family. Nick is not very keen on the idea he meets [[Irene Roberts (Home and Away)|Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]), Will and Hayley's foster mother and Ken's new partner. He feels that Ken is trying to replace his mother [[Eve Smith|Eve]] ([[Robyn Gibbes]]) and Nick is upset further when he learns Ken are Irene are to be engaged after Ken proposes.\n\nNick soon befriends [[Duncan Stewart (Home and Away)|Duncan Stewart]] (Brendan McKensy) and they begin causing havoc together. When Nick is accused of throwing stones at Duncan's aunt, [[Celia Stewart|Celia]] ([[Fiona Spence]]), they get into a fight but later reconcile their friendship and focus their attentions on the newly arrived Sutherland twins [[Jade Sutherland|Jade]] ([[Kate Garven]]) and [[Kirsty Sutherland|Kirsty]] ([[Christie Hayes]]), who are in their year at school. Duncan dates Jade while Nick dates Kirsty.\n\nAfter Nick saves Irene from being attacked by Eve, who has since left a mental hospital, he gives her and Ken his blessing. Ken is later killed when a car he is working on crushes him, leaving Nick and the family devastated. Nick feels isolated and things are not helped when Irene becomes distant and Will takes an authoritarian role. He becomes worried that Irene will not want him, Will and Hayley now Ken has died but she reassures him otherwise.\n\nWhen Nick runs away one night and he hides out at Ken's garage, which is about to be sold and destroyed, he is visited his father in  a dream who tells him that the garage would probably have had to close due to its location and if he returned home, everything would work out. Nick wakes up and returns home to reconcile. Nick's friendship with Duncan comes to an end when Duncan's bad behaviour spirals out of control. Nick soon becomes closer to Jade and she feels the same but rejects him when he offers to break up with Kirsty to be with her as she feels it will damage her own relationship with he sister. Kirsty, however, ends things first as she has feelings for [[Seb Miller]] ([[Mitch Firth]]). Nick briefly dates Simone Harris but it fizzles out when Simone insults Jade. After Nick returns from a visit to [[London]], he and Jade finally get together.\n\nWhen Will asks Nick to be his best man at his wedding to [[Gypsy Nash]] ([[Kimberley Cooper]]), he is pleased but panics when he realises he has lost the ring. In order to fund a replacement, he sells his games console and is annoyed when it emerges Will has taken the ring to have engraved. Will suggests that Nick gives the replacement ring to Jade. Shortly after Will and Gypsy leave, Nick clashes with Irene's son [[Nathan Roberts (Home and Away)|Nathan Roberts]] (Craig Ball) who has recently been released from prison. During a Year 10 class trip, The bus crashes and Nick is left with his legs trapped. Nathan assists the search party in rescuing the passengers and is able to save them before the bus explodes into flames.\n\nFollowing the death of local doctor, [[Charlotte Adams (Home and Away)|Charlotte Adams]] ([[Stephanie Chaves-Jacobsen]]), Nick finds Jade's phase of Living for the moment hard to take and is somewhat reluctant when she seems to want to elevate their relationship to a more physical level. Nick then gently informs her he is not ready for that step.\n\n[[Angie Russell]] ([[Laurie Foell]]), the new deputy pricinipal at Summer Bay High begins playing mind games after Nick is found arguing with her son, [[Dylan Russell|Dylan]]. She begins flirting with Nick, causing him to obsess over her. Nick's behaviour becomes erratic when he tries to get Jade to take suggestive photos of herself. Social services are called and Irene is initially accused of abusing Nick. When Nick stands up to Angie one day in class, she begins tearing at her clothes and screaming, claiming that Nick has sexually assaulted her. Nick is then charged and vilified in town. Nick flees and hides out on a hippy farm where Jade finds him high on \"[[Psilocybin mushrooms|magic mushrooms]]\", and she is only just able to get him to attend court. In spite of Dylan's testimony, Nick is found guilty and expelled from Summer Bay High. Nick then begins community service at a retirement home and is forced to attend Yabbie Creek High. Jade, Kirsty and Seb work together on a video which exposes Angie's behaviour and she is fired by Principal [[Paris Burnett]] (Rhett Giles) and Nick is reinstated. Several weeks later, Angie is killed and many people, including Nick and the Sutherlands are in the frame for murder. It is later revealed Dylan killed Angie.\n\nNick auditions for \"The Dorm\", a [[reality television]] show and is successful. Nick quickly discovers that one of the other contestants, [[List of Home and Away characters (2003)#Courtney|Courtney]] (Emily Sexton), is a plant aiming to cause trouble. Courtney climbs into bed to silence Nick but the sequence is edited to make it look like they have slept together. Jade sees the footage and begins making multiple phone calls in order to vote Nick out of the show and he returns home in disgrace. Nick tells his side of the story in a newspaper interview but has a hard time convincing people that he was the innocent party. After learning of Irene's relationship with Paris, Nick steals a car and tries to leave town. [[Jesse McGregor]] ([[Ben Unwin]]) catches him but is arrested for the crime himself. He confesses once Jesse is facing a return to prison. A major American producer offers Nick a role in a film and he accepts.

At Wentworth, he enjoys the company of inmate Marilyn Mason and so finds reasons to prolong his work, with the pair stowing away for a number of romantic liaisons - notably up in the rec room roof during the riot of episodes 3-4 in which Meg Jackson's husband Bill is killed. When Marilyn is released, the pair move in together, but Marilyn is hard up for money and finding it hard to get work, so reluctantly turns back to prostitution (albeit to afford to buy Eddie a gift for his birthday), leaving Marilyn back inside and putting a severe strain on their relationship. With Marilyn released a second time, Bea Smith eventually sets them straight, arranging for them to run Monica Ferguson's milk bar, which we later hear of them buying permanently.\n* '''Judith-Anne Watkins''' (Kim Deacon - ''episodes 5-67''), Mum's granddaughter, and the only member of her family to take any interest in her. Visits her in Wentworth to reveal she is pregnant, and shortly afterwards moves into a flat with Mum after her release. When Bea seeks refuge with them when she is on the run, she uses all of Mum's savings to buy a disguise for Bea, just to get rid of her. Reintroduced when Mum's health deteriorates and she is due to give birth. Karen Travers is persuaded to move in and look after her while Mum is in hospital.

His main case is that of Karen Travers, and with her permitted day release to study at University, the pair start to become romantically involved, although it does not extend much beyond holding hands. However, with his position at the struggling law practice jeopardised (mostly due to all of the unpaying cases he is taking at Wentworth), when an old flame suddenly reappears and offers to go into business him, and believing Karen not to be interested in him, he leaves for the new venture, and is not heard from again in the series.\n* '''Jason Richards''' ([[David Bradshaw]] - ''episodes 27-29''), Pop star who is alleged to be the lover of Susan Rice's husband Frederick.

In her early episodes, she seems cast as the stereotyped bitter ambitious wife. She becomes a little more sympathetic after she shows her dislike for Jim's mate, Geoff Butler when Jim invites him to dinner. She is introduced again when she throws Jim out of the house after she is told about his relationship with Caroline Simpson. Eventually dies with her children in a bomb blast intended to kill Jim, unknowingly planted by Caroline's husband, Michael, orchestrated by Geoff.\n* '''Peter Clements''' ([[Carrillo Gantner]] - ''episodes 44-52''), a sleazy and manipulative psychology lecturer, who teaches at the University that Karen attends, and who is granted permission to conduct research into prison life at Wentworth, but who is covertly studying the officers rather more than the prisoners. His case study of Doreen causes her to have a breakdown, and he is also duped by Bea into giving information over mysterious new prisoner, Bella Albrecht. His findings over the running of the prison and its staff causes the Department embarrassment, but the storyline seems to fade away without much impact.\n* '''Angela Jeffries''' ([[Jeanie Drynan]] - ''episodes 59-114''), a lesbian lawyer involved with the Prison Reform Group and in the plan to set up a halfway house. She offers Karen accommodation and a job, so Karen moves in with her for a while. Angela has to warn Karen off from falling in love with her.

The scriptwriters stretch co-incidence to its limits by getting him to Wentworth in the next episode in a prison work party so that Pat can talk to him and tell him why she's divorcing his father. When Pat gets paroled just before Christmas, she visits him in Pentridge and sees him get punched by one of the guards. Shortly after this, David escapes and seeks shelter with his friend Shayne. When he goes to see his mother, the police are already on their way, and there is a shootout in which David kills a policeman.

Geoff also tries to get Jim interested in joining him in becoming part of a mercenary army overseas. When Jim and Geoff are out for a drink one evening, a homosexual man is found badly beaten in the toilets soon after. Following the previous incident, Leila is convinced Geoff is behind it, but Jim refuses to listen. By the time Leila finally convinces Jim to contact the Police about him, Geoff is in the middle of attacking Meg in her apartment after Leila's warnings turned her away from him. Jim arrives just in time to save Meg, and the Police take Geoff away. However, the character returns in 106 to face trial and escapes charge. Embittered at his friend Jim turning him in, Geoff joins forces with Caroline Simpson's estranged husband Michael, who is jaded at Jim seeing his ex-wife. The pair plot to get even with Jim; Michael does not want anyone seriously hurt, but Geoff tricks him into delivering a bomb to Jim's hotel room intended to kill him.

Although he initially comes across as a carefree individual who likes to flirt with female co-workers, it soon becomes apparent that Kevin is an honest and well-intentioned young man who cares deeply for Doreen. He becomes curious about her secret background (she is living at the Halfway House at the time), and after he finds out her true identity he sticks with her, willing to accept her for whatever she is. He soon proposes to her and they plan to marry, much to the disdain of his rather snobbish mother. However, a drunken incident sees Doreen, and Lizzie, breaking parole and sent back to Wentworth, but Kevin tells Doreen that he is willing to wait for her. When a tussle breaks out over Doreen's late mother's house, which crooked land developers want to buy up cheap, the pair decide to marry on Wentworth grounds. A while later, Doreen is included as part of the prison's work project with a local textile company, where worker Vince Talbot rapes Doreen. She soon discovers that she is pregnant as a result; Doreen considers not letting on and claiming the child to be Kevin's, but when, unaware of her condition, he says that he is not ready to start a family yet, Doreen plans an abortion, before breaking down and admitting that she was raped by Talbot. The Police do not have enough evidence to charge Talbot, and Doreen admits to Kevin that on a second occasion, she allowed Talbot, in hope of gaining the information needed for Kevin to win a lucrative work contract at the factory. This confession puts a strain on the pair's marriage and Kevin decides he wants a divorce.

At Wentworth, he enjoys the company of inmate Marilyn Mason and so finds reasons to prolong his work, with the pair stowing away for a number of romantic liaisons - notably up in the rec room roof during the riot of episodes 3-4 in which Meg Jackson's husband Bill is killed. When Marilyn is released, the pair move in together, but Marilyn is hard up for money and finding it hard to get work, so reluctantly turns back to prostitution (albeit to afford to buy Eddie a gift for his birthday), leaving Marilyn back inside and putting a severe strain on their relationship. With Marilyn released a second time, Bea Smith eventually sets them straight, arranging for them to run Monica Ferguson's milk bar, which we later hear of them buying permanently.\n* '''Judith-Anne Watkins''' (Kim Deacon - ''episodes 5-67''), Mum's granddaughter, and the only member of her family to take any interest in her.

His main case is that of Karen Travers, and with her permitted day release to study at University, the pair start to become romantically involved, although it does not extend much beyond holding hands. However, with his position at the struggling law practice jeopardised (mostly due to all of the unpaying cases he is taking at Wentworth), when an old flame suddenly reappears and offers to go into business him, and believing Karen not to be interested in him, he leaves for the new venture, and is not heard from again in the series.\n* '''Jason Richards''' ([[David Bradshaw]] - ''episodes 27-29''), Pop star who is alleged to be the lover of Susan Rice's husband Frederick.

In her early episodes, she seems cast as the stereotyped bitter ambitious wife. She becomes a little more sympathetic after she shows her dislike for Jim's mate, Geoff Butler when Jim invites him to dinner. She is introduced again when she throws Jim out of the house after she is told about his relationship with Caroline Simpson. Eventually dies with her children in a bomb blast intended to kill Jim, unknowingly planted by Caroline's husband, Michael, orchestrated by Geoff.\n* '''Peter Clements''' ([[Carrillo Gantner]] - ''episodes 44-52''), a sleazy and manipulative psychology lecturer, who teaches at the University that Karen attends, and who is granted permission to conduct research into prison life at Wentworth, but who is covertly studying the officers rather more than the prisoners. His case study of Doreen causes her to have a breakdown, and he is also duped by Bea into giving information over mysterious new prisoner, Bella Albrecht. His findings over the running of the prison and its staff causes the Department embarrassment, but the storyline seems to fade away without much impact.\n* '''Angela Jeffries''' ([[Jeanie Drynan]] - ''episodes 59-114''), a lesbian lawyer involved with the Prison Reform Group and in the plan to set up a halfway house. She offers Karen accommodation and a job, so Karen moves in with her for a while. Angela has to warn Karen off from falling in love with her.

The scriptwriters stretch co-incidence to its limits by getting him to Wentworth in the next episode in a prison work party so that Pat can talk to him and tell him why she's divorcing his father. When Pat gets paroled just before Christmas, she visits him in Pentridge and sees him get punched by one of the guards. Shortly after this, David escapes and seeks shelter with his friend Shayne. When he goes to see his mother, the police are already on their way, and there is a shootout in which David kills a policeman. As a result his mother is sent back to Wentworth, and David becomes convinced that Greg Miller tipped off the police. With his friend Herbie, he plans to kill Greg, but shoots Karen instead. Herbie becomes worried about him and leads the police to their hideout, where David is recaptured and is not seen again.

Geoff also tries to get Jim interested in joining him in becoming part of a mercenary army overseas. When Jim and Geoff are out for a drink one evening, a homosexual man is found badly beaten in the toilets soon after. Following the previous incident, Leila is convinced Geoff is behind it, but Jim refuses to listen. By the time Leila finally convinces Jim to contact the Police about him, Geoff is in the middle of attacking Meg in her apartment after Leila's warnings turned her away from him. Jim arrives just in time to save Meg, and the Police take Geoff away. However, the character returns in 106 to face trial and escapes charge. Embittered at his friend Jim turning him in, Geoff joins forces with Caroline Simpson's estranged husband Michael, who is jaded at Jim seeing his ex-wife. The pair plot to get even with Jim; Michael does not want anyone seriously hurt, but Geoff tricks him into delivering a bomb to Jim's hotel room intended to kill him.

Although he initially comes across as a carefree individual who likes to flirt with female co-workers, it soon becomes apparent that Kevin is an honest and well-intentioned young man who cares deeply for Doreen. He becomes curious about her secret background (she is living at the Halfway House at the time), and after he finds out her true identity he sticks with her, willing to accept her for whatever she is. He soon proposes to her and they plan to marry, much to the disdain of his rather snobbish mother. However, a drunken incident sees Doreen, and Lizzie, breaking parole and sent back to Wentworth, but Kevin tells Doreen that he is willing to wait for her. When a tussle breaks out over Doreen's late mother's house, which crooked land developers want to buy up cheap, the pair decide to marry on Wentworth grounds. A while later, Doreen is included as part of the prison's work project with a local textile company, where worker Vince Talbot rapes Doreen. She soon discovers that she is pregnant as a result; Doreen considers not letting on and claiming the child to be Kevin's, but when, unaware of her condition, he says that he is not ready to start a family yet, Doreen plans an abortion, before breaking down and admitting that she was raped by Talbot. The Police do not have enough evidence to charge Talbot, and Doreen admits to Kevin that on a second occasion, she allowed Talbot, in hope of gaining the information needed for Kevin to win a lucrative work contract at the factory. This confession puts a strain on the pair's marriage and Kevin decides he wants a divorce.

As a result, Austin is banned from visiting her at Wentworth.

The first two series were based on [[fantastic|fantasy]] stories written by author [[Paul Jennings (Australian author)|Paul Jennings]]; the latter two were based on a variety of authors' work. The first series was filmed in 1989, and first aired in 1990. A second series, with many roles re-cast, was filmed in 1992 and first aired in 1993. A third series, again re-cast, was made in 2000, followed by a fourth (with some roles again re-cast) in 2001.\n\nThe show's theme song, with the lyrics \"Have you ever... ever felt like this?\" was sung by [[Tamsin West]], who played the lead female role of Linda Twist in the first series. It borrowed lines from [[nursery rhyme]]s such as \"[[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]\", \"[[Humpty Dumpty]]\" and \"[[Rain Rain Go Away]]\". The song was used in a series of Halloween television adverts by [[United Kingdom]] supermarket chain [[Sainsbury's]] in 2018.<ref>{{Citation|title=Halloween Pumpkin Song {{!}} Sainsbury's Ad {{!}} Autumn 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IAg5jyHG0|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\nMaking a show about children which spanned more than a decade meant many changes in actors were required, as the child actors became too old for their parts. Overall, three sets of children (the Twists, the Gribbles and Fiona) were cast. Additionally, most of the major adult roles were recast at least once: overall, there were two Tonys, two Nells, three Fays, two Mr Snappers, two Harold Gribbles, and three Matron Gribbles across the series' run.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Character\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Series 1 (1990)\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Series 2 (1993)\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Series 3 (2000)\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Series 4 (2001)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Tony \"Dad\" Twist || colspan=\"2\" | [[Richard Moir]] || colspan=\"2\" | [[Andrew S.

With Linda, he  enjoys ganging up on his younger brother Bronson.\n* Linda Twist \u2014 Pete's twin sister, into [[feminism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[judo]]. She enjoys picking on her younger brother, and the audience is exposed to the inner workings of the teenage mind as she struggles with her own individuality.\n* Bronson Twist \u2014 the twins' younger brother, who is obsessed with food and odours as well as having a tendency to use [[malapropisms]], such as rendering ''widower'' as ''windower''. He often feels left out of what his older siblings are doing, so tags along despite the possibility of danger or ridicule. On a handful of occasions, he is treated as much older than his tender years, including in Series 1, where he is expected to take full responsibility for a green baby he located in the cabbage patch.\n\n=== Other characters ===\n* Helen \"Nell\" Rickards \u2014 the old woman who lives in a cottage next door, whose brother, Tom, had been the former lighthouse keeper. Her father (also a lighthouse keeper), her mother and her sister all died when the ship they were on sunk, their spirits, as well as Tom's, haunted the lighthouse.\n* Harold Gribble \u2014 a greedy real-estate agent and one-time senate candidate, who often tries to force the Twists to move out of the lighthouse with business schemes.\n* \"Matron\" Cecilia Gribble \u2014 Harold's supportive wife, a nurse. Cecilia wears a lot of make-up which she tries to force on Linda in Series 1, but she is revealed to the audience as equally scheming as her husband.\n* James Gribble \u2014 Harold's no-good son, a bully at school who often antagonizes Pete.\n* {{anchor|Rabbit}}\"Rabbit\" \u2014 one of James Gribble's friends.\n* \"Tiger\" Gleeson \u2014 the other of James Gribble's friends.\n* Ms Faye James \u2014 Bronson's schoolteacher; Faye James is a  love interest for Dad, and she lives with the Twists in their lighthouse during the third and fourth series.\n* Mr Ralph Snapper \u2014 Pete and Linda's teacher; with the children he is a harsh disciplinarian who does not respond well to insolence, but with adults he is very socially awkward.\n* Fiona Richmond \u2014 Linda's friend, and Pete's sometime girlfriend.\n* Hugh Townsend \u2014 Linda's love crush in the first series only.\n* Anthony \u2014 in the third and fourth series only, a well-meaning nerd with a crush on Linda.\n* Phadre, Sacha and Emily \u2014 Three girls Pete tries to win over, in the fourth series only.\nCharacters who appear briefly in each episode of a series include:\n*Ghost Matthew and Ghost Jeremiah \u2014 two [[ghost]]s whose spirits were trapped in the lighthouse during Series 2 after they failed to guide a boat to shore one hundred years earlier.\n* Ariel \u2014 a girl from the \"Isle of Dreams\" who comes seeking to take Pete away in the fourth series.\n* Mr Nic Papadelioises - a local small deli owner who gave Bronson his first job.\n\n== Storylines ==\n{{see also|List of Round the Twist episodes}}\nFour series of ''Round the Twist'' have been made, each comprising thirteen episodes. Although each episode has a self-contained plot each series has a recurring theme, usually an object or character which appears briefly in every episode. This gradually develops the theme until the final episode of each series in which it is explained and resolved.\n\nThe Twist family also have frequent conflicts with a ruthless local businessman, Harold Gribble, and his family. Typically, Gribble seeks to remove the Twists from the lighthouse in order to more profitably use it as a tourist attraction for Port Niranda. This is a continuous feature of the first series, and a recurring feature of the third and fourth series.\n\n=== Series 1 (1990) ===\nThe lighthouse is haunted by eerie music coming from upstairs. In the final episode, \"Lighthouse Blues\", the music is revealed to be played by the ghosts of Nell's deceased family. The ghosts help the Twists to stop one of Mr. Gribble's business associates from destroying the lighthouse.\n\nIn a subplot, Tony falls in love with Fay, and spends the series developing a relationship with her, culminating in a marriage proposal at the finale. The answer to the proposal is left open-ended.\n\n=== Series 2 (1993) ===\nThe lighthouse is again haunted, this time by ghosts visible to the viewers, but not to the characters until the final episode. The two ghosts are Matthew and Jeremiah, who fade into view once in each episode. They are being punished because as lighthouse keepers 100 years previously they failed to stop a ship bearing Matthew's love, Jane, from being wrecked on the rocks. In the final episode, \"Seeing the Light\", the ghost ship comes again, and this time, all of the characters from the show help to turn on the lighthouse light and save the family who were lost at sea, redeeming the ghosts.\n\nAnother recurring theme in the second series is Bronson's foul-smelling feet. In episode 7, \"Smelly Feat\", he reveals that he has been 'saving the stink' to stop the Gribbles from killing an endangered turtle. In the end, he helps save the turtle.\n\nTony and Fay become officially engaged, but Fay becomes increasingly concerned that Bronson does not want her to marry Tony, eventually leading to the engagement being broken off. They are re-engaged at the end of the series.\n\nFor the only time in the show's run, Mr Gribble's primary concern is not with removing the Twists from the lighthouse. Rather, he spends the series campaigning for a senate seat with the fictional Progressive Conservative Party. Disagreeing with his policies, Nell runs against him in a party similar to the [[Australian Greens]] and ultimately wins in a landslide.\n\n=== Series 3 (2000) ===\nIn the second episode Linda is given a book of poetry, The Viking Book of Love by a young Viking named Snorrison who finds the lighthouse. In most of the episodes, a character falls in love with someone who reads poetry from the book to them; each love spell lasts up until the next one is cast. In the final episode, \"The Big Rock\", the Vikings return and the book's effects are reversed, with terrible consequences.\n\n=== Series 4 (2001) ===\nIn each episode, a knight in armour enters the lighthouse through a magical door. At the beginning of the series the knight's face is hidden behind a visor, in the second half the visor is raised. In the final episode, Isle of Dreams, the stranger is revealed to be a girl, Ariel, who has come to offer the children a perfect life on the Isle of Dreams, if Pete will become her husband. In the end, they decline, and Ariel disappears forever, along with the enchanted isle.\n\nA subplot in this series is Fay's pregnancy to Tony. The baby, named Ariel, is born in the series finale.\n\nAnother subplot is Bronson collecting various smells throughout the series with his Smellsucker, a vacuum cleaner with a nose built into it for storing the smells. This leads Bronson to becoming a superhero of sorts called Skunkman. He appears randomly throughout the series, but his true identity is not revealed. His friend Lois, appearing only in the episode of the same name, is made out to be Skunkman to Gribble's gang, but in reality, it is Bronson's alter-ego.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:SplitPoint 0072.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Split Point Lighthouse]] was used for the exterior scenes of the Twist family's [[lighthouse]] home.]]\nThe first two series were written by [[Paul Jennings (Australian author)|Paul Jennings]], with heavy editing by director Esben Storm (who also played Mr. Snapper in the first three series). Each of these episodes, with the exception of the second series's final episode \"Seeing The Light\", were based on Jennings' short stories. A movie of ''Round the Twist'' was planned, but due to creative differences, it was never made. After the second series, Jennings left the show, taking the rights to his stories with him. Paul Jennings also made some cameo appearances, in particular as the ghost of Ben Byron in Series 1's \"Without My Pants\".\n\nA lot of season one's scripts/plots had to be changed either due to budget, or just not being funny enough. Nell was supposed to die in \"Lighthouse Blues\", but episode's director Esben Storm told Paul Jennings, \"it's too depressing after thirteen weeks. We can't finish the series by killing off a well-loved character.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pauljennings.com.au/blogs.asp?cid=34|title=Writing Round the Twist - Paul Jennings Official Website and Book Shop|website=www.pauljennings.com.au|access-date=2019-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106071343/http://www.pauljennings.com.au/blogs.asp?cid=34|archive-date=6 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe seventh episode of series one was supposed to be \"Frozen Stiff\", but that had to be changed as well since it was too expensive to freeze a house and thirty other animals inside large ice blocks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe third and fourth series were written by various writers and re-used the same characters, but did not draw from Jennings' material. The latter series did not match the popular acclaim of the originals, and because of this, the series was cancelled.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Incidentally, just two years before the third series was aired, Jennings' stories were being adapted into a different show called ''[[Driven Crazy]]'', which also failed to match the popularity of the early ''Round the Twist'' and of which only one series was produced.\n\nSeveral locations in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] were used for external shots in the filming of the series.

The first two series were based on [[fantastic|fantasy]] stories written by author [[Paul Jennings (Australian author)|Paul Jennings]]; the latter two were based on a variety of authors' work. The first series was filmed in 1989, and first aired in 1990. A second series, with many roles re-cast, was filmed in 1992 and first aired in 1993. A third series, again re-cast, was made in 2000, followed by a fourth (with some roles again re-cast) in 2001.\n\nThe show's theme song, with the lyrics \"Have you ever... ever felt like this?\" was sung by [[Tamsin West]], who played the lead female role of Linda Twist in the first series. It borrowed lines from [[nursery rhyme]]s such as \"[[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]\", \"[[Humpty Dumpty]]\" and \"[[Rain Rain Go Away]]\". The song was used in a series of Halloween television adverts by [[United Kingdom]] supermarket chain [[Sainsbury's]] in 2018.<ref>{{Citation|title=Halloween Pumpkin Song {{!}} Sainsbury's Ad {{!}} Autumn 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IAg5jyHG0|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\nMaking a show about children which spanned more than a decade meant many changes in actors were required, as the child actors became too old for their parts. Overall, three sets of children (the Twists, the Gribbles and Fiona) were cast. Additionally, most of the major adult roles were recast at least once: overall, there were two Tonys, two Nells, three Fays, two Mr Snappers, two Harold Gribbles, and three Matron Gribbles across the series' run.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Character\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Series 1 (1990)\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Series 2 (1993)\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Series 3 (2000)\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Series 4 (2001)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Tony \"Dad\" Twist || colspan=\"2\" | [[Richard Moir]] || colspan=\"2\" | [[Andrew S.

With Linda, he  enjoys ganging up on his younger brother Bronson.\n* Linda Twist \u2014 Pete's twin sister, into [[feminism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[judo]]. She enjoys picking on her younger brother, and the audience is exposed to the inner workings of the teenage mind as she struggles with her own individuality.\n* Bronson Twist \u2014 the twins' younger brother, who is obsessed with food and odours as well as having a tendency to use [[malapropisms]], such as rendering ''widower'' as ''windower''. He often feels left out of what his older siblings are doing, so tags along despite the possibility of danger or ridicule. On a handful of occasions, he is treated as much older than his tender years, including in Series 1, where he is expected to take full responsibility for a green baby he located in the cabbage patch.\n\n=== Other characters ===\n* Helen \"Nell\" Rickards \u2014 the old woman who lives in a cottage next door, whose brother, Tom, had been the former lighthouse keeper. Her father (also a lighthouse keeper), her mother and her sister all died when the ship they were on sunk, their spirits, as well as Tom's, haunted the lighthouse.\n* Harold Gribble \u2014 a greedy real-estate agent and one-time senate candidate, who often tries to force the Twists to move out of the lighthouse with business schemes.\n* \"Matron\" Cecilia Gribble \u2014 Harold's supportive wife, a nurse. Cecilia wears a lot of make-up which she tries to force on Linda in Series 1, but she is revealed to the audience as equally scheming as her husband.\n* James Gribble \u2014 Harold's no-good son, a bully at school who often antagonizes Pete.\n* {{anchor|Rabbit}}\"Rabbit\" \u2014 one of James Gribble's friends.\n* \"Tiger\" Gleeson \u2014 the other of James Gribble's friends.\n* Ms Faye James \u2014 Bronson's schoolteacher; Faye James is a  love interest for Dad, and she lives with the Twists in their lighthouse during the third and fourth series.\n* Mr Ralph Snapper \u2014 Pete and Linda's teacher; with the children he is a harsh disciplinarian who does not respond well to insolence, but with adults he is very socially awkward.\n* Fiona Richmond \u2014 Linda's friend, and Pete's sometime girlfriend.\n* Hugh Townsend \u2014 Linda's love crush in the first series only.\n* Anthony \u2014 in the third and fourth series only, a well-meaning nerd with a crush on Linda.\n* Phadre, Sacha and Emily \u2014 Three girls Pete tries to win over, in the fourth series only.\nCharacters who appear briefly in each episode of a series include:\n*Ghost Matthew and Ghost Jeremiah \u2014 two [[ghost]]s whose spirits were trapped in the lighthouse during Series 2 after they failed to guide a boat to shore one hundred years earlier.\n* Ariel \u2014 a girl from the \"Isle of Dreams\" who comes seeking to take Pete away in the fourth series.\n* Mr Nic Papadelioises - a local small deli owner who gave Bronson his first job.\n\n== Storylines ==\n{{see also|List of Round the Twist episodes}}\nFour series of ''Round the Twist'' have been made, each comprising thirteen episodes. Although each episode has a self-contained plot each series has a recurring theme, usually an object or character which appears briefly in every episode. This gradually develops the theme until the final episode of each series in which it is explained and resolved.\n\nThe Twist family also have frequent conflicts with a ruthless local businessman, Harold Gribble, and his family. Typically, Gribble seeks to remove the Twists from the lighthouse in order to more profitably use it as a tourist attraction for Port Niranda. This is a continuous feature of the first series, and a recurring feature of the third and fourth series.\n\n=== Series 1 (1990) ===\nThe lighthouse is haunted by eerie music coming from upstairs. In the final episode, \"Lighthouse Blues\", the music is revealed to be played by the ghosts of Nell's deceased family. The ghosts help the Twists to stop one of Mr. Gribble's business associates from destroying the lighthouse.\n\nIn a subplot, Tony falls in love with Fay, and spends the series developing a relationship with her, culminating in a marriage proposal at the finale. The answer to the proposal is left open-ended.\n\n=== Series 2 (1993) ===\nThe lighthouse is again haunted, this time by ghosts visible to the viewers, but not to the characters until the final episode. The two ghosts are Matthew and Jeremiah, who fade into view once in each episode. They are being punished because as lighthouse keepers 100 years previously they failed to stop a ship bearing Matthew's love, Jane, from being wrecked on the rocks. In the final episode, \"Seeing the Light\", the ghost ship comes again, and this time, all of the characters from the show help to turn on the lighthouse light and save the family who were lost at sea, redeeming the ghosts.\n\nAnother recurring theme in the second series is Bronson's foul-smelling feet. In episode 7, \"Smelly Feat\", he reveals that he has been 'saving the stink' to stop the Gribbles from killing an endangered turtle. In the end, he helps save the turtle.\n\nTony and Fay become officially engaged, but Fay becomes increasingly concerned that Bronson does not want her to marry Tony, eventually leading to the engagement being broken off. They are re-engaged at the end of the series.\n\nFor the only time in the show's run, Mr Gribble's primary concern is not with removing the Twists from the lighthouse. Rather, he spends the series campaigning for a senate seat with the fictional Progressive Conservative Party. Disagreeing with his policies, Nell runs against him in a party similar to the [[Australian Greens]] and ultimately wins in a landslide.\n\n=== Series 3 (2000) ===\nIn the second episode Linda is given a book of poetry, The Viking Book of Love by a young Viking named Snorrison who finds the lighthouse. In most of the episodes, a character falls in love with someone who reads poetry from the book to them; each love spell lasts up until the next one is cast. In the final episode, \"The Big Rock\", the Vikings return and the book's effects are reversed, with terrible consequences.\n\n=== Series 4 (2001) ===\nIn each episode, a knight in armour enters the lighthouse through a magical door. At the beginning of the series the knight's face is hidden behind a visor, in the second half the visor is raised. In the final episode, Isle of Dreams, the stranger is revealed to be a girl, Ariel, who has come to offer the children a perfect life on the Isle of Dreams, if Pete will become her husband. In the end, they decline, and Ariel disappears forever, along with the enchanted isle.\n\nA subplot in this series is Fay's pregnancy to Tony. The baby, named Ariel, is born in the series finale.\n\nAnother subplot is Bronson collecting various smells throughout the series with his Smellsucker, a vacuum cleaner with a nose built into it for storing the smells. This leads Bronson to becoming a superhero of sorts called Skunkman. He appears randomly throughout the series, but his true identity is not revealed. His friend Lois, appearing only in the episode of the same name, is made out to be Skunkman to Gribble's gang, but in reality, it is Bronson's alter-ego.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:SplitPoint 0072.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Split Point Lighthouse]] was used for the exterior scenes of the Twist family's [[lighthouse]] home.]]\nThe first two series were written by [[Paul Jennings (Australian author)|Paul Jennings]], with heavy editing by director Esben Storm (who also played Mr. Snapper in the first three series). Each of these episodes, with the exception of the second series's final episode \"Seeing The Light\", were based on Jennings' short stories. A movie of ''Round the Twist'' was planned, but due to creative differences, it was never made. After the second series, Jennings left the show, taking the rights to his stories with him. Paul Jennings also made some cameo appearances, in particular as the ghost of Ben Byron in Series 1's \"Without My Pants\".\n\nA lot of season one's scripts/plots had to be changed either due to budget, or just not being funny enough. Nell was supposed to die in \"Lighthouse Blues\", but episode's director Esben Storm told Paul Jennings, \"it's too depressing after thirteen weeks. We can't finish the series by killing off a well-loved character.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pauljennings.com.au/blogs.asp?cid=34|title=Writing Round the Twist - Paul Jennings Official Website and Book Shop|website=www.pauljennings.com.au|access-date=2019-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106071343/http://www.pauljennings.com.au/blogs.asp?cid=34|archive-date=6 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe seventh episode of series one was supposed to be \"Frozen Stiff\", but that had to be changed as well since it was too expensive to freeze a house and thirty other animals inside large ice blocks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe third and fourth series were written by various writers and re-used the same characters, but did not draw from Jennings' material. The latter series did not match the popular acclaim of the originals, and because of this, the series was cancelled.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Incidentally, just two years before the third series was aired, Jennings' stories were being adapted into a different show called ''[[Driven Crazy]]'', which also failed to match the popularity of the early ''Round the Twist'' and of which only one series was produced.\n\nSeveral locations in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] were used for external shots in the filming of the series. Exterior scenes of the Twist family's [[lighthouse]] home were shot at the [[Split Point Lighthouse]] in [[Aireys Inlet, Victoria|Aireys Inlet]]. The school and some town scenes were shot in [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]], [[Point Lonsdale, Victoria|Point Lonsdale]], and [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]].\n\n== Content ==\n''Round the Twist'' pushed the boundaries of acceptability for children's television, to the extent that the [[Australian Children's Television Foundation]] had difficulty finding a distributor for it: according to the ACTF's marketing Manager Jenny Buckland, \"the scripts were declared 'too rude', 'not for television' and 'outrageous'\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/rtt/roundthetwist.html|title=Australian Television: Round The Twist|website=www.australiantelevision.net|access-date=12 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203182221/http://www.australiantelevision.net/rtt/roundthetwist.html|archive-date=3 December 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSome episodes include references to [[flatulence]], [[defecation]], [[urination]], [[vomiting]], [[body odour]], [[underwear]], [[birth]] (one involving a male), [[death]], [[nudity]], [[incest]], [[genitalia]], [[homosexuality]], [[bestiality]] and [[coprophagia]], ie:\n* '''References to flatulence''': Series 1, ep.1 ''Skeleton on the Dunny'';\n* '''References to defecation''': Series 1, ep.1 ''Skeleton on the Dunny;'' Series 1, ep.2 ''Birdsdo''; (referred to) Series 1, ep.5, ''Spaghetti Pig Out''; Series 2, ep.12 ''Little Black Balls''; Series 4, ep.3 ''Linda Godiva'';\n* '''References to urination''': Series 2, ep.3 ''Little Squirt''; Series 3, ep. 1 ''The Big Burp''; \n* '''References to vomiting''': Series 1, ep.5 ''Spaghetti Pig Out''; Series 3, ep.1 ''The Big Burp''; Series 3, ep.11 ''The Ice Cream Man Cometh;''\n* '''References to body odour''': Series 2, ep.7 ''Smelly Feat'';\n* '''References to underwear''': (actual) Series 1, ep.8 ''Wunderpants''; (referred to) series 2, ep.5 ''Nails'';\n* '''References to birth''': Series 1, ep.4 ''Cabbage Patch Fib''; series 3, ep.1 ''The Big Burp''; series 4, ep.13 ''Isle of Dreams'';\n* '''References to death''': Series 2, ep.4 ''Pink Bowtie'', and implicitly most of the ghost stories;\n* '''References to nudity''': Series 2, ep.11 ''Quivering Heap'', Series 4, ep.3 ''Linda Godiva'';\n* '''References to incest''': Series 1, ep.9 ''Lucky Lips''; Series 2, ep.9 ''Ice Maiden'';\n* '''References to genitalia''': Series 3, ep.3 ''Whirling Derfish'';\n* '''References to homosexuality''': Series 2, ep.5 ''Nails''; Series 3, ep.8 ''Brainless''; \n* '''References to bestiality''': Series 4, ep.4 ''Dog By Night''; and\n* '''References to coprophagia''': Series 2, ep.2 ''Copy Cat''.\nThe series also engages with significant personal or social issues such as environmental conservation, or romantic relationships.<ref>\n* '''Environmental''': Series 2, episodes 3 ''Little Squirt'', 6 ''Sloppy Jalopy'', 7 ''Smelly Feat'', 8 ''Grandad's Gifts'', 10 ''Yuckles''; Series 3, ep.6 ''The Nirandathal Beast''; series 4, ep.8 ''The Princess and the Pete''\n* '''Relationships''': Series 1, episode 9 ''Lucky Lips''; Series 2, episodes 5 ''Nails'', 9 ''Ice Maiden''; Series 3, episode 2 ''Viking Book of Love''</ref>\nMany episodes revolve around helping restless spirits of dead people or animals find peace.<ref>\nSeries 1, episodes 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 13; Series 2, episodes 8, 11, 13.</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], ''Round the Twist'' was aired on [[BBC One]] during the channel's [[CBBC]] program several times in the 1990s and early 2000s, and was repeated again in 2007 on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] on Sunday mornings.\nIt also regularly appeared on [[RT\u00c9 Two|Network 2]] in [[Ireland]].
