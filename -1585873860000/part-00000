The Yale game was the sole game Princeton played in New Jersey in 1997. Palmer Stadium had been demolished for the construction of Princeton Stadium on the same site.

The [[forward pass]] is now legal.\n\n;1914\nYale, by 19\u201314, won its debut at [[Palmer Stadium]] on November 14, 1914. Palmer Stadium is the second largest stadium in the country. Yale Bowl is the largest.\n\n;1922\n[[Grantland Rice]]'s [[1922 Princeton Tigers football team|Team of Destiny]], the 1922 Princeton Tigers football team, completed an undefeated season with 6\u20130 victory.

Yale defeated Princeton, 7\u20130, in front of 53,000 fans at Palmer Stadium.\n\nLarry Kelley scored on an 80+ yard pass play as Yale was an obvious underdog versus one of Princeton's all-time great teams.<ref>The Yale Banner, pg. 139</ref>\n\nPrinceton sought its sixteenth straight victory in a streak extending back to the 1933 season. Princeton coach [[Fritz Crisler]], the acknowledged father of two-platoon football, guided the Tigers to a 7\u20131 record one year after an undefeated season and a national championship. [[1934 Princeton Tigers football team|The 1934 team]] outscored opponents 280\u201338.\n\nThe contest inspired two monographs. \"Football's Last Iron Men: 1934, Yale vs. Princeton and One Stunning Upset\" by Norman Macht, [[University of Nebraska Press]], Bison Books, published in 2010, and \"Yale's Ironmen: A Story of Football and Lives In The Decade of The [[Great Depression]] and Beyond\" by [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] [[sportswriter]] and Yale alumnus William N.

Crisler's record was 2\u20133\u20131 versus his Yale counterparts (1\u20133 versus [[Ducky Pond]]) but he led Princeton to consensus national championships the two seasons he defeated Yale. Crisler coached against Yale's Downtown Athletic and Heisman Trophy winners Larry Kelley and Clint Frank, and he coached in the Ironmen game. He lost the 1937 contest, 26\u20130.\n\n;1949\u20131951\nThe 1949\u20131951 contests, each won by Princeton, featured Dick Kazmaier, the eventual winner of the 1951 Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, [[Walter Camp Award]], and [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year]]. Kazmaier received 506 first place votes (first, second and third place votes are tallied) and 1,777 total points with the second-place finisher receiving, by contrast, 42 first place votes in the balloting. Kazmaier was a double threat\u2014to run or to pass\u2014in the [[single wing offense]].\n\nPrinceton won 21\u201313,  47\u201312 in New Haven (most points ever scored by a visiting team at the Bowl) and 27\u20130. Kazmaier appeared on the cover of the November 19, 1951 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', two days after the 27\u20130 victory.\n\nKazmaier dominated the contests; he, for example, tossed three touchdown passes and ran for another touchdown in the 27\u20130 victory his senior season. (Earlier in the season Kazmaier and teammates crushed Harvard, 54\u201313.) Kazmaier won the coveted Heisman Trophy for the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heisman.com/mobile/index.aspx|title=The Heisman Trophy|website=Heisman}}</ref><ref>http://www.goprincetontigers.com/newd/2013/8/1/208907651.aspx</ref>\n\n;1955\nPrinceton captain and future athletic  director [[Royce Flippin]] led the Tigers to a 13\u20130 at packed and partisan Palmer Stadium. Over 46,000 spectators saw contest. \"Overall, Yale is our biggest rival,\" Flippin remarked years later, \"so we took the game seriously.\"\n\nYale defeated an able Army team the week before and was ranked nationally but Princeton provided unsolved problems for Yale. Flippin, who was later also athletic director at [[MIT]], opened the scoring in the third quarter and Princeton won, 13\u20130, after Joe DiRenzo returned an interception for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter.<ref>The Yale Banner 1956, pg. 150</ref><ref>https://www.princetontigersfootball.com/2016/06/the-great-royce-flippin-and-class-of-1956s-lasting/legacy</ref>\n[[Robert Casciola]], later a head coach  the program, was on the field for Princeton.\n\n;1960\nThe 1960 Ivy League football season ended with Yale  7\u20130 and Princeton 6\u20131. Yale, captained by [[Mike Pyle]], who switched to [[offensive tackle]] from [[Center (gridiron football)|center]] for the season, won before 65,000 spectators at the Bowl. The 1960 Yale team is the program's sole undefeated, untied team since 1923. The team was ranked 14th in the season-ending AP poll, in front of 16th ranked [[1960 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] and 19th ranked [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]].<ref>[http://www.collegepollarchive.com/football/ap/seasons.cfm?s]</ref>\n\nPyle captained the [[Chicago Bears]] during its 1963 NFL Championship season until the end of the 1969 season.\n\n;1967\nYale won 29\u20137 at Palmer Stadium, the first of fourteen consecutive victories versus Princeton. The Tigers had enjoyed a six-game winning streak versus the Bulldogs. [[Calvin Hill]] and [[Brian Dowling (American football)|Brian Dowling]] led the Bulldogs during the contest. Cheerleading captain [[George W. Bush]] lead Yalies post-contest. Bush was arrested by local police for attempting to tear down a goalpost.<ref>http://www.wthefilm.com/guide/pages/6-Arrested-at-Princeton-Game.html</ref>\n\n;1979\nYale won 35\u201310, led by future three time Super Bowl winner [[Kenny Hill (defensive back)|Ken Hill]]. The running back  gained 129 yards on 19 carries. Yale was undefeated at 5\u20130 in the League and Princeton 4\u20131 before kickoff. Yale clinched sole possession of the football title with the lop-sided victory.

Princeton undergrads Mark Hallam, Jamie Herbert, Rod Sheperd, and Scott Thompson posed as members of the Yale cheerleading squad and requested Bingo's appearance for publicity photographs. Osterweiss obliged the perpetrators.

[[Bob Holly (American football)|Bob Holly]], a future Super Bowl champion with the [[Washington Redskins]], passed for 501 yards and [[wide receiver]] Derek Graham accounted for 278 yards, both Princeton records. Rich Diana ran for a Yale record 222 yards.\n\nThe Princeton Athletic News deemed the contest the Princeton game of the century.\n\nYale was 8\u20130 including a nationally televised \"upset\" victory versus [[Navy football|Navy]]. Yale Head Coach [[Carm Cozza]]'s record was 14\u20131 versus Princeton before the final whistle. Princeton had a 3\u20134\u20131 overall record, and had lost to Maine 55\u201344 the week before.\n\nHolly, a right handed quarterback, scored the winning touchdown on a left roll out with four seconds remaining.<ref>[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]], December 1, 1981</ref>\n\n;1988\n[[Jason Garrett]], [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the 1988 Princeton team and [[Asa Smith Bushnell III|Asa S.

Garrett, who played professionally in three leagues and won two [[Super Bowl]] rings with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], is the former head coach of the Cowboys. Garrett was named NFL Coach of the Year for the 2016 season.\n\n;1997\nPrinceton defeated Yale 9\u20130 in front of a little more than 6,000 spectators on a blustery and cloudy afternoon at the [[Giants Stadium|Meadowlands]], home to the [[NFL]] [[New York Jets]] and [[New York Giants]]. The following day's New York Times game story, by William N. Wallace, began: \"A century ago Princeton - Yale was the game, played at the Polo Grounds in New York from 1887 to 1896 before capacity crowds.\" That was not the case across the [[Hudson River]] just west of the mentioned Polo Grounds, now home to a rundown [[New York City Housing Authority]] development.\n\nThe Princeton Tigers football team spent the season on the road while [[Princeton Stadium]] was constructed. The Yale game was the sole game Princeton played in New Jersey in 1997. Palmer Stadium had been demolished for the construction of Princeton Stadium on the same site. William Powers, once an All Ivy punter for Princeton, contributed $10 million to the Princeton athletic department. Princeton Stadium's playing surface is named in honor of his family.<ref>https://www.goprincetontigers.com/news/2006/6/18/295165.aspx</ref>\n\n==Game results==\n{{sports rivalry series table\n|

If one adds up all forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]] of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite.  Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from [[conservation of mass]]; however, [[special relativity]] showed that mass is related to energy and vice versa by ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>'', and science now takes the view that mass\u2013energy as a whole is conserved. Theoretically, this implies that any object with mass can itself be converted to pure energy, and vice versa, though this is believed to be possible only under the most extreme of physical conditions, such as likely existed in the universe [[Grand unification epoch|very shortly after the Big Bang]].\n\nConservation of energy can be rigorously proven by [[Noether's theorem]] as a consequence of [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[time translation symmetry]]; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.\n\nA consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a [[Perpetual motion#Classification|perpetual motion machine of the first kind]] cannot exist, that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings.<ref>Planck, M.

However, there is no particular reason to identify their theories with what we know today as \"mass-energy\" (for example, Thales thought it was water). [[Empedocles]] (490\u2013430 BCE) wrote that in his universal system, composed of [[Classical element|four roots]] (earth, air, water, fire), \"nothing comes to be or perishes\";<ref>{{cite journal|last=Janko|first=Richard|title=Empedocles, \"On Nature\"|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik|year=2004 |volume=150 |pages=1\u201326|url=http://ancphil.lsa.umich.edu/-/downloads/faculty/janko/empedocles-nature.pdf }}</ref> instead, these elements suffer continual rearrangement. [[Epicurus]] ({{circa}}&nbsp;350 BCE) on the other hand believed everything in the universe to be composed of indivisible units of matter - the ancient precursor to 'atoms' - and he too had some idea of the necessity of conservation, stating that \"the sum total of things was always such as it is now, and such it will ever remain\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Laertius|first=Diogenes|title=\"Lives of Eminent Philosophers: Epicurus\"|url = https://www-loebclassics.com/view/diogenes_laertius-lives_eminent_philosophers_book_x_epicurus/1925/pb_LCL185.569.xml?result=1&rskey=YoU4V6}}. This passage comes from a letter quoted in full by Diogenes, and purportedly written by Epicurus himself in which he lays out the tenets of his philosophy.</ref>\n\nIn 1605, [[Simon Stevinus]] was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that [[perpetual motion]] was impossible.\n\nIn 1639, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his analysis of several situations\u2014including the celebrated \"interrupted pendulum\"\u2014which can be described (in modern language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of the surface.\n\nIn 1669, [[Christiaan Huygens]] published his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their [[linear momentum|linear momenta]] as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'', he gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.\n\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]]]\nThe fact that kinetic energy is scalar, unlike linear momentum which is a vector, and hence easier to work with did not escape the attention of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. It was Leibniz during 1676\u20131689 who first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with ''motion'' (kinetic energy). Using Huygens' work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several [[mass]]es, ''m<sub>i</sub>'' each with [[velocity]] ''v<sub>i</sub>''),\n:<math>\\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2</math>\n\nwas conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the ''[[vis viva]]'' or ''living force'' of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of [[kinetic energy]] in situations where there is no friction. Many [[physicist]]s at that time, such as Newton,  held that the [[conservation of momentum]], which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the [[momentum]]:\n\n:<math>\\,\\!\\sum_{i} m_i v_i</math>\n\nwas the conserved ''vis viva''. It was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously, given the proper conditions such as an [[elastic collision]].\n\nIn 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', which was organized around the concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other principles were also required.\n\n[[File:Daniel Bernoulli 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]]]\n\nThe law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo, [[Johann Bernoulli|Johann]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. The former enunciated the principle of [[virtual work]] as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based his ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'', published in 1738, on this single conservation principle. Daniel's study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the [[Bernoulli's principle]], which relates the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.\n\nThis focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the [[D'Alembert's principle]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]],\nand [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations of mechanics.\n \n[[File:Emilie Chatelet portrait by Latour.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Emilie du Chatelet]]]]\n\n[[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]] (1706  \u2013 1749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. Earlier workers, including Newton and Voltaire, had all believed that \"energy\" (so far as they understood the concept at all) was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped. In classical physics the correct formula is <math>E_k = \\frac12 mv^2</math>, where <math>E_k</math> is the kinetic energy of an object, <math>m</math> its mass and <math>v</math> its speed. On this basis, du Ch\u00e2telet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat\u2026).<ref>Hagengruber, Ruth, editor (2011) ''\u00c9milie du Chatelet between Leibniz and Newton''.

The principle was also championed by some [[chemist]]s such as [[William Hyde Wollaston]]. Academics such as [[John Playfair]] were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but in the 18th and 19th centuries the fate of the lost energy was still unknown.\n\nGradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of ''vis viva''. In 1783, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] reviewed the two competing theories of ''vis viva'' and [[caloric theory]].<ref>Lavoisier, A.L. & Laplace, P.S. (1780) \"Memoir on Heat\", ''Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences'' pp.&nbsp;4\u2013355</ref> [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]'s 1798 observations of heat generation during the [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] of [[cannon]]s added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat, and (as importantly) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). ''Vis viva'' then started to be known as ''energy'', after the term was first used in that sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1807.\n\n[[File:Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]]]]\n\nThe recalibration of ''vis viva'' to\n\n:<math>\\frac {1} {2}\\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2</math>\n\nwhich can be understood as converting kinetic energy to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], was largely the result of [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] over the period 1819\u20131839. The former called the quantity ''quantit\u00e9 de travail'' (quantity of work) and the latter, ''travail m\u00e9canique'' (mechanical work), and both championed its use in engineering calculation.\n\nIn a paper ''\u00dcber die Natur der W\u00e4rme''(German \"On the Nature of Heat/Warmth\"), published in the ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'' in 1837, [[Karl Friedrich Mohr]] gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in the words: \"besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called ''Kraft'' [energy or work]. It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others.\"\n\n===Mechanical equivalent of heat===\nA key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the ''[[mechanical equivalent of heat]]''. The [[caloric theory]] maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.\n\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], a Russian scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid.\n\nIn 1798, Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]) performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.\n\n[[File:SS-joule.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[James Prescott Joule]]]]\n\nThe mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the German surgeon [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] in 1842.<ref>von Mayer, J.R. (1842) \"Remarks on the forces of inorganic nature\" in ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''43''', 233</ref> Mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the [[Dutch East Indies]], where he found that his patients' blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less [[oxygen]], and therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate.  He discovered that [[heat]] and [[mechanical work]] were both forms of energy and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them.<ref>Mayer, J.R. (1845). ''Die organische Bewegung in ihrem Zusammenhange mit dem Stoffwechsel. Ein Beitrag zur Naturkunde'', Dechsler, Heilbronn.</ref>\n\n[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|[[James Prescott Joule|Joule]]'s apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]\n\nMeanwhile, in 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now called the \"Joule apparatus\", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate.  He showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.\n\nOver the period 1840\u20131843, similar work was carried out by engineer [[Ludwig A. Colding]], although it was little known outside his native Denmark.\n\nBoth Joule's and Mayer's work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joule's that eventually drew the wider recognition.\n\n{{For|the dispute between Joule and Mayer over priority|Mechanical equivalent of heat: Priority}}\n\nIn 1844, [[William Robert Grove]] postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, [[light]], [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] by treating them all as manifestations of a single \"force\" (''energy'' in modern terms). In 1846, Grove published his theories in his book ''The Correlation of Physical Forces''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Grove, W.

It has [[rest mass|''intrinsic'' or ''rest'' mass]]. In the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of [[special relativity]] showed that it corresponds to an equivalent amount of ''rest energy''. This means that it can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of ''other'' (non-material) forms of energy, for example kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the [[mass in special relativity|''total'' mass]] or ''total'' energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.\n\nFor example, an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] each have rest mass.  They can perish together, converting their combined rest energy into [[photon]]s having electromagnetic radiant energy, but no rest mass.  If this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings, then neither the total ''mass'' nor the total ''energy'' of the system will change.  The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.\n\nThus, conservation of energy (''total'', including material or ''rest'' energy), and [[conservation of mass]] (''total'', not just ''rest''), each still holds as an (equivalent) law.  In the 18th century these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws.\n\n===Conservation of energy in beta decay===\n{{Main|Beta decay#Neutrinos in beta decay}}\nThe discovery in 1911 that electrons emitted in [[beta decay]] have a continuous rather than a discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy, under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Carsten |year=2000 |editor1-link= |editor1-mask= |title=Controversy and Consensus: Nuclear Beta Decay 1911-1934 |url=https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/physics/book/978-3-7643-5313-1 |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Verlag |isbn=978-3-7643-5313-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |bibcode= 1978PhT....31i..23B |doi=10.1063/1.2995181 |title=The idea of the neutrino |journal=Physics Today |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=23\u20138 |year=1978 |last1=Brown |first1=Laurie M. }}</ref> This problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by [[Enrico Fermi]] who proposed the correct [[Fermi's interaction|description of beta-decay]] as the emission of both an electron and an [[antineutrino]], which carries away the apparently missing energy.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Wilson |first=F.

Work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy <math>U</math> is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term \"heat energy\" for <math>\\delta Q</math> means \"that amount of energy added as the result of heating\" rather than referring to a particular form of energy. Likewise, the term \"work energy\" for <math>\\delta W</math> means \"that amount of energy lost as the result of work\". Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled, nor as the result of work being performed on or by the system.\n\n[[Entropy (classical thermodynamics)|Entropy]] is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work.\n\nFor a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be written:\n\n:<math>\\delta W = P\\,\\mathrm{d}V,</math>\n\nwhere <math>P</math> is the [[pressure]] and <math>dV</math> is a small change in the [[volume]] of the system, each of which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called ''quasi-static'', and regarded as reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature, then the heat energy may be written\n\n:<math>\\delta Q = T\\,\\mathrm{d}S,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T</math> is the [[temperature]] and <math>\\mathrm{d}S</math> is a small change in the [[entropy]] of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of state of a system.\n\nIf an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written:<ref>[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949).

From a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of [[Noether's theorem]], developed by [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and first published in 1918. The theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance then the conserved quantity is called \"energy\". The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as \"nothing depends on time per se\".\nIn other words, if the physical system is invariant under the [[continuous symmetry]] of [[time translation]] then its energy (which is [[canonical conjugate]] quantity to time) is conserved.  Conversely, systems which are not invariant under shifts in time (an example, systems with time dependent potential energy) do not exhibit conservation of energy&nbsp;\u2013 unless we consider them to exchange energy with another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time invariant again.  Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in such physical theories as special relativity and quantum theory (including [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]) in the flat [[space-time]].\n\n==Relativity==\nWith the discovery of [[special relativity]] by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Albert Einstein]], energy was proposed to be one component of an [[four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]].  Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen from any given [[inertial reference frame]].  Also conserved is the vector length ([[Minkowski space|Minkowski norm]]), which is the [[rest mass]] for single particles, and the [[invariant mass]] for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculated\u2014see the article on [[invariant mass]]).\n\nThe relativistic energy of a single [[mass]]ive particle contains a term related to its [[rest mass]] in addition to its kinetic energy of motion.  In the limit of zero kinetic energy (or equivalently in the [[rest frame]]) of a massive particle, or else in the [[center of momentum frame]] for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy, the [[total energy]] of particle or object (including internal kinetic energy in systems) is related to its [[rest mass]] or its [[invariant mass]] via the famous equation <math>E=mc^2</math>.\n\nThus, the rule of [[Mass in special relativity|''conservation of energy'' over time in special relativity]] continues to hold, so long as the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer is unchanged. This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all observers, is the [[invariant mass]], which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the [[energy\u2013momentum relation]].\n\nIn [[general relativity]], energy\u2013momentum conservation is not well-defined except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a [[stress\u2013energy\u2013momentum pseudotensor]]. However, since pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls. In practice, some metrics such as the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric]] do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html|title=Is Energy Conserved in General Relativity?|authors=Michael Weiss and John Baez|accessdate=5 Jan 2017}}</ref> The theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe.\n\n==Quantum theory==\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], energy of a quantum system is described by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] (or Hermitian) operator called the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which acts on the [[Hilbert space]] (or a space of [[wave functions]]) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the  evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum [[Noether's theorem]] for energy-momentum tensor operator. Due to the lack of the (universal) time operator in quantum theory, the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, and merely holds in specific cases (see [[Uncertainty principle]]). Energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Energy quality]]\n* [[Energy transformation]]\n* [[Eternity of the world]]\n* [[Laws of thermodynamics]]\n* [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]\n* [[Principles of energetics]]\n* [[Zero-energy universe]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Modern accounts===\n* Goldstein, Martin, and Inge F., (1993).

For instance, [[chemical energy]] is [[Energy conversion|converted]] to [[kinetic energy]] when a stick of [[dynamite]] explodes. If one adds up all forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]] of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite.  Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from [[conservation of mass]]; however, [[special relativity]] showed that mass is related to energy and vice versa by ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>'', and science now takes the view that mass\u2013energy as a whole is conserved. Theoretically, this implies that any object with mass can itself be converted to pure energy, and vice versa, though this is believed to be possible only under the most extreme of physical conditions, such as likely existed in the universe [[Grand unification epoch|very shortly after the Big Bang]].\n\nConservation of energy can be rigorously proven by [[Noether's theorem]] as a consequence of [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[time translation symmetry]]; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.\n\nA consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a [[Perpetual motion#Classification|perpetual motion machine of the first kind]] cannot exist, that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings.<ref>Planck, M.

However, there is no particular reason to identify their theories with what we know today as \"mass-energy\" (for example, Thales thought it was water). [[Empedocles]] (490\u2013430 BCE) wrote that in his universal system, composed of [[Classical element|four roots]] (earth, air, water, fire), \"nothing comes to be or perishes\";<ref>{{cite journal|last=Janko|first=Richard|title=Empedocles, \"On Nature\"|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik|year=2004 |volume=150 |pages=1\u201326|url=http://ancphil.lsa.umich.edu/-/downloads/faculty/janko/empedocles-nature.pdf }}</ref> instead, these elements suffer continual rearrangement. [[Epicurus]] ({{circa}}&nbsp;350 BCE) on the other hand believed everything in the universe to be composed of indivisible units of matter - the ancient precursor to 'atoms' - and he too had some idea of the necessity of conservation, stating that \"the sum total of things was always such as it is now, and such it will ever remain\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Laertius|first=Diogenes|title=\"Lives of Eminent Philosophers: Epicurus\"|url = https://www-loebclassics.com/view/diogenes_laertius-lives_eminent_philosophers_book_x_epicurus/1925/pb_LCL185.569.xml?result=1&rskey=YoU4V6}}. This passage comes from a letter quoted in full by Diogenes, and purportedly written by Epicurus himself in which he lays out the tenets of his philosophy.</ref>\n\nIn 1605, [[Simon Stevinus]] was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that [[perpetual motion]] was impossible.\n\nIn 1639, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his analysis of several situations\u2014including the celebrated \"interrupted pendulum\"\u2014which can be described (in modern language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of the surface.\n\nIn 1669, [[Christiaan Huygens]] published his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their [[linear momentum|linear momenta]] as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'', he gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.\n\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]]]\nThe fact that kinetic energy is scalar, unlike linear momentum which is a vector, and hence easier to work with did not escape the attention of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. It was Leibniz during 1676\u20131689 who first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with ''motion'' (kinetic energy). Using Huygens' work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several [[mass]]es, ''m<sub>i</sub>'' each with [[velocity]] ''v<sub>i</sub>''),\n:<math>\\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2</math>\n\nwas conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the ''[[vis viva]]'' or ''living force'' of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of [[kinetic energy]] in situations where there is no friction. Many [[physicist]]s at that time, such as Newton,  held that the [[conservation of momentum]], which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the [[momentum]]:\n\n:<math>\\,\\!\\sum_{i} m_i v_i</math>\n\nwas the conserved ''vis viva''. It was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously, given the proper conditions such as an [[elastic collision]].\n\nIn 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', which was organized around the concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other principles were also required.\n\n[[File:Daniel Bernoulli 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]]]\n\nThe law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo, [[Johann Bernoulli|Johann]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. The former enunciated the principle of [[virtual work]] as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based his ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'', published in 1738, on this single conservation principle. Daniel's study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the [[Bernoulli's principle]], which relates the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.\n\nThis focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the [[D'Alembert's principle]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]],\nand [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations of mechanics.\n\n[[File:Emilie Chatelet portrait by Latour.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Emilie Chatelet]]]]\n\n[[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]] (1706  \u2013 1749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. Earlier workers, including Newton and Voltaire, had all believed that \"energy\" (so far as they understood the concept at all) was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped. In classical physics the correct formula is <math>E_k = \\frac12 mv^2</math>, where <math>E_k</math> is the kinetic energy of an object, <math>m</math> its mass and <math>v</math> its speed. On this basis, Ch\u00e2telet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat\u2026).<ref>Hagengruber, Ruth, editor (2011) ''\u00c9milie du Chatelet between Leibniz and Newton''.

The principle was also championed by some [[chemist]]s such as [[William Hyde Wollaston]]. Academics such as [[John Playfair]] were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but in the 18th and 19th centuries the fate of the lost energy was still unknown.\n\nGradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of ''vis viva''. In 1783, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] reviewed the two competing theories of ''vis viva'' and [[caloric theory]].<ref>Lavoisier, A.L. & Laplace, P.S. (1780) \"Memoir on Heat\", ''Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences'' pp.&nbsp;4\u2013355</ref> [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]'s 1798 observations of heat generation during the [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] of [[cannon]]s added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat, and (as importantly) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). ''Vis viva'' then started to be known as ''energy'', after the term was first used in that sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1807.\n\n[[File:Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]]]]\n\nThe recalibration of ''vis viva'' to\n\n:<math>\\frac {1} {2}\\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2</math>\n\nwhich can be understood as converting kinetic energy to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], was largely the result of [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] over the period 1819\u20131839. The former called the quantity ''quantit\u00e9 de travail'' (quantity of work) and the latter, ''travail m\u00e9canique'' (mechanical work), and both championed its use in engineering calculation.\n\nIn a paper ''\u00dcber die Natur der W\u00e4rme''(German \"On the Nature of Heat/Warmth\"), published in the ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'' in 1837, [[Karl Friedrich Mohr]] gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in the words: \"besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called ''Kraft'' [energy or work]. It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others.\"\n\n===Mechanical equivalent of heat===\nA key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the ''[[mechanical equivalent of heat]]''. The [[caloric theory]] maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.\n\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], a Russian scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid.\n\nIn 1798, Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]) performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.\n\n[[File:SS-joule.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[James Prescott Joule]]]]\n\nThe mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the German surgeon [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] in 1842.<ref>von Mayer, J.R. (1842) \"Remarks on the forces of inorganic nature\" in ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''43''', 233</ref> Mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the [[Dutch East Indies]], where he found that his patients' blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less [[oxygen]], and therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate.  He discovered that [[heat]] and [[mechanical work]] were both forms of energy and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them.<ref>Mayer, J.R. (1845). ''Die organische Bewegung in ihrem Zusammenhange mit dem Stoffwechsel. Ein Beitrag zur Naturkunde'', Dechsler, Heilbronn.</ref>\n\n[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|[[James Prescott Joule|Joule]]'s apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]\n\nMeanwhile, in 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now called the \"Joule apparatus\", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate.  He showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.\n\nOver the period 1840\u20131843, similar work was carried out by engineer [[Ludwig A.

In 1846, Grove published his theories in his book ''The Correlation of Physical Forces''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Grove, W.

It has [[rest mass|''intrinsic'' or ''rest'' mass]]. In the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of [[special relativity]] showed that it corresponds to an equivalent amount of ''rest energy''. This means that it can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of ''other'' (non-material) forms of energy, for example kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the [[mass in special relativity|''total'' mass]] or ''total'' energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.\n\nFor example, an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] each have rest mass.  They can perish together, converting their combined rest energy into [[photon]]s having electromagnetic radiant energy, but no rest mass.  If this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings, then neither the total ''mass'' nor the total ''energy'' of the system will change.  The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.\n\nThus, conservation of energy (''total'', including material or ''rest'' energy), and [[conservation of mass]] (''total'', not just ''rest''), each still holds as an (equivalent) law.  In the 18th century these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws.\n\n===Conservation of energy in beta decay===\n{{Main|Beta decay#Neutrinos in beta decay}}\nThe discovery in 1911 that electrons emitted in [[beta decay]] have a continuous rather than a discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy, under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Carsten |year=2000 |editor1-link= |editor1-mask= |title=Controversy and Consensus: Nuclear Beta Decay 1911-1934 |url=https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/physics/book/978-3-7643-5313-1 |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Verlag |isbn=978-3-7643-5313-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |bibcode= 1978PhT....31i..23B |doi=10.1063/1.2995181 |title=The idea of the neutrino |journal=Physics Today |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=23\u20138 |year=1978 |last1=Brown |first1=Laurie M. }}</ref> This problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by [[Enrico Fermi]] who proposed the correct [[Fermi's interaction|description of beta-decay]] as the emission of both an electron and an [[antineutrino]], which carries away the apparently missing energy.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Wilson |first=F.

Work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy <math>U</math> is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term \"heat energy\" for <math>\\delta Q</math> means \"that amount of energy added as the result of heating\" rather than referring to a particular form of energy. Likewise, the term \"work energy\" for <math>\\delta W</math> means \"that amount of energy lost as the result of work\". Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled, nor as the result of work being performed on or by the system.\n\n[[Entropy (classical thermodynamics)|Entropy]] is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work.\n\nFor a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be written:\n\n:<math>\\delta W = P\\,\\mathrm{d}V,</math>\n\nwhere <math>P</math> is the [[pressure]] and <math>dV</math> is a small change in the [[volume]] of the system, each of which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called ''quasi-static'', and regarded as reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature, then the heat energy may be written\n\n:<math>\\delta Q = T\\,\\mathrm{d}S,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T</math> is the [[temperature]] and <math>\\mathrm{d}S</math> is a small change in the [[entropy]] of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of state of a system.\n\nIf an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written:<ref>[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949).

From a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of [[Noether's theorem]], developed by [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and first published in 1918. The theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance then the conserved quantity is called \"energy\". The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as \"nothing depends on time per se\".\nIn other words, if the physical system is invariant under the [[continuous symmetry]] of [[time translation]] then its energy (which is [[canonical conjugate]] quantity to time) is conserved.  Conversely, systems which are not invariant under shifts in time (an example, systems with time dependent potential energy) do not exhibit conservation of energy&nbsp;\u2013 unless we consider them to exchange energy with another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time invariant again.  Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in such physical theories as special relativity and quantum theory (including [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]) in the flat [[space-time]].\n\n==Relativity==\nWith the discovery of [[special relativity]] by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Albert Einstein]], energy was proposed to be one component of an [[four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]].  Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen from any given [[inertial reference frame]].  Also conserved is the vector length ([[Minkowski space|Minkowski norm]]), which is the [[rest mass]] for single particles, and the [[invariant mass]] for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculated\u2014see the article on [[invariant mass]]).\n\nThe relativistic energy of a single [[mass]]ive particle contains a term related to its [[rest mass]] in addition to its kinetic energy of motion.  In the limit of zero kinetic energy (or equivalently in the [[rest frame]]) of a massive particle, or else in the [[center of momentum frame]] for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy, the [[total energy]] of particle or object (including internal kinetic energy in systems) is related to its [[rest mass]] or its [[invariant mass]] via the famous equation <math>E=mc^2</math>.\n\nThus, the rule of [[Mass in special relativity|''conservation of energy'' over time in special relativity]] continues to hold, so long as the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer is unchanged. This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all observers, is the [[invariant mass]], which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the [[energy\u2013momentum relation]].\n\nIn [[general relativity]], energy\u2013momentum conservation is not well-defined except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a [[stress\u2013energy\u2013momentum pseudotensor]]. However, since pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls. In practice, some metrics such as the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric]] do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html|title=Is Energy Conserved in General Relativity?|authors=Michael Weiss and John Baez|accessdate=5 Jan 2017}}</ref> The theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe.\n\n==Quantum theory==\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], energy of a quantum system is described by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] (or Hermitian) operator called the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which acts on the [[Hilbert space]] (or a space of [[wave functions]]) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the  evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum [[Noether's theorem]] for energy-momentum tensor operator. Due to the lack of the (universal) time operator in quantum theory, the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, and merely holds in specific cases (see [[Uncertainty principle]]). Energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Energy quality]]\n* [[Energy transformation]]\n* [[Eternity of the world]]\n* [[Laws of thermodynamics]]\n* [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]\n* [[Principles of energetics]]\n* [[Zero-energy universe]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Modern accounts===\n* Goldstein, Martin, and Inge F., (1993).

It was one of the largest sultanates ever established in the territory, and, at the height of its power, included the [[Sanaag]] region and parts of the northeastern [[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] region of the country, an area historically known as [[Maakhir]] or the ''Maakhir Coast''. The Sultanate was founded in the 13th century in northern Somalia by a group of Somalis from the [[Warsangali]] branch of the [[Darod]] clan, and was ruled by the descendants of the [[Gerad Dhidhin]]. In the late 19th century, the influential [[Sultan]] [[Mohamoud Ali Shire]] governed the Sultanate, assuming control during some of its most turbulent years.<ref>[http://www.warsangeli.org Warsangeli Sultanate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519035544/http://www.warsangeli.org/ |date=19 May 2018 }}.

A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] with a band of [[Hadhramaut|Hadhrami]] [[musketeer]]s and a group of devoted lieutenants.

Both rulers had signed the protectorate treaties to advance their own expansionist objectives, with Boqor Osman looking to use Italy's support in his ongoing power struggle with Kenadid over the Majeerteen Sultanate.

Experts believe this is because of higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in Puntland consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty does not appear to be driven by household size, as the average in Puntland is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in [[Somaliland]] and 4.5 in [[Mogadishu]]. Puntland is doing better in various important indicators of well-being. For instance, the literacy rate in Puntland is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in Puntland also outperform the average in other educational outcomes such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in Puntland have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%.

The Sultanate was founded in the 13th century in northern Somalia by a group of Somalis from the [[Warsangali]] branch of the [[Darod]] clan, and was ruled by the descendants of the [[Gerad Dhidhin]].

Experts believe this is because of higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in Puntland consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty does not appear to be driven by household size, as the average in Puntland is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in [[Somaliland]] and 4.5 in [[Mogadishu]]. Puntland is doing better in various important indicators of well-being. For instance, the literacy rate in Puntland is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in Puntland also outperform the average in other educational outcomes such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in Puntland have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%. Therefore, Puntland's higher performance on non-monetary indicators of well-being are inline with its lower rate of poverty.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/325991506114032755/pdf/Output-P160456-v7.pdf|title=Somali Poverty Profile 2016|last=Pape|first=Utz|last2=di Filippo|first2=Mario|date=June 2017|website=The World Bank|publisher=The World Bank|pages=91\u2013102|type=PDF|format=PDF|last3=Nunez|first3=Gonzalo|last4=Wollburg|first4=Philip|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013064911/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/325991506114032755/pdf/Output-P160456-v7.pdf|archive-date=13 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Selected poverty indicators'''<ref name=\":0\" />\n!\n!Poverty\nincidence\n\n(% of population)\n!Poverty\ngap\n\n(% of poverty line)\n!Poverty\nseverity\nindex\n!Total\ngap\n\n(per year,\n\ncurrent million USD)\n|-\n|'''Puntland'''\n|'''27.2'''\n|'''7.9'''\n|'''3.5'''\n|'''49.2'''\n|-\n|Urban\n|26\n|7.5\n|3.4\n|40.4\n|-\n|Rural\n|34\n|10.1\n|4.1\n|8.8\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|'''[[Somaliland]]'''\n|'''50.0'''\n|'''19.2'''\n|'''9.3'''\n|'''229.8'''\n|-\n|Urban\n|47.9\n|18.2\n|8.9\n|179.7\n|-\n|Rural\n|61.1\n|24.2\n|11.4\n|50.1\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|'''[[Mogadishu]]'''\n|'''57.0'''\n|'''23.8'''\n|'''11.9'''\n|'''163.5'''\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|'''[[Somalia]]'''\n|'''51.4'''\n|'''21.7'''\n|'''11.5'''\n|'''1,318.4'''\n|-\n|Urban\n|45.0\n|17.1\n|8.4\n|476.3\n|-\n|Rural\n|52.5\n|19.7\n|9.1\n|627.5\n|-\n|IDP Settlements\n|70.5\n|36.5\n|22.2\n|214.6\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |The total monetary value of the poverty gap includes the entire Somali population.<ref name=\":0\" />\n|}\n\nIn December 2011, a new commercial market opened in Bosaso's northern Dayaha (\"Star\") neighborhood, near the seaport.
