{"title_page": "Rear admiral", "text_new": "{{short description|Naval commissioned officer rank above that of a commodore and captain}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}\n{{Military ranks}}\n{{Navalranks}}\n'''Rear admiral''' is a senior [[naval]] [[flag officer]] rank, equivalent to a [[major general]] and [[air vice marshal]] and above that of a [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] and [[Captain (naval)|captain]], but below that of a [[vice admiral]]. It is regarded as a two star \"[[admiral]]\" rank. In many navies it is referred to as (OF-7)/(O-7).\n\nIt originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the [[Royal Navy]].  Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head, who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron.  The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral, who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle.  In the rear of the naval squadron, a third admiral would command the remaining ships and, as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger, the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals. This has survived into the modern age, with the rank of rear admiral the most-junior of the admiralty ranks of many navies.\n\nIn some European navies (e.g., that of [[French Navy|France]]), and in the Canadian Forces' French rank translations, the rank of rear admiral is known as ''[[contre-amiral]]''. In the [[German Navy]] the rank is known as [[Konteradmiral]], superior to the [[flotilla admiral]] (Commodore in other navies). In the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], this rank is known as ''[[schout-bij-nacht]]'' (lit.: supervisor during night), denoting the role junior to the squadron admiral, and fleet admiral.\n\n==Australia==\n{{main|Rear admiral (Australia)}}\n{{Infobox military rank\n| name           = Rear admiral (Australia)\n| image          = Royal Australian Navy OF-7.svg\n| image_size     = 60px\n| caption        = The RADM insignia\n| image2         = Royal Australian Navy (sleeves) OF-7.svg\n| image_size2    = 60px\n| caption2       =\n| country        = {{flag|Australia}}\n| service branch = {{navy|Australia}}\n| abbreviation   = RADM\n| rank           = [[two-star rank|Two-star]]\n| NATO rank      = [[Ranks and insignia of NATO armies officers#Officers (OF 1\u201310)|O-9]]\n| Non-NATO rank  =\n| formation      =\n| abolished      =\n| higher rank    = [[Vice admiral (Australia)|Vice admiral]]\n| lower rank     = [[Commodore (Australia)|Commodore]]\n| equivalents    = {{bulleted list|{{nowrap|[[Major general (Australia)|Major general]] ([[Australian Army|Army]])}}|{{nowrap|[[Air vice-marshal (Australia)|Air vice-marshal]] ([[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]]) }}  }} \n| history        =\n}}\nThe [[Royal Australian Navy]] maintains a rank of rear admiral; refer to [[Australian Defence Force ranks and insignia]].

Written by Barve, Prasad, Mitesh Shah and [[Anand Gandhi]], who also served as the creative director, the film was produced by [[Sohum Shah (actor)|Sohum Shah]], [[Aanand L. Rai]], Mukesh Shah and Amita Shah. Starring Sohum Shah in the lead role as Vinayak Rao, it follows the story of his search for a hidden treasure in the 20th century [[British India]] village of [[Tumbbad, Maharashtra]].\n\nBarve began writing the script based on a story a friend had told him about in 1993, by [[Marathi people|Marathi writer]] [[Narayan Dharap]]. He wrote the first draft in 1997, when he was 18 years old. From 2009 to 2010, he created a 700-page storyboard for the film. It was optioned by seven production companies who backed out and went on the floor (went into production) three times. It was first shot in 2012 but after editing, Barve and Shah were not satisfied. The film was then re-written and re-shot with filming completed in May 2015. Pankaj Kumar served as the [[director of photography]] while Sanyukta Kaza was its editor. [[Jesper Kyd]] composed the original score while [[Ajay-Atul]] composed one song.\n\n''Tumbbad'' premiered in the critics' week section of the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]]\u2014the first Indian film to be screened there. It was also screened at: the 2018 [[Fantastic Fest]], [[Sitges Film Festival]], the [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]], the [[El Gouna Film Festival]], 23rd [[International Film Festival of Kerala]], Morbido Film Fest, [[Brooklyn Horror Film Festival]] and Nitte International Film Festival. It was released on 12 October 2018 to mostly positive reviews with critics praising the visuals. Made on a production budget of {{INRConvert|50|m}}, the film grossed a total of {{INRConvert|136|m}} at the box office, making it a profitable venture. ''Tumbbad'' received eight nominations at the [[64th Filmfare Awards]] winning three for [[Filmfare Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Sound Design|Best Sound Design]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1947, Vinayak Rao tells his 14-year-old son Pandurang about the Goddess of Prosperity who gave birth to 160 million gods. [[Hastar]], her first and most beloved offspring, was greedy for all her gold and food. The other gods attacked Hastar just as he was about to acquire her food, but the goddess saved him on the condition that he could never be worshipped and would be forgotten by history. For years, Hastar has been sleeping inside his mother's womb.\n\nIn 1918 in [[Tumbbad, Maharashtra]], Vinayak's mother is the widow and serves the elder brother-in-law, the local lord, Sarkar, in his mansion. This includes, as in those days of the blighted lives of widows, offering him sexual services. She gets a single gold coin which Sarkar managed to possess. After the death of Vinayak's father, Sarkar searches for the treasure all his life in vain. Meanwhile, Vinayak and his younger brother Sadashiv worry about having to feed the monstrous old woman, their grandmother, chained up in a separate room.\n\nSarkar later dies and the mother proposes leaving Tumbbad for [[Pune]], as the last surviving male dying exposes the widow to further turmoil.\n\nWhilst playing, Sadashiv gets badly hurt after falling from a tree, and their tense mother purposes to take him to the local doctor-vaidya. She tells Vinayak he will have to feed his grandmother that night. She also warns him that if the old woman wakes up, he should say \"sleep, else Hastar will come\".\n\nVinayak is tricked by the old lady's whispering pleadings that she will tell him the secret to the treasure. As Vinayak tries to feed her, the monstrous and hungry old woman attacks, shackles him and catches him with intent to eat, but he makes to escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Sadashiv dies on the way to the doctor. The mother directs her carriage driver to Sarkar's mansion where she retrieves the gold coin.\n\nThe mother returns the next day to forcibly take away Vinayak, from Tumbbad for Pune. She makes Vinayak promise never return to Tumbbad, despite Vinayak insisting on finding the treasure that is rumoured to be hidden somewhere in the mansion with the help of his grandmother.\n\n14 years pass, and Vinayak grows up. Desperate to escape his life of poverty, Vinayak returns to Tumbbad. The old woman, with now a tree growing out of her body, warns him he will be cursed to become immortal and turned into a monster like her if he touches the treasure i.e. Hastar. She tells him the secret which is revealed later. Using that secret he starts acquiring gold mudras. He offers his first gold coin to the money lender, to pay off a debt. Raghav deals in all commodities, including opium. Each time he needs more money, Vinayak returns to Tumbbad to steal from Hastar. He completes his tractions with Raghav, who now owes Vinayak.\n\nVinayak now lives a life of excesses. Wine, women, debauchery. Raghav openly wonders about the treasure rumoured to exist in the Tumbbad mansion while also questioning why Vinayak can only retrieve a few coins at a time. Vinayak and his wife give birth to their son Pandurang. Sergeant Cooper gives Raghav two days to come up with the money to buy an opium field cheaply, before he gets transferred on promotion.\n\nRaghav sells his widowed daughter-in-law to Vinayak as a mistress, to keep him engaged, whilst looting the treasure. Vinayak follows Raghav to the Tumbbad mansion and tricks him into descending into Hastar's well. Hastar viciously attacks Raghav, turning him into a monster and mutating him into the walls of the womb. Vinayak burns Raghav alive to end his suffering.\n\nPandurang has polio and his left leg is weak and short. Vinayak sets him training to climb ropes up and down and collect scattered coins quickly. The boy is a witness to his father's debauchery within the wada in Pune.\n\nVinayak takes Pandurang to the mansion to train him for bringing back the gold. He narrates the story of Tumbbad, Hastar, the first goddess, their ancestors and their current family.\n\nAs per the aborigines, the first magical being was a female goddess who gave birth to many living and happy beings. But her first born, a male God was evil, acquisitive, greedy, selfish. He snatches all the gold, then wants to possess all the grain. But the other gods get to know of this and chase him. His mother protects him by taking him back into her womb and obliterates his name from literature. He's eternally magical, alive, hungry, angry and animalistic. But confined to her womb, deep within the earth.\n\nThe humans of Tumbbad resurrect his name and build a temple to him. This saddens the other gods and it continually rains in Tumbbad. Though the rest of the inhabitants find living there unbearable, the khots who revered him became rich.\n\nIn their mansion-wada, there's a cordoned off area with two heavy doors and complicated locks. Here, there's a dry well which leads with winding, narrow and dark paths, deep into the earth. A heavy and large trunk is the entrance to the lair. They draw a circle with flour around the trunk and around the point of descent inside the red, throbbing womb. They descend via a rope and rob Hastar by luring him with a flour doll, filled with stones to slow him down. As he's eating, they scatter the gold coins from a pouch around his waist. They pick as many as they quickly can and ascend and exit the lair to escape him. The narrow circle of flour barely containing the hastar.\n\nIn the trial run, Vinayak was to only show Pandurang the format and not to actually bring the dough doll down. But Pandurang secretly brings a dough doll and Hastar unexpectedly attacks. They barely manage to escape and Vinayak chides his son for nearly getting them touched. But he rewards his son with his first gold coin for the partnership.\n\nPandurang is now emboldened at nine years to indulge in the same debauchery as the Father. He's encouraged to do so.\n\nIndia gets its freedom in 1947 and takes possession of all unclaimed mansions. The indulgent Vinayak didn't know of this till too late. In a last bid attempt to add to the already accumulated wealth, Pandurang suggests stealing Hastar's loincloth with dozens of dough dolls to distract Hastar.\n\nThis is when the total brilliance of the team is shown. The entire format of the story being rhetorical, philosophical and having dual meaning gets revealed.\n\nThey descend supreme in the thought of their cleverness. But the two of them become trapped inside the womb when separate Hastars appear for each one of those dolls. Every doll they throw at Hastar had all of them fighting, hitting each other to eat it. Jostling and killing each other for the morsel. Seeing the Hastars kill each other, Pandurang realises the effect of the potli with gold mudras on the psyche, relationships, morality, virtue and sanity. At death's door he only wants to escape that hell with his father, who he adores. But with no hope of escaping, Vinayak ties the dolls to his body to act as bait. Once the coast is clear, Pandurang climbs back to the surface, only to see his father being mutated into a monster outside the mansion. Vinayak presents him with the stolen loincloth, but Pandurang refuses to take it. Sobbing at seeing what his father finally turned into, Pandurang reluctantly sets Vinayak on fire along with the potli yielding the eternal supply of gold mudras and leaves locking the evil mansion for good.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sohum Shah (actor)|Sohum Shah]] as Vinayak Rao\n* Jyoti Malshe as Vinayak's mother\n* Dhundiraj Prabhakar Jogalekar as young Vinayak\n* Rudra Soni as Sadashiv\n* Madhav Hari Joshi as Sarkar\n* Pushpak Kaushik as Grandmother\n* Anita Date as Vaidehi, Vinayak's wife\n* Deepak Damle as Raghav\n* Cameron Anderson as Sergeant Cooper\n* [[Ronjini Chakraborty]] as Vinayak's mistress\n* [[Mohammad Samad]] as Pandurang\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nDirector Rahi Anil Barve said the title is derived from [[Shripad Narayan Pendse]]'s [[Marathi literature|Marathi novel]] ''Tumbadche Khot''.<ref name=touch>{{cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/touching-indifference/|title=Touching Indifference|last=Hebbar|first=Prajakta|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=24 December 2014|accessdate=21 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709153748/https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/touching-indifference/|archive-date=9 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He wrote the first draft in 1997, when he was 18 years old.

The character of Hastar was created with heavy prosthetic makeup that required six to seven hours to prepare.<ref name=nandini /> Shah wore contact lenses throughout the film for the green eyes. The entire film was shot over 100 to 120 days with four shooting schedules in 2012 and 2015.

Written by Barve, Prasad, Mitesh Shah and [[Anand Gandhi]], who also served as the creative director, the film was produced by [[Sohum Shah (actor)|Sohum Shah]], [[Aanand L. Rai]], Mukesh Shah and Amita Shah. Starring Sohum Shah in the lead role as Vinayak Rao, it follows the story of his search for a hidden treasure in the 20th century [[British India]] village of [[Tumbbad, Maharashtra]].\n\nBarve began writing the script based on a story a friend had told him about in 1993, by [[Marathi people|Marathi writer]] [[Narayan Dharap]]. He wrote the first draft in 1997, when he was 18 years old. From 2009 to 2010, he created a 700-page storyboard for the film. It was optioned by seven production companies who backed out and went on the floor (went into production) three times. It was first shot in 2012 but after editing, Barve and Shah were not satisfied. The film was then re-written and re-shot with filming completed in May 2015. Pankaj Kumar served as the [[director of photography]] while Sanyukta Kaza was its editor. [[Jesper Kyd]] composed the original score while [[Ajay-Atul]] composed one song.\n\n''Tumbbad'' premiered in the critics' week section of the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]]\u2014the first Indian film to be screened there. It was also screened at: the 2018 [[Fantastic Fest]], [[Sitges Film Festival]], the [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]], the [[El Gouna Film Festival]], 23rd [[International Film Festival of Kerala]], Morbido Film Fest, [[Brooklyn Horror Film Festival]] and Nitte International Film Festival. It was released on 12 October 2018 to mostly positive reviews with critics praising the visuals. Made on a production budget of {{INRConvert|50|m}}, the film grossed a total of {{INRConvert|136|m}} at the box office, making it a profitable venture. ''Tumbbad'' received eight nominations at the [[64th Filmfare Awards]] winning three for [[Filmfare Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Sound Design|Best Sound Design]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1947, Vinayak Rao tells his 14-year-old son Pandurang about the Goddess of Prosperity who gave birth to 160 million gods. [[Hastar]], her first and most beloved offspring, was greedy for all her gold and food. The other gods attacked Hastar just as he was about to acquire her food, but the goddess saved him on the condition that he could never be worshipped and would be forgotten by history. For years, Hastar has been sleeping inside his mother's womb.\n\nIn 1918 in [[Tumbbad, Maharashtra]], Vinayak's mother is the widow and serves the elder brother-in-law, the local lord, Sarkar, in his mansion. This includes, as in those days of the blighted lives of widows, offering him sexual services. She gets a single gold coin which Sarkar managed to possess. After the death of Vinayak's father, Sarkar searches for the treasure all his life in vain. Meanwhile, Vinayak and his younger brother Sadashiv worry about having to feed the monstrous old woman, their grandmother, chained up in a separate room. \n\nSarkar later dies and the mother proposes leaving Tumbbad for [[Pune]], as the last surviving male dying exposes the widow to further turmoil.\n\nWhilst playing, Sadashiv gets badly hurt after falling from a tree, and their tense mother purposes to take him to the local doctor-vaidya. She tells Vinayak he will have to feed his grandmother that night. She also warns him that if the old woman wakes up, he should say \"sleep, else Hastar will come\".\n\nVinayak is tricked by the old lady's whispering pleadings that she will tell him the secret to the treasure. As Vinayak tries to feed her, the monstrous and hungry old woman attacks, shackles him and catches him with intent to eat, but he makes to escape. \n\nMeanwhile, Sadashiv dies on the way to the doctor. The mother directs her carriage driver to Sarkar's mansion where she retrieves the gold coin.\n\nThe mother returns the next day to forcibly take away Vinayak, from Tumbbad for Pune. She makes Vinayak promise never return to Tumbbad, despite Vinayak insisting on finding the treasure that is rumoured to be hidden somewhere in the mansion with the help of his grandmother.\n\n14 years pass, and Vinayak grows up. Desperate to escape his life of poverty, Vinayak returns to Tumbbad. The old woman, with now a tree growing out of her body, warns him he will be cursed to become immortal and turned into a monster like her if he touches the treasure i.e. Hastar. She tells him the secret which is revealed later. Using that secret he starts acquiring gold mudras. He offers his first gold coin to the money lender, to pay off a debt. Raghav deals in all commodities, including opium. Each time he needs more money, Vinayak returns to Tumbbad to steal from Hastar. He completes his tractions with Raghav, who now owes Vinayak.\n\nVinayak now lives a life of excesses. Wine, women, debauchery. Raghav openly wonders about the treasure rumoured to exist in the Tumbbad mansion while also questioning why Vinayak can only retrieve a few coins at a time. Vinayak and his wife give birth to their son Pandurang. Sergeant Cooper gives Raghav two days to come up with the money to buy an opium field cheaply, before he gets transfered on promotion. \n\nRaghav sells his widowed daughter-in-law to Vinayak as a mistress, to keep him engaged, whilst looting the treasure. Vinayak follows Raghav to the Tumbbad mansion and tricks him into descending into Hastar's well. Hastar viciously attacks Raghav, turning him into a monster and mutating him into the walls of the womb. Vinayak burns Raghav alive to end his suffering. \n\nPandurang has polio and his left leg is weak and short. Vinayak sets him training to climb ropes up and down and collect scattered coins quickly. The boy is a witness to his father's debauchery within the wada in Pune.\n\nVinayak takes Pandurang to the mansion to train him for bringing back the gold. He narrates the story of Tumbbad, Hastar, the first goddess, their ancestors and their current family. \n\nAs per the aborigines, the first magical being was a female goddess who gave birth to many living and happy beings. But her first born, a male God was evil, acquisitive, greedy, selfish. He snatches all the gold, then wants to possess all the grain. But the other gods get to know of this and chase him. His mother protects him by taking him back into her womb and obliterates his name from literature. He's eternally magical, alive, hungry, angry and animalistic. But confined to her womb, deep within the earth.\n\nThe humans of Tumbbad resurrect his name and build a temple to him. This saddens the other gods and it continually rains in Tumbbad. Though the rest of the inhabitants find living there unbearable, the khots who revered him became rich. \n\nIn their mansion-wada, there's a cordoned off area with two heavy doors and complicated locks. Here, there's a dry well which leads with winding, narrow and dark paths, deep into the earth. A heavy and large trunk is the entrance to the lair. They draw a circle with flour around the trunk and around the point of descent inside the red, throbbing womb. They descend via a rope and rob Hastar by luring him with a flour doll, filled with stones to slow him down. As he's eating, they scatter the gold coins from a pouch around his waist. They pick as many as they quickly can and ascend and exit the lair to escape him. The narrow circle of flour barely containing the hastar.\n\nIn the trial run, Vinayak was to only show Pandurang the format and not to actually bring the dough doll down. But Pandurang secretly brings a dough doll and Hastar unexpectedly attacks. They barely manage to escape and Vinayak chides his son for nearly getting them touched. But he rewards his son with his first gold coin for the partnership.\n\nPandurang is now emboldened at nine years to indulge in the same debauchery as the Father. He's encouraged to do so.\n\nIndia gets its freedom in 1947 and takes possession of all unclaimed mansions. The indulgent Vinayak didn't know of this till too late. In a last bid attempt to add to the already accumulated wealth, Pandurang suggests stealing Hastar's loincloth with dozens of dough dolls to distract Hastar. \n\nThis is when the total brilliance of the team is shown. The entire format of the story being rhetorical, philosophical and having dual meaning gets revealed. \n\nThey descend supreme in the thought of their cleverness. But the two of them become trapped inside the womb when separate Hastars appear for each one of those dolls. Every doll they throw at Hastar had all of them fighting, hitting each other to eat it. Jostling and killing each other for the morsel. Seeing the Hastars kill each other, Pandurang realises the effect of the potli with gold mudras on the psyche, relationships, morality, virtue and sanity. At death's door he only wants to escape that hell with his father, who he adores. But with no hope of escaping, Vinayak ties the dolls to his body to act as bait. Once the coast is clear, Pandurang climbs back to the surface, only to see his father being mutated into a monster outside the mansion. Vinayak presents him with the stolen loincloth, but Pandurang refuses to take it. Sobbing at seeing what his father finally turned into, Pandurang reluctantly sets Vinayak on fire along with the potli yeilding the eternal supply of gold mudras and leaves locking the evil mansion for good.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sohum Shah (actor)|Sohum Shah]] as Vinayak Rao\n* Jyoti Malshe as Vinayak's mother\n* Dhundiraj Prabhakar Jogalekar as young Vinayak\n* Rudra Soni as Sadashiv\n* Madhav Hari Joshi as Sarkar\n* Pushpak Kaushik as Grandmother\n* Anita Date as Vaidehi, Vinayak's wife\n* Deepak Damle as Raghav\n* Cameron Anderson as Sergeant Cooper\n* [[Ronjini Chakraborty]] as Vinayak's mistress\n* [[Mohammad Samad]] as Pandurang\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nDirector Rahi Anil Barve said the title is derived from [[Shripad Narayan Pendse]]'s [[Marathi literature|Marathi novel]] ''Tumbadche Khot''.<ref name=touch>{{cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/touching-indifference/|title=Touching Indifference|last=Hebbar|first=Prajakta|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=24 December 2014|accessdate=21 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709153748/https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/touching-indifference/|archive-date=9 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He wrote the first draft in 1997, when he was 18 years old.

The crew used artificial rain for the scenes and had to wait for hours for cloud cover.<ref name=nandini /> ''Tumbbad'' was shot in several locations across Maharashtra including [[Saswad]] and villages of the [[Satara district]]. Some scenes were shot on constructed sets in [[Mumbai]], including the womb sequence.

The character of Hastar was created with heavy prosthetic makeup that required six to seven hours to prepare.<ref name=nandini /> Shah wore contact lenses throughout the film for the green eyes. The entire film was shot over 100 to 120 days with four shooting schedules in 2012 and 2015. After the shoot, the team felt that the film was \"halfway there\" to becoming something that \"audiences hadn't seen before.\" After that the script went through re-writing, some scenes were added, and the story was \"enhanced\".

In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.

In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.

It was named after the [[World War I]] aviator  [[Max Immelmann]]. It served until its disolution in Octobr 1943. The wing operated the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', exclusively, in the combat role.\n\nFormed on 1 May 1939 StG 2 fought in the German [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 which started World War II. It formed part of [[Luftflotte 2]] in May and June 1940 and flew in support of [[Army Group A]] in the [[Battle of Belgium]] and [[Battle of France]]. StG 2 remained with Luftflotte 2 during the [[Battle of Britain]] before transfering to southern Europe to participate in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]].\n\nIn the south it mainly served in the [[Maritime interdiction]] role as it [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|bombarded Malta]] from January to March 1941. The wing then fought in the [[German invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Crete]] in April 1941 in the Martime, [[Air interdiction]], [[Offensive counter air|counter-air]] and [[close air support]] role alongside [[StG 1]], [[StG 3]] and [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 77|StG 77]]. The Ju 87 groups were successful in the [[Battle of Crete]], the final phase of the Greek campaign.\n\nElements of the wing fought in the [[North African Campaign]] until January 1942. The bulk of StG 2 fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] from 22 June 1941, after [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] began. It fought in support of all three Army Groups, and served in major battles such as the [[Siege of Leningrad]], [[Battle of Moscow]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1941 and 1942.\n\nStG 2 supported German forces in the [[Battle of Kursk]], one of the last major offensives on the Eastern Front in July 1943. The vulnerability of the Ju 87 and the loss of [[air superiority]] to the [[Red Air Force]], precluded any further large-scale use of the aircraft in the traditional dive-bombing role. In October 1943, the Ju 87 units were renamed ''Schlachtgeschwader'', battle wings, with a mixed number of Ju 87s and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s operating in the anti-tank role.\n\nStab., I., and III./StG 2 was renamed [[Schlachtgeschwader 2]] on the 18 October 1943, and ceased to exist. II./StG 2 continued, without redesignation to operate until January 1944, when its ''staffeln'' (squadrons) were renamed and equipped.\n\n==Background==\nThe dive-bomber is often associated with German aerial development in the [[Inter-war period|pre-war era]], but the type remained a low-priority for air planners who shaped the embryonic ''Luftwaffe''.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}} This apparent regression from the practices and experiences of [[World War I]] stemmed from the belief among the [[General Staff]] (''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'') that army support aviation in 1917\u20131918 was purely a reaction to [[trench warfare]].{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nGerman air doctrine remained rooted in the fundamentals of ''Operativer Luftkrieg'' (Operational Air War) which stressed [[interdiction]], [[strategic bombing]] (when and if possible) but primarily the [[air supremacy]] mission. The [[Spanish Civil War]] experience encouraged the General Staff to embrace the dive-bomber concept later in the 1930s, though the war's influence on German operational preferences remain ambiguous.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nOn the eve of World War II, some German air planners regarded the dive-bomber as a strategic weapon to strike with precision at enemy industry. Even factored into the army support groups, only fifteen percent of ''Luftwaffe'' front-line strength contained specialist ground-attack aircraft in September 1939. The lack of specialist close support aircraft left the general-purpose dive-bomber, the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', most suited to the close support role.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\n===Formation===\n''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' 2 was formed on 1 May 1939 upon the establishment of all three ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppen]]''.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pp=81, 87, 91}} The [[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|''Stabsstaffel'']] (command unit) was formed at [[K\u00f6ln]]\u2013[[Ostheim]] on 15 October 1939. The stab unit was predominantly equipped with [[Dornier Do 17]] aircraft and a handful of Ju 87s for reconnaissance and personnel transport purposes. The ''Gruppen'' were equipped with the Ju 87 dive bomber.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=72}}\n\nThe wing's first commanding officer was [[Oskar Dinort]]. I./StG 2 was established in [[Breslau]] from I./StG 163.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=75}} II./StG 2 in [[S\u0142upsk|Stolp-Reitt]] from I./StG 162, and III./StG 2 from III./StG 163 in [[Bad Langensalza|Langensalza]].{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pP=82, 91}} Dinort led the wing and first ''Gruppe'' upon StG 2's creation. Dinort then relinquished command of I./StG 2 for control of Stab./StG 2. ''[[Hauptmann]]'' Ulrich Schmidt and Ernst Ott commanded the first and second ''Gruppen''. ''Hauptmann'' [[Hubertus Hitschhold]] succeeded Dinort mid-way through StG's first major campaign.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pp=75, 82, 91}}\n\nIn August 1939 Dinort moved I./StG 2 to Nieder-Ellguth under the ''Fliegerdivision'' 2 (Flying Division 2) subordinated to [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' 4]] (Air Fleet 4). 38 Ju 87s were available to Dinort, only one was non-operational.

We could not risk making a dive-bombing attack from 4,000 metres because of the wide area of bomb dispersion. We had to fly a slant range attack, releasing bombs directly over the roofs.

It was named after the [[World War I]] aviator  [[Max Immelmann]]. It served until its disolution in Octobr 1943. The wing operated the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', exclusively, in the combat role.\n\nFormed on 1 May 1939 StG 2 fought in the German [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 which started World War II. It formed part of [[Luftflotte 2]] in May and June 1940 and flew in support of [[Army Group A]] in the [[Battle of Belgium]] and [[Battle of France]]. StG 2 remained with Luftflotte 2 during the [[Battle of Britain]] before transfering to southern Europe to participate in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]]. \n\nIn the south it mainly served in the [[Maritime interdiction]] role as it [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|bombarded Malta]] from January to March 1941. The wing then fought in the [[German invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Crete]] in April 1941 in the Martime, [[Air interdiction]], [[Offensive counter air|counter-air]] and [[close air support]] role alongside [[StG 1]], [[StG 3]] and [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 77|StG 77]]. The Ju 87 groups were successful in the [[Battle of Crete]], the final phase of the Greek campaign.\n\nElements of the wing fought in the [[North African Campaign]] until January 1942. The bulk of StG 2 fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] from 22 June 1941, after [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] began. It fought in support of all three Army Groups, and served in major battles such as the [[Siege of Leningrad]], [[Battle of Moscow]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1941 and 1942. \n\nStG 2 supported German forces in the [[Battle of Kursk]], one of the last major offensives on the Eastern Front in July 1943. The vulnerability of the Ju 87 and the loss of [[air superiority]] to the [[Red Air Force]], precluded any further large-scale use of the aircraft in the traditional dive-bombing role. In October 1943, the Ju 87 units were renamed ''Schlachtgeschwader'', battle wings, with a mixed number of Ju 87s and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s operating in the anti-tank role. \n\nStab., I., and III./StG 2 was renamed [[Schlachtgeschwader 2]] on the 18 October 1943, and ceased to exist. II./StG 2 continued, without redesignation to operate until January 1944, when its ''staffeln'' (squadrons) were renamed and equipped.\n\n==Background==\nThe dive-bomber is often associated with German aerial development in the [[Inter-war period|pre-war era]], but the type remained a low-priority for air planners who shaped the embryonic ''Luftwaffe''.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}} This apparent regression from the practices and experiences of [[World War I]] stemmed from the belief among the [[General Staff]] (''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'') that army support aviation in 1917\u20131918 was purely a reaction to [[trench warfare]].{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nGerman air doctrine remained rooted in the fundamentals of ''Operativer Luftkrieg'' (Operational Air War) which stressed [[interdiction]], [[strategic bombing]] (when and if possible) but primarily the [[air supremacy]] mission. The [[Spanish Civil War]] experience encouraged the General Staff to embrace the dive-bomber concept later in the 1930s, though the war's influence on German operational preferences remain ambiguous.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}} \n\nOn the eve of World War II, some German air planners regarded the dive-bomber as a strategic weapon to strike with precision at enemy industry. Even factored into the army support groups, only fifteen percent of ''Luftwaffe'' front-line strength contained specialist ground-attack aircraft in September 1939. The lack of specialist close support aircraft left the general-purpose dive-bomber, the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', most suited to the close support role.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\n===Formation===\n''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' 2 was formed on 1 May 1939 upon the establishment of all three ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppen]]''.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pp=81, 87, 91}} The [[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|''Stabsstaffel'']] (command unit) was formed at [[K\u00f6ln]]\u2013[[Ostheim]] on 15 October 1939. The stab unit was predominantly equipped with [[Dornier Do 17]] aircraft and a handful of Ju 87s for reconnaissance and personnel transport purposes. The ''Gruppen'' were equipped with the Ju 87 dive bomber.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=72}}\n\nThe wing's first commanding officer was [[Oskar Dinort]]. I./StG 2 was established in [[Breslau]] from I./StG 163.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=75}} II./StG 2 in [[S\u0142upsk|Stolp-Reitt]] from I./StG 162, and III./StG 2 from III./StG 163 in [[Bad Langensalza|Langensalza]].{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pP=82, 91}} Dinort led the wing and first ''Gruppe'' upon StG 2's creation. Dinort then relinquished command of I./StG 2 for control of Stab./StG 2. ''[[Hauptmann]]'' Ulrich Schmidt and Ernst Ott commanded the first and second ''Gruppen''. ''Hauptmann'' [[Hubertus Hitschhold]] succeeded Dinort mid-way through StG's first major campaign.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pp=75, 82, 91}}\n\nIn August 1939 Dinort moved I./StG 2 to Nieder-Ellguth under the ''Fliegerdivision'' 2 (Flying Division 2) subordinated to [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' 4]] (Air Fleet 4). 38 Ju 87s were available to Dinort, only one was non-operational. An additional three [[Dornier Do 17]]P reconnaissance aircraft were operational.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=75}} Ulrich Schmidt commanded 38 Ju 87s, all but two operational with three Do 17P aircraft. Based at Stolp-Reitz, Schmidt was subordinated to [[1st Air Division (Germany)|''Fliegerdivision'' 1]] (Flying Division) and [[Luftflotte 1|''Luftflotte'' 1]] (Air Fleet 1).{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=82}} III./StG 2 was assigned the same division and air fleet with second ''Gruppe''. 34 of 36 Ju 87s and the three Do 17Ps were available at Stolp-West, near Annafeld and [[Danzig]] by 1 September 1939.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=91}}\n\n==World War II==\n===Poland===\nOn 1 September 1939 the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' began the [[Invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]] followed sixteen days later by the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]].

Hozzel remarked that StG 2 had to abandon traditional dive-bombing in favour of improvised tactics;<blockquote>We had to do precision bombing to avoid danger to our troops entrenched too close to the target area. We could not risk making a dive-bombing attack from 4,000 metres because of the wide area of bomb dispersion. We had to fly a slant range attack, releasing bombs directly over the roofs. We had to push bombs directly into the target like loaves of bread into an oven, with one aircraft succeeding the other.{{sfn|Jones|2007|p=202}}</blockquote>\n\nThe heavy bombs employed by the ''Stukas'' were fitted with delayed-action fuses, and anti-tank warheads to penetrate roofs, buildings and bunkers.

During [[World War II]] and the [[Quit India Movement]] of 1942, a temporary ban on paint imports left only foreign companies and [[Shalimar Paints]] in the market. Asian Paints took up the market and reported annual turn over of {{INR}}23 [[crore]] in 1952 but with only 2% [[Profit Before Tax|PBT]] margin. By 1967, it became the leading paints manufacturer in the country.<ref name=\"Unusual\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UL3BDAAAQBAJ&pg=PP35&dq=%22asian+paints%22+plants&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv-ZGKhrTQAhWLMY8KHaG4ALA4ChDoAQgxMAA#v=onepage&q=%22asian%20paints%22%20plants&f=false |title= The Unusual Billionaires |author= Saurabh Mukherjea |publisher=Penguin UK |year=2016 |isbn=9789386057679}}</ref><ref name=\"Club\"/>\n\nThe four families together held the majority shares of the company. But disputes started over the global rights in 1990s when the company expanded beyond India. The disputes resulted in Choksi selling their 13.7% shares and exiting in 1997. Champaklal died in July 1997 and his son Atul took over. After failed collaboration talks with the British company [[Imperial Chemical Industries]], Choksi's shares were mutually bought by the remainder three family and [[Unit Trust of India]]. {{As of|2008}}, the Choksi, Dani and Vakil families hold a share of 47.81%.<ref name=\"Club\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YiLBD_IpgIkC&pg=PA211&dq=%22asian+paints%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0r5jggLTQAhXFPY8KHegQCuEQ6AEIRDAD#v=onepage&q=%22asian%20paints%22&f=false |title= India's Global Wealth Club: The Stunning Rise of Its Billionaires and Their Secrets of Success |publisher= John Wiley & Sons  |pp=211 |author=Geoff Hiscock |year= 2008 |isbn= 9780470822388 }}</ref>\n\n== Marketing and advertising ==\nIn 1950s, the company launched a \"washable [[Distemper (paint)|distemper]]\", which was a balance between the cheap dry distemper that peeled easily and the more expensive plastic emulsions.
