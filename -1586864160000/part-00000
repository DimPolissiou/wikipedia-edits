He didn't gain my confidence, nor did he build credibility with the financial community, Congress or his colleagues in the administration.\" Bush likewise, was unhappy that O'Neil was criticizing the President key economic policy of tax cuts behind his back. O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father [[George H. W. Bush]] had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist [[Larry Lindsey]] the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle, O'Neil did not take his removal professionally or well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms but Bush felt it was the right decision at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=George |first1=George W. |editor1-last=Desmond |editor1-first=Sean |title=Decision Points |date=2010 |publisher=Crown Publishing Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-59061-9 |pages=85-86}}</ref>                \n\n[[Ron Suskind]] interviewed O'Neill extensively about his tenure in the Bush Administration.

The book also details O'Neill's criticisms of some of Bush's economic policies. O'Neill claims that Bush appeared somewhat unquestioning and uncurious, and that the war in Iraq was planned from the first [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting, soon after the administration took office. At the first cabinet meeting of the new Bush administration, O'Neill observed that the debate was not \"should we attack Iraq?\" but rather \"how do we go about attacking Iraq?\" O'Neill viewed this as a violation of earlier guarantees that (then-presidential candidate) Bush would refrain from [[Nation-building|nation building]] endeavors during his time in office.<ref>[https://www.salon.com/2006/06/20/911pdb/ Ron Suskind, George W.

O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father [[George H. W. Bush]] had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist [[Larry Lindsey]] the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle, O'Neil did not take his removal professionally or well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms but Bush felt it was the right decision at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=George |first1=George W. |editor1-last=Desmond |editor1-first=Sean |title=Decision Points |date=2010 |publisher=Crown Publishing Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-59061-9 |pages=85-86 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>                \n\n[[Ron Suskind]] interviewed O'Neill extensively about his tenure in the Bush Administration. He was also given access to a large amount of documentation. In 2004 he produced the book ''[[The Price of Loyalty]]'', detailing O'Neill's tenure in the Bush Administration.<ref>''The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-5545-3}}) 2004</ref> The book describes many of the conflicts that O'Neill had with the Bush administration. The book also details O'Neill's criticisms of some of Bush's economic policies. O'Neill claims that Bush appeared somewhat unquestioning and uncurious, and that the war in Iraq was planned from the first [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting, soon after the administration took office. At the first cabinet meeting of the new Bush administration, O'Neill observed that the debate was not \"should we attack Iraq?\" but rather \"how do we go about attacking Iraq?\" O'Neill viewed this as a violation of earlier guarantees that (then-presidential candidate) Bush would refrain from [[Nation-building|nation building]] endeavors during his time in office.<ref>[https://www.salon.com/2006/06/20/911pdb/ Ron Suskind, George W.

{"title_page": "Cape Sable Island", "text_new": "{{distinguish|text=[[Sable Island]] in southeastern Nova Scotia, or [[Cape Sable]] in Florida}}\n\n'''Cape Sable Island''', locally referred to as '''Cape Island''', is a small [[Canada|Canadian]] island at the southernmost point of the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]].  It is sometimes confused with [[Sable Island]]. Historically, the [[Argyle, Nova Scotia]] region was known as Cape Sable and encompassed a much larger area than simply the island it does today. It extended from [[Cape Negro, Nova Scotia|Cape Negro]] (Baccaro) through [[Chebogue, Nova Scotia|Chebogue]].\n\nThe island is situated in [[Shelburne County]] south of [[Barrington Head, Nova Scotia|Barrington Head]], separated from the mainland by the narrow [[strait]] of [[Barrington Passage]], but has been connected since 1949 by a [[causeway]]. The largest community on the island is the town of [[Clark's Harbour]]. Other communities are listed below. At the extreme southern tip is Cape Sable.\n{{Location map|Canada Nova Scotia\n|width=220\n|lon_dir=W|lat_dir=N\n|lat_deg    = 43\n|lat_min    = 27\n|lat_sec    = 24.41\n|lon_deg    = 65\n|lon_min    = 36\n|lon_sec    = 50.86\n|caption    = Cape Sable Island in [[Nova Scotia]]\n}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Southern tip of Nova Scotia, showing Cape Sable Island.png|thumb|Southern tip of Nova Scotia, showing Cape Sable Island.]]\nCape Sable Island was inhabited by the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] who knew it as Kespoogwitk meaning \"land's end\".  It was first charted by explorers from [[Portugal]] who named it Beusablom, meaning \"Sandy Bay\".\n\n===French Colony===\nCape Sable and [[Cape Negro, Nova Scotia]] were first settled by the Acadians who migrated from [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal, Nova Scotia]] in 1620.<ref>M. A. MacDonald. Fortune and La Tour. Methuen Press. 1983.p.14</ref> The French governor of Acadia, [[Charles de Saint-\u00c9tienne de la Tour|Charles de la Tour]], colonized Cap de Sable giving it the present name, meaning Sandy Cape.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070504165156/http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/cap/places/page.asp?ID=108 ''Place Names of Nova Scotia'' Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management]</ref> La Tour built up a strong post at Cap de Sable beginning in 1623, called Fort Lomeron in honour of David Lomeron who was his agent in France. (The fur trading post called Fort Lomeron was later renamed Fort La Tour although identified as Fort Saint-Louis in the writings of Samuel de Champlain.) Here he carried on a sizable trade in furs with the Mi'kmaq and farmed the land.\n\nDuring the [[Anglo-French War (1627\u20131629)]], under [[Charles I of England|Charles 1]], by 1629 the [[David Kirke|Kirkes]] took [[Quebec City]], Sir James Stewart of Killeith, [[Lord Ochiltree]] planted a colony on [[Cape Breton Island]] at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia|Baleine]], and Alexander's son, [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling]] established the first incarnation of [[Nova Scotia|\"New Scotland\"]] at [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal, Nova Scotia]]. This set of British triumphs in what had otherwise been a disastrous war was not destined to last.  Charles 1's haste to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant that the new North American gains would be bargained away in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)]].<ref>Nichols, 2010. p. xix</ref>  There were three battles in Nova Scotia during the colonization of Scots: one at [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]]; another battle at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia|Balene]], Cape Breton; and one on Cape Sable Island.\n\n==== Siege of 1630 ====\nIn 1629, as a result of these Scottish victories, Cape Sable was the only major French holding in North America.<ref>Roger Sarty and Doug Knight. Saint John Fortifications: 1630-1956. New Brunswick Military Heritage Series. 2003. p. 18</ref>  There was a battle between Charles and his father at Fort St. Louis (See [http://ns1763.ca/shelbco/fortstlouis.html National Historic Site - Fort St. Louis]), the latter supporting the Scottish who had taken Port Royal. The battle lasted two days.  Claude was forced to withdraw in humiliation to Port Royal.<ref>Nicholls, 2010, p. 139</ref>\n\nAs a result, La Tour appealed to the King of France for assistance and was appointed lieutenant-general in Acadia in 1631.<ref>Roger Sarty and Doug Knight. Saint John Fortifications: 1630-1956. Goose Lane Editions. 2003. p. 18</ref>\n\nBy 1641, La Tour lost Cape Sable Island, Pentagouet ([[Castine, Maine]]), and [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] to Governor of Acadia [[Charles de Menou d'Aulnay]] de Charnisay.<ref>M. A. MacDonald. La Tour and Fortune. p. 89</ref>\n\nLa Tour retired to Cap de Sable with his third wife [http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/motin_jeanne_1E.html Jeanne Motin], wed in 1653, and died in 1666.<ref>{{cite DCB |title=Saint-\u00c9tienne de La Tour (Turgis), Charles de (1593\u20131666) |first=George |last=MacBeath |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/saint_etienne_de_la_tour_charles_de_1593_1666_1E.html}}</ref>\n\n===Father Rale's War===\nDuring [[Father Rale's War]], there were numerous attacks on New England fishing vessels. As an important landfall and base for seasonal New England fishing vessels working the rich fishing banks of Southwestern Nova Scotia, Cape Sable attracted several waves of pirate attacks in the [[Golden Age of Piracy]]. Pirates [[Ned Low]] and [[John Phillips (pirate)|John Phillips]] raided fishing vessels off Cape Sable and Phillips met his death off the Cape in 1723.<ref>[[Dan Conlin]], ''Pirates of the Atlantic'' (2009), Halifax: Formac Publishing, p. 34, 44, 52</ref>\n\nIn 1725 the British signed a treaty (or \"agreement\") with the Mi'kmaq of Cape Sable and other parts of Nova Scotia but the rights of the Mi'kmaq defined in it to hunt and fish on their lands have often been disputed by the authorities.<ref>[http://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf]</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nThe British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour.<ref>John Grenier, Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia 1710-1760. Oklahoma University Press. 2008</ref>  The Acadians and Mi'kmaq from Cape Sable Island raided the Protestants at [[Raid on Lunenburg (1756)|Lunenburg]], Nova Scotia numerous times.\n\nDuring the [[French and Indian War]], the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by [[Expulsion of the Acadians|deporting Acadians from Acadia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Stephen E.|chapter=Indian-White Relations in Nova Scotia, 1749-61: A Study in Political Interaction|editor1=P.A.

Foreign Protestants, University of Toronto, 1961, p. 504; Peter Landry. ''The Lion and the Lily'', Trafford Press. 2007.p. 555</ref>\n\nIn the late summer of 1758, the British launched three large offensives against the Acadians.  One was the [[St. John River Campaign]], another was the [[Petitcodiac River Campaign]], and the other was against the Acadians at Cape Sable Island. Major Henry Fletcher led the [[35th Regiment of Foot|35th Regiment]] and a company of [[Joseph Gorham]]'s Rangers to Cape Sable Island.  He cordoned off the cape and sent his men through it.  One hundred Acadians and Father Jean Baptiste de Gray surrendered, while about 130 Acadians and seven Mi'kmaq escaped. The Acadian prisoners were taken to [[Georges Island (Nova Scotia)|Georges Island]] in Halifax Harbour.<ref>John Grenier, ''The Far Reaches of Empire'', Oklahoma Press. 2008. p. 198</ref>\n\nEn route to the [[St. John River Campaign]] in September 1758, Moncton sent Major Roger Morris, in command of two men-of-war and transport ships with 325 soldiers, to deport more Acadians.  On October 28, his troops sent the women and children to Georges Island.  The men were kept behind and forced to work with troops to destroy their village.  On October 31, they were also sent to Halifax.<ref>Marshall, p. 98; see also Bell. ''Foreign Protestants''.  p. 512</ref>  In the spring of 1759, Joseph Gorham and his rangers arrived to take prisoner the remaining 151 Acadians. They reached Georges Island with them on June 29.<ref>Marshall, p. 98; Peter Landry. ''The Lion and the Lily,'' Trafford Press. 2007. p. 555</ref>\n\n===New England Planters===\nFollowing the [[Acadian Expulsion]] in the 1750s, the island was settled by the [[New England Planters]] from Cape Cod and nearby Nantucket Island.  The waters off southwestern Nova Scotia had been well known to them since the days of French settlement in the early 17th century.  While the tides of the Gulf of Maine may have brought a few exploring fishermen from Nantucket to the island, it was an entirely different tide that spawned the eventual permanent English settlement\u2014a political tide.\n\nMany Cape New Englanders took advantage of the offer of {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land to each male adult who would leave his home and live on those vacated lands in Atlantic Canada. Cape Sable Island was well known to Cape Cod fishermen and they moved north in 1760 to take advantage of a new life. The Cape Sable settlement soon became, and remains today, an important base for inshore fisheries. It is famous as the birthplace of the [[Cape Islander]] fishing boat, a motor fishing boat which emerged about 1905.<ref>[http://www.civilization.ca/hist/lifelines/linsc01e.html \"Nova Scotia Motorized Fishing Boats\"] by [[David A. Walker (marine consultant)|David A. Walker]]</ref> Ferry service provided transportation to the island in the early 20th century.  A [[causeway]] was eventually constructed for pedestrian and automobile traffic, opening on August 5, 1949. Today the [[lobster]] fishery is the island's biggest industry.\n\n=== American Revolution ===\n\n==== Raid on Cape Sable Island (1778) ====\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], on September 4, 1778, the light infantry company of the [[84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants)]], under the command of Cpt. [[Ranald MacKinnon]], was in the Raid of Cape Sable Island. American Privateers were threatening Cape Sable Island when the 84th Regiment arrived; they surprised the ship in the night and destroyed it.  For his aggressive action, MacKinnon was praised highly by Brigadier General [[Eyre Massey, 1st Baron Clarina|Eyre Massey]]. In response, one of his friends, Cpt. MacDonald, wrote to Major [[John Small (British Army officer)|John Small]], \"McKinnon was embarrassed by the praise of the General and requested it not be inserted in the record since he only did his duty.\"<ref>Kim Stacy (1994).

This traffic produced many shipwrecks such as the SS ''[[SS Hungarian|Hungarian]]'' in 1862 and the schooner ''[[Codseeker]]'' in 1877.\n\n==Climate==\nCape Sable Island has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), with significant continental influence. The surrounding waters result in cooler summers, but milder winters, with less snowfall, than the rest of Nova Scotia.  Summer temperatures are rather low, averaging only slightly above 10&nbsp;\u00b0C for four months, just enough to prevent the climate from being classified as subarctic ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfc'') or subpolar oceanic ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfc''). At the peak of summer, in late August and early September, daily average high temperatures barely reach 15\u00b0C. Winters are wet and windy, but warm for Atlantic Canada. Snowfall is moderately heavy, but winter brings less snow than in virtually all other locations in Atlantic Canada, which commonly average much more snow per winter season (for example, [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]] [283 cm] and [[St. John's, Newfoundland]] [335 cm]). Summers on Cape Sable Island are cool with much more stable weather when compared to winters. Due to surrounding cool ocean waters, summer thunderstorms are very rare, but low clouds and fog are common. The strong influence of the Atlantic Ocean also produces exceptionally strong [[seasonal lag]]. On average, the coldest month is February, while the warmest month is September, coming in slightly warmer than August, and October is much warmer than June. The same pattern appears in nearby [[Clark's Harbour]].\n\nThe island lies in the path of [[Nor'easter]]s, which reach maximum frequency and intensity in winter, meaning this area's wettest months on average are December and January. Tropical weather systems, including, rarely, [[hurricanes]] can occur occasionally, generally entering the area from the south or southwest, with the greatest risk in September and October. Cape Sable Island is also prone to bouts of thick fog. Over the years the Cape's storms, and the close proximity of the island to shipping routes, has led to a substantial number of shipwrecks.

The island is a notable [[birdwatching|birding]] destination, being an important [[bird migration|migratory]] stopping point for birds such as the Atlantic [[brent goose|brant]] and [[piping plover]]. It is this unique climate, its abundant tidal marshes and the island's geographical location on the north-south flight path of numerous migratory water fowl that has given it the international designation as an [[Important Bird Area]].  The annual brant geese fly-by during March and April is developing into a local birding event. The tens of thousands of brant make their spectacular fly by at dusk after spending the day feeding in local marshes.  They spend the night bobbing in the Atlantic to the east of the island.<ref>[http://www.bsc-eoc.org/iba/site.jsp?siteID=NS016 Important Bird Areas of Canada page for Cape Sable Island] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311181735/http://www.bsc-eoc.org/iba/site.jsp?siteID=NS016 |date=March 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cape Islander]]\n\n==References==\n\nTexts\n*Nicholls, Andrew.

It is sometimes confused with [[Sable Island]]. Historically, the [[Argyle, Nova Scotia]] region was known as Cape Sable and encompassed a much larger area than simply the island it does today. It extended from [[Cape Negro, Nova Scotia|Cape Negro]] (Baccaro) through [[Chebogue, Nova Scotia|Chebogue]].\n\nThe island is situated in [[Shelburne County]] south of [[Barrington Head, Nova Scotia|Barrington Head]], separated from the mainland by the narrow [[strait]] of [[Barrington Passage]], but has been connected since 1949 by a [[causeway]]. The largest community on the island is the town of [[Clark's Harbour]]. Other communities are listed below. At the extreme southern tip is Cape Sable.\n{{Location map|Canada Nova Scotia\n|width=220\n|lon_dir=W|lat_dir=N\n|lat_deg    = 43\n|lat_min    = 27\n|lat_sec    = 24.41\n|lon_deg    = 65\n|lon_min    = 36\n|lon_sec    = 50.86\n|caption    = Cape Sable Island in [[Nova Scotia]]\n}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Southern tip of Nova Scotia, showing Cape Sable Island.png|thumb|Southern tip of Nova Scotia, showing Cape Sable Island.]]\nCape Sable Island was inhabited by the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] who knew it as Kespoogwitk meaning \"land's end\".  It was first charted by explorers from [[Portugal]] who named it Beusablom, meaning \"Sandy Bay\".\n\n===French Colony===\nCape Sable and [[Cape Negro, Nova Scotia]] were first settled by the Acadians who migrated from [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal, Nova Scotia]] in 1620.<ref>M. A. MacDonald. Fortune and La Tour. Methuen Press. 1983.p.14</ref> The French governor of Acadia, [[Charles de Saint-\u00c9tienne de la Tour|Charles de la Tour]], colonized Cap de Sable giving it the present name, meaning Sandy Cape.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070504165156/http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/cap/places/page.asp?ID=108 ''Place Names of Nova Scotia'' Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management]</ref> La Tour built up a strong post at Cap de Sable beginning in 1623, called Fort Lomeron in honour of David Lomeron who was his agent in France. (The fur trading post called Fort Lomeron was later renamed Fort La Tour although identified as Fort Saint-Louis in the writings of Samuel de Champlain.) Here he carried on a sizable trade in furs with the Mi'kmaq and farmed the land.\n\nDuring the [[Anglo-French War (1627\u20131629)]], under [[Charles I of England|Charles 1]], by 1629 the [[David Kirke|Kirkes]] took [[Quebec City]], Sir James Stewart of Killeith, [[Lord Ochiltree]] planted a colony on [[Cape Breton Island]] at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia|Baleine]], and Alexander's son, [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling]] established the first incarnation of [[Nova Scotia|\"New Scotland\"]] at [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal, Nova Scotia]]. This set of British triumphs in what had otherwise been a disastrous war was not destined to last.  Charles 1's haste to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant that the new North American gains would be bargained away in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)]].<ref>Nichols, 2010. p. xix</ref>  There were three battles in Nova Scotia during the colonization of Scots: one at [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]]; another battle at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia|Balene]], Cape Breton; and one on Cape Sable Island.\n\n==== Siege of 1630 ====\nIn 1629, as a result of these Scottish victories, Cape Sable was the only major French holding in North America.<ref>Roger Sarty and Doug Knight. Saint John Fortifications: 1630-1956. New Brunswick Military Heritage Series. 2003. p. 18</ref>  There was a battle between Charles and his father at Fort St. Louis (See [http://ns1763.ca/shelbco/fortstlouis.html National Historic Site - Fort St. Louis]), the latter supporting the Scottish who had taken Port Royal. The battle lasted two days.  Claude was forced to withdraw in humiliation to Port Royal.<ref>Nicholls, 2010, p. 139</ref>\n\nAs a result, La Tour appealed to the King of France for assistance and was appointed lieutenant-general in Acadia in 1631.<ref>Roger Sarty and Doug Knight.

As an important landfall and base for seasonal New England fishing vessels working the rich fishing banks of Southwestern Nova Scotia, Cape Sable attracted several waves of pirate attacks in the [[Golden Age of Piracy]]. Pirates [[Ned Low]] and [[John Phillips (pirate)|John Phillips]] raided fishing vessels off Cape Sable and Phillips met his death off the Cape in 1723.<ref>[[Dan Conlin]], ''Pirates of the Atlantic'' (2009), Halifax: Formac Publishing, p. 34, 44, 52</ref>\n\nIn 1725 the British signed a treaty (or \"agreement\") with the Mi'kmaq of Cape Sable and other parts of Nova Scotia but the rights of the Mi'kmaq defined in it to hunt and fish on their lands have often been disputed by the authorities.<ref>[http://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf]</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nThe British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour.<ref>John Grenier, Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia 1710-1760. Oklahoma University Press. 2008</ref>  The Acadians and Mi'kmaq from Cape Sable Island raided the Protestants at [[Raid on Lunenburg (1756)|Lunenburg]], Nova Scotia numerous times.\n\nDuring the [[French and Indian War]], the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by [[Expulsion of the Acadians|deporting Acadians from Acadia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Stephen E.|chapter=Indian-White Relations in Nova Scotia, 1749-61: A Study in Political Interaction|editor1=P.A.

Foreign Protestants, University of Toronto, 1961, p. 504; Peter Landry. ''The Lion and the Lily'', Trafford Press. 2007.p. 555</ref>\n\nIn the late summer of 1758, the British launched three large offensives against the Acadians.  One was the [[St. John River Campaign]], another was the [[Petitcodiac River Campaign]], and the other was against the Acadians at Cape Sable Island. Major Henry Fletcher led the [[35th Regiment of Foot|35th Regiment]] and a company of [[Joseph Gorham]]'s Rangers to Cape Sable Island.  He cordoned off the cape and sent his men through it.  One hundred Acadians and Father Jean Baptiste de Gray surrendered, while about 130 Acadians and seven Mi'kmaq escaped. The Acadian prisoners were taken to [[Georges Island (Nova Scotia)|Georges Island]] in Halifax Harbour.<ref>John Grenier, ''The Far Reaches of Empire'', Oklahoma Press. 2008. p. 198</ref>\n\nEn route to the [[St. John River Campaign]] in September 1758, Moncton sent Major Roger Morris, in command of two men-of-war and transport ships with 325 soldiers, to deport more Acadians.  On October 28, his troops sent the women and children to Georges Island.  The men were kept behind and forced to work with troops to destroy their village.  On October 31, they were also sent to Halifax.<ref>Marshall, p. 98; see also Bell. ''Foreign Protestants''.  p. 512</ref>  In the spring of 1759, Joseph Gorham and his rangers arrived to take prisoner the remaining 151 Acadians. They reached Georges Island with them on June 29.<ref>Marshall, p. 98; Peter Landry. ''The Lion and the Lily,'' Trafford Press. 2007. p. 555</ref>\n\n===New England Planters===\nFollowing the [[Acadian Expulsion]] in the 1750s, the island was settled by the [[New England Planters]] from Cape Cod and nearby Nantucket Island.  The waters off southwestern Nova Scotia had been well known to them since the days of French settlement in the early 17th century.  While the tides of the Gulf of Maine may have brought a few exploring fishermen from Nantucket to the island, it was an entirely different tide that spawned the eventual permanent English settlement\u2014a political tide.\n\nMany Cape New Englanders took advantage of the offer of {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land to each male adult who would leave his home and live on those vacated lands in Atlantic Canada. Cape Sable Island was well known to Cape Cod fishermen and they moved north in 1760 to take advantage of a new life. The Cape Sable settlement soon became, and remains today, an important base for inshore fisheries. It is famous as the birthplace of the [[Cape Islander]] fishing boat, a motor fishing boat which emerged about 1905.<ref>[http://www.civilization.ca/hist/lifelines/linsc01e.html \"Nova Scotia Motorized Fishing Boats\"] by [[David A. Walker (marine consultant)|David A. Walker]]</ref> Ferry service provided transportation to the island in the early 20th century.  A [[causeway]] was eventually constructed for pedestrian and automobile traffic, opening on August 5, 1949. Today the [[lobster]] fishery is the island's biggest industry.\n\n=== American Revolution ===\n\n==== Raid on Cape Sable Island (1778) ====\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], on September 4, 1778, the light infantry company of the [[84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants)]], under the command of Cpt. [[Ranald MacKinnon]], was in the Raid of Cape Sable Island. American Privateers were threatening Cape Sable Island when the 84th Regiment arrived; they surprised the ship in the night and destroyed it.  For his aggressive action, MacKinnon was praised highly by Brigadier General [[Eyre Massey, 1st Baron Clarina|Eyre Massey]]. In response, one of his friends, Cpt. MacDonald, wrote to Major [[John Small (British Army officer)|John Small]], \"McKinnon was embarrassed by the praise of the General and requested it not be inserted in the record since he only did his duty.\"<ref>Kim Stacy (1994). ''No One harms me with impunity - the History, Organization and Biographies of the 84th Highland Regiment (Royal Highland Emigrants) and Young Royal Highlanders during the Revolutionary War 1775-1784''.

This traffic produced many shipwrecks such as the SS ''[[SS Hungarian|Hungarian]]'' in 1862 and the schooner ''[[Codseeker]]'' in 1877.\n\n==Climate==\nCape Sable Island has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), with significant continental influence. The surrounding waters result in cooler summers, but milder winters, with less snowfall, than the rest of Nova Scotia.  Summer temperatures are rather low, averaging only slightly above 10&nbsp;\u00b0C for four months, just enough to prevent the climate from being classified as subarctic ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfc'') or subpolar oceanic ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfc''). At the peak of summer, in late August and early September, daily average high temperatures barely reach 15\u00b0C. Winters are wet and windy, but warm for Atlantic Canada. Snowfall is moderately heavy, but winter brings less snow than in virtually all other locations in Atlantic Canada, which commonly average much more snow per winter season (for example, [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]] (283 cm) and [[St. John's, Newfoundland]] (335 cm). Summers on Cape Sable Island are cool with much more stable weather when compared to winters. Due to surrounding cool ocean waters, summer thunderstorms are very rare, but low clouds and fog are common. The strong influence of the Atlantic Ocean also produces exceptionally strong [[seasonal lag]]. On average, the coldest month is February, while the warmest month is September, coming in slightly warmer than August, and October is much warmer than June. The same pattern appears in nearby [[Clark's Harbour]].\n\nThe island lies in the path of [[Nor'easter]]s, which reach maximum frequency and intensity in winter, meaning this area's wettest months on average are December and January. Tropical weather systems, including, rarely, [[hurricanes]] can occur occasionally, generally entering the area from the south or southwest, with the greatest risk in September and October. Cape Sable Island is also prone to bouts of thick fog. Over the years the Cape's storms, and the close proximity of the island to shipping routes, has led to a substantial number of shipwrecks. The most tragic was the wreck of the SS ''Hungarian'' in February 1860 with the loss of over 200 lives. A [[lighthouse]] was established at the tip of Cape Sable in the next year.<ref>[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/wrecks/wrecks/shipwrecks.asp?ID=2197 \"SS Hungarian\" Nova Scotia Museum Marine Heritage Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713102225/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/wrecks/wrecks/shipwrecks.asp?ID=2197 |date=2007-07-13 }}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Cape Sable Island\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 12.0\n|Feb record high C = 12.0\n|Mar record high C = 14.0\n|Apr record high C = 16.0\n|May record high C = 18.9\n|Jun record high C = 22.8\n|Jul record high C = 24.0\n|Aug record high C = 24.0\n|Sep record high C = 23.9\n|Oct record high C = 22.0\n|Nov record high C = 17.2\n|Dec record high C = 13.9\n|year record high C =  24.0\n|Jan high C = 1.4\n|Feb high C = 0.7\n|Mar high C = 3.0\n|Apr high C = 5.7\n|May high C = 8.8\n|Jun high C = 12.0\n|Jul high C = 13.8\n|Aug high C = 14.9\n|Sep high C = 15.1\n|Oct high C = 12.3\n|Nov high C = 8.7\n|Dec high C = 4.6\n|year high C = 8.4\n|Jan mean C = \u22121.6\n|Feb mean C = \u22122.1\n|Mar mean C = 0.6\n|Apr mean C = 3.6\n|May mean C = 6.8\n|Jun mean C = 9.7\n|Jul mean C = 11.3\n|Aug mean C = 12.4\n|Sep mean C = 12.7\n|Oct mean C = 10.0\n|Nov mean C = 6.2\n|Dec mean C = 1.4\n|year mean C = 5.9\n|Jan low C = -4.8\n|Feb low C = -5.0\n|Mar low C = -1.9\n|Apr low C = 1.4\n|May low C = 4.6\n|Jun low C = 7.3\n|Jul low C = 8.7\n|Aug low C = 9.9\n|Sep low C = 10.3\n|Oct low C = 7.6\n|Nov low C = 3.6\n|Dec low C = -1.8\n|year low C = 3.3\n|Jan record low C = -17.2\n|Feb record low C = -18.3\n|Mar record low C = -14.5\n|Apr record low C = -6.7\n|May record low C = -1.1\n|Jun record low C = 2.8\n|Jul record low C = 5.0\n|Aug record low C = 5.6\n|Sep record low C = 0.6\n|Oct record low C = -3.0\n|Nov record low C = -7.8\n|Dec record low C = -19.0\n|year record low C = -19.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 140.4\n|Feb precipitation mm = 112.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 104.8\n|Apr precipitation mm = 98.7\n|May precipitation mm = 86.4\n|Jun precipitation mm = 76.2\n|Jul precipitation mm = 68.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 104.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 73.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 89.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 122.2\n|Dec precipitation mm = 139.6\n|year precipitation mm = 1217.1\n|rain colour=green\n|Jan rain mm = 86.5\n|Feb rain mm = 71.5\n|Mar rain mm = 83.5\n|Apr rain mm = 94.6\n|May rain mm = 86.1\n|Jun rain mm = 76.2\n|Jul rain mm = 68.3\n|Aug rain mm = 104.6\n|Sep rain mm = 73.4\n|Oct rain mm = 89.1\n|Nov rain mm = 120.8\n|Dec rain mm = 113.3\n|year rain mm = 1067.9\n|Jan snow cm = 53.9\n|Feb snow cm = 41.2\n|Mar snow cm = 21.2\n|Apr snow cm = 4.2\n|May snow cm = 0.3\n|Jun snow cm = 0\n|Jul snow cm = 0\n|Aug snow cm = 0\n|Sep snow cm = 0\n|Oct snow cm = 0.7\n|Nov snow cm = 1.3\n|Dec snow cm = 26.3\n|year snow cm = 149.0\n|unit precipitation days= 0.2 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 17\n|Feb precipitation days = 13\n|Mar precipitation days = 12\n|Apr precipitation days = 11\n|May precipitation days = 10\n|Jun precipitation days = 10\n|Jul precipitation days = 9\n|Aug precipitation days = 9\n|Sep precipitation days = 8\n|Oct precipitation days = 10\n|Nov precipitation days = 13\n|Dec precipitation days = 16\n|year precipitation days= 138\n|unit rain days= 0.2 mm\n|Jan rain days = 8\n|Feb rain days = 6\n|Mar rain days = 9\n|Apr rain days = 10\n|May rain days = 10\n|Jun rain days = 10\n|Jul rain days = 9\n|Aug rain days = 9\n|Sep rain days = 8\n|Oct rain days = 10\n|Nov rain days = 13\n|Dec rain days = 11\n|year rain days= 112\n|unit snow days= 0.2 cm\n|Jan snow days = 11\n|Feb snow days = 8\n|Mar snow days = 5\n|Apr snow days = 1\n|May snow days = 0 <!--Trace amounts-->\n|Jun snow days = 0\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 0\n|Oct snow days = 0 <!--Trace amounts-->\n|Nov snow days = 0 <!--Trace amounts-->\n|Dec snow days = 6\n|year snow days= 32\n|source 1 = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name = CCN>{{cite web\n| url= http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1961_1990_e.html?stnID=1534&prov=NS&lang=e&province=NS&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12\n| title= Canadian Climate Normals 1961-1990\n| publisher= Environment Canada\n| accessdate= November 23, 2012}}</ref>\n|date= November 2012\n}}\n\n==Residents==\n\nIn spite of what might seem to have been major deterrents to permanent settlement{{what|date=April 2020}}, many residents came and stayed{{who|date=April 2020}}.

The island is a notable [[birdwatching|birding]] destination, being an important [[bird migration|migratory]] stopping point for birds such as the Atlantic [[brent goose|brant]] and [[piping plover]]. It is this unique climate, its abundant tidal marshes and the island's geographical location on the north-south flight path of numerous migratory water fowl that has given it the international designation as an [[Important Bird Area]].  The annual brant geese fly-by during March and April is developing into a local birding event. The tens of thousands of brant make their spectacular fly by at dusk after spending the day feeding in local marshes.  They spend the night bobbing in the Atlantic to the east of the island.<ref>[http://www.bsc-eoc.org/iba/site.jsp?siteID=NS016 Important Bird Areas of Canada page for Cape Sable Island] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311181735/http://www.bsc-eoc.org/iba/site.jsp?siteID=NS016 |date=March 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cape Islander]]\n\n==References==\n\nTexts\n*Nicholls, Andrew.

The [[exponential distribution]], [[Erlang distribution]], and [[chi-squared distribution]] are special cases of the gamma distribution.  There are three different [[Statistical parameter|parametrization]]s in common use:\n#With a [[shape parameter]] ''k'' and a [[scale parameter]] ''\u03b8''.\n#With a shape parameter {{nowrap|1=''\u03b1'' = ''k''}} and an inverse scale parameter {{nowrap|1=''\u03b2'' = 1/''\u03b8''}}, called a [[rate parameter]].\n#With a shape parameter ''k'' and a mean parameter {{nowrap|1=''\u03bc'' = ''k\u03b8'' = ''\u03b1''/''\u03b2''}}.\nIn each of these three forms, both parameters are positive real numbers.\n\nThe gamma distribution is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] (both with respect to a uniform base measure and with respect to a 1/''x'' base measure) for a random variable ''X'' for which '''E'''[''X''] = ''k\u03b8'' = ''\u03b1''/''\u03b2'' is fixed and greater than zero, and '''E'''[ln(''X'')] = ''\u03c8''(''k'') + ln(''\u03b8'') = ''\u03c8''(''\u03b1'') \u2212 ln(''\u03b2'') is fixed (''\u03c8'' is the [[digamma function]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=Sung Y. |last2=Bera |first2=Anil K. |year=2009 |title=Maximum entropy autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model |journal=Journal of Econometrics |volume=150 |issue=2 |pages=219\u2013230 |url=http://www.wise.xmu.edu.cn/Master/Download/..%5C..%5CUploadFiles%5Cpaper-masterdownload%5C2009519932327055475115776.pdf |accessdate=2011-06-02 |doi=10.1016/j.jeconom.2008.12.014 |citeseerx=10.1.1.511.9750 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307144515/http://wise.xmu.edu.cn/uploadfiles/paper-masterdownload/2009519932327055475115776.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nThe parameterization with ''k'' and ''\u03b8'' appears to be more common in [[econometrics]] and certain other applied fields, where for example the gamma distribution is frequently used to model waiting times.

Using the fact that a Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) distribution is the same as an Exp(1) distribution, and noting the method of [[exponential distribution#Generating exponential variates|generating exponential variables]], we conclude that if ''U'' is [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on (0, 1], then \u2212ln(''U'') is distributed Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) (i.e. [[inverse transform sampling]]). Now, using the \"''\u03b1''-addition\" property of gamma distribution, we expand this result:\n\n: <math>-\\sum_{k=1}^n \\ln U_k \\sim \\Gamma(n, 1)</math>\n\nwhere ''U''<sub>''k''</sub> are all uniformly distributed on (0, 1] and [[statistical independence|independent]].

Using the fact that a Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) distribution is the same as an Exp(1) distribution, and noting the method of [[exponential distribution#Generating exponential variates|generating exponential variables]], we conclude that if ''U'' is [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on (0, 1], then \u2212ln(''U'') is distributed Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) (i.e. [[inverse transform sampling]]). Now, using the \"''\u03b1''-addition\" property of gamma distribution, we expand this result:\n\n: <math>-\\sum_{k=1}^n \\ln U_k \\sim \\Gamma(n, 1)</math>\n\nwhere ''U''<sub>''k''</sub> are all uniformly distributed on (0, 1] and [[statistical independence|independent]].
