This has triggered contesting theories about authenticity and how the canonical text of Sikhism evolved over time. There are five views:<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA125 |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|pages=125\u2013128}};<br>For a more comprehensive discussion of these theories and evidence, see: {{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh|title=The Guru Granth Sahib: Canon, Meaning and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiwpDwAAQBAJ| year=2003|publisher =Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-908773-0}}</ref>\n*The first view held by scholars such as Balwant Singh Dhillon states that there was a consistent \"mother tradition\", where the hymns of Guru Nanak were carefully preserved as a single codex without any corruption or unauthorized changes, to which the later Gurus added additional hymns. The Sikh scripture developed in linear, pure form becoming first the Adi Granth and finally the closed version of the Guru Granth Sahib. According to this view, there were no pre-canonical diversity, the scripture developed in an organized and disciplined format, and it denies the existence of alternate hymns and texts that were cherished by Sikhs of an earlier era.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The second view held by scholars such as Gurinder Singh Mann states that the scripture started from a single process, proceeded linearly, then diversified into separate textual traditions with some variations, over time. This school of scholars supports their theory by highlighting the similarities of the manuscripts and close match particularly between the three manuscripts called the Guru Har Sahai MS, the Govindval MS, and the Guru Nanak Dev University MS 1245.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> This theory is weakened by variations observed in 27 manuscript variants now dated between 1642 and 1692. The alternate formulation of this theory states that two branches developed over time, with the Peshawar pothi and Kartarpur pothi being the two branches.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The third view held by scholars such as Piar Singh states that independent versions of the Sikh scripture developed in geographically distant regions of the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> These versions developed because of the forgetfulness or creativity of the local Sikh leaders, errors made by scribes, attempts to adopt popular hymns of bhagats or adapt the hymns to local regional languages where Gurmukhi was not understood. It is these manuscripts that Guru Arjan collected and considered, then edited to produce an approved version of the Adi Granth. The Sikh scripture, according to this school, was thus a collaborative effort and there was no authentic version of the pre-canonical text in Sikhism.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The fourth view builds upon this third view and is supported by scholars such as Jeevan Deol. According to this view, there were independent textual traditions in Sikhism before Guru Arjan decided to edit and redact them into the Adi Granth.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> These textual traditions developed in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, greatly influenced by the popularity of regional bhagats and their [[Bhakti movement]] ideas about ''nirguna'' and ''saguna'' forms of the divine, with Guru Arjan favoring the ''nirgun'' versions. The Adi Granth reflects the review, editing and compilation of complex and diverse textual traditions before him.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The fifth view held by scholars such as Pashaura Singh develops and refines the fourth view. It states that the Sikh scripture emerged from a collaborative effort of Guru Arjan and his trusted associates, particularly Bhai Gurdas and Jagana Brahmin of Agra. His collaborators were his devout admirers, well versed in the Sikh thought, Sanskrit traditions and philosophical schools of Indian religions.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\"/> The variant manuscripts support this theory, as does the handwriting analysis of the Kartarpur bir (manuscript) approved by Guru Arjan which shows at least four distinct scribal styles.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\"/> The variations in the manuscripts also affirm that the ''Adi Granth'' did not develop in a linear way, i.e. it was not simply copied from a previous version.<ref name=\"MannMann2001p33\"/><ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

McLeod, the difference in the two versions can be because of three possibilities, from which he withholds judgment:<ref>W.H. McLeod (1979), ''The Sikh scriptures: Some Issues'', in Sikh Studies: Comparative Perspectives on a Changing Tradition by Mark Jurgensmeyer and N Gerald Barrier (editors), University of California Press, Berkeley Religious Studies Series and Theological Union, pages 101\u2013103</ref> first, Guru Arjan deliberately left the blank folio pages to complete it later, but was unable to because he was arrested and executed by the Mughal emperor [[Jehangir]]; second, the hymn and pages existed in the original manuscript, the Banno bir is older, the pages were removed by Khalsa Sikhs from the Kartarpur manuscript and replaced with blank folios in their attempt to carve out a separate Sikh identity from the Hindus during the Singh Sabha Movement; third, the blank pages were intentionally left by Guru Arjan for unknown reasons, and the complete hymn in the Banno bir is an interpolation added by a Sikh follower who wanted to insert Brahminical rites-of-passage rituals in the text. According to G.B. Singh \u2013 a Sikh scholar who pioneered study of the early Sikh manuscripts, the evidence supports the second theory.<ref name=kanpur1/><ref>G.B.

This has triggered contesting theories about authenticity and how the canonical text of Sikhism evolved over time. There are five views:<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA125 |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|pages=125\u2013128}};<br>For a more comprehensive discussion of these theories and evidence, see: {{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh|title=The Guru Granth Sahib: Canon, Meaning and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiwpDwAAQBAJ| year=2003|publisher =Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-908773-0}}</ref>\n*The first view held by scholars such as Balwant Singh Dhillon states that there was a consistent \"mother tradition\", where the hymns of Guru Nanak were carefully preserved as a single codex without any corruption or unauthorized changes, to which the later Gurus added additional hymns. The Sikh scripture developed in linear, pure form becoming first the Adi Granth and finally the closed version of the Guru Granth Sahib. According to this view, there were no pre-canonical diversity, the scripture developed in an organized and disciplined format, and it denies the existence of alternate hymns and texts that were cherished by Sikhs of an earlier era.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The second view held by scholars such as Gurinder Singh Mann states that the scripture started from a single process, proceeded linearly, then diversified into separate textual traditions with some variations, over time. This school of scholars supports their theory by highlighting the similarities of the manuscripts and close match particularly between the three manuscripts called the Guru Har Sahai MS, the Govindval MS, and the Guru Nanak Dev University MS 1245.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> This theory is weakened by variations observed in 27 manuscript variants now dated between 1642 and 1692. The alternate formulation of this theory states that two branches developed over time, with the Peshawar pothi and Kartarpur pothi being the two branches.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The third view held by scholars such as Piar Singh states that independent versions of the Sikh scripture developed in geographically distant regions of the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> These versions developed because of the forgetfulness or creativity of the local Sikh leaders, errors made by scribes, attempts to adopt popular hymns of bhagats or adapt the hymns to local regional languages where Gurmukhi was not understood. It is these manuscripts that Guru Arjan collected and considered, then edited to produce an approved version of the Adi Granth. The Sikh scripture, according to this school, was thus a collaborative effort and there was no authentic version of the pre-canonical text in Sikhism.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The fourth view builds upon this third view and is supported by scholars such as Jeevan Deol. According to this view, there were independent textual traditions in Sikhism before Guru Arjan decided to edit and redact them into the Adi Granth.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> These textual traditions developed in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, greatly influenced by the popularity of regional bhagats and their [[Bhakti movement]] ideas about ''nirguna'' and ''saguna'' forms of the divine, with Guru Arjan favoring the ''nirgun'' versions. The Adi Granth reflects the review, editing and compilation of complex and diverse textual traditions before him.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The fifth view held by scholars such as Pashaura Singh develops and refines the fourth view. It states that the Sikh scripture emerged from a collaborative effort of Guru Arjan and his trusted associates, particularly Bhai Gurdas and Jagana Brahmin of Agra. His collaborators were his devout admirers, well versed in the Sikh thought, Sanskrit traditions and philosophical schools of Indian religions.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\"/> The variant manuscripts support this theory, as does the handwriting analysis of the Kartarpur bir (manuscript) approved by Guru Arjan which shows at least four distinct scribal styles.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\"/> The variations in the manuscripts also affirm that the ''Adi Granth'' did not develop in a linear way, i.e. it was not simply copied from a previous version.<ref name=\"MannMann2001p33\"/><ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.
