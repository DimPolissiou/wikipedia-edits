Milgrom noted that this discrepancy could be resolved if the [[gravitational force]] experienced by a star in the outer regions of a galaxy was proportional to the square of its centripetal [[acceleration]] (as opposed to the centripetal acceleration itself, as in [[Newton's second law]]), or alternatively if gravitational force came to vary inversely with radius (as opposed to the inverse square of the radius, as in [[Newton's law of gravity]]). In MOND, violation of Newton's laws occurs at extremely small accelerations, characteristic of galaxies yet far below anything typically encountered in the [[Solar System]] or on Earth.\n\n{{unsolved|physics|\n* What is the nature of [[dark matter]]?

This observation necessitates at least one of the following: 1) There exists in galaxies large quantities of unseen matter which boosts the stars' velocities beyond what would be expected on the basis of the visible mass alone, or 2) Newton's Laws do not apply to galaxies. The former leads to the dark matter hypothesis; the latter leads to MOND.\n\n[[Image:Milgrom Mordechai.jpg|thumb|upright 1.0| MOND was proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1983]]\n\nThe basic premise of MOND is that while Newton's laws have been extensively tested in high-acceleration environments (in the Solar System and on Earth), they have not been verified for objects with extremely low acceleration, such as stars in the outer parts of galaxies. This led Milgrom to postulate a new effective gravitational force law (sometimes referred to as \"Milgrom's law\") that relates the true acceleration of an object to the acceleration that would be predicted for it on the basis of Newtonian mechanics.<ref name=\"Milgrom papers\"/> This law, the keystone of MOND, is chosen to reduce to the Newtonian result at high acceleration but leads to different (\"deep-MOND\") behaviour at low acceleration:\n\n{{NumBlk|::|<math> F_N = m \\mu \\left( \\frac{a}{a_0} \\right) a. </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nHere ''F<sub>N</sub>'' is the Newtonian force, ''m'' is the object's (gravitational) [[mass]], ''a'' is its acceleration, ''\u03bc''(''x'') is an as-yet unspecified function (known as the \"interpolating function\"), and ''a''<sub>0</sub> is a new fundamental constant which marks the transition between the Newtonian and deep-MOND regimes. Agreement with Newtonian mechanics requires \n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\mu(x) \\to 1 && \\text{for } x \\gg 1, \\end{align}</math>\n\nand consistency with astronomical observations requires\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\mu(x) \\to x && \\text{for } x \\ll 1. \\end{align}</math>\n\nBeyond these limits, the interpolating function is not specified by the hypothesis, although it is possible to weakly constrain it empirically.<ref>G. Gentile, B. Famaey, W.J.G. de Blok (2011). \"THINGS about MOND\", Astron. Astrophys. '''527''', A76. {{arxiv|1011.4148}}</ref><ref>B. Famaey, J. Binney (2005), \"Modified Newtonian Dynamics in the Milky Way\", MNRAS, {{arxiv|astro-ph/0506723}}</ref> Two common choices are the \"simple interpolating function\":\n\n:<math> \\mu \\left( \\frac{a}{a_0} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{a_0}{a}},</math>\n\nand the \"standard interpolating function\":\n\n:<math> \\mu \\left( \\frac{a}{a_0} \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_0}{a}\\right)^2}}.</math>\n\nThus, in the deep-MOND regime (''a'' \u226a ''a''<sub>0</sub>):\n\n:<math> F_N = m \\frac{a^2}{a_0}. </math>\n\nApplying this to an object of mass ''m'' in [[circular orbit]] around a point mass ''M'' (a crude approximation for a star in the outer regions of a galaxy), we find:\n\n{{NumBlk|::|<math> \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \\frac{\\left( \\frac{v^2}{r} \\right)^2}{a_0} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad v^4 = G M a_0 </math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nthat is, the star's rotation velocity is independent of ''r'', its distance from the centre of the galaxy \u2013 the rotation curve is flat, as required. By fitting his law to rotation curve data, Milgrom found <math>a_0 \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{ms}^{-2}</math> to be optimal. This simple law is sufficient to make predictions for a broad range of galactic phenomena.\n\nMilgrom's law can be interpreted in two different ways. One possibility is to treat it as a modification to the classical [[law of inertia]] (Newton's second law), so that the force on an object is not proportional to the particle's acceleration ''a'' but rather to <math>\\mu\\left(\\frac{a}{a_0}\\right)a</math>. In this case, the modified dynamics would apply not only to gravitational phenomena, but also those generated by other [[forces]], for example [[electromagnetism]].<ref>M. Milgrom, \"MOND - Particularly as Modified Inertia\", {{arxiv|1111.1611}}</ref> Alternatively, Milgrom's law can be viewed as leaving Newton's Second Law intact and instead modifying the inverse-square law of gravity, so that the true gravitational force on an object of mass ''m'' due to another of mass ''M'' is roughly of the form\n\n:<math> \\frac{GMm}{\\mu \\left (\\frac{a}{a_0} \\right ) r^2}.</math>\n\nIn this interpretation, Milgrom's modification would apply exclusively to gravitational phenomena.\n\nBy itself, Milgrom's law is not a complete and self-contained [[physical theory]], but rather an ad-hoc empirically motivated variant of one of the several equations that constitute classical mechanics. Its status within a coherent non-relativistic hypothesis of MOND is akin to [[Kepler's Third Law]] within Newtonian mechanics; it provides a succinct description of observational facts, but must itself be explained by more fundamental concepts situated within the underlying hypothesis. Several complete classical hypotheses have been proposed (typically along \"modified gravity\" as opposed to \"modified inertia\" lines), which generally yield Milgrom's law exactly in situations of high [[symmetry]] and otherwise deviate from it slightly. A subset of these non-relativistic hypotheses have been further embedded within relativistic theories, which are capable of making contact with non-classical phenomena (e.g., [[gravitational lensing]]) and [[cosmology]].<ref name = \"famaey mcgaugh\">B.

MOND, by contrast, is actively studied by only a handful of researchers. The primary difference between supporters of \u039bCDM and MOND is in the observations for which they demand a robust, quantitative explanation and those for which they are satisfied with a qualitative account, or are prepared to leave for future work. Proponents of MOND emphasize predictions made on galaxy scales (where MOND enjoys its most notable successes) and believe that a cosmological model consistent with galaxy dynamics has yet to be discovered; proponents of \u039bCDM require high levels of cosmological accuracy (which concordance cosmology provides) and argue that a resolution of galaxy-scale issues will follow from a better understanding of the complicated baryonic astrophysics underlying [[galaxy formation]].<ref name=\"tale of two paradigms\"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Sanders, R.

Milgrom (2013), \"MOND Laws of Galaxy Dynamics\", {{arxiv|1212.2568}}</ref> Many of these came to light after the publication of Milgrom's original papers and are difficult to explain using the alternative [[dark matter]] hypothesis. The most prominent are the following:\n\n* In addition to demonstrating that rotation curves in MOND are flat, equation 2 provides a concrete relation between a galaxy's total baryonic mass (the sum of its mass in stars and gas) and its asymptotic rotation velocity. Observationally, this is known as the baryonic [[Tully\u2013Fisher relation]] (BTFR),<ref>S. S. McGaugh, J. M. Schombert, G. D. Bothun,2 and W. J. G. de Blok (2000), \"The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation\", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0003001}}</ref> and is found to conform quite closely to the MOND prediction.<ref>S. McGaugh (2011), \"The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation of Gas-Rich Galaxies as a Test of \u039bCDM and MOND\", ApJ, {{arxiv|1107.2934}}</ref>\n* Milgrom's law fully specifies the rotation curve of a galaxy given only the distribution of its baryonic mass. In particular, MOND predicts a far stronger correlation between features in the baryonic mass distribution and features in the rotation curve than does the dark matter hypothesis (since dark matter dominates the galaxy's mass budget and is conventionally assumed not to closely track the distribution of baryons). Such a tight correlation is claimed to be observed in several spiral galaxies, a fact which has been referred to as \"Renzo's rule\".<ref name = \"famaey mcgaugh\"/>\n* Since MOND modifies Newtonian dynamics in an acceleration-dependent way, it predicts a specific relationship between the acceleration of a star at any radius from the centre of a galaxy and the amount of unseen (dark matter) mass within that radius that would be inferred in a Newtonian analysis. This is known as the \"mass discrepancy-acceleration relation\", and has been measured observationally.<ref>R. Sanders, \"Mass discrepancies in galaxies: dark matter and alternatives\", The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review 1990, Volume 2, Issue 1, pp 1-28</ref><ref>S. McGaugh (2004), \"The Mass Discrepancy-Acceleration Relation: Disk Mass and the Dark Matter Distribution\", ApJ, {{arxiv|astro-ph/0403610}}</ref> One aspect of the MOND prediction is that the mass of the inferred dark matter go to zero when the stellar centripetal acceleration becomes greater than ''a''<sub>0</sub>, where MOND reverts to Newtonian mechanics. In dark matter hypothesis, it is a challenge to understand why this mass should correlate so closely with acceleration, and why there appears to be a critical acceleration above which dark matter is not required.<ref name = \"tale of two paradigms\"/>\n* Both MOND and dark matter halos stabilise disk galaxies, helping them retain their rotation-supported structure and preventing their transformation into [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. In MOND, this added stability is only available for regions of galaxies within the deep-MOND regime (i.e., with ''a'' < ''a''<sub>0</sub>), suggesting that spirals with ''a'' > ''a''<sub>0</sub> in their central regions should be prone to instabilities and hence less likely to survive to the present day.<ref>M.

At these radii, MOND predicts that the rotation curve should fall as 1/''r'', in accordance with [[Kepler's Laws]]. In contrast, from a dark matter perspective one would expect the halo to significantly boost the rotation velocity and cause it to asymptote to a constant value, as in less massive galaxies.

Alzain, \"MOND as a modification of Newtonian inertia\", {{arxiv|1708.05385}}</ref>\n\n== The external field effect ==\n\nIn Newtonian mechanics, an object's acceleration can be found as the vector sum of the acceleration due to each of the individual forces acting on it. This means that a [[subsystem]] can be decoupled from the larger system in which it is embedded simply by referring the motion of its constituent particles to their centre of mass; in other words, the influence of the larger system is irrelevant for the internal dynamics of the subsystem. Since Milgrom's law is [[non-linear]] in acceleration, MONDian subsystems cannot be decoupled from their environment in this way, and in certain situations this leads to behaviour with no Newtonian parallel. This is known as the \"external field effect\" (EFE).<ref name = \"Milgrom papers\"/>\n\nThe external field effect is best described by classifying physical systems according to their relative values of ''a''<sub>in</sub> (the characteristic acceleration of one object within a subsystem due to the influence of another), ''a''<sub>ex</sub> (the acceleration of the entire subsystem due to forces exerted by objects outside of it), and ''a''<sub>0</sub>:\n\n* <math> a_{\\mathrm{in}} > a_0 </math> :  Newtonian regime\n\n* <math> a_{\\mathrm{ex}} < a_{\\mathrm{in}} < a_0 </math> :  Deep-MOND regime\n\n* <math> a_{\\mathrm{in}} < a_0 < a_{\\mathrm{ex}} </math> : The external field is dominant and the behaviour of the system is Newtonian.\n\n* <math> a_{\\mathrm{in}} < a_{\\mathrm{ex}} < a_0 </math> : The external field is larger than the internal acceleration of the system, but both are smaller than the critical value. In this case, dynamics is Newtonian but the effective value of ''G'' is enhanced by a factor of ''a''<sub>0</sub>/''a''<sub>ex</sub>.<ref>S. McGaugh, [http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/EFE.html The EFE in MOND]</ref>\n\nThe external field effect implies a fundamental break with the [[strong equivalence principle]] (but not necessarily the [[weak equivalence principle]]). The effect was postulated by Milgrom in the first of his 1983 papers to explain why some [[open clusters]] were observed to have no mass discrepancy even though their internal accelerations were below a<sub>0</sub>. It has since come to be recognised as a crucial element of the MOND paradigm.\n\nThe dependence in MOND of the internal dynamics of a system on its external environment (in principle, the rest of the [[universe]]) is strongly reminiscent of [[Mach's principle]], and may hint towards a more fundamental structure underlying Milgrom's law. In this regard, Milgrom has commented:<ref>M. Milgrom (2008), \"The MOND paradigm\", {{arxiv|0801.3133}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It has been long suspected that local dynamics is strongly influenced by the universe at large, a-la Mach's principle, but MOND seems to be the first to supply concrete evidence for such a connection. This may turn out to be the most fundamental implication of MOND, beyond its implied modification of Newtonian dynamics and general relativity, and beyond the elimination of dark matter.</blockquote>\n\nIndeed, the potential link between MONDian dynamics and the universe as a whole (that is, cosmology) is augmented by the observation that the value of ''a''<sub>0</sub> (determined by fits to internal properties of galaxies) is within an order of magnitude of ''cH''<sub>0</sub>, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''H''<sub>0</sub> is the [[Hubble constant]] (a measure of the present-day expansion rate of the universe).<ref name = \"Milgrom papers\"/> It is also close to the [[Accelerating universe|acceleration rate of the universe]], and hence the [[cosmological constant]]. However, as yet no full hypothesis  has been constructed which manifests these connections in a natural way.\n\n== Responses and criticism ==\n\n=== Attempts to explain MOND phenomenology using dark matter ===\n\nWhile acknowledging that Milgrom's law provides a succinct and accurate description of a range of galactic phenomena, many physicists reject the idea that classical dynamics itself needs to be modified and attempt instead to explain the law's success by reference to the behaviour of dark matter. Some effort has gone towards establishing the presence of a characteristic acceleration scale as a natural consequence of the behaviour of cold dark matter halos,<ref>M. Kaplinghat and M. Turner (2002), \"How Cold Dark Matter Theory Explains Milgrom's Law\", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0107284}}</ref><ref>M. H.

Milgrom (2002), \"Do Modified Newtonian Dynamics Follow from the Cold Dark Matter Paradigm?\", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0110362}}</ref> An alternative proposal is to modify the properties of dark matter (e.g., to make it [[strongly interacting massive particle|interact strongly]] with itself or baryons) in order to induce the tight coupling between the baryonic and dark matter mass that the observations point to.<ref>J. Bullock (2014), [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/2014/sackler/index/talks/Harvard2014_Bullock.pdf Self-Interacting Dark Matter]</ref> Finally, some researchers suggest that explaining the empirical success of Milgrom's law requires a more radical break with conventional assumptions about the nature of dark matter. One idea (dubbed \"dipolar dark matter\") is to make dark matter gravitationally [[Dipolar polarization|polarisable]] by ordinary matter and have this polarisation enhance the gravitational attraction between baryons.<ref>L.

Astronomers measured the distribution of stellar and gas mass in the clusters using [[visible light|visible]] and [[X-ray]] light, respectively, and in addition mapped the inferred dark matter density using gravitational lensing. In MOND, one would expect the missing mass (which is only apparent since it results from using Newtonian as opposed to MONDian dynamics) to be centred on the visible mass. In \u039bCDM, on the other hand, one would expect the dark matter to be significantly offset from the visible mass because the halos of the two colliding clusters would pass through each other (assuming, as is conventional, that dark matter is collisionless), whilst the cluster gas would interact and end up at the centre. An offset is clearly seen in the observations. It has been suggested, however, that MOND-based models may be able to generate such an offset in strongly non-spherically-symmetric systems, such as the Bullet Cluster.<ref>{{cite journal| author=G.W.

This observation necessitates at least one of the following: 1) There exists in galaxies large quantities of unseen matter which boosts the stars' velocities beyond what would be expected on the basis of the visible mass alone, or 2) Newton's Laws do not apply to galaxies. The former leads to the dark matter hypothesis; the latter leads to MOND.\n\n[[Image:Milgrom Mordechai.jpg|thumb|upright 1.0| MOND was proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1983]]\n\nThe basic premise of MOND is that while Newton's laws have been extensively tested in high-acceleration environments (in the Solar System and on Earth), they have not been verified for objects with extremely low acceleration, such as stars in the outer parts of galaxies. This led Milgrom to postulate a new effective gravitational force law (sometimes referred to as \"Milgrom's law\") that relates the true acceleration of an object to the acceleration that would be predicted for it on the basis of Newtonian mechanics.<ref name=\"Milgrom papers\"/> This law, the keystone of MOND, is chosen to reduce to the Newtonian result at high acceleration but leads to different (\"deep-MOND\") behaviour at low acceleration:\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> F_N = m \\mu \\left( \\frac{a}{a_0} \\right) a. </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nHere ''F<sub>N</sub>'' is the Newtonian force, ''m'' is the object's (gravitational) [[mass]], ''a'' is its acceleration, ''\u03bc''(''x'') is an as-yet unspecified function (known as the \"interpolating function\"), and ''a''<sub>0</sub> is a new fundamental constant which marks the transition between the Newtonian and deep-MOND regimes. Agreement with Newtonian mechanics requires \n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\mu(x) \\to 1 && \\text{for } x \\gg 1, \\end{align}</math>\n\nand consistency with astronomical observations requires\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\mu(x) \\to x && \\text{for } x \\ll 1. \\end{align}</math>\n\nBeyond these limits, the interpolating function is not specified by the hypothesis, although it is possible to weakly constrain it empirically.<ref>G. Gentile, B. Famaey, W.J.G. de Blok (2011). \"THINGS about MOND\", Astron. Astrophys. '''527''', A76. {{arxiv|1011.4148}}</ref><ref>B. Famaey, J.

By fitting his law to rotation curve data, Milgrom found <math>a_0 \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{ms}^{-2}</math> to be optimal. This simple law is sufficient to make predictions for a broad range of galactic phenomena.\n\nMilgrom's law can be interpreted in two different ways. One possibility is to treat it as a modification to the classical [[law of inertia]] (Newton's second law), so that the force on an object is not proportional to the particle's acceleration ''a'' but rather to <math>\\mu\\left(\\frac{a}{a_0}\\right)a</math>. In this case, the modified dynamics would apply not only to gravitational phenomena, but also those generated by other [[forces]], for example [[electromagnetism]].<ref>M. Milgrom, \"MOND - Particularly as Modified Inertia\", {{arxiv|1111.1611}}</ref> Alternatively, Milgrom's law can be viewed as leaving Newton's Second Law intact and instead modifying the inverse-square law of gravity, so that the true gravitational force on an object of mass ''m'' due to another of mass ''M'' is roughly of the form\n\n:<math> \\frac{GMm}{\\mu \\left (\\frac{a}{a_0} \\right ) r^2}.</math>\n\nIn this interpretation, Milgrom's modification would apply exclusively to gravitational phenomena.\n\nBy itself, Milgrom's law is not a complete and self-contained [[physical theory]], but rather an ad-hoc empirically motivated variant of one of the several equations that constitute classical mechanics. Its status within a coherent non-relativistic hypothesis of MOND is akin to [[Kepler's Third Law]] within Newtonian mechanics; it provides a succinct description of observational facts, but must itself be explained by more fundamental concepts situated within the underlying hypothesis. Several complete classical hypotheses have been proposed (typically along \"modified gravity\" as opposed to \"modified inertia\" lines), which generally yield Milgrom's law exactly in situations of high [[symmetry]] and otherwise deviate from it slightly. A subset of these non-relativistic hypotheses have been further embedded within relativistic theories, which are capable of making contact with non-classical phenomena (e.g., [[gravitational lensing]]) and [[cosmology]].<ref name = \"famaey mcgaugh\">B.

The primary difference between supporters of \u039bCDM and MOND is in the observations for which they demand a robust, quantitative explanation and those for which they are satisfied with a qualitative account, or are prepared to leave for future work. Proponents of MOND emphasize predictions made on galaxy scales (where MOND enjoys its most notable successes) and believe that a cosmological model consistent with galaxy dynamics has yet to be discovered; proponents of \u039bCDM require high levels of cosmological accuracy (which concordance cosmology provides) and argue that a resolution of galaxy-scale issues will follow from a better understanding of the complicated baryonic astrophysics underlying [[galaxy formation]].<ref name=\"tale of two paradigms\"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Sanders, R.

Milgrom (2013), \"MOND Laws of Galaxy Dynamics\", {{arxiv|1212.2568}}</ref> Many of these came to light after the publication of Milgrom's original papers and are difficult to explain using the alternative [[dark matter]] hypothesis. The most prominent are the following:\n\n* In addition to demonstrating that rotation curves in MOND are flat, equation 2 provides a concrete relation between a galaxy's total baryonic mass (the sum of its mass in stars and gas) and its asymptotic rotation velocity. Observationally, this is known as the baryonic [[Tully\u2013Fisher relation]] (BTFR),<ref>S. S. McGaugh, J. M. Schombert, G. D. Bothun,2 and W. J. G. de Blok (2000), \"The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation\", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0003001}}</ref> and is found to conform quite closely to the MOND prediction.<ref>S. McGaugh (2011), \"The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation of Gas-Rich Galaxies as a Test of \u039bCDM and MOND\", ApJ, {{arxiv|1107.2934}}</ref>\n* Milgrom's law fully specifies the rotation curve of a galaxy given only the distribution of its baryonic mass. In particular, MOND predicts a far stronger correlation between features in the baryonic mass distribution and features in the rotation curve than does the dark matter hypothesis (since dark matter dominates the galaxy's mass budget and is conventionally assumed not to closely track the distribution of baryons). Such a tight correlation is claimed to be observed in several spiral galaxies, a fact which has been referred to as \"Renzo's rule\".<ref name = \"famaey mcgaugh\"/>\n* Since MOND modifies Newtonian dynamics in an acceleration-dependent way, it predicts a specific relationship between the acceleration of a star at any radius from the centre of a galaxy and the amount of unseen (dark matter) mass within that radius that would be inferred in a Newtonian analysis. This is known as the \"mass discrepancy-acceleration relation\", and has been measured observationally.<ref>R. Sanders, \"Mass discrepancies in galaxies: dark matter and alternatives\", The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review 1990, Volume 2, Issue 1, pp 1-28</ref><ref>S. McGaugh (2004), \"The Mass Discrepancy-Acceleration Relation: Disk Mass and the Dark Matter Distribution\", ApJ, {{arxiv|astro-ph/0403610}}</ref> One aspect of the MOND prediction is that the mass of the inferred dark matter go to zero when the stellar centripetal acceleration becomes greater than ''a''<sub>0</sub>, where MOND reverts to Newtonian mechanics. In dark matter hypothesis, it is a challenge to understand why this mass should correlate so closely with acceleration, and why there appears to be a critical acceleration above which dark matter is not required.<ref name = \"tale of two paradigms\"/>\n* Both MOND and dark matter halos stabilise disk galaxies, helping them retain their rotation-supported structure and preventing their transformation into [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. In MOND, this added stability is only available for regions of galaxies within the deep-MOND regime (i.e., with ''a'' < ''a''<sub>0</sub>), suggesting that spirals with ''a'' > ''a''<sub>0</sub> in their central regions should be prone to instabilities and hence less likely to survive to the present day.<ref>M.

At these radii, MOND predicts that the rotation curve should fall as 1/''r'', in accordance with [[Kepler's Laws]]. In contrast, from a dark matter perspective one would expect the halo to significantly boost the rotation velocity and cause it to asymptote to a constant value, as in less massive galaxies.

This means that a [[subsystem]] can be decoupled from the larger system in which it is embedded simply by referring the motion of its constituent particles to their centre of mass; in other words, the influence of the larger system is irrelevant for the internal dynamics of the subsystem. Since Milgrom's law is [[non-linear]] in acceleration, MONDian subsystems cannot be decoupled from their environment in this way, and in certain situations this leads to behaviour with no Newtonian parallel. This is known as the \"external field effect\" (EFE).<ref name = \"Milgrom papers\"/>\n\nThe external field effect is best described by classifying physical systems according to their relative values of ''a''<sub>in</sub> (the characteristic acceleration of one object within a subsystem due to the influence of another), ''a''<sub>ex</sub> (the acceleration of the entire subsystem due to forces exerted by objects outside of it), and ''a''<sub>0</sub>:\n\n* <math> a_{\\mathrm{in}} > a_0 </math> :  Newtonian regime\n\n* <math> a_{\\mathrm{ex}} < a_{\\mathrm{in}} < a_0 </math> :  Deep-MOND regime\n\n* <math> a_{\\mathrm{in}} < a_0 < a_{\\mathrm{ex}} </math> : The external field is dominant and the behaviour of the system is Newtonian.\n\n* <math> a_{\\mathrm{in}} < a_{\\mathrm{ex}} < a_0 </math> : The external field is larger than the internal acceleration of the system, but both are smaller than the critical value.

McGaugh, [http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/EFE.html The EFE in MOND]</ref>\n\nThe external field effect implies a fundamental break with the [[strong equivalence principle]] (but not necessarily the [[weak equivalence principle]]). The effect was postulated by Milgrom in the first of his 1983 papers to explain why some [[open clusters]] were observed to have no mass discrepancy even though their internal accelerations were below a<sub>0</sub>. It has since come to be recognised as a crucial element of the MOND paradigm.\n\nThe dependence in MOND of the internal dynamics of a system on its external environment (in principle, the rest of the [[universe]]) is strongly reminiscent of [[Mach's principle]], and may hint towards a more fundamental structure underlying Milgrom's law. In this regard, Milgrom has commented:<ref>M. Milgrom (2008), \"The MOND paradigm\", {{arxiv|0801.3133}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It has been long suspected that local dynamics is strongly influenced by the universe at large, a-la Mach's principle, but MOND seems to be the first to supply concrete evidence for such a connection. This may turn out to be the most fundamental implication of MOND, beyond its implied modification of Newtonian dynamics and general relativity, and beyond the elimination of dark matter.</blockquote>\n\nIndeed, the potential link between MONDian dynamics and the universe as a whole (that is, cosmology) is augmented by the observation that the value of ''a''<sub>0</sub> (determined by fits to internal properties of galaxies) is within an order of magnitude of ''cH''<sub>0</sub>, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''H''<sub>0</sub> is the [[Hubble constant]] (a measure of the present-day expansion rate of the universe).<ref name = \"Milgrom papers\"/> It is also close to the [[Accelerating universe|acceleration rate of the universe]], and hence the [[cosmological constant]]. However, as yet no full hypothesis  has been constructed which manifests these connections in a natural way.\n\n== Responses and criticism ==\n\n=== Attempts to explain MOND phenomenology using dark matter ===\n\nWhile acknowledging that Milgrom's law provides a succinct and accurate description of a range of galactic phenomena, many physicists reject the idea that classical dynamics itself needs to be modified and attempt instead to explain the law's success by reference to the behaviour of dark matter. Some effort has gone towards establishing the presence of a characteristic acceleration scale as a natural consequence of the behaviour of cold dark matter halos,<ref>M. Kaplinghat and M. Turner (2002), \"How Cold Dark Matter Theory Explains Milgrom's Law\", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0107284}}</ref><ref>M. H. Chan (2013), \"Reconciliation of MOND and Dark Matter theory\", {{arxiv|1310.6810}}</ref> although Milgrom has argued that such arguments explain only a small subset of MOND [[wikt:phenomenon|phenomena]].<ref>M. Milgrom (2002), \"Do Modified Newtonian Dynamics Follow from the Cold Dark Matter Paradigm?\", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0110362}}</ref> An alternative proposal is to modify the properties of dark matter (e.g., to make it [[strongly interacting massive particle|interact strongly]] with itself or baryons) in order to induce the tight coupling between the baryonic and dark matter mass that the observations point to.<ref>J. Bullock (2014), [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/2014/sackler/index/talks/Harvard2014_Bullock.pdf Self-Interacting Dark Matter]</ref> Finally, some researchers suggest that explaining the empirical success of Milgrom's law requires a more radical break with conventional assumptions about the nature of dark matter. One idea (dubbed \"dipolar dark matter\") is to make dark matter gravitationally [[Dipolar polarization|polarisable]] by ordinary matter and have this polarisation enhance the gravitational attraction between baryons.<ref>L. Blanchet, \"Gravitational polarization and the phenomenology of MOND\", Class. Quantum Grav., 24, 3529\u20133539, (2007), {{arXiv|astro-ph/0605637}}</ref>\n\n=== Outstanding problems for MOND ===\n\nThe most serious problem facing Milgrom's law is that it cannot completely eliminate the need for dark matter in all astrophysical systems: galaxy clusters show a residual mass discrepancy even when analysed using MOND.<ref name = \"tale of two paradigms\"/> The fact that some form of unseen mass must exist in these systems detracts from the elegance of MOND as a solution to the missing mass problem, although the amount of extra mass required is a fifth that of a Newtonian analysis, and there is no requirement that the missing mass be non-baryonic. It has been speculated that 2&nbsp;eV neutrinos could account for the cluster observations in MOND while preserving the hypothesis's successes at the galaxy scale.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Angus |first=Garry W. |last2=Shan |first2=Huan Yuan |last3=Zhao |first3=Hong Sheng |last4=Famaey |first4=Benoit |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2007 |title=On the Proof of Dark Matter, the Law of Gravity, and the Mass of Neutrinos |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=654 |issue=1 |pages=L13\u2013L16 |doi=10.1086/510738 |arxiv=astro-ph/0609125 |bibcode=2007ApJ...654L..13A}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=R.H.

Astronomers measured the distribution of stellar and gas mass in the clusters using [[visible light|visible]] and [[X-ray]] light, respectively, and in addition mapped the inferred dark matter density using gravitational lensing. In MOND, one would expect the missing mass (which is only apparent since it results from using Newtonian as opposed to MONDian dynamics) to be centred on the visible mass. In \u039bCDM, on the other hand, one would expect the dark matter to be significantly offset from the visible mass because the halos of the two colliding clusters would pass through each other (assuming, as is conventional, that dark matter is collisionless), whilst the cluster gas would interact and end up at the centre. An offset is clearly seen in the observations. It has been suggested, however, that MOND-based models may be able to generate such an offset in strongly non-spherically-symmetric systems, such as the Bullet Cluster.<ref>{{cite journal| author=G.W.

On July 15, 1954, Kelly played the gunfighter, cattleman, and bandit [[Clay Allison]] in the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Stories of the Century]]'', starring and narrated by [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0710945|title=''Stories of the Century'': \"Clay Allison\"|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955-1956 television season, Kelly starred in a [[Warner Bros. Television|series]] based on the 1942 feature film ''[[Kings Row]]''. He played Dr. Parris Mitchell, a young [[psychiatrist]] coping with the narrow-minded environment of his small town.\n\n''King's Row'' was one-third of the ''[[Warner Bros. Presents]]'' [[wheel series]], hosted by [[Gig Young]]. It rotated at the scheduled hour of 7:30 Eastern on Tuesday with a similar television version of the popular movie ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' as well as the new ABC Western series ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' starring [[Clint Walker]]. After the series ended in 1956, Kelly appeared in ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956) and ''She-Devil'' (1957), along with guest roles on ''[[Fireside Theater]]'', ''[[Schlitz Playhouse of Stars]]'', ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.\n\n===''Maverick'' (1957\u20131962)===\n[[File:Jack Kelly Richard Long Maverick 1960.JPG|left|thumb|With [[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]] as Gentleman Jack Darby (1960).]]\nThe various anti-heroic Mavericks were dapper professional poker-players roaming the [[Old West]] with the benefit of superb scripts.  The series had an enormous cultural impact during a time when there were only three television networks and most cities had only three TV channels to choose from.\n\n''Maverick'''s demanding filming schedule had caused production to lag behind early on. The producers decided to give Bret Maverick ([[James Garner]]) a brother so as not to run out of episodes long before the end of the season. Thus, Kelly was introduced as Bart Maverick in \"Hostage!\", the [[List of Maverick episodes|eighth episode]] of the series.\n\nKelly shared the lead with James Garner in one of the show's most-discussed episodes, \"[[Shady Deal at Sunny Acres]]\", on which the first half of the 1973 movie ''[[The Sting]]'' appears to be based. The pair also co-starred in the famous \"Pappy\" episode in which Garner played the brothers' much-quoted father Beauregard \"Pappy\" Maverick, in addition to his regular role of Bret. Aided by trick photography, Bret and Pappy play cards together in one scene (Kelly had a dual role in the episode as well, playing Bart and elderly Uncle Bentley Maverick). Bart rescued Bret at the climax of \"[[Duel at Sundown (Maverick)|Duel at Sundown]]\", in which Garner first fought guest star [[Clint Eastwood]].\n\nGarner had first choice of which part he would play in the two-brother episodes, which delineated the brothers as \"Maverick 1\" and \"Maverick 2\" in the scripts, giving him an enormous advantage. All but one script during the show's first two years were written with Garner in mind regardless of which actor would eventually be cast. Series creator [[Roy Huggins]] insisted that the writers visualize Garner as Maverick while writing the scripts.\n\nAlthough the \"solo\" episodes in which Bart appeared tended to be somewhat more dramatic than the often more humorous Bret episodes, Kelly displayed his comedic skills in lighter ''Maverick'' outings such as \"Hadley's Hunters\" and \"The People's Friend.\" Kelly actually appeared in more episodes of ''Maverick'' than James Garner, who left the show following a contract dispute in 1960 to successfully pursue a theatrical film career. Kelly appeared in 83 episodes; Garner in only 65.\n\nIn the wake of Garner's departure, [[Roger Moore]] stepped in to play Bart's cousin [[List of Maverick episodes|Beau Maverick]] in fourteen episodes, sharing the screen with Kelly in three of them, while [[Robert Colbert]] appeared in two installments as a third brother named Brent, one of which briefly featured Kelly.\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:James Garner Bret Maverick Jack Kelly Bart Maverick.JPG|With [[James Garner]] (1959).\nFile:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|With [[James Garner]] (1959).\nFile:Jack Kelly Julie Adams Bart Maverick 1960.JPG|With [[Julie Adams]] (1960).\nFile:Jack Kelly Kathleen Crowley Mike Road Maverick 1962.JPG|With [[Kathleen Crowley]] and [[Mike Road]] (1962).\nFile:Jack Kelly Paula Raymond Maverick 1961.JPG|thumb|With [[Paula Raymond]] (1962).\n</gallery>\n\n===Later career===\nWhen ''Maverick'' ended in 1962, Kelly continued acting with roles in a number of films and television shows. In 1962, he played the lead in ''Red Nightmare'' (also known as ''[[The Commies Are Coming, the Commies Are Coming]]'' in its derisive 1985 video re-release incarnation) a [[Cold War]] film narrated by [[Jack Webb]] in which Kelly's character wakes up one morning to discover that America has been taken over by [[Communists]]. \n[[File:Art James Bob Clayton Jack Kelly Art Fleming NBC game show hosts 1970.JPG|thumb|NBC game show hosts in 1970.

The first appearance was in the season 3 episode, \"The Becker Connection,\" and the second was the first show of season 4, \"Beamer's Last Case\" as a jealous husband. In 1978, he briefly appeared as Bart Maverick and was again paired with Garner in the TV-movie ''[[The New Maverick]]'' and in Garner's TV series ''[[Bret Maverick]]'' (1981; Kelly appeared momentarily at the end of the final episode of the show and would have become a regular had it been renewed).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} He showed up on a 1983 episode of ''[[The Fall Guy]]'', costumed as Maverick but basically playing himself in a storyline that rounded up many classic TV cowboys.

Television|series]] based on the 1942 feature film ''[[Kings Row]]''. He played Dr. Parris Mitchell, a young [[psychiatrist]] coping with the narrow-minded environment of his small town.\n\n''King's Row'' was one-third of the ''[[Warner Bros.

It rotated at the scheduled hour of 7:30 Eastern on Tuesday with a similar television version of the popular movie ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' as well as the new ABC Western series ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' starring [[Clint Walker]]. After the series ended in 1956, Kelly appeared in ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956) and ''She-Devil'' (1957), along with guest roles on ''[[Fireside Theater]]'', ''[[Schlitz Playhouse of Stars]]'', ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.\n\n===''Maverick'' (1957\u20131962)===\n[[File:Jack Kelly Richard Long Maverick 1960.JPG|left|thumb|With [[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]] as Gentleman Jack Darby (1960).]]\nThe various anti-heroic Mavericks were dapper professional poker-players roaming the [[Old West]] with the benefit of superb scripts.  The series had an enormous cultural impact during a time when there were only three television networks and most cities had only three TV channels to choose from.\n\n''Maverick'''s demanding filming schedule had caused production to lag behind early on. The producers decided to give Bret Maverick ([[James Garner]]) a brother so as not to run out of episodes long before the end of the season. Thus, Kelly was introduced as Bart Maverick in \"Hostage!\", the [[List of Maverick episodes|eighth episode]] of the series.\n\nKelly shared the lead with James Garner in one of the show's most-discussed episodes, \"[[Shady Deal at Sunny Acres]]\", on which the first half of the 1973 movie ''[[The Sting]]'' appears to be based. The pair also co-starred in the famous \"Pappy\" episode in which Garner played the brothers' much-quoted father Beauregard \"Pappy\" Maverick, in addition to his regular role of Bret. Aided by trick photography, Bret and Pappy play cards together in one scene (Kelly had a dual role in the episode as well, playing Bart and elderly Uncle Bentley Maverick). Bart rescued Bret at the climax of \"[[Duel at Sundown (Maverick)|Duel at Sundown]]\", in which Garner first fought guest star [[Clint Eastwood]].\n\nGarner had first choice of which part he would play in the two-brother episodes, which delineated the brothers as \"Maverick 1\" and \"Maverick 2\" in the scripts, giving him an enormous advantage. All but one script during the show's first two years were written with Garner in mind regardless of which actor would eventually be cast. Series creator [[Roy Huggins]] insisted that the writers visualize Garner as Maverick while writing the scripts.\n\nAlthough the \"solo\" episodes in which Bart appeared tended to be somewhat more dramatic than the often more humorous Bret episodes, Kelly displayed his comedic skills in lighter ''Maverick'' outings such as \"Hadley's Hunters\" and \"The People's Friend.\" Kelly actually appeared in more episodes of ''Maverick'' than James Garner, who left the show following a contract dispute in 1960 to successfully pursue a theatrical film career. Kelly appeared in 83 episodes; Garner in only 65.\n\nIn the wake of Garner's departure, [[Roger Moore]] stepped in to play Bart's cousin [[List of Maverick episodes|Beau Maverick]] in fourteen episodes, sharing the screen with Kelly in three of them, while [[Robert Colbert]] appeared in two installments as a third brother named Brent, one of which briefly featured Kelly.\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:James Garner Bret Maverick Jack Kelly Bart Maverick.JPG|With [[James Garner]] (1959).\nFile:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|With [[James Garner]] (1959).\nFile:Jack Kelly Julie Adams Bart Maverick 1960.JPG|With [[Julie Adams]] (1960).\nFile:Jack Kelly Kathleen Crowley Mike Road Maverick 1962.JPG|With [[Kathleen Crowley]] and [[Mike Road]] (1962).\nFile:Jack Kelly Paula Raymond Maverick 1961.JPG|thumb|With [[Paula Raymond]] (1962).\n</gallery>\n\n===Later career===\nWhen ''Maverick'' ended in 1962, Kelly continued acting with roles in a number of films and television shows. In 1962, he played the lead in ''Red Nightmare'' (also known as ''[[The Commies Are Coming, the Commies Are Coming]]'' in its derisive 1985 video re-release incarnation) a [[Cold War]] film narrated by [[Jack Webb]] in which Kelly's character wakes up one morning to discover that America has been taken over by [[Communists]]. \n[[File:Art James Bob Clayton Jack Kelly Art Fleming NBC game show hosts 1970.JPG|thumb|NBC game show hosts in 1970. From left: [[Art James]], [[Bob Clayton]], Kelly and [[Art Fleming]].]]\n\nOn December 30, 1963, Kelly appeared with [[Barbara Bain]] in \"The Fenton Canaby Story\" on ABC's ''[[Wagon Train]]''. Canaby is a former trailmaster with a dark secret he refuses to discuss. He is attracted to Lucy Garrison, a young woman with her own questionable past played by Barbara Bain, long before ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible!]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0743116|title=The Fenton Canaby Story|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nKelly co-starred in ''[[Commandos (film)|Commandos]]'' (1968) opposite [[Lee Van Cleef]], and as a villain dressed almost exactly like Bart Maverick in ''[[Young Billy Young]]'' (1969) with [[Robert Mitchum]]. From 1969 to 1971, Kelly hosted the [[NBC]] daytime game show ''[[Sale of the Century]]'' but was eventually replaced by [[Joe Garagiola Sr.|Joe Garagiola]]. He was also briefly a series regular in ''[[Get Christie Love!]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' (1978), and performed many lucrative television commercial [[voice-overs]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1977 Kelly appeared as obstreperous villains for a few moments in two episodes of [[James Garner]]'s series ''[[Rockford Files]]''. The first appearance was in the season 3 episode, \"The Becker Connection,\" and the second was the first show of season 4, \"Beamer's Last Case\" as a jealous husband. In 1978, he briefly appeared as Bart Maverick and was again paired with Garner in the TV-movie ''[[The New Maverick]]'' and in Garner's TV series ''[[Bret Maverick]]'' (1981; Kelly appeared momentarily at the end of the final episode of the show and would have become a regular had it been renewed).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} He showed up on a 1983 episode of ''[[The Fall Guy]]'', costumed as Maverick but basically playing himself in a storyline that rounded up many classic TV cowboys. In 1991, he reprised the role of Bart Maverick one last time in the [[Kenny Rogers]] vehicle, ''[[The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Business and politics==\nKelly's acting roles became less frequent in the late 1970s as he became more involved in [[real estate]] and local politics.

football)|striker]] for {{English football updater|SkelmerU}} club [[Skelmersdale United F.C.|Skelmersdale United]]. He has played in [[the Football League]] for [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]].\n\nBrodie started his career with [[Whickham F.C.|Whickham]] and, after being their top scorer in the 2005\u201306 season, moved to [[Newcastle Benfield F.C.|Newcastle Benfield]] in 2006. He signed for [[York City F.C.|York City]] in January 2007 and finished [[2006\u201307 York City F.C. season|2006\u201307]] with one goal and played in the [[Conference National]] play-off semi-final. He started [[2007\u201308 York City F.C. season|2007\u201308]] with only three goals in 2007, but finished the season with 14 goals. Early in [[2008\u201309 York City F.C. season|2008\u201309]], Brodie was [[Loan (sports)|loaned]] to [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]] and scored four goals during a one-month period. He finished the season as York's top scorer with 19 goals and played in their [[2009 FA Trophy Final]] defeat at [[Wembley Stadium]]. The [[2009\u201310 York City F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]] saw Brodie play in York's defeat in the [[2010 Conference Premier play-off Final]] at Wembley Stadium and again finish as top scorer, this time with 34 goals. He joined [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]] in August 2010 for an undisclosed fee, and with them he won the Conference Premier title in [[2010\u201311 Crawley Town F.C. season|2010\u201311]].\n\nHe joined [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]] on a season-long loan for [[2011\u201312 Fleetwood Town F.C. season|2011\u201312]], winning a second Conference Premier title in as many seasons. Brodie had loan spells with Morecambe and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] over 2012\u201313, and after being released by Crawley joined [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]]. He was loaned out to [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]], joining the latter permanently in 2014. Having been Southport's top scorer with 14 goals in [[2014\u201315 Football Conference#Conference Premier|2014\u201315]], Brodie joined [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] but finished [[2015\u201316 National League#National League North|2015\u201316]] with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. He returned to York in 2016, but was released the following year after a loan spell with [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]]. This was followed by short spells with [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] and Southport. He earned two [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[England national football C team|England national C team]] from 2008 to 2009.\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nBrodie was born in [[Gateshead]],

Its mainline route proved influential in the development and economic growth of the [[Southern Tier]], including cities such as [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], and [[Hornell]]. The Erie Railroad repair shops were located in Hornell, and were Hornell's largest employer. Hornell was also where Erie's main line split into two routes, one north to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and the other west to [[Cleveland]].\n\nOn October 17, 1960, the Erie merged with former rival [[Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad|Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad]] to form the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]]. The Hornell repair shops were closed, and repair operations moved to the Lackawanna's [[Scranton]] facility; this had a devastating effect on Hornell from which it has never recovered. (The repair shops have subsequently been used, intermittently, for the assembly of railroad and transit cars.) Much of the former Erie line between Hornell and Binghamton was damaged in 1972 by the floods of [[Hurricane Agnes]], but the damage was quickly repaired and this line is today a key link in the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s Southern Tier main line. The Canisteo Valley line, through Canisteo to Addison, was abandoned. What was left of the Erie Lackawanna became part of [[Conrail]] in 1976.<ref name=drury/> In 1983, Erie remnants became part of [[New Jersey Transit rail operations]], including parts of its [[Main Line (New Jersey Transit)|Main Line]]. Today, most of the surviving Erie Railroad routes are operated by the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== New York and Erie Rail Road: 1832\u20131861 ===\n[[Image:1834 Erie.jpg|thumb|300px|1834 plan]]\nThe '''New York and Erie Rail Road''' was chartered April 24, 1832 by Governor of New York, [[Enos T. Throop]] to connect the [[Hudson River]] at [[Piermont (NY)|Piermont]], north of [[New York City]], west to [[Lake Erie]] at [[Dunkirk (NY)|Dunkirk]]. On February 16, 1841 the railroad was authorized to cross into the northeast corner of [[Pennsylvania]] on the west side of the [[Delaware River]]. Construction began in 1836, and it opened from Piermont to [[Goshen (NY)|Goshen]] on September 23, 1841. After some financial problems, construction resumed in August 1846, and the next section, to [[Port Jervis (NY)|Port Jervis]], opened on January 7, 1848.  Further extensions opened to [[Binghamton (NY)|Binghamton]] December 27, 1848, [[Owego (NY)|Owego]] January 1, 1849, and the full length to Dunkirk May 19, 1851.  At Dunkirk [[steamboat]]s continued across [[Lake Erie]] to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].\n\nWhen the route was completed in May 1851, President [[Millard Fillmore]] and several members of his cabinet, including Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]], made a special, two-day excursion run to open the railway. It is reported that Webster viewed the entire run from a rocking chair attached to a flatcar, with a steamer rug and jug of high-quality [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]] [[rum]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Stover|first=John F.|author-link= |date=1995|title=History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|url= |location= |publisher=Purdue University Press|page=74|isbn=9781557530660}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Stover|first=John F.|author-link= |date=1999|title=The Routledge Historical Atlas of the American Railroads|url= |location= |publisher=Psychology Press|page=70|isbn=9780415921404}}</ref> At stops, he would get down and speechify.\n\nThe line was built as {{Track gauge|6ft|lk=on}} [[Broad gauge|wide gauge]]; this was believed to be a superior technology to standard gauge, providing more stability.\n\nIn 1848 the railroad built the [[Starrucca Viaduct]], a stone railroad bridge over [[Starrucca Creek]] in [[Lanesboro, Pennsylvania]], which has survived and is still in use today.

The branch opened January 8, 1850. It was later used as a connection to the [[New York and New England Railroad]] via a [[car float]] operation across the river to Beacon, New York. In July 1869, a second branch to Newburgh was constructed from what is now Newburgh Junction, near [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]], to [[Vails Gate, New York|Vails Gate]], where it connected with the existing branch line. This new branch was known as \"the shortcut\", because it was a more direct link between Newburgh and the southern section of the main line.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McCue|first=Robert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hS9AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781467120968&hl=xx-pirate&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjr79a347voAhVVmnIEHYDcDbsQuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&q=shortcut&f=false|title=Erie Railroad's Newburgh Branch|date=2014|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-1-4671-2096-8|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Paterson and Ramapo Railroad]] and Union Railroad opened in 1848, providing a connection between the Erie at the village of [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]] in [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] and Jersey City, across the [[Hudson River]] from [[New York City]]. Through ticketing began in 1851, with a required change of cars at Ramapo due to the [[gauge break]].  In 1852 the Erie leased the two companies along with the [[Paterson and Hudson River Railroad]], and Erie trains begin operating to the [[New Jersey Rail Road|New Jersey Rail Road's]] [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] terminal on November 1853 after a [[Dual gauge|third rail]] for [[Broad gauge|wide gauge]] was finished.\n\nIn 1852 the [[Buffalo and Rochester Railroad]], later to become part of the [[New York Central Railroad]] system, completed a new alignment between [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Batavia (NY)|Batavia]], and as a result sold their previous alignment from Buffalo to [[Attica (NY)|Attica]] to the Attica and Hornellsville Railroad, which subsequently renamed itself to the Buffalo and New York City Railroad, and [[Track gauge conversion|converted]] to the Erie's [[Broad gauge|wide gauge]]. The Buffalo and New York City began leasing their track to the Erie upon the completion of their extension from Attica southeast to [[Hornellsville (NY)|Hornellsville]], opened on November 17, 1852, giving the Erie access to Buffalo, a better terminal than Dunkirk. On October 31, 1857, the Buffalo and New York City was finally sold to the Erie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/abnyrr.Html|title=Early Railroads of New York|website=www.catskillarchive.com|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> \n\nThe Erie began operating the [[Chemung Railroad]] in 1850; this provided a branch from [[Horseheads (village), New York|Horseheads]] north to [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins]].  The [[Canandaigua and Elmira Railroad]] opened in 1851 as a northern extension from Watkins to [[Canandaigua (NY)|Canandaigua]] and was operated by the Erie until 1853.  At this point, the Erie subleased the Chemung Railroad to the Canandaigua and Elmira.  The C&E went [[bankrupt]] in 1857 and was reorganized in 1859 as the [[Elmira, Canandaigua and Niagara Falls Railroad]], at which time the Erie leased it again.  The Chemung Railroad reverted to the Erie in 1858 during the bankruptcy.\n\n[[Image:1855 Erie.jpg|thumb|300px|1855 map]]\nThe [[Canandaigua and Niagara Falls Railroad]] continued this line beyond Canandaigua to [[North Tonawanda, New York|North Tonawanda]] with [[trackage rights]] over the [[Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad]] to [[Niagara Falls (NY)|Niagara Falls]] and the [[Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge]] into [[Ontario]].  This was leased by the Canandaigua and Elmira from its opening in 1853 to 1858, when it went [[bankrupt]], was reorganized as the Niagara Bridge and Canandaigua Railroad, and was leased by [[New York Central Railroad]].  The NYC converted it to [[standard gauge]] and blocked the Erie from it.\n\nThe Erie pushed southward into the coal fields of [[Elk County, Pennsylvania]], [[Jefferson County, Pennsylvania]], and [[Clearfield County, Pennsylvania]] to acquire a source of fuel for its locomotives. This action began with the February 26, 1859 merger of two earlier roads to form the Buffalo, Bradford and Pittsburgh Railroad Company. The new organization was sponsored by the New York and Erie Railroad Company, later known as the Erie. The B.B.& P. ran for 25.97 miles through [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]] after connecting with the primary line of the Erie at [[Carrollton, New York]]. The line came to a point known as Gilesville (later Buttsville), the site of a [[bituminous]] mine in southeast [[Lafayette Township, McKean County, Pennsylvania|Lafayette]], by January 1, 1866.<ref name=\"erie\">{{cite news|last=Scott|first=George A.|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2335056/the-progress/|title=The Erie Railroad|date=November 16, 1967|newspaper=The Clearfield Progress|access-date=April 1, 2020|url-status=live|page=1}}</ref>\n\n===Erie Railway: 1861\u20131878===\nIn August 1859, the company went into [[receivership]] due to the large costs of building, and on June 25, 1861 it was reorganized as the Erie Railway.

In addition, this company also acquired the Buffalo, Corning and New York Railroad, which ran from Corning to Batavia, and connected the two lines. In 1858, the company leased the Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad, which split from the Buffalo, New York and Erie at [[Avon (NY)|Avon]], running north to [[Rochester (NY)|Rochester]].

A joint through line was created between [[Philadelphia (PA)|Philadelphia]] and Buffalo.  At this time, the Northern Central leased the [[Elmira and Williamsport Railroad]], forming the part of the line from [[Elmira (NY)|Elmira]] south into [[Pennsylvania]]. After disputes due to charges of the Erie using its own line via [[Hornellsville (NY)|Hornellsville]] (the B&NYC) too much, and problems with the [[gauge break]] at [[Elmira (NY)|Elmira]], this contract was cancelled in 1866. The [[Elmira, Jefferson and Canandaigua Railroad]] (and its [[Chemung Railroad]]) was transferred to the Northern Central, and a [[Dual gauge|third rail]] was built to allow the Northern Central's {{Track gauge|56.5in|allk=on}} trains to operate over it.\n\nTo restore access to the [[Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge]], the Erie got the Suspension Bridge and Erie Junction Railroad chartered in 1868. The line opened in 1871, running from eastern [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda]] and then alongside the [[New York Central Railroad]]'s [[Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad]] to the bridge.  The Erie International Railway, chartered 1872 and opened 1874, provided a branch to the [[International Bridge (Buffalo)|International Bridge]], and the Lockport and Buffalo Railway, chartered 1871 and opened 1879, provided a branch to [[Lockport (NY)|Lockport]].\n\n[[Image:NutleyRailSwitch.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Railway switch in Nutley, New Jersey]]\nIn the [[Erie War]] of the 1860s, four well-known financiers struggled for control of the company; [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] versus [[Daniel Drew]], [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] and [[Jay Gould]]. Gould ultimately triumphed in this struggle, but was forced to relinquish control in 1872\u201373, due to unfavourable public opinion following his involvement in the 1869 [[Black Friday (1869)|gold-rigging scandal]] and to his loss of $1 million of Erie Railroad stock to the British con-man [[Lord Gordon-Gordon]].\n\nIn 1869, the railroad moved its main shops facilities from Dunkirk to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. Rather than demolishing the shops in Dunkirk, the facility was leased to [[Horatio G. Brooks]], the former chief engineer of the NY&E who was at the controls of the first train into Dunkirk in 1851. Horatio Brooks used the facilities to begin [[Brooks Locomotive Works]], which remained in independent business until 1901 when it was merged with seven other locomotive manufacturing firms to create [[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]]. ALCO continued new locomotive production at this facility until 1934, then closed the plant completely in 1962.\n\n=== New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad: 1878\u20131895 ===\n[[File:Erie Limited.JPG|thumb|right|The ''[[Erie Limited]]'', which traveled between New York-Chicago]]\nThe Erie still did not see profits and via bankruptcy was sold in 1878 to become the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad.\n\nThe New York, Lake Erie, and Western Coal and Railroad Company pushed the line south to [[Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania]] in 1881 ''-'' 1882, a distance of {{convert|29.68|mi}}.

Union leaders agreed to make this an issue which Erie management would settle with its own men. However, W.G. Lee, president of the brotherhood of railroad trainmen, asserted that the only way \"to deal with the Erie is through [[J.P. Morgan & Company]], or the banks\".

Its reorganization, accomplished by December 1941, included the purchase of the leased [[Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad]], swapping high rent for lower interest payments, and the purchase of formerly subsidized and leased lines.

The company's 1957 income was half of that in 1956; by 1958 and 1959, the Erie posted deficits. The business recession that occurred in the 1950s led the Erie to explore the idea of doing business with the nearby [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W). The first result of this was the abandonment of duplicate freight facilities in Binghamton and Elmira, New York. Between 1956 and 1957, the Erie shifted its passenger trains from its Pavonia Terminal to the DL&W's newer [[Hoboken Terminal]]. Also, the DL&W's main line between Binghamton and Elmira was abandoned in favor of the Erie's parallel main line in 1958. These successful business consolidations led to merger talks (which, at first, also included the [[Delaware and Hudson Railroad]]); on October 17, 1960, the two railroads merged to create the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]].<ref name=drury>{{cite book| last=Drury| first=George H.| title=The Historical Guide to North American Railroads: Histories, Figures, and Features of more than 160 Railroads Abandoned or Merged since 1930| publisher=Kalmbach Publishing| year=1994| location=Waukesha, Wisconsin| pages=129\u2013135| isbn=0-89024-072-8}}</ref> Erie's large repair facility in [[Hornell, New York|Hornell]] closed \u2014 an economic impact from which the city has never recovered \u2014 and operations were consolidated at the Lackawanna's [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] facility.

It expanded west to Chicago with its 1941 merger with the former [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]], also known as the [[New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad]] (NYPANO RR). Its mainline route proved influential in the development and economic growth of the [[Southern Tier]], including cities such as [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], and [[Hornell]]. The Erie Railroad repair shops were located in Hornell, and were Hornell's largest employer. Hornell was also where Erie's main line split into two routes, one north to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and the other west to [[Cleveland]].\n\nOn October 17, 1960, the Erie merged with former rival [[Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad|Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad]] to form the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]]. The Hornell repair shops were closed, and repair operations moved to the Lackawanna's [[Scranton]] facility; this had a devastating effect on Hornell from which it has never recovered. (The repair shops have subsequently been used, intermittently, for the assembly of railroad and transit cars.) Much of the former Erie line between Hornell and Binghamton was damaged in 1972 by the floods of [[Hurricane Agnes]], but the damage was quickly repaired and this line is today a key link in the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s Southern Tier main line. The Canisteo Valley line, through Canisteo to Addison, was abandoned. What was left of the Erie Lackawanna became part of [[Conrail]] in 1976.<ref name=drury/> In 1983, Erie remnants became part of [[New Jersey Transit rail operations]], including parts of its [[Main Line (New Jersey Transit)|Main Line]]. Today, most of the surviving Erie Railroad routes are operated by the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== New York and Erie Rail Road: 1832\u20131861 ===\n[[Image:1834 Erie.jpg|thumb|300px|1834 plan]]\nThe '''New York and Erie Rail Road''' was chartered April 24, 1832 by Governor of New York, [[Enos T. Throop]] to connect the [[Hudson River]] at [[Piermont (NY)|Piermont]], north of [[New York City]], west to [[Lake Erie]] at [[Dunkirk (NY)|Dunkirk]]. On February 16, 1841 the railroad was authorized to cross into the northeast corner of [[Pennsylvania]] on the west side of the [[Delaware River]]. Construction began in 1836, and it opened from Piermont to [[Goshen (NY)|Goshen]] on September 23, 1841. After some financial problems, construction resumed in August 1846, and the next section, to [[Port Jervis (NY)|Port Jervis]], opened on January 7, 1848.  Further extensions opened to [[Binghamton (NY)|Binghamton]] December 27, 1848, [[Owego (NY)|Owego]] January 1, 1849, and the full length to Dunkirk May 19, 1851.  At Dunkirk [[steamboat]]s continued across [[Lake Erie]] to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].\n\nWhen the route was completed in May 1851, President [[Millard Fillmore]] and several members of his cabinet, including Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]], made a special, two-day excursion run to open the railway. It is reported that Webster viewed the entire run from a rocking chair attached to a flatcar, with a steamer rug and jug of high-quality [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]] [[rum]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Stover|first=John F.|author-link= |date=1995|title=History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|url= |location= |publisher=Purdue University Press|page=74|isbn=9781557530660}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Stover|first=John F.|author-link= |date=1999|title=The Routledge Historical Atlas of the American Railroads|url= |location= |publisher=Psychology Press|page=70|isbn=9780415921404}}</ref> At stops, he would get down and speechify.\n\nThe line was built as {{Track gauge|6ft|lk=on}} [[Broad gauge|wide gauge]]; this was believed to be a superior technology to standard gauge, providing more stability.\n\nIn 1848 the railroad built the [[Starrucca Viaduct]], a stone railroad bridge over [[Starrucca Creek]] in [[Lanesboro, Pennsylvania]], which has survived and is still in use today. The viaduct is {{convert|1040|ft|m|0}} long, {{convert|100|ft|m|1}} high and {{convert|25|ft|m|1}} wide at the top.

The branch opened January 8, 1850. It was later used as a connection to the [[New York and New England Railroad]] via a [[car float]] operation across the river to Beacon, New York. In July 1869, a second branch to Newburgh was constructed from what is now Newburgh Junction, near [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]], to [[Vails Gate, New York|Vails Gate]], where it connected with the existing branch line. This new branch was known as \"the shortcut\", because it was a more direct link between Newburgh and the southern section of the main line.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McCue|first=Robert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hS9AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781467120968&hl=xx-pirate&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjr79a347voAhVVmnIEHYDcDbsQuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&q=shortcut&f=false|title=Erie Railroad's Newburgh Branch|date=2014|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-1-4671-2096-8|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Paterson and Ramapo Railroad]] and Union Railroad opened in 1848, providing a connection between the Erie at the village of [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]] in [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] and Jersey City, across the [[Hudson River]] from [[New York City]]. Through ticketing began in 1851, with a required change of cars at Ramapo due to the [[gauge break]].  In 1852 the Erie leased the two companies along with the [[Paterson and Hudson River Railroad]], and Erie trains begin operating to the [[New Jersey Rail Road|New Jersey Rail Road's]] [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] terminal on November 1853 after a [[Dual gauge|third rail]] for [[Broad gauge|wide gauge]] was finished.\n\nIn 1852 the [[Buffalo and Rochester Railroad]], later to become part of the [[New York Central Railroad]] system, completed a new alignment between [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Batavia (NY)|Batavia]], and as a result sold their previous alignment from Buffalo to [[Attica (NY)|Attica]] to the Attica and Hornellsville Railroad, which subsequently renamed itself to the Buffalo and New York City Railroad, and [[Track gauge conversion|converted]] to the Erie's [[Broad gauge|wide gauge]]. The Buffalo and New York City began leasing their track to the Erie upon the completion of their extension from Attica southeast to [[Hornellsville (NY)|Hornellsville]], opened on November 17, 1852, giving the Erie access to Buffalo, a better terminal than Dunkirk. On October 31, 1857, the Buffalo and New York City was finally sold to the Erie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/abnyrr.Html|title=Early Railroads of New York|website=www.catskillarchive.com|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> \n\nThe Erie began operating the [[Chemung Railroad]] in 1850; this provided a branch from [[Horseheads (village), New York|Horseheads]] north to [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins]].  The [[Canandaigua and Elmira Railroad]] opened in 1851 as a northern extension from Watkins to [[Canandaigua (NY)|Canandaigua]] and was operated by the Erie until 1853.  At this point, the Erie subleased the Chemung Railroad to the Canandaigua and Elmira.  The C&E went [[bankrupt]] in 1857 and was reorganized in 1859 as the [[Elmira, Canandaigua and Niagara Falls Railroad]], at which time the Erie leased it again.  The Chemung Railroad reverted to the Erie in 1858 during the bankruptcy.\n\n[[Image:1855 Erie.jpg|thumb|300px|1855 map]]\nThe [[Canandaigua and Niagara Falls Railroad]] continued this line beyond Canandaigua to [[North Tonawanda, New York|North Tonawanda]] with [[trackage rights]] over the [[Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad]] to [[Niagara Falls (NY)|Niagara Falls]] and the [[Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge]] into [[Ontario]].  This was leased by the Canandaigua and Elmira from its opening in 1853 to 1858, when it went [[bankrupt]], was reorganized as the Niagara Bridge and Canandaigua Railroad, and was leased by [[New York Central Railroad]].  The NYC converted it to [[standard gauge]] and blocked the Erie from it.\n\nThe Erie pushed southward into the coal fields of [[Elk County, Pennsylvania]], [[Jefferson County, Pennsylvania]], and [[Clearfield County, Pennsylvania]] to acquire a source of fuel for its locomotives. This action began with the February 26, 1859 merger of two earlier roads to form the Buffalo, Bradford and Pittsburgh Railroad Company. The new organization was sponsored by the New York and Erie Railroad Company, later known as the Erie. The B.B.& P. ran for 25.97 miles through [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]] after connecting with the primary line of the Erie at [[Carrollton, New York]]. The line came to a point known as Gilesville (later Buttsville), the site of a [[bituminous]] mine in southeast [[Lafayette Township, McKean County, Pennsylvania|Lafayette]], by January 1, 1866.<ref name=\"erie\">{{cite news|last=Scott|first=George A.|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2335056/the-progress/|title=The Erie Railroad|date=November 16, 1967|newspaper=The Clearfield Progress|access-date=April 1, 2020|url-status=live|page=1}}</ref>\n\n===Erie Railway: 1861\u20131878===\nIn August 1859, the company went into [[receivership]] due to the large costs of building, and on June 25, 1861 it was reorganized as the Erie Railway.

In addition, this company also acquired the Buffalo, Corning and New York Railroad, which ran from Corning to Batavia, and connected the two lines. In 1858, the company leased the Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad, which split from the Buffalo, New York and Erie at [[Avon (NY)|Avon]], running north to [[Rochester (NY)|Rochester]].

A joint through line was created between [[Philadelphia (PA)|Philadelphia]] and Buffalo.  At this time, the Northern Central leased the [[Elmira and Williamsport Railroad]], forming the part of the line from [[Elmira (NY)|Elmira]] south into [[Pennsylvania]]. After disputes due to charges of the Erie using its own line via [[Hornellsville (NY)|Hornellsville]] (the B&NYC) too much, and problems with the [[gauge break]] at [[Elmira (NY)|Elmira]], this contract was cancelled in 1866. The [[Elmira, Jefferson and Canandaigua Railroad]] (and its [[Chemung Railroad]]) was transferred to the Northern Central, and a [[Dual gauge|third rail]] was built to allow the Northern Central's {{Track gauge|56.5in|allk=on}} trains to operate over it.\n\nTo restore access to the [[Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge]], the Erie got the Suspension Bridge and Erie Junction Railroad chartered in 1868. The line opened in 1871, running from eastern [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda]] and then alongside the [[New York Central Railroad]]'s [[Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad]] to the bridge.  The Erie International Railway, chartered 1872 and opened 1874, provided a branch to the [[International Bridge (Buffalo)|International Bridge]], and the Lockport and Buffalo Railway, chartered 1871 and opened 1879, provided a branch to [[Lockport (NY)|Lockport]].\n\n[[Image:NutleyRailSwitch.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Railway switch in Nutley, New Jersey]]\nIn the [[Erie War]] of the 1860s, four well-known financiers struggled for control of the company; [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] versus [[Daniel Drew]], [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] and [[Jay Gould]]. Gould ultimately triumphed in this struggle, but was forced to relinquish control in 1872\u201373, due to unfavourable public opinion following his involvement in the 1869 [[Black Friday (1869)|gold-rigging scandal]] and to his loss of $1 million of Erie Railroad stock to the British con-man [[Lord Gordon-Gordon]].\n\nIn 1869, the railroad moved its main shops facilities from Dunkirk to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. Rather than demolishing the shops in Dunkirk, the facility was leased to [[Horatio G. Brooks]], the former chief engineer of the NY&E who was at the controls of the first train into Dunkirk in 1851. Horatio Brooks used the facilities to begin [[Brooks Locomotive Works]], which remained in independent business until 1901 when it was merged with seven other locomotive manufacturing firms to create [[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]]. ALCO continued new locomotive production at this facility until 1934, then closed the plant completely in 1962.\n\n=== New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad: 1878\u20131895 ===\n[[File:Erie Limited.JPG|thumb|right|The ''[[Erie Limited]]'', which traveled between New York-Chicago]]\nThe Erie still did not see profits and via bankruptcy was sold in 1878 to become the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad.\n\nThe New York, Lake Erie, and Western Coal and Railroad Company pushed the line south to [[Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania]] in 1881 ''-'' 1882, a distance of {{convert|29.68|mi}}.

During the eastern railroad strike of 1913 Underwood agreed to accept any ruling made by mediators under the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]]. One of the demands made by Erie employees was a 20% increase in wages. Erie management had refused a wage increase but compromised by asking employees to wait until January 1915 for any advance. Union leaders agreed to make this an issue which Erie management would settle with its own men. However, W.G. Lee, president of the brotherhood of railroad trainmen, asserted that the only way \"to deal with the Erie is through [[J.P. Morgan & Company]], or the banks\".

The reorganization paid off, as the Erie managed to pay dividends to its shareholders after the dust had settled.<ref name=drury/>\n\nIn 1938, the Erie Railroad was involved in the famous [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v.

The company's 1957 income was half of that in 1956; by 1958 and 1959, the Erie posted deficits. The business recession that occurred in the 1950s led the Erie to explore the idea of doing business with the nearby [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W). The first result of this was the abandonment of duplicate freight facilities in Binghamton and Elmira, New York. Between 1956 and 1957, the Erie shifted its passenger trains from its Pavonia Terminal to the DL&W's newer [[Hoboken Terminal]]. Also, the DL&W's main line between Binghamton and Elmira was abandoned in favor of the Erie's parallel main line in 1958. These successful business consolidations led to merger talks (which, at first, also included the [[Delaware and Hudson Railroad]]); on October 17, 1960, the two railroads merged to create the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]].<ref name=drury>{{cite book| last=Drury| first=George H.| title=The Historical Guide to North American Railroads: Histories, Figures, and Features of more than 160 Railroads Abandoned or Merged since 1930| publisher=Kalmbach Publishing| year=1994| location=Waukesha, Wisconsin| pages=129\u2013135| isbn=0-89024-072-8}}</ref> Erie's large repair facility in [[Hornell, New York|Hornell]] closed \u2014 an economic impact from which the city has never recovered \u2014 and operations were consolidated at the Lackawanna's [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] facility. However, the merged railroad only survived for a decade and a half before continued decline forced it to join [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nYear-end mileage operated, including C&E but not NYS&W/WB&E: 2451 route-miles, 6013 track-miles in 1925; 2320 route-miles, 5395 track-miles in 1956.

The channel originally launched on 5 November 2001 and relaunched in its final format on 22 June 2009. Good Food was available on satellite through [[Sky UK|Sky]] and through IPTV with [[TalkTalk TV]], [[BT TV]]. From 1 December 2015 to 26 December 2015, Good Food was temporarily rebranded as Christmas Food; the campaign resumed from 26 November 2016 to 26 December 2016. It returned on 26 November 2017.\n\nGood Food ceased broadcasting on 12 September 2019, with all its programmes moving to [[Food Network]].\n\n==History==\nThe channel originally launched on 5 November 2001 as '''UK Food''', as a channel dedicated to cookery programmes that had previously been broadcast on the increasingly crowded [[Home (TV channel)|UK Style]] channel. The channel uses a large amount of programming from the [[BBC]]'s programme archive. The channel is familiar to a former international channel run by [[BBC Worldwide]] called [[BBC Food]], as both use similar programming and both have a similar format. The channel changed its name on 8 March 2004 to '''UKTV Food'''.\n\nAs part of the rebranding of all UKTV's channels to a unique name and identity, UKTV Food rebranded as '''Good Food''' on 22 June 2009, the last of UKTV's brands to do so. The name was based on that of the ''[[BBC Good Food]]'' cookery magazine, published by [[Immediate Media Company]].<ref>{{cite news | title=UKTV Food to become Good Food | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a155653/uktv-food-to-become-good-food/ | accessdate=13 May 2009}}</ref> The channel and the magazine continue to be operated separately. \n\nOn 1 April 2019, it was announced that UKTV co-owner [[Discovery Inc.]] would acquire the BBC's stake in Good Food.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/discovery-bbc-reignite-global-content-partnership-1202586088/|title=Discovery & BBC Reignite Global Content Deal With SVOD & UKTV Agreement, Six Years After Ending Previous Pact|last=White|first=Peter|last2=White|first2=Peter|date=2019-04-01|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> \n\nOn 5 September 2019, Discovery announced that Good Food would merge with Food Network and close on 12 September 2019, with its programmes moving to the sister channel.<ref>[https://www.rxtvlog.com/2019/09/good-food-channel-to-close-content.html?m=1 RXTV-log, 2019-09-05]</ref> Good Food was removed from [[Virgin Media]] on 11 September, while the channel itself was shut down on 12 September 2019, after which the channel space created in 2001 by UK Food ceased to exist. The last programme to be shown was a repeat of [[Choccywoccydoodah]].\n\n==Subsidiary channels==\n===Good Food +1===\nThe network also operated a time shifted version of the channel '''Good Food +1''', which shows the same schedule an hour later for catch up purposes. The timeshifted channel does not use any special branding, with the occasional exception of a change in [[Digital on-screen graphic]] (DOG). The timeshift channel was available on Sky and Virgin Media.\n\n===Good Food HD===\nOn 13 July 2009, Virgin Media revealed that they were \"currently in active talks\" with UKTV about launching a [[High-definition television|high-definition]] version of Good Food on their cable television platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a164766/4-hd-channels-to-launch-on-virgin-media.html|title=4 HD channels to launch on Virgin Media|publisher=Digital Spy|date=13 July 2009}}</ref> '''Good Food HD''' launched on 31 August 2010 on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], broadcasting a HD [[simulcast]] of the channel's schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uktv.co.uk/network/item/aid/637940|title=UKTV announces Good Food and Eden HD channel rollout|publisher=UKTV|date=9 August 2010|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828111206/http://uktv.co.uk/network/item/aid/637940|archivedate=28 August 2010|df=}}</ref> As part of Virgin Media's deal to sell its share of UKTV, all five of UKTV's HD channels were added to Virgin's cable television service by 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/04a841ee-c729-11e0-a9ef-00144feabdc0.html|title=Virgin Media sells \u00a3239m stake in UKTV|publisher=Financial Times|date=15 August 2011|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-cz51SAczqUJ:www.ft.com/cms/s/0/04a841ee-c729-11e0-a9ef-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1VI55De3n|archivedate=17 August 2011}}</ref> Good Food HD was added to Virgin Media on 7 October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.virginmedia.com/customer-news/articles/UKTVNew/|title=Virgin TV just got even bigger|publisher=Virgin Media|accessdate=4 October 2011|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011064522/http://my.virginmedia.com/customer-news/articles/UKTVNew/|archivedate=11 October 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n==On-air identity==\n[[File:UKTV Food logo.png|left|thumb|125px|UKTV Food logo]]\nWhen '''UK Food''' channel launched in 2001, the channel adopted a branding package based around circular shaped foods with a spiral pattern located in the centre when looked at from above. The channel's logo at the time featured the name, stylised as <sup>UK</sup> Food, and a two lined spiral extending outwards from the right of the name.

The channel originally launched on 5 November 2001 and relaunched in its final format on 22 June 2009. Good Food was available on satellite through [[Sky UK|Sky]] and through IPTV with [[TalkTalk TV]], [[BT TV]]. From 1 December 2015 to 26 December 2015, Good Food was temporarily rebranded as Christmas Food; the campaign resumed from 26 November 2016 to 26 December 2016. It returned on 26 November 2017.\n\nGood Food ceased broadcasting on 12 September 2019, with all its programmes moving to [[Food Network]].\n\n==History==\nThe channel originally launched on 5 November 2001 as '''UK Food''', as a channel dedicated to cookery programmes that had previously been broadcast on the increasingly crowded [[Home (TV channel)|UK Style]] channel. The channel uses a large amount of programming from the [[BBC]]'s programme archive. The channel is familiar to a former international channel run by [[BBC Worldwide]] called [[BBC Food]], as both use similar programming and both have a similar format. The channel changed its name on 8 March 2004 to '''UKTV Food'''.\n\nAs part of the rebranding of all UKTV's channels to a unique name and identity, UKTV Food rebranded as '''Good Food''' on 22 June 2009, the last of UKTV's brands to do so. The name was based on that of the ''[[BBC Good Food]]'' cookery magazine, published by [[Immediate Media Company]].<ref>{{cite news | title=UKTV Food to become Good Food | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a155653/uktv-food-to-become-good-food/ | accessdate=13 May 2009}}</ref> The channel and the magazine continue to be operated separately. \n\nOn 1 April 2019, it was announced that UKTV co-owner [[Discovery Inc.]] would acquire the BBC's stake in Good Food.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/discovery-bbc-reignite-global-content-partnership-1202586088/|title=Discovery & BBC Reignite Global Content Deal With SVOD & UKTV Agreement, Six Years After Ending Previous Pact|last=White|first=Peter|last2=White|first2=Peter|date=2019-04-01|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> \n\nOn 5 September 2019, Discovery announced that Good Food would merge with Food Network and close on 12 September 2019, with its programmes moving to the sister channel.<ref>[https://www.rxtvlog.com/2019/09/good-food-channel-to-close-content.html?m=1 RXTV-log, 2019-09-05]</ref> Good Food was removed from [[Virgin Media]] on 11 September, while the channel itself was shut down on 12 September 2019, after which the channel space created in 2001 by UK Food ceased to exist.

The Debye model correctly predicts the low temperature dependence of the heat capacity, which is proportional to <math>T^3</math> \u2013 the '''Debye ''T''<sup>3</sup> law'''. Just like the [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]], it also recovers the [[Dulong\u2013Petit law]] at high temperatures. But due to simplifying assumptions, its accuracy suffers at intermediate temperatures.\n\n== Derivation ==\nThe Debye model is a solid-state equivalent of [[Planck's law of black body radiation]], where one treats [[electromagnetic radiation]] as a [[photon gas]]. The Debye model treats atomic vibrations as [[phonon]]s in a box (the box being the solid). Most of the calculation steps are identical as both are examples of a massless [[Bose gas]] with linear dispersion relation.\n\nConsider a cube of side <math>L</math>. From the [[particle in a box]] article, the resonating modes of the sonic disturbances inside the box (considering for now only those aligned with one axis) have wavelengths given by\n\n:<math>\\lambda_n = {2L\\over n}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>n</math> is an integer. The energy of a phonon is\n\n:<math>E_n\\ =h\\nu_n\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\nu_{n}</math> is the frequency of the phonon. Making the approximation that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength, we have:\n\n:<math>E_n=h\\nu_n={hc_{\\rm s}\\over\\lambda_n}={hc_sn\\over 2L}\\,,</math>\n\nin which <math>c_s</math> is the speed of sound inside the solid.\nIn three dimensions we will use:\n\n:<math>E_n^2={p_n^2 c_{\\rm s}^2}=\\left({hc_{\\rm s}\\over2L}\\right)^2\\left(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2\\right)\\,,</math>\n\nin which <math>p_n</math> is the magnitude of the three-dimensional momentum of the phonon.\n\nThe approximation that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength (giving a constant speed of sound) is good for low-energy phonons but not for high-energy phonons (see the article on [[phonon]]s.) This disagreement is one of the limitations of the Debye model, and corresponds to incorrectness of the results at intermediate temperatures, whereas both at low temperatures and also at high temperatures they are exact.\n\nLet's now compute the total energy in the box,\n\n:<math>E = \\sum_n E_n\\,\\bar{N}(E_n)\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{N}(E_n)</math> is the number of phonons in the box with energy <math>E_n</math>. In other words, the total energy is equal to the sum of energy multiplied by the number of phonons with that energy (in one dimension). In 3 dimensions we have:\n\n:<math>U = \\sum_{n_x}\\sum_{n_y}\\sum_{n_z}E_n\\,\\bar{N}(E_n)\\,.</math>\n\nHere, the '''Debye model''' and [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] differ. Unlike electromagnetic radiation in a box, there is a finite number of [[phonon]] energy states because a [[phonon]] cannot have arbitrarily high frequencies. Its frequency is bounded by the medium of its propagation\u2014the atomic lattice of the solid. Consider an illustration of a transverse phonon below.\n\n:::::[[Image:Debye limit.svg|400px]]\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that the minimum wavelength of a [[phonon]] is twice the atom separation, as shown in the lower figure.

However, as shown below,  <math> kT_{\\rm D}</math>  is roughly equal to the phonon energy of  the minimum wavelength mode, and so we can interpret the Debye temperature as the temperature at which the highest-frequency mode (and hence every mode) is excited.\n\nContinuing, we then have the specific internal energy:\n:<math>\\frac{U}{Nk} = 9T \\left({T\\over T_{\\rm D}}\\right)^3\\int_0^{T_{\\rm D}/T} {x^3\\over e^x-1}\\, dx = 3T D_3 \\left({T_{\\rm D}\\over T}\\right)\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>D_3(x)</math> is the (third) [[Debye function]].\n\nDifferentiating with respect to <math>T</math> we get the dimensionless heat capacity:\n\n:<math> \\frac{C_V}{Nk} = 9 \\left({T\\over T_{\\rm D}}\\right)^3\\int_0^{T_{\\rm D}/T} {x^4 e^x\\over\\left(e^x-1\\right)^2}\\, dx\\,.</math>\n\nThese formulae treat the Debye model at all temperatures. The more elementary formulae given further down give the asymptotic behavior in the limit of low and high temperatures. As already mentioned, this behaviour is exact, in contrast to the intermediate behaviour. The essential reason for the exactness at low and high energies, respectively, is that the Debye model gives (i) the exact ''[[dispersion relation]]'' <math>E(\\nu )</math> at low frequencies, and (ii) corresponds to the exact [[Density of states#Density of wave vector states|density of states]] <math>(\\int g(\\nu ) \\, {\\rm d\\nu}\\equiv 3N)\\,</math>, concerning the number of vibrations per frequency interval.\n\n== Debye's derivation ==\n\nActually, Debye derived his equation somewhat differently and more simply. Using [[continuum mechanics]], he found that the number of vibrational states with a frequency less than a particular value was asymptotic to\n\n:<math> n \\sim {1 \\over 3} \\nu^3 V F\\,, </math>\n\nin which <math> V </math> is the volume and <math> F </math> is a factor which he calculated from [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity coefficient]]s and density. Combining this formula with the expected energy of a harmonic oscillator at temperature T (already used by [[Einstein solid|Einstein]] in his model) would give an energy of\n\n:<math>U = \\int_0^\\infty \\,{h\\nu^3 V F\\over e^{h\\nu/kT}-1}\\, d\\nu\\,,</math>\n\nif the vibrational frequencies continued to infinity. This form gives the <math>T^3</math> behavior which is correct at low temperatures. But Debye realized that there could not be more than <math>3N</math> vibrational states for N atoms. He made the assumption that in an atomic solid, the spectrum of frequencies of the vibrational states would continue to follow the above rule, up to a maximum frequency <math>\\nu_m</math>chosen so that the total number of states is <math>3N</math>:\n\n:<math> 3N = {1 \\over 3} \\nu_m^3 V F \\,.</math>\n\nDebye knew that this assumption was not really correct (the higher frequencies are more closely spaced than assumed), but it guarantees the proper behavior at high temperature (the [[Dulong\u2013Petit law]]). The energy is then given by:\n\n:<math>U = \\int_0^{\\nu_m} \\,{h\\nu^3 V F\\over e^{h\\nu/kT}-1}\\, d\\nu\\,,</math>\n\n::<math> = V F kT (kT/h)^3 \\int_0^{T_{\\rm D}/T} \\,{x^3 \\over e^x-1}\\, dx\\,,</math>\n\n::where <math>T_{\\rm D}</math> is <math>h\\nu_m/k</math>.\n\n::<math> = 9 N k T (T/T_{\\rm D})^3 \\int_0^{T_{\\rm D}/T} \\,{x^3 \\over e^x-1}\\, dx\\,,</math>\n\n::<math> = 3 N k T D_3(T_{\\rm D}/T)\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>D_3</math> is the function later given the name of third-order [[Debye function]].\n\n== Another derivation ==\nFirst we derive the vibrational frequency distribution; the following derivation is based on Appendix VI from.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Terrell L.|title=An Introduction to Statistical Mechanics|date=1960|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.|location=Reading, Massachusetts, U.S.A.|isbn=9780486652429|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontost0000hill}}</ref> Consider a three-dimensional isotropic elastic solid with N atoms in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped with side-lengths <math>L_x, L_y, L_z</math>.

Using <math>e^x - 1\\approx  x</math> if <math>|x| \\ll 1</math>leads to\n\n:<math> \\frac{C_V}{Nk} \\sim 9 \\left({T\\over T_{\\rm D}}\\right)^3\\int_0^{T_{\\rm D}/T} {x^4 \\over x^2}\\, dx </math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{C_V}{Nk} \\sim 3\\,.</math>\nThis is the [[Dulong\u2013Petit law]], and is fairly accurate although it does not take into account anharmonicity, which causes the heat capacity to rise further. The total heat capacity of the solid, if it is a [[electrical conductor|conductor]] or [[semiconductor]], may also contain a non-negligible contribution from the electrons.\n\n== Debye versus Einstein ==\n\n[[Image:DebyeVSEinstein.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|'''Debye vs. Einstein'''. Predicted heat capacity as a function of temperature.|right|300px]]\n\nSo how closely do the Debye and Einstein models correspond to experiment? Surprisingly close, but Debye is correct at low temperatures whereas Einstein is not.\n\nHow different are the models? To answer that question one would naturally plot the two on the same set of axes... except one can't. Both the Einstein model and the Debye model provide a ''functional form'' for the heat capacity. They are ''models'', and no model is without a scale. A scale relates the model to its real-world counterpart. One can see that the scale of the Einstein model, which is given by\n\n:<math>C_V = 3Nk\\left({\\epsilon\\over k T}\\right)^2{e^{\\epsilon/kT}\\over \\left(e^{\\epsilon/kT}-1\\right)^2}</math>\n\nis <math>\\epsilon/k</math>.  And the scale of the Debye model is <math>T_{\\rm D}</math>, the Debye temperature. Both are usually found by fitting the models to the experimental data. (The Debye temperature can theoretically be calculated from the speed of sound and crystal dimensions.) Because the two methods approach the problem from different directions and different geometries, Einstein and Debye scales are '''not''' the same, that is to say\n\n:<math>{\\epsilon\\over k} \\ne T_{\\rm D}\\,,</math>\n\nwhich means that plotting them on the same set of axes makes no sense. They are two models of the same thing, but of different scales. If one defines '''Einstein temperature''' as\n\n:<math>T_{\\rm E} \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  {\\epsilon\\over k}\\,,</math>\n\nthen one can say\n\n:<math>T_{\\rm E} \\ne T_{\\rm D}\\,,</math>\n\nand, to relate the two, we must seek the ratio\n\n:<math>\\frac{T_{\\rm E}}{ T_{\\rm D}} = ?</math>\n\nThe [[Einstein solid]] is composed of '''single'''-frequency [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s, <math>\\epsilon = \\hbar\\omega = h\\nu</math>. That frequency, if it indeed existed, would be related to the speed of sound in the solid. If one imagines the propagation of sound as a sequence of atoms ''hitting'' one another, then it becomes obvious that the frequency of oscillation must correspond to the minimum wavelength sustainable by the atomic lattice, <math>\\lambda_{min}</math>.\n\n:<math>\\nu = {c_{\\rm s}\\over\\lambda} = {c_{\\rm s}\\sqrt[3]{N}\\over 2L} = {c_{\\rm s}\\over 2}\\sqrt[3]{N\\over V}</math>\n\nwhich makes the '''Einstein temperature'''\n\n:<math>T_{\\rm E} = {\\epsilon\\over k} = {h\\nu\\over k} = {h c_{\\rm s}\\over 2k}\\sqrt[3]{N\\over V}\\,,</math>\n\nand the sought ratio is therefore\n\n:<math>{T_{\\rm E}\\over T_{\\rm D}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\pi\\over6}\\ = 0.805995977...</math>\n\nNow both models can be plotted on the same graph. Note that this ratio is the cube root of the ratio of the volume of one octant of a 3-dimensional sphere to the volume of the cube that contains it, which is just the correction factor used by Debye when approximating the energy integral above.\n\nAlternately the ratio of the 2 temperatures can be seen to be the ratio of Einstein's single frequency at which all oscillators oscillate and Debye's maximum frequency.  Einstein's single frequency can then be seen to be a mean of the frequencies available to the Debye model.\n\n== Debye temperature table ==\nEven though the Debye model is not completely correct, it gives a good approximation for the low temperature heat capacity of insulating, crystalline solids where other contributions (such as highly mobile conduction electrons) are negligible. For metals, the electron contribution to the heat is proportional to <math>T</math>, which at low temperatures dominates the Debye <math>T^3</math> result for lattice vibrations. In this case, the Debye model can only be said to approximate for the lattice ''contribution'' to the specific heat.

In this case at low frequencies one has different [[dispersion relation]]s, e.g., <math>E(\\nu )\\propto k^2</math> in the case of magnons, instead of <math>E(\\nu )\\propto k</math> for phonons (with <math>k=2\\pi /\\lambda </math>). One also has different [[Density of states#Density of wave vector states|density of states]] (e.g., <math>\\int g(\\nu ){\\rm d}\\nu \\equiv N\\,</math>). As a consequence, in ferromagnets one gets a magnon contribution\nto the heat capacity, <math>\\Delta C_{\\,{\\rm V|\\,magnon}}\\,\\propto T^{3/2}</math>, which dominates at sufficiently low temperatures the phonon contribution, <math>\\,\\Delta C_{\\,{\\rm V|\\,phonon}}\\propto T^3</math>.

That is: including different directions and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]s. He assumed the total number of modes per polarization to be <math>3N</math> (with <math>N</math> the amount of masses in the system), or in mathematical language<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=3 N</math>,\n\nwhere the <math>3</math> on both sides is because of the three polarizations, so the sum runs over all modes for one specific polarization. Debye made this assumption because he knew from [[classical mechanics]] that the number of modes per polarization in a chain of masses should always be equal to the amount of masses in the chain.\n\nThe left hand side is now to be made explicit to show how it depends on the Debye frequency (here simply introduced as a cut-off frequency, that is: higher frequencies than the Debye frequency cannot exist), so that an expression for it could be found.\n\nFirst of all, by assuming <math>L</math> to be very large (<math>L</math>>>1, with <math>L</math> the size of the system in any of the three directions) the smallest wave vector in any direction could be approximated by: <math> d k_i = 2 \\pi / L </math>, with <math>i = x, y, z</math>. Smaller wave vectors cannot exist because of the [[periodic boundary conditions]]. Thus the summation would become [https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/oxford-solid-state-basics 4]\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=\\frac {3 V}{(2 \\pi)^3} \\iiint d \\mathbf k</math>,\n\nwhere <math> \\mathbf k \\equiv (k_x, k_y, k_z) </math>; <math> V \\equiv L^3 </math> is the size of the system; and the integral is (as the summation) over all possible modes, which is assumed to be a finite region (bounded by the cut-off frequency).\n\nThe triple integral could be rewritten as a single integral over all possible values of the absolute value of <math> \\mathbf k </math> (see: [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian for spherical coordinates]]).

The number of modes remains unchanged, because there are still three polarizations. So\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=3 N</math>.\n\nThe rest of the derivation is analogous to the previous, so again the left hand side is rewritten;\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=\\frac {3 L}{2 \\pi} \\int_{-k_{\\rm D}}^{k_{\\rm D}}d k = \\frac {3 L}{\\pi v_{\\rm s}} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{\\rm D}}d \\omega</math>.\n\nIn the last step the multiplication by two is because <math>k</math> runs negative, but <math> \\omega </math> does not. \nWe continue;\n\n:<math> \\frac {3 L}{\\pi v_{\\rm s}} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{\\rm D}}d \\omega = \\frac {3 L}{\\pi v_{\\rm s}} \\omega_{\\rm D} = 3 N </math>.\n\nConclusion:\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {\\pi v_{\\rm s} N}{L} </math>.\n\n====Two dimensional crystal====\nThe same derivation could be done for a two dimensional crystal. Again, the number of modes remains unchanged, because there are still three polarizations. The derivation is analogous to the previous two. We start with the same equation,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=3 N</math>.\n\nAnd then the left hand side is rewritten and equated to <math>3N</math>\n\n:<math> \\sum_{\\rm modes}3=\\frac {3 A}{(2 \\pi)^2} \\iint d \\mathbf k = \\frac {3 A}{2 \\pi v_{\\rm s}^2} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{\\rm D}} \\omega d \\omega = \\frac {3 A \\omega_{\\rm D}^2}{4 \\pi v_{\\rm s}^2} = 3 N </math>,\n\nwhere <math> A \\equiv L^2</math> is the size of the system.\n\nConclusion\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^2 = \\frac {4 \\pi N}{A} v_{\\rm s}^2 </math>.\n\n===Allowing polarization to make a difference===\nAs mentioned in the introduction: in general, longitudinal waves have a different wave velocity than transverse waves. For clarity they were first assumed to be equal, but now we drop that assumption.\n\nThe dispersion relation becomes <math> \\omega_i = v_{s,i}|\\mathbf k|</math>, where <math> i = 1, 2, 3 </math>, which correspond to the three polarizations. The cut-off frequency (Debye frequency) however does not depend on <math>i</math>. And we can write the total number of modes as <math> \\sum_{i}\\sum_{\\rm modes} 1 </math>, which is again equal to <math>3 N</math>. Here the summation over the modes is (although not explicitly stated) dependent on <math>i</math>.\n\n====One dimension====\nOnce again the summation over the modes is rewritten\n\n:<math> \\sum_{i}\\sum_{\\rm modes} 1 = \\sum_i \\frac {L}{\\pi v_{s,i}} \\int_0^{\\omega_{\\rm D}} d \\omega_i = 3 N </math>.\n\nThe result is\n\n:<math> \\frac {L \\omega_{\\rm D}}{\\pi} (\\frac {1}{v_{s,1}} + \\frac {1}{v_{s,2}} + \\frac {1}{v_{s,3}}) = 3 N </math>.\n\nThus the Debye frequency is found\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {3 \\pi N}{L} \\frac {v_{s,1} v_{s,2} v_{s,3}}{v_{s,2} v_{s,3} + v_{s,1} v_{s,3} + v_{s,1} v_{s,2}} </math>.\n\nOr by assuming the two transverse polarizations to be the same (to have the same phase speed and frequency)\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {3 \\pi N}{L} \\frac {v_{s,t}^2 v_{s,l}}{2 v_{s,t} v_{s,l} + v_{s,t}^2} </math>.\n\nOne can check this relation is equivalent to the one found earlier (when polarization did not make a difference) by setting <math> v_{s,t} = v_{s,l} </math>.\n\n====Two dimensions====\nThe same derivation can be done for a two dimensional crystal to find (the derivation is analogous to previous derivations)\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^2 = \\frac {12 \\pi N}{A} \\frac {(v_{s,1} v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^2}{(v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^2 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,3})^2 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,2})^2} </math>.\n\nOr by assuming the two transverse polarizations are equal (although for two dimensions it would be more logical if all polarizations would be different):\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^2 = \\frac {12 \\pi N}{A} \\frac {(v_{s,t}^2 v_{s,l})^2}{2 (v_{s,t} v_{s,l})^2 + v_{s,t}^4} </math>.\n\nAgain, one can check this relation is equivalent to the one found earlier by setting <math> v_{s,t} = v_{s,l} </math>.\n\n====Three dimensions====\nThe same derivation can be done for a three dimensional crystal to find (the derivation is analogous to previous derivations)\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^3 = \\frac {18 \\pi^2 N}{V} \\frac {(v_{s,1} v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^3}{(v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^3 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,3})^3 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,2})^3} </math>.\n\nOr by assuming the two transverse polarizations are equal (although for three dimensions it would be more logical when all polarizations would be the same):\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^3 = \\frac {18 \\pi^2 N}{V} \\frac {(v_{s,t}^2 v_{s,l})^3}{2 (v_{s,t} v_{s,l})^3 + v_{s,t}^6} </math>.\n\nAgain, one can check this relation is equivalent to the one found earlier by setting <math> v_{s,t} = v_{s,l} </math>.\n\n===Derivation with the actual dispersion relation===\n[[File:phonon k 3k.gif|right|thumb|250px|Because only the [[Discretization|discretized]] points matter, two different waves could render the same physical manifestation (see [[Phonon]]).]]\nThis problem could be made more insightful by making it more complex. Instead of using the dispersion relation <math> \\omega = v_{\\rm s} k </math>, the correct dispersion relation is now going to be assumed. From classical mechanics it is known that for an equidistant chain of masses which interact harmonically with each other the dispersion relation reads as follows<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<math> \\omega (k) = 2 \\sqrt {\\frac {\\kappa}{m}}\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac {k a}{2}\\right)\\right| </math>.\n\nAfter plotting this relation, it is clear that Debye's estimation of the cut-off wavelength was right after all. Because for every wavenumber bigger than <math>\\pi / a </math> (that is: <math> \\lambda </math> is smaller than <math>2 a</math>) a wavenumber that is smaller than <math>\\pi / a</math> could be found with the same angular frequency. This means the resulting physical manifestation for the mode with the larger wavenumber is indistinguishable from the one with the smaller wavenumber. This is possible because of the fact that the system consists of [[Discretization|discretized]] points, as is demonstrated in the animated picture. Dividing the dispersion relation by <math>k</math> and inserting <math>\\pi / a</math> for <math>k</math>, we find the speed of a wave with <math>k = \\pi / a</math> to be\n\n<math> v_{\\rm s}(k = \\pi / a) = \\frac {2 a}{\\pi} \\sqrt {\\frac {\\kappa}{m}} </math>.\n\nBy simply inserting <math>k = \\pi/a</math> in the original dispersion relation we find\n\n<math> \\omega(k = \\pi / a) = 2 \\sqrt {\\frac {\\kappa}{m}} = \\omega_{\\rm D} </math>.\n\nCombining these results the same result is once again found\n\n<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {\\pi v_{\\rm s}}{a} </math>.\n\nHowever, for diatomic chains (and more complex chains) the associated cut-off frequency (and wavelength) is not very accurate, since the cut-off wavelength is twice as big and the dispersion relation exists of two branches (for a diatomic chain). It is also not certain from this whether for more dimensional systems the cut-off frequency was accurately predicted by Debye.\n\n===Alternative derivation===\n[[File:CPT-sound-nyquist-thereom-1.5percycle.svg|thumb|250px|The physical result of two waves can be identical when at least one of them has a wavelength that is bigger than twice the initial distance between the masses (taken from [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]]).]]\n\nFor a one dimensional chain this result could also be reproduced using theory on aliasing. The [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]] is used in the following derivation; the main difference being that in the following derivation the discretization is not in time, but in space. If we use the correct dispersion relation from last paragraph, it will be clear in another insightful way why the cut-off frequency has the value previously (twice) derived. So again,\n\n<math> \\omega (k) = 2 \\sqrt {\\frac {\\kappa}{m}}\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac {k a}{2}\\right)\\right| </math>\n\nis assumed.\n\nThis derivation is completely equivalent to the previous one, that is: the same assumptions are made to retrieve the result. It is not more or less accurate, it is just a different approach.\n\nTo determine where the cut-off frequency should be, it is useful to first determine where the cut-off of the wavelength should be. From the dispersion relation we know that for <math> k > \\pi / a </math> every mode is repeated, so the cut-off wavelength would be at <math> \\lambda_{\\rm D} = 2 a </math>. From this and the periodic boundary conditions you can immediately see that the total number of modes per polarization would be <math>N</math>. As seen in the gif of the previous paragraph this is because every wave with a wavelength shorter than <math>2a</math> could be replaced by a wave with a wavelength longer than <math> 2a </math> to regain the same physical result.\n\nHowever, the dispersion relation from previous paragraph (the correct one) is not even necessary in reasoning as to why the cut-off should be at <math> \\lambda = 2a </math>. Because, as is depicted, only waves with a longer wavelength than <math> 2a </math> could render the same physical result as another one. So this is another way to correctly predict the cut-off wavelength without using the correct dispersion relation (or even knowledge from classical mechanics as Debye did). However, using the wrong dispersion relation which Debye assumed, waves with a smaller wavelength would have a higher frequency, but the relative movement of the masses would be the same, so this does not render new modes.\n\nThis results again in <math> k_{\\rm D} = \\pi / a </math>, rendering\n\n<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {\\pi v_{\\rm s}}{a} </math>.\n\nAlso here it does not matter which dispersion relation is used (the correct one or the one Debye used), the same cut-off frequency would be found.\n\nUnfortunately, the same method could not be used (as easily) for a two- or three-dimensional crystal, because diagonal waves would have a larger cut-off wavelength, which are also difficult to predict.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Bose gas]]\n* [[Debye frequency]]\n* [[Gas in a box]]\n* [[Kinetic theory of solids]]\n* [[Gr\u00fcneisen parameter]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n*''CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 56th Edition (1975\u20131976)\n*Schroeder, Daniel V.

The Debye model correctly predicts the low temperature dependence of the heat capacity, which is proportional to <math>T^3</math> \u2013 the '''Debye ''T''<sup>3</sup> law'''. Just like the [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]], it also recovers the [[Dulong\u2013Petit law]] at high temperatures. But due to simplifying assumptions, its accuracy suffers at intermediate temperatures.\n\n== Derivation ==\nThe Debye model is a solid-state equivalent of [[Planck's law of black body radiation]], where one treats [[electromagnetic radiation]] as a [[photon gas]]. The Debye model treats atomic vibrations as [[phonon]]s in a box (the box being the solid). Most of the calculation steps are identical as both are examples of a massless [[Bose gas]] with linear dispersion relation.\n\nConsider a cube of side <math>L</math>. From the [[particle in a box]] article, the resonating modes of the sonic disturbances inside the box (considering for now only those aligned with one axis) have wavelengths given by\n\n:<math>\\lambda_n = {2L\\over n}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>n</math> is an integer. The energy of a phonon is\n\n:<math>E_n\\ =h\\nu_n\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\nu_{n}</math> is the frequency of the phonon. Making the approximation that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength, we have:\n\n:<math>E_n=h\\nu_n={hc_{\\rm s}\\over\\lambda_n}={hc_sn\\over 2L}\\,,</math>\n\nin which <math>c_s</math> is the speed of sound inside the solid.\nIn three dimensions we will use:\n\n:<math>E_n^2={p_n^2 c_{\\rm s}^2}=\\left({hc_{\\rm s}\\over2L}\\right)^2\\left(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2\\right)\\,,</math>\n\nin which <math>p_n</math> is the magnitude of the three-dimensional momentum of the phonon.\n\nThe approximation that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength (giving a constant speed of sound) is good for low-energy phonons but not for high-energy phonons (see the article on [[phonon]]s.) This disagreement is one of the limitations of the Debye model, and corresponds to incorrectness of the results at intermediate temperatures, whereas both at low temperatures and also at high temperatures they are exact.\n\nLet's now compute the total energy in the box,\n\n:<math>E = \\sum_n E_n\\,\\bar{N}(E_n)\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{N}(E_n)</math> is the number of phonons in the box with energy <math>E_n</math>. In other words, the total energy is equal to the sum of energy multiplied by the number of phonons with that energy (in one dimension). In 3 dimensions we have:\n\n:<math>U = \\sum_{n_x}\\sum_{n_y}\\sum_{n_z}E_n\\,\\bar{N}(E_n)\\,.</math>\n\nHere, the '''Debye model''' and [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] differ. Unlike electromagnetic radiation in a box, there is a finite number of [[phonon]] energy states because a [[phonon]] cannot have arbitrarily high frequencies. Its frequency is bounded by the medium of its propagation\u2014the atomic lattice of the solid. Consider an illustration of a transverse phonon below.\n\n:::::[[Image:Debye limit.svg|400px]]\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that the minimum wavelength of a [[phonon]] is twice the atom separation, as shown in the lower figure. There are <math>N</math> atoms in a solid.  Our solid is a cube, which means there are  <math>\\sqrt[3]{N}</math> atoms per edge. Atom separation is then given by <math>L/\\sqrt[3]{N}</math>, and the minimum wavelength is\n\n:<math>\\lambda_{\\rm min} = {2L \\over \\sqrt[3]{N}}\\,,</math>\n\nmaking the maximum mode number <math>n</math> (infinite for [[photon]]s)\n\n:<math>n_{\\rm max} = \\sqrt[3]{N}\\,.</math>\n\nThis number bounds the upper limit of the triple energy sum\n\n:<math>U = \\sum_{n_x}^{\\sqrt[3]{N}}\\sum_{n_y}^{\\sqrt[3]{N}}\\sum_{n_z}^{\\sqrt[3]{N}}E_n\\,\\bar{N}(E_n)\\,.</math>\n\nFor slowly varying, well-behaved functions, a sum can be replaced with an integral (also known as [[Thomas\u2013Fermi approximation]])\n\n:<math>U \\approx\\int_0^{\\sqrt[3]{N}}\\int_0^{\\sqrt[3]{N}}\\int_0^{\\sqrt[3]{N}} E(n)\\,\\bar{N}\\left(E(n)\\right)\\,dn_x\\, dn_y\\, dn_z\\,.</math>\n\nSo far, there has been no mention of <math>\\bar{N}(E)</math>, the number of phonons with energy <math>E\\,.</math> Phonons obey [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]]. Their distribution is given by the famous Bose\u2013Einstein formula\n\n:<math>\\langle N\\rangle_{BE} = {1\\over e^{E/kT}-1}\\,.</math>\n\nBecause a phonon has three possible polarization states (one [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]], and two [[transverse wave|transverse]] which approximately do not affect its\nenergy) the formula above must be multiplied by 3,\n\n:<math>\\bar{N}(E) = {3\\over e^{E/kT}-1}\\,.</math>\n\n(Actually one uses an ''effective sonic velocity'' <math>c_s:=c_{{\\rm eff}}</math>, i.e. the Debye temperature <math>T_{\\rm D}</math> (see below) is proportional to <math>c_{{\\rm eff}}</math>, more precisely <math>T_{\\rm D}^{-3}\\propto c_{{\\rm eff}}^{-3}:=(1/3)c_{{\\rm long}}^{-3}+(2/3)c_{{\\rm trans}}^{-3}</math>, where one distinguishes longitudinal and transversal sound-wave velocities (contributions 1/3 and 2/3, respectively). The Debye temperature or the effective sonic velocity is a measure of the hardness of the crystal.)\n\nSubstituting into the energy integral yields\n\n:<math>U  = \\int_0^{\\sqrt[3]{N}}\\int_0^{\\sqrt[3]{N}}\\int_0^{\\sqrt[3]{N}} E(n)\\,{3\\over e^{E(n)/kT}-1}\\,dn_x\\, dn_y\\, dn_z\\,.</math>\n\nThe ease with which these integrals are evaluated for [[photon]]s is due to the fact that light's frequency, at least semi-classically, is unbound.

However, as shown below,  <math> kT_{\\rm D}</math>  is roughly equal to the phonon energy of  the minimum wavelength mode, and so we can interpret the Debye temperature as the temperature at which the highest-frequency mode (and hence every mode) is excited.\n\nContinuing, we then have the specific internal energy:\n:<math>\\frac{U}{Nk} = 9T \\left({T\\over T_{\\rm D}}\\right)^3\\int_0^{T_{\\rm D}/T} {x^3\\over e^x-1}\\, dx = 3T D_3 \\left({T_{\\rm D}\\over T}\\right)\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>D_3(x)</math> is the (third) [[Debye function]].\n\nDifferentiating with respect to <math>T</math> we get the dimensionless heat capacity:\n\n:<math> \\frac{C_V}{Nk} = 9 \\left({T\\over T_{\\rm D}}\\right)^3\\int_0^{T_{\\rm D}/T} {x^4 e^x\\over\\left(e^x-1\\right)^2}\\, dx\\,.</math>\n\nThese formulae treat the Debye model at all temperatures. The more elementary formulae given further down give the asymptotic behavior in the limit of low and high temperatures. As already mentioned, this behaviour is exact, in contrast to the intermediate behaviour. The essential reason for the exactness at low and high energies, respectively, is that the Debye model gives (i) the exact ''[[dispersion relation]]'' <math>E(\\nu )</math> at low frequencies, and (ii) corresponds to the exact [[Density of states#Density of wave vector states|density of states]] <math>(\\int g(\\nu ) \\, {\\rm d\\nu}\\equiv 3N)\\,</math>, concerning the number of vibrations per frequency interval.\n\n== Debye's derivation ==\n\nActually, Debye derived his equation somewhat differently and more simply. Using [[continuum mechanics]], he found that the number of vibrational states with a frequency less than a particular value was asymptotic to\n\n:<math> n \\sim {1 \\over 3} \\nu^3 V F\\,, </math>\n\nin which <math> V </math> is the volume and <math> F </math> is a factor which he calculated from [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity coefficient]]s and density. Combining this formula with the expected energy of a harmonic oscillator at temperature T (already used by [[Einstein solid|Einstein]] in his model) would give an energy of\n\n:<math>U = \\int_0^\\infty \\,{h\\nu^3 V F\\over e^{h\\nu/kT}-1}\\, d\\nu\\,,</math>\n\nif the vibrational frequencies continued to infinity. This form gives the <math>T^3</math> behavior which is correct at low temperatures. But Debye realized that there could not be more than <math>3N</math> vibrational states for N atoms. He made the assumption that in an atomic solid, the spectrum of frequencies of the vibrational states would continue to follow the above rule, up to a maximum frequency <math>\\nu_m</math>chosen so that the total number of states is <math>3N</math>:\n\n:<math> 3N = {1 \\over 3} \\nu_m^3 V F \\,.</math>\n\nDebye knew that this assumption was not really correct (the higher frequencies are more closely spaced than assumed), but it guarantees the proper behavior at high temperature (the [[Dulong\u2013Petit law]]). The energy is then given by:\n\n:<math>U = \\int_0^{\\nu_m} \\,{h\\nu^3 V F\\over e^{h\\nu/kT}-1}\\, d\\nu\\,,</math>\n\n::<math> = V F kT (kT/h)^3 \\int_0^{T_{\\rm D}/T} \\,{x^3 \\over e^x-1}\\, dx\\,,</math>\n\n::where <math>T_{\\rm D}</math> is <math>h\\nu_m/k</math>.\n\n::<math> = 9 N k T (T/T_{\\rm D})^3 \\int_0^{T_{\\rm D}/T} \\,{x^3 \\over e^x-1}\\, dx\\,,</math>\n\n::<math> = 3 N k T D_3(T_{\\rm D}/T)\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>D_3</math> is the function later given the name of third-order [[Debye function]].\n\n== Another derivation ==\nFirst we derive the vibrational frequency distribution; the following derivation is based on Appendix VI from.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Terrell L.|title=An Introduction to Statistical Mechanics|date=1960|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.|location=Reading, Massachusetts, U.S.A.|isbn=9780486652429|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontost0000hill}}</ref> Consider a three-dimensional isotropic elastic solid with N atoms in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped with side-lengths <math>L_x, L_y, L_z</math>.

The total heat capacity of the solid, if it is a [[electrical conductor|conductor]] or [[semiconductor]], may also contain a non-negligible contribution from the electrons.\n\n== Debye versus Einstein ==\n\n[[Image:DebyeVSEinstein.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|'''Debye vs. Einstein'''. Predicted heat capacity as a function of temperature.|right|300px]]\n\nSo how closely do the Debye and Einstein models correspond to experiment? Surprisingly close, but Debye is correct at low temperatures whereas Einstein is not.\n\nHow different are the models? To answer that question one would naturally plot the two on the same set of axes... except one can't. Both the Einstein model and the Debye model provide a ''functional form'' for the heat capacity. They are ''models'', and no model is without a scale. A scale relates the model to its real-world counterpart. One can see that the scale of the Einstein model, which is given by\n\n:<math>C_V = 3Nk\\left({\\epsilon\\over k T}\\right)^2{e^{\\epsilon/kT}\\over \\left(e^{\\epsilon/kT}-1\\right)^2}</math>\n\nis <math>\\epsilon/k</math>.  And the scale of the Debye model is <math>T_{\\rm D}</math>, the Debye temperature. Both are usually found by fitting the models to the experimental data. (The Debye temperature can theoretically be calculated from the speed of sound and crystal dimensions.) Because the two methods approach the problem from different directions and different geometries, Einstein and Debye scales are '''not''' the same, that is to say\n\n:<math>{\\epsilon\\over k} \\ne T_{\\rm D}\\,,</math>\n\nwhich means that plotting them on the same set of axes makes no sense. They are two models of the same thing, but of different scales. If one defines '''Einstein temperature''' as\n\n:<math>T_{\\rm E} \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  {\\epsilon\\over k}\\,,</math>\n\nthen one can say\n\n:<math>T_{\\rm E} \\ne T_{\\rm D}\\,,</math>\n\nand, to relate the two, we must seek the ratio\n\n:<math>\\frac{T_{\\rm E}}{ T_{\\rm D}} = ?</math>\n\nThe [[Einstein solid]] is composed of '''single'''-frequency [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s, <math>\\epsilon = \\hbar\\omega = h\\nu</math>. That frequency, if it indeed existed, would be related to the speed of sound in the solid. If one imagines the propagation of sound as a sequence of atoms ''hitting'' one another, then it becomes obvious that the frequency of oscillation must correspond to the minimum wavelength sustainable by the atomic lattice, <math>\\lambda_{min}</math>.\n\n:<math>\\nu = {c_{\\rm s}\\over\\lambda} = {c_{\\rm s}\\sqrt[3]{N}\\over 2L} = {c_{\\rm s}\\over 2}\\sqrt[3]{N\\over V}</math>\n\nwhich makes the '''Einstein temperature'''\n\n:<math>T_{\\rm E} = {\\epsilon\\over k} = {h\\nu\\over k} = {h c_{\\rm s}\\over 2k}\\sqrt[3]{N\\over V}\\,,</math>\n\nand the sought ratio is therefore\n\n:<math>{T_{\\rm E}\\over T_{\\rm D}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\pi\\over6}\\ = 0.805995977...</math>\n\nNow both models can be plotted on the same graph. Note that this ratio is the cube root of the ratio of the volume of one octant of a 3-dimensional sphere to the volume of the cube that contains it, which is just the correction factor used by Debye when approximating the energy integral above.\n\nAlternately the ratio of the 2 temperatures can be seen to be the ratio of Einstein's single frequency at which all oscillators oscillate and Debye's maximum frequency.  Einstein's single frequency can then be seen to be a mean of the frequencies available to the Debye model.\n\n== Debye temperature table ==\nEven though the Debye model is not completely correct, it gives a good approximation for the low temperature heat capacity of insulating, crystalline solids where other contributions (such as highly mobile conduction electrons) are negligible. For metals, the electron contribution to the heat is proportional to <math>T</math>, which at low temperatures dominates the Debye <math>T^3</math> result for lattice vibrations. In this case, the Debye model can only be said to approximate for the lattice ''contribution'' to the specific heat. The following table lists Debye temperatures for several pure elements<ref name=Kittel/> and sapphire:\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| [[Aluminium]]\n| {{0}}428 K\n|-\n| [[Beryllium]]\n| 1440 K\n|-\n| [[Cadmium]]\n| {{0}}209 K\n|-\n| [[Caesium]]\n| {{0}}{{0}}38 K\n|-\n| [[Carbon]]\n| 2230 K\n|-\n| [[Chromium]]\n| {{0}}630 K\n|-\n|}\n||\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| [[Copper]]\n| {{0}}343 K\n|-\n| [[Germanium]]\n| {{0}}374 K\n|-\n| [[Gold]]\n| {{0}}170 K\n|-\n| [[Iron]]\n| {{0}}470 K\n|-\n| [[Lead]]\n| {{0}}105 K\n|-\n| [[Manganese]]\n| {{0}}410 K\n|-\n|}\n||\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| [[Nickel]]\n| {{0}}450 K\n|-\n| [[Platinum]]\n| {{0}}240 K\n|-\n| [[Rubidium]]\n| {{0}}{{0}}56 K\n|-\n| [[Sapphire]]\n| 1047 K\n|-\n| [[Selenium]]\n| {{0}}{{0}}90 K\n|-\n| [[Silicon]]\n| {{0}}645 K\n|}\n||\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| [[Silver]]\n| {{0}}215 K\n|-\n| [[Tantalum]]\n| {{0}}240 K\n|-\n| [[Tin]] (white)\n| {{0}}200 K\n|-\n| [[Titanium]]\n| {{0}}420 K\n|-\n| [[Tungsten]]\n| {{0}}400 K\n|-\n| [[Zinc]]\n| {{0}}327 K\n|}\n|\n|}\nThe Debye model's fit to experimental data is often phenomenologically improved by allowing the Debye temperature to become temperature dependent;<ref>{{cite book |title=Solid-State Physics: Introduction to the Theory |first1=James D |last1=Patterson |first2=Bernard C. |last2=Bailey |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-34933-4 |year=2007 |pages=96\u201397}}</ref>  for example, the value for water ice increases from about 222 K<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Shulman | first1 = L.

In this case at low frequencies one has different [[dispersion relation]]s, e.g., <math>E(\\nu )\\propto k^2</math> in the case of magnons, instead of <math>E(\\nu )\\propto k</math> for phonons (with <math>k=2\\pi /\\lambda </math>). One also has different [[Density of states#Density of wave vector states|density of states]] (e.g., <math>\\int g(\\nu ){\\rm d}\\nu \\equiv N\\,</math>). As a consequence, in ferromagnets one gets a magnon contribution\nto the heat capacity, <math>\\Delta C_{\\,{\\rm V|\\,magnon}}\\,\\propto T^{3/2}</math>, which dominates at sufficiently low temperatures the phonon contribution, <math>\\,\\Delta C_{\\,{\\rm V|\\,phonon}}\\propto T^3</math>.

Since most energy is contained in these high-frequency modes, a simple modification of the Debye model is sufficient to yield a good approximation to experimental heat capacities of simple liquids.<ref>Bolmativ, Brazhin, Trachenko, ''The phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics'', [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00421, Sci Rep 2:421 (2012)]</ref>\n\n==Debye frequency==\nThe '''Debye frequency''' (Symbol: <math> \\omega_{\\rm Debye} </math> or <math> \\omega_{\\rm D} </math>) is a parameter in the Debye model.

That is: including different directions and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]s. He assumed the total number of modes per polarization to be <math>3N</math> (with <math>N</math> the amount of masses in the system), or in mathematical language<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=3 N</math>,\n\nwhere the <math>3</math> on both sides is because of the three polarizations, so the sum runs over all modes for one specific polarization. Debye made this assumption because he knew from [[classical mechanics]] that the number of modes per polarization in a chain of masses should always be equal to the amount of masses in the chain.\n\nThe left hand side is now to be made explicit to show how it depends on the Debye frequency (here simply introduced as a cut-off frequency, that is: higher frequencies than the Debye frequency cannot exist), so that an expression for it could be found.\n\nFirst of all, by assuming <math>L</math> to be very large (<math>L</math>>>1, with <math>L</math> the size of the system in any of the three directions) the smallest wave vector in any direction could be approximated by: <math> d k_i = 2 \\pi / L </math>, with <math>i = x, y, z</math>. Smaller wave vectors cannot exist because of the [[periodic boundary conditions]]. Thus the summation would become [https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/oxford-solid-state-basics 4]\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=\\frac {3 V}{(2 \\pi)^3} \\iiint d \\mathbf k</math>,\n\nwhere <math> \\mathbf k \\equiv (k_x, k_y, k_z) </math>; <math> V \\equiv L^3 </math> is the size of the system; and the integral is (as the summation) over all possible modes, which is assumed to be a finite region (bounded by the cut-off frequency).\n\nThe triple integral could be rewritten as a single integral over all possible values of the absolute value of <math> \\mathbf k </math> (see: [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian for spherical coordinates]]). The result is\n\n:<math>\\frac {3 V}{(2 \\pi)^3} \\iiint d \\mathbf k = \\frac {3 V}{2 \\pi^2} \\int_0^{k_{\\rm D}} |\\mathbf k|^2 d \\mathbf k </math>,\n\nwith <math>k_{\\rm D}</math> the absolute value of the wave vector corresponding with the Debye frequency, so <math>k_{\\rm D} = \\omega_{\\rm D}/v_{\\rm s}</math>.\n\nSince we know the dispersion relation to be <math>\\omega =v_{\\rm s}|\\mathbf k|</math>, this can be written as an integral over all possible <math> \\omega </math>\n\n:<math> \\frac {3 V}{2 \\pi^2} \\int_0^{k_{\\rm D}} |\\mathbf k|^2 d \\mathbf k = \\frac {3 V}{2 \\pi^2 v_{\\rm s}^3} \\int_0^{\\omega_{\\rm D}} \\omega^2 d \\omega </math>,\n\nAfter solving the integral it is again equated to <math>3 N</math> to find\n\n:<math> \\frac {V}{2 \\pi^2 v_{\\rm s}^3} \\omega_{\\rm D}^3 = 3 N </math>.\n\nConclusion:\n\n:<math>  \\omega_{\\rm D}^3 =\\frac {6 \\pi^2 N}{V} v_{\\rm s}^3 </math>.\n\n====One dimensional chain in 3D space====\nThe same derivation could be done for a one dimensional chain of atoms. The number of modes remains unchanged, because there are still three polarizations. So\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=3 N</math>.\n\nThe rest of the derivation is analogous to the previous, so again the left hand side is rewritten;\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=\\frac {3 L}{2 \\pi} \\int_{-k_{\\rm D}}^{k_{\\rm D}}d k = \\frac {3 L}{\\pi v_{\\rm s}} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{\\rm D}}d \\omega</math>.\n\nIn the last step the multiplication by two is because <math>k</math> runs negative, but <math> \\omega </math> does not. \nWe continue;\n\n:<math> \\frac {3 L}{\\pi v_{\\rm s}} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{\\rm D}}d \\omega = \\frac {3 L}{\\pi v_{\\rm s}} \\omega_{\\rm D} = 3 N </math>.\n\nConclusion:\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {\\pi v_{\\rm s} N}{L} </math>.\n\n====Two dimensional crystal====\nThe same derivation could be done for a two dimensional crystal. Again, the number of modes remains unchanged, because there are still three polarizations. The derivation is analogous to the previous two. We start with the same equation,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\rm modes}3=3 N</math>.\n\nAnd then the left hand side is rewritten and equated to <math>3N</math>\n\n:<math> \\sum_{\\rm modes}3=\\frac {3 A}{(2 \\pi)^2} \\iint d \\mathbf k = \\frac {3 A}{2 \\pi v_{\\rm s}^2} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{\\rm D}} \\omega d \\omega = \\frac {3 A \\omega_{\\rm D}^2}{4 \\pi v_{\\rm s}^2} = 3 N </math>,\n\nwhere <math> A \\equiv L^2</math> is the size of the system.\n\nConclusion\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^2 = \\frac {4 \\pi N}{A} v_{\\rm s}^2 </math>.\n\n===Allowing polarization to make a difference===\nAs mentioned in the introduction: in general, longitudinal waves have a different wave velocity than transverse waves. For clarity they were first assumed to be equal, but now we drop that assumption.\n\nThe dispersion relation becomes <math> \\omega_i = v_{s,i}|\\mathbf k|</math>, where <math> i = 1, 2, 3 </math>, which correspond to the three polarizations. The cut-off frequency (Debye frequency) however does not depend on <math>i</math>. And we can write the total number of modes as <math> \\sum_{i}\\sum_{\\rm modes} 1 </math>, which is again equal to <math>3 N</math>. Here the summation over the modes is (although not explicitly stated) dependent on <math>i</math>.\n\n====One dimension====\nOnce again the summation over the modes is rewritten\n\n:<math> \\sum_{i}\\sum_{\\rm modes} 1 = \\sum_i \\frac {L}{\\pi v_{s,i}} \\int_0^{\\omega_{\\rm D}} d \\omega_i = 3 N </math>.\n\nThe result is\n\n:<math> \\frac {L \\omega_{\\rm D}}{\\pi} (\\frac {1}{v_{s,1}} + \\frac {1}{v_{s,2}} + \\frac {1}{v_{s,3}}) = 3 N </math>.\n\nThus the Debye frequency is found\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {3 \\pi N}{L} \\frac {v_{s,1} v_{s,2} v_{s,3}}{v_{s,2} v_{s,3} + v_{s,1} v_{s,3} + v_{s,1} v_{s,2}} </math>.\n\nOr by assuming the two transverse polarizations to be the same (to have the same phase speed and frequency)\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {3 \\pi N}{L} \\frac {v_{s,t}^2 v_{s,l}}{2 v_{s,t} v_{s,l} + v_{s,t}^2} </math>.\n\nOne can check this relation is equivalent to the one found earlier (when polarization did not make a difference) by setting <math> v_{s,t} = v_{s,l} </math>.\n\n====Two dimensions====\nThe same derivation can be done for a two dimensional crystal to find (the derivation is analogous to previous derivations)\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^2 = \\frac {12 \\pi N}{A} \\frac {(v_{s,1} v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^2}{(v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^2 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,3})^2 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,2})^2} </math>.\n\nOr by assuming the two transverse polarizations are equal (although for two dimensions it would be more logical if all polarizations would be different):\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^2 = \\frac {12 \\pi N}{A} \\frac {(v_{s,t}^2 v_{s,l})^2}{2 (v_{s,t} v_{s,l})^2 + v_{s,t}^4} </math>.\n\nAgain, one can check this relation is equivalent to the one found earlier by setting <math> v_{s,t} = v_{s,l} </math>.\n\n====Three dimensions====\nThe same derivation can be done for a three dimensional crystal to find (the derivation is analogous to previous derivations)\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^3 = \\frac {18 \\pi^2 N}{V} \\frac {(v_{s,1} v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^3}{(v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^3 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,3})^3 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,2})^3} </math>.\n\nOr by assuming the two transverse polarizations are equal (although for three dimensions it would be more logical when all polarizations would be the same):\n\n:<math> \\omega_{\\rm D}^3 = \\frac {18 \\pi^2 N}{V} \\frac {(v_{s,t}^2 v_{s,l})^3}{2 (v_{s,t} v_{s,l})^3 + v_{s,t}^6} </math>.\n\nAgain, one can check this relation is equivalent to the one found earlier by setting <math> v_{s,t} = v_{s,l} </math>.\n\n===Derivation with the actual dispersion relation===\n[[File:phonon k 3k.gif|right|thumb|250px|Because only the [[Discretization|discretized]] points matter, two different waves could render the same physical manifestation (see [[Phonon]]).]]\nThis problem could be made more insightful by making it more complex. Instead of using the dispersion relation <math> \\omega = v_{\\rm s} k </math>, the correct dispersion relation is now going to be assumed. From classical mechanics it is known that for an equidistant chain of masses which interact harmonically with each other the dispersion relation reads as follows<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<math> \\omega (k) = 2 \\sqrt {\\frac {\\kappa}{m}}\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac {k a}{2}\\right)\\right| </math>.\n\nAfter plotting this relation, it is clear that Debye's estimation of the cut-off wavelength was right after all. Because for every wavenumber bigger than <math>\\pi / a </math> (that is: <math> \\lambda </math> is smaller than <math>2 a</math>) a wavenumber that is smaller than <math>\\pi / a</math> could be found with the same angular frequency. This means the resulting physical manifestation for the mode with the larger wavenumber is indistinguishable from the one with the smaller wavenumber. This is possible because of the fact that the system consists of [[Discretization|discretized]] points, as is demonstrated in the animated picture. Dividing the dispersion relation by <math>k</math> and inserting <math>\\pi / a</math> for <math>k</math>, we find the speed of a wave with <math>k = \\pi / a</math> to be\n\n<math> v_{\\rm s}(k = \\pi / a) = \\frac {2 a}{\\pi} \\sqrt {\\frac {\\kappa}{m}} </math>.\n\nBy simply inserting <math>k = \\pi/a</math> in the original dispersion relation we find\n\n<math> \\omega(k = \\pi / a) = 2 \\sqrt {\\frac {\\kappa}{m}} = \\omega_{\\rm D} </math>.\n\nCombining these results the same result is once again found\n\n<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {\\pi v_{\\rm s}}{a} </math>.\n\nHowever, for diatomic chains (and more complex chains) the associated cut-off frequency (and wavelength) is not very accurate, since the cut-off wavelength is twice as big and the dispersion relation exists of two branches (for a diatomic chain). It is also not certain from this whether for more dimensional systems the cut-off frequency was accurately predicted by Debye.\n\n===Alternative derivation===\n[[File:CPT-sound-nyquist-thereom-1.5percycle.svg|thumb|250px|The physical result of two waves can be identical when at least one of them has a wavelength that is bigger than twice the initial distance between the masses (taken from [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]]).]]\n\nFor a one dimensional chain this result could also be reproduced using theory on aliasing. The [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]] is used in the following derivation; the main difference being that in the following derivation the discretization is not in time, but in space. If we use the correct dispersion relation from last paragraph, it will be clear in another insightful way why the cut-off frequency has the value previously (twice) derived. So again,\n\n<math> \\omega (k) = 2 \\sqrt {\\frac {\\kappa}{m}}\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac {k a}{2}\\right)\\right| </math>\n\nis assumed.\n\nThis derivation is completely equivalent to the previous one, that is: the same assumptions are made to retrieve the result. It is not more or less accurate, it is just a different approach.\n\nTo determine where the cut-off frequency should be, it is useful to first determine where the cut-off of the wavelength should be. From the dispersion relation we know that for <math> k > \\pi / a </math> every mode is repeated, so the cut-off wavelength would be at <math> \\lambda_{\\rm D} = 2 a </math>. From this and the periodic boundary conditions you can immediately see that the total number of modes per polarization would be <math>N</math>. As seen in the gif of the previous paragraph this is because every wave with a wavelength shorter than <math>2a</math> could be replaced by a wave with a wavelength longer than <math> 2a </math> to regain the same physical result.\n\nHowever, the dispersion relation from previous paragraph (the correct one) is not even necessary in reasoning as to why the cut-off should be at <math> \\lambda = 2a </math>. Because, as is depicted, only waves with a longer wavelength than <math> 2a </math> could render the same physical result as another one. So this is another way to correctly predict the cut-off wavelength without using the correct dispersion relation (or even knowledge from classical mechanics as Debye did). However, using the wrong dispersion relation which Debye assumed, waves with a smaller wavelength would have a higher frequency, but the relative movement of the masses would be the same, so this does not render new modes.\n\nThis results again in <math> k_{\\rm D} = \\pi / a </math>, rendering\n\n<math> \\omega_{\\rm D} = \\frac {\\pi v_{\\rm s}}{a} </math>.\n\nAlso here it does not matter which dispersion relation is used (the correct one or the one Debye used), the same cut-off frequency would be found.\n\nUnfortunately, the same method could not be used (as easily) for a two- or three-dimensional crystal, because diagonal waves would have a larger cut-off wavelength, which are also difficult to predict.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Bose gas]]\n* [[Debye frequency]]\n* [[Gas in a box]]\n* [[Kinetic theory of solids]]\n* [[Gr\u00fcneisen parameter]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n*''CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 56th Edition (1975\u20131976)\n*Schroeder, Daniel V.
