One day, Superman visited him and told him that he wasn\u2019t the omnipotent, perfect being that William thought he was, stating that Kansas happened simply because he wasn't there, shattering William's world view and mentally unbalancing him. When the Quintessence ([[Shazam (DC Comics)]], [[Ganthet]], [[Zeus]], [[Highfather]], and the [[Phantom Stranger]]) invested him with a portion of their vast power, William, now known as Gog, went insane and blamed Superman for his misfortune, believing him to be the Anti-Christ who had allowed the Kansas disaster to take place to regain his standing in the world.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=121}}</ref>\n\nUsing his newfound powers, Gog killed Superman. Unsatisfied by his victory, Gog traveled 24 hours back in time, found Superman, and killed him again, repeating the process over and over, going backwards one day further each time, and each time varying the means of Superman's death and absorbing portions of the slain Supermen's power. When he arrived on the day that Superman and [[Wonder Woman]]'s child was born, the entire Justice League tried to stop him, but they failed, and Gog took the child, deciding to go directly to the past where he intended to trigger the Kansas cataclysm almost twenty years early, burning Superman's insignia into the countryside.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nGog's actions exposed the existence of [[Hypertime]], a fictional construct similar to the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] stories.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> Gog unknowingly passed into an alternate timeline each day he traveled back in time, effectively killing a different Superman at every turn. As a result, the Phantom Stranger was forced to recruit time traveler [[Rip Hunter]] of the [[Linear Men]], the only other person aware of Hypertime, in an attempt to preserve the secret, the other members of the Quintessence refusing to act to stop Gog for their own personal reasons.\n\nRip Hunter, refusing to believe the other Linear Men's claims that traveling back in time would destroy the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' reality, recruited Superman, [[Batman]], Wonder Woman, [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|Kid Flash III]] (daughter of [[Flash (comics)|Wally West]]), [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]] (son of [[Plastic Man]]), [[Nightstar (character)|Nightstar]] (daughter of [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]]), and [[Ibn al Xu'ffasch]] (son of [[Batman]] and [[Talia al Ghul]]) from the ''Kingdom Come'' reality, along with the Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman from the present to fight Gog, luring him into [[Booster Gold|Booster Gold's]] \"Planet Krypton\", a superhero-themed restaurant that had been stocked with artifacts from various realities before Hunter moved the restaurant outside of time to limit civilian casualties. With the available arsenal, the heroes managed to wound Gog, with Batman using a [[Phantom Zone]] projector to partially send Gog into the Zone, severely scarring him while the heroes armed themselves. Gog fought back, knocking the heroes down as he himself collapsed in a weakened state. Unable to move from the force of the attack, the present Superman was convinced to fight back by the future Wonder Woman, who told him of the destruction of Kansas and how it happened as a result of him abandoning his fight for truth and justice following the death of [[Lois Lane]]. Refusing to allow those events to occur in his life, Superman charged at Gog, sending both of them and everyone else in the restaurant into Hypertime, thus allowing Hunter to preserve the ''Kingdom Come'' reality. Gog is then returned to the future by Rip Hunter and the future versions of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, who demand that the Quintessence restore him to the person he was.\n\n===In the Name of Gog===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\nA second version of Gog with a different origin appeared several years later in DC continuity. This version of Gog is a survivor of [[Imperiex]]\u2019 attack on Topeka, Kansas. He was saved by Superman, but Superman was unable to rescue the boy's parents. Desperate to fix what had gone wrong, Gog grew up researching the science of time travel in an effort to go back in time and rescue his family.\n\nEventually, he succeeds in his efforts at creating a time machine, but his first prototype is unable to travel far enough back. He refines the time machine for over two-hundred thousand years, making it more and more powerful and using the technology to  give himself  super-powers. He then gives his research and advanced technology to younger versions of himself, which gives him more power due to rewriting history over and over. Realizing that he could not save his parents due to a temporal paradox (the death of his parents triggered the creation of his powers) his desire grows from saving his parents to punishing Superman for their deaths.\n\nThe present day Gog attacks Superman when [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] returns to Earth with newfound sentience and begins discovering emotions during his rampage. Doomsday arrives to see Superman on the verge of death after being beaten by an army of Gogs. Doomsday leaps to Superman\u2019s defense just as Gog is about to kill him. Doomsday\u2019s attempt to save Superman fails as Gog successfully kills him.\n\nOver the next two-hundred years, Doomsday leads an army in Superman\u2019s name against Gog. This future is erased when it is revealed that Gog didn\u2019t actually kill Superman but has instead been keeping him prisoner and surrounded by Kryptonite.\n\nGog offers Superman the chance to go back in time and kill him. Superman eventually shows Gog the error of his ways when Doomsday bursts in and rescues Superman. Gog then offers Doomsday the chance to go back and erase this future at the cost of returning to his villainous ways which he agrees to. In the present, the present day Gog teleports away an unconscious Doomsday for unknown reasons.<ref>''Action Comics'' #825</ref>\n\n===Thy Kingdom Come===<!--the William Matthews info needs merging into the \"In The Name of Gog\" sub-section as the second and third Gogs are the same character-->\nA third version of Gog recently appeared in the ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' ongoing series. In the new Multiverse, the events of the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' limited series take place on Earth-22. That world's version of Superman arrived on New Earth following the destruction of Earth-22. Gog appears soon after the other Superman\u2019s arrival. Gog gruesomely slaughters [[metahuman]] criminals who claim to be gods by blasting holes through their chests and disintegrating their hearts. Some of his kills include the criminals Goth and Chroma and a group of beings calling themselves the New Olympians. The [[Infinity-Man]] and [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]] were two who survived his onslaught. After facing off against the Infinity-Man, he attacks [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] who was spying on him, before taking on the Justice Society.\n\nThis version of Gog is a priest named William Matthews who received his powers from an underground citadel in Africa and took the name Gog, which was the name of the last surviving god of the Second World. He also claims that the Superman of Earth-22 let Kansas die, and is implied several times to be a [[retcon|ret-conned]] version of the character appearing in \"In the Name of Gog\" story above, with his background changed due to the events of [[Infinite Crisis]]. When the Justice Society follow him back to the citadel, his body is absorbed by a stone face on a wall. The stone face rises, becoming a massive stone man adorned in gold who claims to be the one, true Gog.\n\nThis Gog, chronologically the first one, is an exile of the \"Second World\" who was unwilling to take sides in the final battle of the Old Gods and was cast off as a result. He then plunged into the [[Bleed (comics)|Bleed]] and traveled through various alternate universes until he landed on New Earth. Inert, his consciousness lingered in the stone and lava. A local tribe built a staff out of his remnants, enabling a user to channel Gog's energy. The staff was later found by William Matthews, who claimed the name Gog.\n\nUpon being revived, Gog claims that Matthews wasn't his servant and that Matthews had been driven mad from visions of the Multiverse, including having visions of events on Earth-22.\n\nThis version of Gog displays a cheerful, childlike, peaceful personality. He claims he is \"happy to be alive\" and compelled to \"make things good again\". He saves an African village near his citadel from the effects of toxic contamination from lava that contained his essence and heals [[Damage (DC Comics)|Damage]]'s disfigured face in response to his skepticism.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #16</ref> Gog then sends [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] to a blissful, dream-filled sleep for twenty-four hours, cures [[Thom Kallor|Starman]] of his schizophrenia, gives [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Pieter Cross|Doctor Mid-Nite]] his sight back, and sends [[Power Girl]] \"[[Earth-Two|home]]\". Gog then hears the noises of a war going on nearby and vows to stop it.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #17</ref> Finding a small village under attack by a rogue militia, Gog transforms the soldiers into trees. During the conflict, [[Lance (DC Comics)|Lance]], one of the JSA's new recruits, is hit by a rocket launcher blast and killed. Gog brings Lance back to life, replacing his ruined arm with gold armor, and renames him \"[[Magog (comics)|Magog]]\".<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #18</ref>\n\nLater, Gog's intentions to move on to the Middle East and punish the warmongers there in the same fashion as the militia members causes the Justice Society to split in half, with [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], Magog, Damage, [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat (Tom Bronson)]], [[Amazing Man (DC Comics)|Amazing Man]], [[Judomaster]], and [[Commander Steel#Nathan Heywood|Citizen Steel]] taking Gog's side.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #19</ref> Like the biblical [[God]], he asks for a rest on the seventh day, sending some of his followers back to America to preach his will. At the same time, the rest of the JSA who did not choose to follow Gog have started to realize that Gog's wishes have various negative side-effects; Starman fears that he cannot complete his mission in the past with his sanity intact, the loss of Sandman's prophetic dreams has cost him one of his greatest edges in hunting criminals, Doctor Mid-Nite feels hindered by the loss of his unique sight after so long with it, Power Girl finds that she has been sent to a 'new' Earth-Two with an existing counterpart for herself, and while Damage cannot see it, his restored face makes him increasingly vain and arrogant, dismissing his past to the point of burning down his father's home while constantly checking out his reflection in mirrors and believing that people only want to talk to him because he's so handsome.\n\nAfter the last day apart, Gog collects the heroes again, asking them gleefully to kneel down and worship him while he brings in a new world.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) ''The Kingdom'' one-shot</ref> The rest of the JSA arrive, having learned from Sandman that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, and if he remains for one more day, the Earth will die if he ever leaves, leaving them with the one option of killing Gog and separating his head from the Earth. Hawkman and the rest of the Society following Gog attempt to protect him, until they see him attempt to transform [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] into lightning. All of Gog's followers turn against him and Gog punishes the Society by taking away his \"gifts\" to an extreme degree (Citizen Steel now feels pain in all his nerves and Starman can't be cured of his madness). Even Magog eventually turns on him, for which Gog's blessing on him is also undone.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #21</ref> Citizen Steel breaks Gog's leg with a single punch and eventually, the JSA are able to topple Gog and cut off his head. The Superman of Earth-22 and Starman take the still-living head to the [[Source Wall]], embedding it there for all eternity. Gog accuses Superman of being exactly what he accused Gog of being.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #22</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe first version of Gog used a cosmic staff&nbsp;\u2013 imbued with the powers of the Quintessence<ref>The Quintessence is a group of gods and cosmic beings&nbsp;\u2013 Zeus, Ganthet, Shazam, Highfather and the Stranger&nbsp;\u2013 who embody most of the mystic power in the DC universe between them.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 as his initial weapon and later used a trick he claimed to have learned from the [[Amazo]] of 2020 to absorb the powers of several alternate Supermen that he killed. His abilities included travelling through time at will, extremely keen senses, sufficient speed to intercept the Flash, superhuman strength considerably greater than Superman's and the prodigious intelligence needed to develop an almost infinite number of highly inventive and complicated ways to kill Superman.\n\nThe second Gog\u2019s powers were based on science rather than cosmic or mystical power. This Gog also has the power to give other superhumans advanced abilities through the use of Kryptonite, such as imbuing [[Repo Man (comics)|Repo Man]] with enhanced strength and the ability to grow in size, in order to battle Superboy and a weakened Superman. He was also capable of flight, energy blasts, the creation  (through time manipulation) of countless copies of himself and his spear, and teleportation throughout time and space.\n\nThe third version of Gog is actually a god from the ''Third World'', Urgrund, the world that once encompassed the two halves, [[New Genesis]] and [[Apokolips]], of the ''[[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]]''. As such he possesses a huge and boundless amount of cosmic powers. However, he chooses to use them in a reactive rather than proactive way, merely granting \"wishes\" to \"make people around him happy\". Theoretically able to reshape reality at will, he confines himself into granting people their innermost desires, often without bothering to consult with them first, which can lead to mishaps: for example, he restores Doctor Mid-Nite's vision to normal, but this leaves Mid-Nite deprived of the enhanced vision he had grown used to when performing more delicate operations in the field; he took away Sand's nightmarish visions, depriving Sand of his key resource when conducting investigations. This Gog also displays a childlike and narrow-minded personality, looking at the world with glee and awe, but he clearly understands what he is doing. He performs these miracles so that Earth's people will worship him in return for his gifts, and punished those who reject him&mdash; e.g., by turning enemy soldiers into trees, arguing that he wasn't technically killing them. When the JSA attacks him, he removes his blessings on all of them, even those who are still loyal to him at the time, purely out of spite, and even nearly transforms the Flash into lightning before Superman manages to deflect the blast.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Figurine===\n[[DC Direct]] released a cold-cast porcelain, hand-painted medium-sized statue of The Kingdom's version of Gog in 1998, based upon designs by artist [[Jerry Ordway]].

The first version first appeared in ''New Year's Evil: Gog'' #1, (February 1998), and was created by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Jerry Ordway]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Gog | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 139 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===The Kingdom===\nThe first version of Gog was known as '''William''', the sole survivor of a nuclear disaster in Kansas that was caused by the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]'s shattering of [[Captain Atom]] during a battle with the [[Justice League]], and became a believer in [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|Superman]] as a savior, even creating a church dedicated to his philosophy as he tried to find meaning in the cataclysm that had taken place, believing that it was Superman's will that Earth be punished for forsaking him. One day, Superman visited him and told him that he wasn\u2019t the omnipotent, perfect being that William thought he was, stating that Kansas happened simply because he wasn't there, shattering William's world view and mentally unbalancing him. When the Quintessence ([[Shazam (DC Comics)]], [[Ganthet]], [[Zeus]], [[Highfather]], and the [[Phantom Stranger]]) invested him with a portion of their vast power, William, now known as Gog, went insane and blamed Superman for his misfortune, believing him to be the Anti-Christ who had allowed the Kansas disaster to take place to regain his standing in the world.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=121}}</ref>\n\nUsing his newfound powers, Gog killed Superman. Unsatisfied by his victory, Gog traveled 24 hours back in time, found Superman, and killed him again, repeating the process over and over, going backwards one day further each time, and each time varying the means of Superman's death and absorbing portions of the slain Supermen's power. When he arrived on the day that Superman and [[Wonder Woman]]'s child was born, the entire Justice League tried to stop him, but they failed, and Gog took the child, deciding to go directly to the past where he intended to trigger the Kansas cataclysm almost twenty years early, burning Superman's insignia into the countryside.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nGog's actions exposed the existence of [[Hypertime]], a fictional construct similar to the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] stories.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> Gog unknowingly passed into an alternate timeline each day he traveled back in time, effectively killing a different Superman at every turn. As a result, the Phantom Stranger was forced to recruit time traveler [[Rip Hunter]] of the [[Linear Men]], the only other person aware of Hypertime, in an attempt to preserve the secret, the other members of the Quintessence refusing to act to stop Gog for their own personal reasons.\n\nRip Hunter, refusing to believe the other Linear Men's claims that traveling back in time would destroy the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' reality, recruited Superman, [[Batman]], Wonder Woman, [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|Kid Flash III]] (daughter of [[Flash (comics)|Wally West]]), [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]] (son of [[Plastic Man]]), [[Nightstar (character)|Nightstar]] (daughter of [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]]), and [[Ibn al Xu'ffasch]] (son of [[Batman]] and [[Talia al Ghul]]) from the ''Kingdom Come'' reality, along with the Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman from the present to fight Gog, luring him into [[Booster Gold|Booster Gold's]] \"Planet Krypton\", a superhero-themed restaurant that had been stocked with artifacts from various realities before Hunter moved the restaurant outside of time to limit civilian casualties. With the available arsenal, the heroes managed to wound Gog, with Batman using a [[Phantom Zone]] projector to partially send Gog into the Zone, severely scarring him while the heroes armed themselves. Gog fought back, knocking the heroes down as he himself collapsed in a weakened state. Unable to move from the force of the attack, the present Superman was convinced to fight back by the future Wonder Woman, who told him of the destruction of Kansas and how it happened as a result of him abandoning his fight for truth and justice following the death of [[Lois Lane]]. Refusing to allow those events to occur in his life, Superman charged at Gog, sending both of them and everyone else in the restaurant into Hypertime, thus allowing Hunter to preserve the ''Kingdom Come'' reality. Gog is then returned to the future by Rip Hunter and the future versions of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, who demand that the Quintessence restore him to the person he was.\n\n===In the Name of Gog===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\nA second version of Gog with a different origin appeared several years later in DC continuity. This version of Gog is a survivor of [[Imperiex]]\u2019 attack on Topeka, Kansas. He was saved by Superman, but Superman was unable to rescue the boy's parents. Desperate to fix what had gone wrong, Gog grew up researching the science of time travel in an effort to go back in time and rescue his family.\n\nEventually, he succeeds in his efforts at creating a time machine, but his first prototype is unable to travel far enough back. He refines the time machine for over two-hundred thousand years, making it more and more powerful and using the technology to  give himself  super-powers. He then gives his research and advanced technology to younger versions of himself, which gives him more power due to rewriting history over and over. Realizing that he could not save his parents due to a temporal paradox (the death of his parents triggered the creation of his powers) his desire grows from saving his parents to punishing Superman for their deaths.\n\nThe present day Gog attacks Superman when [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] returns to Earth with newfound sentience and begins discovering emotions during his rampage. Doomsday arrives to see Superman on the verge of death after being beaten by an army of Gogs. Doomsday leaps to Superman\u2019s defense just as Gog is about to kill him. Doomsday\u2019s attempt to save Superman fails as Gog successfully kills him.\n\nOver the next two-hundred years, Doomsday leads an army in Superman\u2019s name against Gog. This future is erased when it is revealed that Gog didn\u2019t actually kill Superman but has instead been keeping him prisoner and surrounded by Kryptonite.\n\nGog offers Superman the chance to go back in time and kill him. Superman eventually shows Gog the error of his ways when Doomsday bursts in and rescues Superman. Gog then offers Doomsday the chance to go back and erase this future at the cost of returning to his villainous ways which he agrees to. In the present, the present day Gog teleports away an unconscious Doomsday for unknown reasons.<ref>''Action Comics'' #825</ref>\n\n===Thy Kingdom Come===<!--the William Matthews info needs merging into the \"In The Name of Gog\" sub-section as the second and third Gogs are the same character-->\nA third version of Gog recently appeared in the ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' ongoing series. In the new Multiverse, the events of the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' limited series take place on Earth-22. That world's version of Superman arrived on New Earth following the destruction of Earth-22. Gog appears soon after the other Superman\u2019s arrival. Gog gruesomely slaughters [[metahuman]] criminals who claim to be gods by blasting holes through their chests and disintegrating their hearts. Some of his kills include the criminals Goth and Chroma and a group of beings calling themselves the New Olympians. The [[Infinity-Man]] and [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]] were two who survived his onslaught. After facing off against the Infinity-Man, he attacks [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] who was spying on him, before taking on the Justice Society.\n\nThis version of Gog is a priest named William Matthews who received his powers from an underground citadel in Africa and took the name Gog, which was the name of the last surviving god of the Second World. He also claims that the Superman of Earth-22 let Kansas die, and is implied several times to be a [[retcon|ret-conned]] version of the character appearing in \"In the Name of Gog\" story above, with his background changed due to the events of [[Infinite Crisis]]. When the Justice Society follow him back to the citadel, his body is absorbed by a stone face on a wall. The stone face rises, becoming a massive stone man adorned in gold who claims to be the one, true Gog.\n\nThis Gog, chronologically the first one, is an exile of the \"Second World\" who was unwilling to take sides in the final battle of the Old Gods and was cast off as a result. He then plunged into the [[Bleed (comics)|Bleed]] and traveled through various alternate universes until he landed on New Earth. Inert, his consciousness lingered in the stone and lava. A local tribe built a staff out of his remnants, enabling a user to channel Gog's energy. The staff was later found by William Matthews, who claimed the name Gog.\n\nUpon being revived, Gog claims that Matthews wasn't his servant and that Matthews had been driven mad from visions of the Multiverse, including having visions of events on Earth-22.\n\nThis version of Gog displays a cheerful, childlike, peaceful personality. He claims he is \"happy to be alive\" and compelled to \"make things good again\". He saves an African village near his citadel from the effects of toxic contamination from lava that contained his essence and heals [[Damage (DC Comics)|Damage]]'s disfigured face in response to his skepticism.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #16</ref> Gog then sends [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] to a blissful, dream-filled sleep for twenty-four hours, cures [[Thom Kallor|Starman]] of his schizophrenia, gives [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Pieter Cross|Doctor Mid-Nite]] his sight back, and sends [[Power Girl]] \"[[Earth-Two|home]]\". Gog then hears the noises of a war going on nearby and vows to stop it.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #17</ref> Finding a small village under attack by a rogue militia, Gog transforms the soldiers into trees. During the conflict, [[Lance (DC Comics)|Lance]], one of the JSA's new recruits, is hit by a rocket launcher blast and killed. Gog brings Lance back to life, replacing his ruined arm with gold armor, and renames him \"[[Magog (comics)|Magog]]\".<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #18</ref>\n\nLater, Gog's intentions to move on to the Middle East and punish the warmongers there in the same fashion as the militia members causes the Justice Society to split in half, with [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], Magog, Damage, [[Wildcat (comics)#Tom Bronson|Wildcat (Tom Bronson)]], [[Amazing Man (DC Comics)|Amazing Man]], [[Judomaster]], and [[Commander Steel#Nathan Heywood|Citizen Steel]] taking Gog's side.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #19</ref> Like the biblical [[God]], he asks for a rest on the seventh day, sending some of his followers back to America to preach his will. At the same time, the rest of the JSA who did not choose to follow Gog have started to realize that Gog's wishes have various negative side-effects; Starman fears that he cannot complete his mission in the past with his sanity intact, the loss of Sandman's prophetic dreams has cost him one of his greatest edges in hunting criminals, Doctor Mid-Nite feels hindered by the loss of his unique sight after so long with it, Power Girl finds that she has been sent to a 'new' Earth-Two with an existing counterpart for herself, and while Damage cannot see it, his restored face makes him increasingly vain and arrogant, dismissing his past to the point of burning down his father's home while constantly checking out his reflection in mirrors and believing that people only want to talk to him because he's so handsome.\n\nAfter the last day apart, Gog collects the heroes again, asking them gleefully to kneel down and worship him while he brings in a new world.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) ''The Kingdom'' one-shot</ref> The rest of the JSA arrive, having learned from Sandman that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, and if he remains for one more day, the Earth will die if he ever leaves, leaving them with the one option of killing Gog and separating his head from the Earth. Hawkman and the rest of the Society following Gog attempt to protect him, until they see him attempt to transform [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] into lightning. All of Gog's followers turn against him and Gog punishes the Society by taking away his \"gifts\" to an extreme degree (Citizen Steel now feels pain in all his nerves and Starman can't be cured of his madness). Even Magog eventually turns on him, for which Gog's blessing on him is also undone.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #21</ref> Citizen Steel breaks Gog's leg with a single punch and eventually, the JSA are able to topple Gog and cut off his head. The Superman of Earth-22 and Starman take the still-living head to the [[Source Wall]], embedding it there for all eternity. Gog accuses Superman of being exactly what he accused Gog of being.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #22</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe first version of Gog used a cosmic staff&nbsp;\u2013 imbued with the powers of the Quintessence<ref>The Quintessence is a group of gods and cosmic beings&nbsp;\u2013 Zeus, Ganthet, Shazam, Highfather and the Stranger&nbsp;\u2013 who embody most of the mystic power in the DC universe between them.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 as his initial weapon and later used a trick he claimed to have learned from the [[Amazo]] of 2020 to absorb the powers of several alternate Supermen that he killed. His abilities included travelling through time at will, extremely keen senses, sufficient speed to intercept the Flash, superhuman strength considerably greater than Superman's and the prodigious intelligence needed to develop an almost infinite number of highly inventive and complicated ways to kill Superman.\n\nThe second Gog\u2019s powers were based on science rather than cosmic or mystical power. This Gog also has the power to give other superhumans advanced abilities through the use of Kryptonite, such as imbuing [[Repo Man (comics)|Repo Man]] with enhanced strength and the ability to grow in size, in order to battle Superboy and a weakened Superman. He was also capable of flight, energy blasts, the creation  (through time manipulation) of countless copies of himself and his spear, and teleportation throughout time and space.\n\nThe third version of Gog is actually a god from the ''Third World'', Urgrund, the world that once encompassed the two halves, [[New Genesis]] and [[Apokolips]], of the ''[[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]]''. As such he possesses a huge and boundless amount of cosmic powers. However, he chooses to use them in a reactive rather than proactive way, merely granting \"wishes\" to \"make people around him happy\". Theoretically able to reshape reality at will, he confines himself into granting people their innermost desires, often without bothering to consult with them first, which can lead to mishaps: for example, he restores Doctor Mid-Nite's vision to normal, but this leaves Mid-Nite deprived of the enhanced vision he had grown used to when performing more delicate operations in the field; he took away Sand's nightmarish visions, depriving Sand of his key resource when conducting investigations. This Gog also displays a childlike and narrow-minded personality, looking at the world with glee and awe, but he clearly understands what he is doing. He performs these miracles so that Earth's people will worship him in return for his gifts, and punished those who reject him&mdash; e.g., by turning enemy soldiers into trees, arguing that he wasn't technically killing them. When the JSA attacks him, he removes his blessings on all of them, even those who are still loyal to him at the time, purely out of spite, and even nearly transforms the Flash into lightning before Superman manages to deflect the blast.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Figurine===\n[[DC Direct]] released a cold-cast porcelain, hand-painted medium-sized statue of The Kingdom's version of Gog in 1998, based upon designs by artist [[Jerry Ordway]].

Captain Cold is the leader of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], a loose criminal association, as well as the older brother of [[Golden Glider]]. An adversary of the various superheroes known as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], he has served as one of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen's]] archenemies, both foe and begrudging ally to [[Wally West]], and one of the killers of [[Bart Allen]]. As part of 2011's [[The New 52]] reboot, Captain Cold is a villain that with his team The Rogues lives by a code to never kill and sometimes can be perceived as a hero.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book|last = Wallace|first = Dan|author-link =|contribution = Captain Cold|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 67|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1|oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\n[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked Captain Cold as #27.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/27.html |title=Captain Cold is Number 27 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |accessdate=2011-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206025148/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/27.html |archivedate=2011-02-06 }}</ref>\n\nActor [[Wentworth Miller]] has portrayed the character in [[The CW]]'s television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and was in the first and second seasons of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #8 (June 1957).<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=61}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nLeonard Snart was raised by an abusive father and took refuge with his grandfather, who worked in an ice truck. When his grandfather died, Snart grew tired of his father's abuse and set out to start a criminal career. Snart joined up with a group of small-time thieves and in planning out a robbery, each was issued a gun and a visor to protect their eyes against the flashes of gunfire. This visor design would later be adapted by Snart into his trademark costume. In recent years he has added a radio receiver to them which picks up the police band to monitor local law enforcement. Snart and the other thugs were captured by the Flash and imprisoned. Snart decided to go solo, but knew he had to do something about the local hero, the Flash.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nSnart read an article that theorized that the energy emissions of a [[cyclotron]] could interfere with the Flash's speed. He designed a weapon to harness that power and broke into a cyclotron lab, intending to use the device to charge up his experimental gun. As he was finishing his experiment, a security guard surprised Snart. Intending to use his gun only to scare the guard, he inadvertently pulled the trigger and discovered that his weapon had been altered in a way he had never imagined. The moisture in the air around the guard froze. Intrigued by this twist of fate, Snart donned a [[Anorak|parka]] and the aforementioned visor and declared himself to be Captain Cold - the man who mastered absolute zero. Snart then committed a series of non-lethal crimes, on one occasion placing the city in suspended animation in an attempt to force Iris West to marry him as he had fallen in love with her when he saw her in the prison, but the Flash got through a wall of ice and was able to reverse the process. He later fell in love with a newscaster, and competed with [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] (in his first appearance) over her in a crime spree, but they were both beaten by the Flash. But after Barry Allen's death, during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Captain Cold became a [[bounty hunter]] with his sister Lisa, the [[Golden Glider]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nDuring the events of ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', Captain Cold lost his soul to [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] but Wally West brought it back to the land of the living. He soon returned to crime, this time a member of Wally's Rogues Gallery. The Rogues had first been assembled when another Flash foe, the super-intelligent [[Gorilla Grodd]] had broken them out of jail to distract the Flash. The Golden Glider had abandoned her bounty hunter career and had started partnering with a series of thugs who she dressed in a costume, armed with a copy of Captain Cold's signature Cold Gun, and called [[Chillblaine]]. Already distraught over the death of her lover, the [[Top (comics)|Top]], it seemed that the supposed death of her brother pushed her over the edge. But the last Chillblaine was a little smarter and more vicious. He murdered the Golden Glider, prompting Captain Cold to hunt him down, torture him and kill him by freezing his outer layer of skin and then pushing him off a high rise building. Not long after that, Snart was framed by a new incarnation of [[Mister Element]]. He used his Element Gun to simulate Cold's gun, using ice and cold to murder several police officers before Captain Cold and the Flash discovered who was actually responsible. With the death of his sister, and having killed Chillblaine and Mr. Element in vengeance, Cold has again become an unrepentant criminal. However, during a confrontation with [[Brother Grimm]], Cold actually worked with Wally West to defeat the powerful magic user, although this was mainly because he and [[Mirror Master]] had been betrayed by Grimm and wanted revenge.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nCaptain Cold was declared the leader of the Flash's Rogues Gallery. His skill and experience have made him a strong leader to the likes of the [[Weather Wizard]], the new [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], the new [[Mirror Master]], and the [[Owen Mercer|new Captain Boomerang]]. Len seems to have taken the young Captain Boomerang under his wing, after the elder Boomerang was recently killed. Tabloids rumoured that Captain Cold's sister, the Golden Glider, was Boomerang's mother, making him Captain Cold's nephew. This turned out to be false, however, as the new Boomerang's mother has been revealed to be [[Meloni Thawne]], who is also the mother of [[Flash (Bart Allen)|Bart Allen]]. Despite his more ruthless nature as of late, Captain Cold's heart is not completely frozen, evidenced by having sent flowers to honor [[Sue Dibny]], murdered wife of the [[Elongated Man]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\nTraditionally, Captain Cold is driven by three things: money, women, and the desire to beat Barry Allen. Although not the lecher that Captain Boomerang was, Len Snart has an eye for the ladies, particularly models. When Barry Allen died, Captain Cold drifted for a while, jumping back and forth over the lines of crime and justice. He was captured by the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] and served time in the [[Suicide Squad]], worked with his sister as a bounty hunter (Golden Snowball Recoveries), and, with his longtime friend and sometimes nemesis [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], encountered [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] of the [[Justice League]]. He has teamed up with various villains over the years other than the many Rogues. These include [[Catwoman]] and the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. His favorite baseball team is the [[Houston Astros]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\n===\"One Year Later\"===\nIn the 2006 \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]). Though Inertia was defeated, Captain Cold, Weather Wizard, Heat Wave, Mirror Master and Abra Kadabra killed Bart with a combined barrage of their elemental weapons. He, Heat Wave, and Weather Wizard seemed to express guilt, however, after learning the identity of the Flash and how young he was.\n\n===''Salvation Run''===\nCaptain Cold is one of the exiled villains featured in the 2007-08 miniseries ''[[Salvation Run]]'' along with his fellow Rogues: [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Weather Wizard]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]].\n\n===''New Rogues''===\nThe New Rogues version of Captain Cold is '''Chill''', a unknown man who possesses a Cold Gun.\n\n===''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge''===\nIn the 2008 miniseries ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'', Captain Cold and the Rogues briefly joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' story, however, Cold and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game. Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #1</ref> Cold and his group are challenged by a new set of Rogues, formed by Libra to be their replacements. The new group, having kidnapped Cold's father, challenge the Rogues, and are defeated and killed. Cold goes to his father, talking to him about the abuse he suffered, and the fate of his sister. After the elder Snart insults him and his mother, calling them weak, Cold punches him, but finds himself unable to kill him, instead getting Heat Wave to do it.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #2</ref> The Rogues have their confrontation with Inertia, despite interference by Zoom and Libra, and kill Inertia. Libra then reveals that he needs the Rogues because Barry Allen has returned from the dead, and the Flashes are potential threats to him and Darkseid. Though shocked by the news that Allen is alive, Cold still rejects his offer of membership. After regrouping, Cold and the other Rogues agree not to retire, claiming that the game is back on.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #3</ref> In \"Final Crisis\" #7, someone that looks like Captain Cold appears as a [[Justifiers|Justifier]] and is seen fighting the Female Furies alongside the other Justifiers under Lex Luthor's control.\n\n===''The Flash: Rebirth''===\nIn the 2009 ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' miniseries, Captain Cold is seen with the other Rogues, reading about Barry Allen's return and claiming that they would need more of the Rogues.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> The Rogues are still debating Allen's return, with Cold saying it's time to pull out their contingency plan that [[Mirror Master|Scudder]] came up with, stating ''\"In case The Flash returns, break glass.\"''<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #6 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===\"Blackest Night\"===\nIn the 2009\u20132010 \"[[Blackest Night]]\" storyline, the Rogues realize that the bodies of various dead Rogues are missing and prepare to fight them. Captain Cold knows that his sister, the Golden Glider, is among the reanimated [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] but is still ready to lead the Rogues against the zombies.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (December 2009)</ref> He is confronted by the Black Lantern Glider, who attempts to use his feelings of love for her against him. However, Captain Cold manages to suppress these feelings long enough for him to fight back, freezing her within a block of ice.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010)</ref> He subsequently kills Owen Mercer by throwing him into a pit with his Black Lantern father when he learns that Owen has been feeding people to his father in the belief that consuming flesh will restore him to life, informing Owen that Rogues do not kill women and children.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===''The Flash'' (Vol. 3)===\nIn ''The Flash'' (Vol. 3), Captain Cold and the Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words ''In Case of Flash: Break Glass'' written on it and release beings from a Mirror World upon breaking it.<ref>''Flash Secret Files and Origins'' (2010)</ref> However, Captain Cold is told by Mirror Master he had discovered that the giant mirror is actually a slow acting poison.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 3 #5 (September 2010)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn the timeline of the 2011 company-wide reboot of all its superhero titles, [[The New 52]], Captain Cold is reintroduced as a younger man than in the previous timeline and now with his [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] lives with a code to never kill. His origin remains the same, however, his sister Lisa has not been the Golden Glider, and is instead dying of [[cancer]]. Upon learning that the hospital does not have enough energy to power a laser that could save her life, because of an EMP seemingly caused by the Flash, Cold blames him for everything that has happened to him, including a falling out with the Rogues, and decides to break the rules of their \"game\" and kill the Flash. Captain Cold has undergone experiments that have given him ice-based metahuman powers, including the ability to slow down the molecules around him, creating a field of inertia that reduces the Flash's speed to human level, allowing Captain Cold to touch him and effortlessly beat him.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #6 (February 2012)</ref> He and the Rogues are set to return,<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #7 (March 2012)</ref> but later defeated them with help from Flash, and the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].<ref>''The Flash annual'' #1</ref>\n\nAfter freeing the Trickster and attending the meeting at the Justice League Watchtower, the Rogues return to Central and Keystone City, only to see that both have been destroyed by Gorilla Grodd. Grodd returns to Central City during the eclipse, while a ceremony commemorating Flash between the humans and gorillas is occurring. Grodd proceeds to take control of Central City as its king and renames it Gorilla City. Captain Cold sees the city's cops tied up from Grodd, and proceeds to free them. He then asks Mirror Master to help him get to the hospital where his sister is being held in order to check on her. While there, the Crime Syndicate send Black Bison, Hyena, Multiplex, Plastique and Typhoon to finish Grodd's work and destroy the hospital. The Rogues are able to hold them off, only to be interrupted by Deathstorm and Power Ring, who were sent by Ultraman to deal with the Rogues for resisting the Crime Syndicate's offer to join them. After battling Deathstorm and Power Ring, Deathstorm attacks Captain Cold and is able to extract his freezing powers from his DNA. Mirror Master attempts to get the Rogues out through the Mirror World, but Power Ring destroys the mirror causing the Rogues to be separated. Captain Cold ends up at Luthor and his Kryptonian clone's location where they are also joined by Black Manta, who has retrieved Black Adam from the ocean.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #3</ref> Luthor realizes that, with the help of his clone, Black Adam, Black Manta, and Captain Cold, he may be able to stop the Crime Syndicate. Captain Cold and the rest of the squad, now joined by [[Batman]], [[Catwoman]], [[Sinestro]] and [[Deathstroke]], infiltrate the fallen Watchtower, where Black Manta kills the Outsider and Cold proceeds to shatter [[Johnny Quick]]'s right leg after having frozen the molecules in it with his cold gun. He then unmasks the hooded prisoner brought over from [[Earth-3]], revealing it to be Alexander Luthor, who is their version of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]], Mazahs, who states he will kill them all.<ref name=\"Forever Evil #6\">''Forever Evil'' #6</ref> {{issue|date=June 2014}} After defeating the crime syndicate, Captain Cold is pardoned by the U.S government, and becomes a member of the Justice League, along with Luthor.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nSnart and the Rogues first made a cameo appearance in the [[DC Rebirth]]'s storylines; they are fleetingly watching a news report about the many newly created speedsters appearing throughout the city in ''The Flash'' #3. Snart quips that it is time for the Rogues to leave Central City for a while. Visually the Rogues still seem to be based upon their New 52 appearances in this cameo, though when Snart later appears in one of Flash's memory flashbacks he has resorted to an even older look. He and the other Rogues retain these costumes in their later appearances.\n\nSnart and the Rogues make their first full-length appearance in ''The Flash'' #15, where they are attempting to steal a valuable golden statue of the god Mercury from the small island nation of Corto Maltese. The Flash arrives to stop them, but they turn out to be constructs of Mirror Master laid so that the Rogues can commit a crime spree in Central City. Captain Cold reveals what he had been working on in his absence from the city\u2014a \"black ice gun\" that uses the anti-Speed Force weaponry of the terrorist group Black Hole combined with his regular freeze gun. After a fight, the [[Golden Glider]] had a chance to kill the Flash, but was talked out of it by her fellow [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]. Despite this setback, Flash manages to finally beat Snart and the rest of the Rogues without killing them. By the end of ''The Flash'' #17, Snart appears to be ready to take over Iron Heights from the more neophyte villains, including Papercut.\n\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Captain Cold and his fellow Rogues are among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by [[Riddler]] that talks about the Superman Theory.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike the majority of the Flash's Rogues, Snart had no innate superhuman powers. He instead relied on his cold guns and instincts. Over the years, Snart had modified his weapons to allow a variety of effects such as:\n* A cold beam that freezes anything it hits instantly.\n* Creating a cold field where people and objects literally stop in their tracks. Cold uses this ability to slow down the Flash's movements.\n* Bathing his opponent in a wide beam of ice designed to freeze the skin of the target so they stay conscious and do not go numb to the pain. Cold used this to kill Chillblaine who murdered Cold's sister to make him suffer as much as possible.\n* Creating a slippery field of ice which can slow down the Flash.\n* Forming sharp stalagmites on the ground to impale his enemies. Used to kill Chillblaine after freezing the outer layer of his skin so he could inflict as much pain as possible.\n* An \"ice grenade\" which was stated to \"turn this place into an iceberg\". Used to freeze everything in a large radius, and  the whole of Iron Heights during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]''.\n* Creating \"mirages\" out of extreme cold-like heat.\n\nFellow ice-based villain [[Mr. Freeze]] has noted that Cold is the only cold-themed villain in the DC Universe to have mastered \"absolute zero\" with his weapons.\n\nIn the New 52 universe, Captain Cold temporarily had meta-human ice powers, including the power to slow down the Flash or objects traveling at high velocities via molecular deceleration caused by Absolute Zero, but these powers are later lost in the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' series when he is attacked by Deathstorm\u2014the Earth-3 counterpart of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]\u2014with Cold reverting to using his classic ice gun. Despite his lack of professional or technical expertise, Cold states that he spent so long analyzing the parts of his cold gun that he is able to recreate it in just over half an hour using parts stolen from a standard electronics shop.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #4</ref> He's even skilled enough to program it for a host of unique effects simulating some of his powers; like his \"Cold Field\" which quick cools the atmosphere to the point that everything caught in it grinds to a halt,<ref>''Justice League'' (2011) #38</ref> or an auto activation function which triggers his Cold Gun's freeze ray via vocalized password input.<ref name=\"Forever Evil #6\"/>\n\nDuring the Rebirth storyline, Snart augmented his Cold Gun even further by combining it with the anti-Speed Force technologies by the science criminal cell called '''Black Hole'''.<ref>''The Flash'' (2016) #16</ref> The newly christened '''Black Ice Gun''' now tacked directly into The Speed Force in order to painfully disrupt a speedster's connection to it. Snart's new cold gun was so powerful that not only could it hinder the Flash in the most excruciating way possible, it was vastly more powerful in scope, able to freeze both the harbor and several city blocks adjacent to their current location.<ref>''The Flash'' (2016) #17</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n*Captain Cold appears in [[Darwyn Cooke]]'s series ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]'', robbing a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casino where some DC heroes and others are attending a boxing match between [[Cassius Clay]] and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Ted \"Wildcat\" Grant]]. Captain Cold freezes [[Iris West]]'s hand while she is on the phone with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]].  As the Flash, Barry races to Vegas and stops Captain Cold from freezing Vegas via cryogenic detonators. The Flash also rewires Cold's gun, causing it to backfire and trap the villain in a frozen water fountain.<ref>''DC: The New Frontier'' #2 (April 2004)</ref>\n*In the ''[[DC Super Friends]]'' universe, Captain Cold is part of a group of ice-themed villains called the \"Ice Pack\" that encases a city in ice and snow.<ref>''DC Super Friends'' #16 (August 2009)</ref>\n*A teen version of Captain Cold known as '''Kid Kold''' appeared in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic as an enemy of [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]].

He retains his current wardrobe and weaponry, and is Central City's main hero, with a museum similar to the [[Flash Museum]], and a Rogues Gallery similar to that of the Flash, though he has killed some of his opponents. It is hinted that his heroics are a cover to hide a terrible secret.<ref name=\"fpcc1\">''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> He is contacted by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] to join in the fight against [[Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

Snart first appears as a regular robber, but when his attempted heist is foiled by [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|The Flash]], Snart obtains a \"cold gun\", created by [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]] to subdue a speedster, due to its ability to freeze anything to absolute zero temperatures, from a black market arms dealer. Dubbed \"Captain Cold\", he makes several attempts to eliminate The Flash throughout the [[The Flash (season 1)|first season]], eventually joining forces with his former colleague [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] and his sister [[Lisa Snart (Arrowverse)|Lisa Snart]], both of whom also get their own guns. After kidnapping Cisco, Snart forces him to reveal the Flash's identity as Barry Allen. Snart then makes a deal with Barry: he will keep his identity a secret and refrain from killing innocent people, and in exchange Barry will not interfere with his heists. Barry later requests Snart's help with a [[metahuman]] prison transfer, and Barry eliminates all of the authorities' records of Snart in exchange. However, Snart betrays Barry by freeing the inmates from captivity. In [[The Flash (season 2)|season two]], Snart is blackmailed into working with his abusive father [[Lewis Snart]] who plants a bomb in Lisa to ensure his son's cooperation.

The vengeful Rory then returns as the Time Masters' temporal bounty hunter Chronos. After Chronos is captured by the Legends, Snart convinces the team to try and reform Rory, who eventually rejoins the team. At the end of the season, Snart sacrifices himself by blowing up the Time Masters, who are revealed to be working with Savage.

Captain Cold is the leader of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], a loose criminal association, as well as the older brother of [[Golden Glider]]. An adversary of the various superheroes known as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], he has served as one of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen's]] archenemies, both foe and begrudging ally to [[Wally West]], and one of the killers of [[Bart Allen]]. As part of 2011's [[The New 52]] reboot, Captain Cold is a villain that with his team The Rogues lives by a code to never kill and sometimes can be perceived as a hero.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book|last = Wallace|first = Dan|author-link =|contribution = Captain Cold|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 67|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1|oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\n[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked Captain Cold as #27.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/27.html |title=Captain Cold is Number 27 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |accessdate=2011-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206025148/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/27.html |archivedate=2011-02-06 }}</ref>\n\nActor [[Wentworth Miller]] has portrayed the character in [[The CW]]'s television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and was in the first and second seasons of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #8 (June 1957).<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=61}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nLeonard Snart was raised by an abusive father and took refuge with his grandfather, who worked in an ice truck. When his grandfather died, Snart grew tired of his father's abuse and set out to start a criminal career. Snart joined up with a group of small-time thieves and in planning out a robbery, each was issued a gun and a visor to protect their eyes against the flashes of gunfire. This visor design would later be adapted by Snart into his trademark costume. In recent years he has added a radio receiver to them which picks up the police band to monitor local law enforcement. Snart and the other thugs were captured by the Flash and imprisoned. Snart decided to go solo, but knew he had to do something about the local hero, the Flash.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nSnart read an article that theorized that the energy emissions of a [[cyclotron]] could interfere with the Flash's speed. He designed a weapon to harness that power and broke into a cyclotron lab, intending to use the device to charge up his experimental gun. As he was finishing his experiment, a security guard surprised Snart. Intending to use his gun only to scare the guard, he inadvertently pulled the trigger and discovered that his weapon had been altered in a way he had never imagined. The moisture in the air around the guard froze. Intrigued by this twist of fate, Snart donned a [[Anorak|parka]] and the aforementioned visor and declared himself to be Captain Cold - the man who mastered absolute zero. Snart then committed a series of non-lethal crimes, on one occasion placing the city in suspended animation in an attempt to force Iris West to marry him as he had fallen in love with her when he saw her in the prison, but the Flash got through a wall of ice and was able to reverse the process. He later fell in love with a newscaster, and competed with [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] (in his first appearance) over her in a crime spree, but they were both beaten by the Flash. But after Barry Allen's death, during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Captain Cold became a [[bounty hunter]] with his sister Lisa, the [[Golden Glider]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nDuring the events of ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', Captain Cold lost his soul to [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] but Wally West brought it back to the land of the living. He soon returned to crime, this time a member of Wally's Rogues Gallery. The Rogues had first been assembled when another Flash foe, the super-intelligent [[Gorilla Grodd]] had broken them out of jail to distract the Flash. The Golden Glider had abandoned her bounty hunter career and had started partnering with a series of thugs who she dressed in a costume, armed with a copy of Captain Cold's signature Cold Gun, and called [[Chillblaine]]. Already distraught over the death of her lover, the [[Top (comics)|Top]], it seemed that the supposed death of her brother pushed her over the edge. But the last Chillblaine was a little smarter and more vicious. He murdered the Golden Glider, prompting Captain Cold to hunt him down, torture him and kill him by freezing his outer layer of skin and then pushing him off a high rise building. Not long after that, Snart was framed by a new incarnation of [[Mister Element]]. He used his Element Gun to simulate Cold's gun, using ice and cold to murder several police officers before Captain Cold and the Flash discovered who was actually responsible. With the death of his sister, and having killed Chillblaine and Mr. Element in vengeance, Cold has again become an unrepentant criminal. However, during a confrontation with [[Brother Grimm]], Cold actually worked with Wally West to defeat the powerful magic user, although this was mainly because he and [[Mirror Master]] had been betrayed by Grimm and wanted revenge.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nCaptain Cold was declared the leader of the Flash's Rogues Gallery. His skill and experience have made him a strong leader to the likes of the [[Weather Wizard]], the new [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], the new [[Mirror Master]], and the [[Owen Mercer|new Captain Boomerang]]. Len seems to have taken the young Captain Boomerang under his wing, after the elder Boomerang was recently killed. Tabloids rumoured that Captain Cold's sister, the Golden Glider, was Boomerang's mother, making him Captain Cold's nephew. This turned out to be false, however, as the new Boomerang's mother has been revealed to be [[Meloni Thawne]], who is also the mother of [[Flash (Bart Allen)|Bart Allen]]. Despite his more ruthless nature as of late, Captain Cold's heart is not completely frozen, evidenced by having sent flowers to honor [[Sue Dibny]], murdered wife of the [[Elongated Man]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\nTraditionally, Captain Cold is driven by three things: money, women, and the desire to beat Barry Allen. Although not the lecher that Captain Boomerang was, Len Snart has an eye for the ladies, particularly models. When Barry Allen died, Captain Cold drifted for a while, jumping back and forth over the lines of crime and justice. He was captured by the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] and served time in the [[Suicide Squad]], worked with his sister as a bounty hunter (Golden Snowball Recoveries), and, with his longtime friend and sometimes nemesis [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], encountered [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] of the [[Justice League]]. He has teamed up with various villains over the years other than the many Rogues. These include [[Catwoman]] and the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. His favorite baseball team is the [[Houston Astros]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\n===\"One Year Later\"===\nIn the 2006 \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]). Though Inertia was defeated, Captain Cold, Weather Wizard, Heat Wave, Mirror Master and Abra Kadabra killed Bart with a combined barrage of their elemental weapons. He, Heat Wave, and Weather Wizard seemed to express guilt, however, after learning the identity of the Flash and how young he was.\n\n===''Salvation Run''===\nCaptain Cold is one of the exiled villains featured in the 2007-08 miniseries ''[[Salvation Run]]'' along with his fellow Rogues: [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Weather Wizard]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]].\n\n===''New Rogues''===\nThe New Rogues version of Captain Cold is '''Chill''', a unknown man who possesses a Cold Gun.\n\n===''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge''===\nIn the 2008 miniseries ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'', Captain Cold and the Rogues briefly joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' story, however, Cold and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game. Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #1</ref> Cold and his group are challenged by a new set of Rogues, formed by Libra to be their replacements. The new group, having kidnapped Cold's father, challenge the Rogues, and are defeated and killed. Cold goes to his father, talking to him about the abuse he suffered, and the fate of his sister. After the elder Snart insults him and his mother, calling them weak, Cold punches him, but finds himself unable to kill him, instead getting Heat Wave to do it.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #2</ref> The Rogues have their confrontation with Inertia, despite interference by Zoom and Libra, and kill Inertia. Libra then reveals that he needs the Rogues because Barry Allen has returned from the dead, and the Flashes are potential threats to him and Darkseid. Though shocked by the news that Allen is alive, Cold still rejects his offer of membership. After regrouping, Cold and the other Rogues agree not to retire, claiming that the game is back on.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #3</ref> In \"Final Crisis\" #7, someone that looks like Captain Cold appears as a [[Justifiers|Justifier]] and is seen fighting the Female Furies alongside the other Justifiers under Lex Luthor's control.\n\n===''The Flash: Rebirth''===\nIn the 2009 ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' miniseries, Captain Cold is seen with the other Rogues, reading about Barry Allen's return and claiming that they would need more of the Rogues.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> The Rogues are still debating Allen's return, with Cold saying it's time to pull out their contingency plan that [[Mirror Master|Scudder]] came up with, stating ''\"In case The Flash returns, break glass.\"''<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #6 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===\"Blackest Night\"===\nIn the 2009\u20132010 \"[[Blackest Night]]\" storyline, the Rogues realize that the bodies of various dead Rogues are missing and prepare to fight them. Captain Cold knows that his sister, the Golden Glider, is among the reanimated [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] but is still ready to lead the Rogues against the zombies.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (December 2009)</ref> He is confronted by the Black Lantern Glider, who attempts to use his feelings of love for her against him. However, Captain Cold manages to suppress these feelings long enough for him to fight back, freezing her within a block of ice.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010)</ref> He subsequently kills Owen Mercer by throwing him into a pit with his Black Lantern father when he learns that Owen has been feeding people to his father in the belief that consuming flesh will restore him to life, informing Owen that Rogues do not kill women and children.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===''The Flash'' (Vol. 3)===\nIn ''The Flash'' (Vol. 3), Captain Cold and the Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words ''In Case of Flash: Break Glass'' written on it and release beings from a Mirror World upon breaking it.<ref>''Flash Secret Files and Origins'' (2010)</ref> However, Captain Cold is told by Mirror Master he had discovered that the giant mirror is actually a slow acting poison.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 3 #5 (September 2010)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn the timeline of the 2011 company-wide reboot of all its superhero titles, [[The New 52]], Captain Cold is reintroduced as a younger man than in the previous timeline and now with his [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] lives with a code to never kill. His origin remains the same, however, his sister Lisa has not been the Golden Glider, and is instead dying of [[cancer]]. Upon learning that the hospital does not have enough energy to power a laser that could save her life, because of an EMP seemingly caused by the Flash, Cold blames him for everything that has happened to him, including a falling out with the Rogues, and decides to break the rules of their \"game\" and kill the Flash. Captain Cold has undergone experiments that have given him ice-based metahuman powers, including the ability to slow down the molecules around him, creating a field of inertia that reduces the Flash's speed to human level, allowing Captain Cold to touch him and effortlessly beat him.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #6 (February 2012)</ref> He and the Rogues are set to return,<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #7 (March 2012)</ref> but later defeated them with help from Flash, and the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].<ref>''The Flash annual'' #1</ref>\n\nAfter freeing the Trickster and attending the meeting at the Justice League Watchtower, the Rogues return to Central and Keystone City, only to see that both have been destroyed by Gorilla Grodd. Grodd returns to Central City during the eclipse, while a ceremony commemorating Flash between the humans and gorillas is occurring. Grodd proceeds to take control of Central City as its king and renames it Gorilla City. Captain Cold sees the city's cops tied up from Grodd, and proceeds to free them. He then asks Mirror Master to help him get to the hospital where his sister is being held in order to check on her. While there, the Crime Syndicate send Black Bison, Hyena, Multiplex, Plastique and Typhoon to finish Grodd's work and destroy the hospital. The Rogues are able to hold them off, only to be interrupted by Deathstorm and Power Ring, who were sent by Ultraman to deal with the Rogues for resisting the Crime Syndicate's offer to join them. After battling Deathstorm and Power Ring, Deathstorm attacks Captain Cold and is able to extract his freezing powers from his DNA. Mirror Master attempts to get the Rogues out through the Mirror World, but Power Ring destroys the mirror causing the Rogues to be separated. Captain Cold ends up at Luthor and his Kryptonian clone's location where they are also joined by Black Manta, who has retrieved Black Adam from the ocean.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #3</ref> Luthor realizes that, with the help of his clone, Black Adam, Black Manta, and Captain Cold, he may be able to stop the Crime Syndicate. Captain Cold and the rest of the squad, now joined by [[Batman]], [[Catwoman]], [[Sinestro]] and [[Deathstroke]], infiltrate the fallen Watchtower, where Black Manta kills the Outsider and Cold proceeds to shatter [[Johnny Quick]]'s right leg after having frozen the molecules in it with his cold gun. He then unmasks the hooded prisoner brought over from [[Earth-3]], revealing it to be Alexander Luthor, who is their version of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]], Mazahs, who states he will kill them all.<ref name=\"Forever Evil #6\">''Forever Evil'' #6</ref> {{issue|date=June 2014}} After defeating the crime syndicate, Captain Cold is pardoned by the U.S government, and becomes a member of the Justice League, along with Luthor.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nSnart and the Rogues first made a cameo appearance in the [[DC Rebirth]]'s storylines; they are fleetingly watching a news report about the many newly created speedsters appearing throughout the city in ''The Flash'' #3. Snart quips that it is time for the Rogues to leave Central City for a while. Visually the Rogues still seem to be based upon their New 52 appearances in this cameo, though when Snart later appears in one of Flash's memory flashbacks he has resorted to an even older look. He and the other Rogues retain these costumes in their later appearances.\n\nSnart and the Rogues make their first full-length appearance in ''The Flash'' #15, where they are attempting to steal a valuable golden statue of the god Mercury from the small island nation of Corto Maltese. The Flash arrives to stop them, but they turn out to be constructs of Mirror Master laid so that the Rogues can commit a crime spree in Central City. Captain Cold reveals what he had been working on in his absence from the city\u2014a \"black ice gun\" that uses the anti-Speed Force weaponry of the terrorist group Black Hole combined with his regular freeze gun. After a fight, the [[Golden Glider]] had a chance to kill the Flash, but was talked out of it by her fellow [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]. Despite this setback, Flash manages to finally beat Snart and the rest of the Rogues without killing them. By the end of ''The Flash'' #17, Snart appears to be ready to take over Iron Heights from the more neophyte villains, including Papercut.\n\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Captain Cold and his fellow Rogues are among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by [[Riddler]] that talks about the Superman Theory.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike the majority of the Flash's Rogues, Snart had no innate superhuman powers. He instead relied on his cold guns and instincts. Over the years, Snart had modified his weapons to allow a variety of effects such as:\n* A cold beam that freezes anything it hits instantly.\n* Creating a cold field where people and objects literally stop in their tracks. Cold uses this ability to slow down the Flash's movements.\n* Bathing his opponent in a wide beam of ice designed to freeze the skin of the target so they stay conscious and do not go numb to the pain. Cold used this to kill Chillblaine who murdered Cold's sister to make him suffer as much as possible.\n* Creating a slippery field of ice which can slow down the Flash.\n* Forming sharp stalagmites on the ground to impale his enemies. Used to kill Chillblaine after freezing the outer layer of his skin so he could inflict as much pain as possible.\n* An \"ice grenade\" which was stated to \"turn this place into an iceberg\". Used to freeze everything in a large radius, and  the whole of Iron Heights during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]''.\n* Creating \"mirages\" out of extreme cold-like heat.\n\nFellow ice-based villain [[Mr. Freeze]] has noted that Cold is the only cold-themed villain in the DC Universe to have mastered \"absolute zero\" with his weapons.\n\nIn the New 52 universe, Captain Cold temporarily had meta-human ice powers, including the power to slow down the Flash or objects traveling at high velocities via molecular deceleration caused by Absolute Zero, but these powers are later lost in the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' series when he is attacked by Deathstorm\u2014the Earth-3 counterpart of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]\u2014with Cold reverting to using his classic ice gun. Despite his lack of professional or technical expertise, Cold states that he spent so long analyzing the parts of his cold gun that he is able to recreate it in just over half an hour using parts stolen from a standard electronics shop.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #4</ref> He's even skilled enough to program it for a host of unique effects simulating some of his powers; like his \"Cold Field\" which quick cools the atmosphere to the point that everything caught in it grinds to a halt,<ref>''Justice League'' (2011) #38</ref> or an auto activation function which triggers his Cold Gun's freeze ray via vocalized password input.<ref name=\"Forever Evil #6\"/>\n\nDuring the Rebirth storyline, Snart augmented his Cold Gun even further by combining it with the anti-Speed Force technologies by the science criminal cell called '''Black Hole'''.<ref>''The Flash'' (2016) #16</ref> The newly christened '''Black Ice Gun''' now tacked directly into The Speed Force in order to painfully disrupt a speedster's connection to it. Snart's new cold gun was so powerful that not only could it hinder the Flash in the most excruciating way possible, it was vastly more powerful in scope, able to freeze both the harbor and several city blocks adjacent to their current location.<ref>''The Flash'' (2016) #17</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n*Captain Cold appears in [[Darwyn Cooke]]'s series ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]'', robbing a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casino where some DC heroes and others are attending a boxing match between [[Cassius Clay]] and [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted \"Wildcat\" Grant]]. Captain Cold freezes [[Iris West]]'s hand while she is on the phone with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]].  As the Flash, Barry races to Vegas and stops Captain Cold from freezing Vegas via cryogenic detonators. The Flash also rewires Cold's gun, causing it to backfire and trap the villain in a frozen water fountain.<ref>''DC: The New Frontier'' #2 (April 2004)</ref>\n*In the ''[[DC Super Friends]]'' universe, Captain Cold is part of a group of ice-themed villains called the \"Ice Pack\" that encases a city in ice and snow.<ref>''DC Super Friends'' #16 (August 2009)</ref>\n*A teen version of Captain Cold known as '''Kid Kold''' appeared in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic as an enemy of [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]]. Like his adult counterpart, Kold had a sister who was also a supervillain, dubbed '''Ice Kate'''.<ref>''Teen Titans Go! A horrible tv show'' #53</ref>\n*The 25th century Captain Cold is a hero named '''Commander Cold'''.  He is the leader of a metahuman police force known as [[Rogues (comics)#The Renegades|The Renegades]]. Commander Cold's face, in the one shot of it without his shades, shows an uncanny resemblance to Barry Allen.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010)</ref>\n*Captain Cold had made two appearances in the animated-continuity comic ''[[DC Animated Universe Comics|Justice League Adventures]]''. In issue #12, he and other ice-related villains encased an African city in ice.<ref>''Justice League Adventures'' #12</ref>\n* The [[New Rogues]] version of Captain Cold is '''Chill''', a unnamed man who possesses a cold gun.\n*In the alternate \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" timeline, Snart is a hero going by the name '''Citizen Cold'''. He retains his current wardrobe and weaponry, and is Central City's main hero, with a museum similar to the [[Flash Museum]], and a Rogues Gallery similar to that of the Flash, though he has killed some of his opponents. It is hinted that his heroics are a cover to hide a terrible secret.<ref name=\"fpcc1\">''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> He is contacted by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] to join in the fight against [[Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. When [[Thomas Wayne|Batman]] refuses to join, Citizen Cold declines as well.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)</ref> After Citizen Cold defeats [[Mr. Freeze|Mister Freeze]], he returns home and sees a news report that his sister, [[Golden Glider|Lisa]], has been arrested for killing their brutal father. When [[Wally West]] discovers Citizen Cold is a former low-level criminal, Cold freezes Wally in a block of ice.<ref name=\"fpcc1\"/> Later, Citizen Cold invites [[Iris West]] to dinner, but it is interrupted by calls that his sister Lisa has been kidnapped by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]. Citizen Cold tries to rescue Lisa, but the Rogues attack him for revenge on what he did to them. Citizen Cold is too late and Lisa is killed. Citizen Cold is injured while escaping and collapses outside his car near Iris.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Iris then brings him to her home. After he recovers, he gives her a key to his penthouse, and an offer to join him when he leaves Central City. He then kills the Rogues in revenge for what they did to his sister. When he returns home, he is confronted by Iris and the Pied Piper, who had revealed to her his murder of Wally. Citizen Cold attempts to kill Pied Piper, but Iris uses one of his own weapons to freeze him in a block of ice, just as he did to Wally.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>\n* In the \"Forever Evil\" storyline, the [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]] version of Leonard Snart is a police officer partnered with [[Heat Wave (comics)|Mick Rory]] who has been pursuing [[Johnny Quick|Jonathan Allen]] and [[Atomica]]. The two supervillains capture Snart and Rory and force them to fight to the death.  Snart loses, but Mick is killed by Jonathan.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #26</ref>\n* Captain Cold appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.  When [[Superman]]'s parents are kidnapped by [[Mirror Master]], the Justice League begins a manhunt for the Rogues. Captain Cold first appears being confronted by the Flash in Central City. Cold reveals the location of a villains' bar called World's End in Keystone City as a possible place where Mirror Master should be.

Dubbed \"Captain Cold\", he makes several attempts to eliminate The Flash throughout the [[The Flash (season 1)|first season]], eventually joining forces with his former colleague [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] and his sister [[Lisa Snart (Arrowverse)|Lisa Snart]], both of whom also get their own guns. After kidnapping Cisco, Snart forces him to reveal the Flash's identity as Barry Allen. Snart then makes a deal with Barry: he will keep his identity a secret and refrain from killing innocent people, and in exchange Barry will not interfere with his heists. Barry later requests Snart's help with a [[metahuman]] prison transfer, and Barry eliminates all of the authorities' records of Snart in exchange. However, Snart betrays Barry by freeing the inmates from captivity. In [[The Flash (season 2)|season two]], Snart is blackmailed into working with his abusive father [[Lewis Snart]] who plants a bomb in Lisa to ensure his son's cooperation.

At one point, Snart unsuccessfully attempts to alter his own past and prevent the cycle of abuse he and his sister suffered at the hands of their father. Later Snart starts to reform, becoming a true hero, which leads him to confrontation with Rory. When Rory later betrays the team, Snart maroons his partner in an isolated area. The vengeful Rory then returns as the Time Masters' temporal bounty hunter Chronos. After Chronos is captured by the Legends, Snart convinces the team to try and reform Rory, who eventually rejoins the team. At the end of the season, Snart sacrifices himself by blowing up the Time Masters, who are revealed to be working with Savage. In [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)|season two]], [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Eobard Thawne]] travels back in time to recruit a past version of Snart as part of his [[Legion of Doom (Arrowverse)|Legion of Doom]] in exchange for being able to prevent his death. This version of Snart has not reformed and is disgusted by the heroes his future self and Rory turned into. Snart manages to convince Rory to betray the Legends and join the Legion, bringing the [[Spear of Destiny]] with him and allowing the Legion to rewrite reality to fit their goals. However, Rory eventually turns back to the Legends when he becomes disillusioned with the new reality and the increasingly abusive Snart.

His parents moved often due to their work for the Symbolix Corporation, and Grant usually felt like an outsider among other kids. At his new school, Grant suddenly discovers he is a [[superhuman]] with incredible strength and the ability to produce explosive blasts.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Damage|Issue = #1-2|Date = (April-May 1994| publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref> During the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' crisis, Grant's powers became the spark that restarted the universe after it was destroyed by [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]; thanks to Damage's powers, the new universe evolved along natural lines, guided by nature rather than the will of Parallax.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]|Issue = #0|Date = (September 1994)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Damage (superhero).jpg|thumb|125px|left|Damage. Art by Todd Nauck.]]\nA superhero/supervillain battle, involving [[Baron Blitzkrieg]], [[Iron Munro]], and others, results in extensive damage to downtown [[Atlanta]]. Damage is arrested for his part in the extensive damage. [[Sarge Steel]] is able to cut a deal for him: he would be banned from Georgia for the rest of his life and remanded into the custody of the then-federally sponsored [[Teen Titans|Titans]] team, led by [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] (formerly Speedy, Green Arrow's sidekick). Around this time Damage deals emotionally with the murder, at the hands of a supervillain, of a schoolmate he cares for. After a while, Damage leaves the Titans to find his origins.\n\nWhen the original five Titans reformed the group,<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Titans|Issue = #1|Date = March 1999| publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Arsenal nominates Damage for membership. Arsenal managed to erase Grant's criminal records, so he was no longer a fugitive, and Grant joins the team. Grant participates in multiple adventures, including a confrontation with demons from [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] in ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]'' #1. Later, Damage confronts something he had buried for a long time: he had been victim of abuse at the hands of his foster father. After opening up to [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] (Arsenal's real name), Grant takes a leave of absence and seeks peace and healing on the Navajo reservation where Roy was raised as a child until he became the ward of [[Green Arrow]].\n\nHe learns that [[Vandal Savage]] was involved in an experiment at Symbolix called Project: Telemachus, where he took DNA samples he had collected from various superheroes and injected them into a fitting vessel: Grant.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> The heroes that Grant shares DNA with are: [[Atom (Al Pratt)]], Flash ([[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]), Green Lantern ([[Alan Scott]]), Wildcat ([[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Ted Grant]]), Hawkman ([[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]]), Hawkgirl ([[Hawkwoman#Shayera Hol|Shayera Hol]]), Hourman ([[Rex Tyler]]), [[Black Canary]] (Dinah Drake Lance), Doctor Mid-Nite ([[Charles McNider]]), Starman ([[Starman (Ted Knight)|Ted Knight]]), [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]] (Joan Dale), [[Johnny Quick (Johnny Chambers)]], Liberty Belle ([[Liberty Belle (comics)#Libby Lawrence|Libby Lawrence]]), [[Martian Manhunter]] (J'onn J'onzz/John Jones), Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]), [[Aquaman]], Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance), Green Lantern ([[Hal Jordan]]) and Atom ([[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]). Symbolix was allied with [[Shadowspire]] through Shadowspire's leader [[Baron Blitzkrieg]]. The Baron became a recurring foe in Damage's ongoing series, beginning with issue #3. Grant eventually learns that he is the son of [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Al Pratt]], the original [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] and his wife Mary. Grant is forced to go underground after leaving the Titans, since he violated his parole by doing so.\n \nHe helps the current [[Justice Society of America]] against [[Imperiex]] and the villainous team of [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], [[Eclipso]], and [[Mordru]], both times as part of a modern [[All-Star Squadron]]. He has since been seen with a new team of government-sponsored [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], whose activities are as yet unknown. He also has something of a brotherly relationship with [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], the godson of his father, the original Atom. It was thought that Grant had a brother, Walter, who was recently killed by Walter's superhero daughter, [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Manhunter]], a.k.a. Kate Spencer. However, Walter is actually the son of [[Iron Munro]] and [[Phantom Lady]] \u2014 an odd parallel to Damage's paternity search, as at one stage it appeared that Grant might be the couple's child.\n\nSeveral members of the modern Freedom Fighters team are killed by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Injustice Society]] in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1. Damage is one of the survivors, though his face is later revealed<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #4. DC Comics.</ref> to have been severely scarred by [[Reverse-Flash|Zoom]].<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1</ref>\n\nDamage appears in the relaunched ''Justice Society of America'' released in December 2006. He wears a full mask and a costume similar to that of his father and Atom Smasher, featuring a biohazard symbol. He also has a significantly gruffer and more cynical attitude, partly because, as the villain Rebel insinuates, Damage was left badly scarred, but alive, by Zoom. Zoom later encounters the Justice Society, claiming to have maimed, but not killed, the boy intentionally, to give him a defining tragedy, and the fight leads to Georgia. Damage leaps into the state, despite his ban from entering, catches up with Zoom, and holds him hostage. [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]] calms Damage down, but Zoom escapes and hurls debris at his face with the intent to kill him. Liberty Belle speeds in, saves Damage, and knocks out Zoom. When the police are ready to arrest Damage for violating his ban, the Justice Society stands up for him and he is released, but it is not yet known if this action has caused the ban to be dropped.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #8. DC Comics.</ref> Damage remained on the team, essentially in Atom Smasher's place (Jakeem Thunder's Thunderbolt has even called him \"Atom Smasher Two\" jokingly).\n\nDamage's face is later healed by the reborn [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #16</ref> This is enough to restore his former cheerful and outgoing personality, pushing him to attempt making contact with Sonia Sato, the new [[Judomaster]]. Since neither of them can understand the language spoken by the other (Grant does not know Japanese, while Judomaster cannot speak or understand more than a few words of English), their relationship is difficult, but the ongoing attraction is there (later it is inferred that they are \"together\" in some romantic way).<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #18</ref> When the JSA learns that Gog transformed a group of people who would harm others into trees and intends to keep overkill from punishing the wicked, they are divided on the subject. Grant and Judomaster, among others, side with Gog, and keep the rest of the JSA from trying to stop him.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #19. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDamage is then sent back to America to preach the will of Gog to the masses, showing a fanatical devotion to the Old God and a strong streak of vanity about his improved looks, to the point where he concludes that even Cyclone and [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] just want to talk to him because he is handsome. When the concerned Stargirl is sent to speak with him, and asks him to rethink his feelings about Gog, he instead attacks her after she accuses him of hiding behind the new 'mask' of his healed face as opposed to his original scars. Atom Smasher defeats Damage in combat and brings him to Al Pratt's home. Damage was prompted to renounce Gog, and learn by the example of Al Pratt, who, despite suffering borderline [[dwarfism]] - a height handicap that was a matter of ridicule in the early days of his membership in the original Justice Society until he received his powers - led a simple lifestyle and had a fulfilling existence. Instead, he renounces Al Pratt, blowing up his home and the records of his adventures and claiming to have always been abandoned by him, while Gog will be always at his side. Called by [[Magog (comics)|Magog]], he rejoins Gog, but there he is asked to kneel and show him his devotion (and expecting the rest of his followers to do the same). When some question this request, Gog becomes angry, even going as far as to threaten them.<ref>''Justice Society of America: The Kingdom'' One-Shot (2008). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThe rest of the JSA arrive, having learned from [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] that Gog is rooting himself into Earth, and if he remains for one more day, Earth will die if he ever leaves; this leaves them with the one option of killing Gog and separating his head from Earth, which is the only way to save the planet. The other Society members following Gog attempt to protect him, until they see him attempt to attack a Society member. All of the followers take up the fight, and Gog punishes them all by taking away his blessings as he threatened, including Damage's restored face, leaving him inconsolable.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #21. DC Comics.</ref> In retaliation, Damage unleashes a full-power blast against Gog, with little effect. Eventually, Gog is destroyed and the split in the Society is healed. After Gog's defeat, Damage, pained over losing his face again, attempts to push away Judomaster, only for her to kiss him, showing him that it does not matter what he looks like; she is attracted to him, not his face.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #22. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, the JSA were attacked by their fallen members, now reanimated as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]]. Damage was saved from Black Lantern Al Pratt by [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], but was then killed by Black Lantern [[Jean Loring]]. His death and the subsequent collection of his heart was the final one needed to bring about the rise of [[Nekron]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4</ref> Atom then made a futile attempt to stop one of the black power rings from turning Damage's corpse into a Black Lantern before Loring uses her own technology to shrink him, [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], and herself into the fully transformed Damage's ring.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #5. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile the other Black Lanterns continue their assault on the JSA headquarters,<ref>''Blackest Night: JSA'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Damage claims that he has retained his original personality and mind and is not influenced by Nekron and his Corps. While he does supposedly sacrifice himself in order to destroy the other Black Lanterns ([[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]] says that Damage's explosions do not necessarily harm him and that he was probably still \"alive\") his sacrifice also allows Lois Lane from Earth-2 to reanimate her deceased husband, with Mister Terrific saying that he knew they had found a way to outsmart them, implying Damage was in fact just another ruse of the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night: JSA'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''Blackest Night'', a funeral for Damage is held, attended by the JSA and with [[Judomaster]] doing the [[eulogy]] for Damage. It is then revealed that Damage, having foreseen his death by one of [[Sanderson Hawkins|Sand]]'s prophetic dreams, had recorded his last will for Judomaster, wishing her a better life, and revealing he had planned, in the attempt of giving her a happier life, to get cosmetic surgery on his scarred face. Spurred by his will, Sonia Sato decides to fund anonymously several relief funds for the victims of collateral damage caused by Grant's powers, thus giving him closure and a legacy.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Watchmen]]\" sequel \"[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\" Damage appeared with the Justice Society of America when [[Doctor Manhattan]] undoes the experiment that erased the Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #12. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Ethan Avery===\nIn 2018, DC introduced a new version of Damage as part of its [[The New Age of DC Heroes]] promotion in the form of US army recruit Ethan \"Elvis\" Avery Jr. He was turned into \"a living weapon of mass destruction\" through the Damage Project who, on a daily basis, becomes a hulking monster for one hour at a time. After breaking free from his confinement following a mission against the Modoran Separatist Army, Damage went on a rampage in Atlanta, Georgia before going into hiding.<ref>''Damage'' Vol. 2 #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter waking up in a homeless shelter, Avery saw the news about Damage and went outside to calm himself down. His position was tracked down by Task Force XI (a variation of the [[Suicide Squad]] consisting of Akando, [[Deadshot]], [[Giganta]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]) where they have orders to capture him. When Ethan tries to talk them out of attacking, Parasite was the first to attack where he starts to absorb his lifeforce until he collapses from absorbing too much energy. Ethan suddenly transforms into Damage and attacks Task Force XI. After easily defeating Task Force XI, Damage was confronted by [[Wonder Woman]] who advises Task Force XI to step aside and let her deal with Damage.<ref>''Damage'' Vol. 2 #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWonder Woman fights Damage and uses her magic lasso on him where she learned that Damage is actually a man. Upon breaking free, Damage threw Wonder Woman into a tree and collapsed a building to get away when his time limit is up. Wonder Woman later informs the [[Justice League]] about her fight with Damage. [[Batman]] promises to continue to investigate the origin of Damage. The next morning, Ethan is at a coffee shop where he sees the news about Damage. Ethan decides to leave the city.<ref>''Damage'' Vol. 2 #3. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Grant Emerson version of Damage can generate a power charge that enhances his strength, durability, speed, and reflexes to superhuman levels. If he does not use the energy in the aforementioned manner he is forced to expend it in a discharge, most notably the time he started another [[Big Bang]] during Zero Hour (although he only gained the energy necessary to do this thanks to other heroes such as [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], the [[Ray (comics)|Ray]] and [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] absorbing and converting [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]'s energy into something that he could then process). The aged Damage in ''Young Justice: Sins of Youth'' had the ability to fly. While the current Damage cannot harness this ability yet, he can \"leap\" by firing his energy at the ground, sometimes traveling great distances, as shown most recently in ''Justice Society of America'' #8. At one point in his ongoing series, it is implied that he potentially possesses all of the powers of the heroes whose DNA he shares. Towards the end of his ongoing series, a middle-aged man in unusual clothes is shown several times quietly observing Grant. Although the series was canceled before this plotline could be addressed, it is strongly implied that this man was a future version of Grant and he is shown possessing powers, including flight, which the current version of Damage does not.\n\nThe Ethan Avery version of Damage can become a hulking monster for one hour at a time. In this form, he has super-strength enough to leap great distances and rival the strengths of Solomon Grundy and Wonder Woman. Damage has enhanced durability where he is resistant to blades, bullets, rockets, and falling from several hundred feet from the air. Besides his power limitation, a side effect of his abilities is that Ethan developed a dual personality where his Damage side fights to trigger Ethan's transformation.\n\n==In other media==\nIn ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Power Outage\", the Grant Emerson version of Damage is one of the people who seemingly died in the particle accelerator explosion.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=damage Damage] at DCU Guide\n\n{{The Atom}}\n\n[[Category:DC Comics titles]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1994]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Superheroes who are adopted]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2018]]\n[[Category:2018 comics debuts]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the Marvel Comics character|Damage (Marvel Comics)}}\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=Damage (comics).jpg\n|caption=''Justice Society of America'' #6 (2007).

His parents moved often due to their work for the Symbolix Corporation, and Grant usually felt like an outsider among other kids.

Art by Todd Nauck.]]\nA superhero/supervillain battle, involving [[Baron Blitzkrieg]], [[Iron Munro]], and others, results in extensive damage to downtown [[Atlanta]]. Damage is arrested for his part in the extensive damage. [[Sarge Steel]] is able to cut a deal for him: he would be banned from Georgia for the rest of his life and remanded into the custody of the then-federally sponsored [[Teen Titans|Titans]] team, led by [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] (formerly Speedy, Green Arrow's sidekick). Around this time Damage deals emotionally with the murder, at the hands of a supervillain, of a schoolmate he cares for. After a while, Damage leaves the Titans to find his origins.\n\nWhen the original five Titans reformed the group,<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Titans|Issue = #1|Date = March 1999| publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Arsenal nominates Damage for membership. Arsenal managed to erase Grant's criminal records, so he was no longer a fugitive, and Grant joins the team. Grant participates in multiple adventures, including a confrontation with demons from [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] in ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]'' #1. Later, Damage confronts something he had buried for a long time: he had been victim of abuse at the hands of his foster father. After opening up to [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] (Arsenal's real name), Grant takes a leave of absence and seeks peace and healing on the Navajo reservation where Roy was raised as a child until he became the ward of [[Green Arrow]].\n\nHe learns that [[Vandal Savage]] was involved in an experiment at Symbolix called Project: Telemachus, where he took DNA samples he had collected from various superheroes and injected them into a fitting vessel: Grant.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> The heroes that Grant shares DNA with are: [[Atom (Al Pratt)]], Flash ([[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]), Green Lantern ([[Alan Scott]]), Wildcat ([[Wildcat (comics)#Ted Grant|Ted Grant]]), Hawkman ([[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]]), Hawkgirl ([[Hawkwoman#Shayera Hol|Shayera Hol]]), Hourman ([[Rex Tyler]]), [[Black Canary]] (Dinah Drake Lance), Doctor Mid-Nite ([[Charles McNider]]), Starman ([[Starman (Ted Knight)|Ted Knight]]), [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]] (Joan Dale), [[Johnny Quick (Johnny Chambers)]], Liberty Belle ([[Liberty Belle (comics)#Libby Lawrence|Libby Lawrence]]), [[Martian Manhunter]] (J'onn J'onzz/John Jones), Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]), [[Aquaman]], Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance), Green Lantern ([[Hal Jordan]]) and Atom ([[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]). Symbolix was allied with [[Shadowspire]] through Shadowspire's leader [[Baron Blitzkrieg]]. The Baron became a recurring foe in Damage's ongoing series, beginning with issue #3. Grant eventually learns that he is the son of [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Al Pratt]], the original [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] and his wife Mary. Grant is forced to go underground after leaving the Titans, since he violated his parole by doing so.\n \nHe helps the current [[Justice Society of America]] against [[Imperiex]] and the villainous team of [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], [[Eclipso]], and [[Mordru]], both times as part of a modern [[All-Star Squadron]]. He has since been seen with a new team of government-sponsored [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], whose activities are as yet unknown. He also has something of a brotherly relationship with [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], the godson of his father, the original Atom. It was thought that Grant had a brother, Walter, who was recently killed by Walter's superhero daughter, [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Manhunter]], a.k.a. Kate Spencer. However, Walter is actually the son of [[Iron Munro]] and [[Phantom Lady]] \u2014 an odd parallel to Damage's paternity search, as at one stage it appeared that Grant might be the couple's child.\n\nSeveral members of the modern Freedom Fighters team are killed by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Injustice Society]] in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1. Damage is one of the survivors, though his face is later revealed<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #4. DC Comics.</ref> to have been severely scarred by [[Reverse-Flash|Zoom]].<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1</ref>\n\nDamage appears in the relaunched ''Justice Society of America'' released in December 2006. He wears a full mask and a costume similar to that of his father and Atom Smasher, featuring a biohazard symbol. He also has a significantly gruffer and more cynical attitude, partly because, as the villain Rebel insinuates, Damage was left badly scarred, but alive, by Zoom. Zoom later encounters the Justice Society, claiming to have maimed, but not killed, the boy intentionally, to give him a defining tragedy, and the fight leads to Georgia. Damage leaps into the state, despite his ban from entering, catches up with Zoom, and holds him hostage. [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]] calms Damage down, but Zoom escapes and hurls debris at his face with the intent to kill him. Liberty Belle speeds in, saves Damage, and knocks out Zoom. When the police are ready to arrest Damage for violating his ban, the Justice Society stands up for him and he is released, but it is not yet known if this action has caused the ban to be dropped.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #8. DC Comics.</ref> Damage remained on the team, essentially in Atom Smasher's place (Jakeem Thunder's Thunderbolt has even called him \"Atom Smasher Two\" jokingly).\n\nDamage's face is later healed by the reborn [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #16</ref> This is enough to restore his former cheerful and outgoing personality, pushing him to attempt making contact with Sonia Sato, the new [[Judomaster]]. Since neither of them can understand the language spoken by the other (Grant does not know Japanese, while Judomaster cannot speak or understand more than a few words of English), their relationship is difficult, but the ongoing attraction is there (later it is inferred that they are \"together\" in some romantic way).<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #18</ref> When the JSA learns that Gog transformed a group of people who would harm others into trees and intends to keep overkill from punishing the wicked, they are divided on the subject. Grant and Judomaster, among others, side with Gog, and keep the rest of the JSA from trying to stop him.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #19. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDamage is then sent back to America to preach the will of Gog to the masses, showing a fanatical devotion to the Old God and a strong streak of vanity about his improved looks, to the point where he concludes that even Cyclone and [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] just want to talk to him because he is handsome. When the concerned Stargirl is sent to speak with him, and asks him to rethink his feelings about Gog, he instead attacks her after she accuses him of hiding behind the new 'mask' of his healed face as opposed to his original scars. Atom Smasher defeats Damage in combat and brings him to Al Pratt's home. Damage was prompted to renounce Gog, and learn by the example of Al Pratt, who, despite suffering borderline [[dwarfism]] - a height handicap that was a matter of ridicule in the early days of his membership in the original Justice Society until he received his powers - led a simple lifestyle and had a fulfilling existence. Instead, he renounces Al Pratt, blowing up his home and the records of his adventures and claiming to have always been abandoned by him, while Gog will be always at his side. Called by [[Magog (comics)|Magog]], he rejoins Gog, but there he is asked to kneel and show him his devotion (and expecting the rest of his followers to do the same). When some question this request, Gog becomes angry, even going as far as to threaten them.<ref>''Justice Society of America: The Kingdom'' One-Shot (2008). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThe rest of the JSA arrive, having learned from [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] that Gog is rooting himself into Earth, and if he remains for one more day, Earth will die if he ever leaves; this leaves them with the one option of killing Gog and separating his head from Earth, which is the only way to save the planet. The other Society members following Gog attempt to protect him, until they see him attempt to attack a Society member. All of the followers take up the fight, and Gog punishes them all by taking away his blessings as he threatened, including Damage's restored face, leaving him inconsolable.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #21. DC Comics.</ref> In retaliation, Damage unleashes a full-power blast against Gog, with little effect. Eventually, Gog is destroyed and the split in the Society is healed. After Gog's defeat, Damage, pained over losing his face again, attempts to push away Judomaster, only for her to kiss him, showing him that it does not matter what he looks like; she is attracted to him, not his face.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #22. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, the JSA were attacked by their fallen members, now reanimated as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]]. Damage was saved from Black Lantern Al Pratt by [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], but was then killed by Black Lantern [[Jean Loring]]. His death and the subsequent collection of his heart was the final one needed to bring about the rise of [[Nekron]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4</ref> Atom then made a futile attempt to stop one of the black power rings from turning Damage's corpse into a Black Lantern before Loring uses her own technology to shrink him, [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], and herself into the fully transformed Damage's ring.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #5. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile the other Black Lanterns continue their assault on the JSA headquarters,<ref>''Blackest Night: JSA'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Damage claims that he has retained his original personality and mind and is not influenced by Nekron and his Corps. While he does supposedly sacrifice himself in order to destroy the other Black Lanterns ([[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]] says that Damage's explosions do not necessarily harm him and that he was probably still \"alive\") his sacrifice also allows Lois Lane from Earth-2 to reanimate her deceased husband, with Mister Terrific saying that he knew they had found a way to outsmart them, implying Damage was in fact just another ruse of the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night: JSA'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''Blackest Night'', a funeral for Damage is held, attended by the JSA and with [[Judomaster]] doing the [[eulogy]] for Damage. It is then revealed that Damage, having foreseen his death by one of [[Sanderson Hawkins|Sand]]'s prophetic dreams, had recorded his last will for Judomaster, wishing her a better life, and revealing he had planned, in the attempt of giving her a happier life, to get cosmetic surgery on his scarred face. Spurred by his will, Sonia Sato decides to fund anonymously several relief funds for the victims of collateral damage caused by Grant's powers, thus giving him closure and a legacy.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Watchmen]]\" sequel \"[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\" Damage appeared with the Justice Society of America when [[Doctor Manhattan]] undoes the experiment that erased the Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #12. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Ethan Avery===\nIn 2018, DC introduced a new version of Damage as part of its [[The New Age of DC Heroes]] promotion in the form of US army recruit Ethan \"Elvis\" Avery Jr. He was turned into \"a living weapon of mass destruction\" through the Damage Project who, on a daily basis, becomes a hulking monster for one hour at a time. After breaking free from his confinement following a mission against the Modoran Separatist Army, Damage went on a rampage in Atlanta, Georgia before going into hiding.<ref>''Damage'' Vol. 2 #1.

When Ethan tries to talk them out of attacking, Parasite was the first to attack where he starts to absorb his lifeforce until he collapses from absorbing too much energy. Ethan suddenly transforms into Damage and attacks Task Force XI. After easily defeating Task Force XI, Damage was confronted by [[Wonder Woman]] who advises Task Force XI to step aside and let her deal with Damage.<ref>''Damage'' Vol. 2 #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWonder Woman fights Damage and uses her magic lasso on him where she learned that Damage is actually a man. Upon breaking free, Damage threw Wonder Woman into a tree and collapsed a building to get away when his time limit is up. Wonder Woman later informs the [[Justice League]] about her fight with Damage. [[Batman]] promises to continue to investigate the origin of Damage. The next morning, Ethan is at a coffee shop where he sees the news about Damage. Ethan decides to leave the city.<ref>''Damage'' Vol. 2 #3. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Grant Emerson version of Damage can generate a power charge that enhances his strength, durability, speed, and reflexes to superhuman levels. If he does not use the energy in the aforementioned manner he is forced to expend it in a discharge, most notably the time he started another [[Big Bang]] during Zero Hour (although he only gained the energy necessary to do this thanks to other heroes such as [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], the [[Ray (comics)|Ray]] and [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] absorbing and converting [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]'s energy into something that he could then process).

He first appeared in ''Flash Comics #1'' (1940).\n\nAfter a bizarre laboratory accident, he acquired the ability to move at superhuman speed, and chose to fight crime as a costumed vigilante, calling himself \"the Flash\". Jay Garrick has made numerous appearances in other media, including his live-action debut as a cameo in ''[[Smallville]]'', played by Billy Mitchell, and recurring in the [[Arrowverse]] show ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[John Wesley Shipp]].\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:FllashComics GA 1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|First appearance in ''Flash Comics'' #1 (Jan 1940).]]\nThe character of Jay Garrick was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert. The character first appeared in the first issue of the anthology series ''Flash Comics'' in 1940, published by [[All-American Publications]]. He was soon featured in ''All-Star Comics'' as part of the [[Justice Society of America]]. In 1941, he got his own solo comic book series, ''[[All-Flash]]''.\n\nAfter World War II, superheroes declined in popularity, <!-- thus causing the Flash's comic book series to be canceled - right? I assumed that that is why it mentioned superheroes' declining popularity. -->causing many of the Flash's comic book series to be canceled. ''All-Flash'' was canceled in 1948 after 32 issues. ''Flash Comics'' was canceled in 1949 after 104 issues. ''All-Star Comics'' was canceled in 1951 after 57 issues, marking Garrick's last [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] appearance. Garrick would not appear again for ten years, and never got another solo series.\n\nIn 1956, DC Comics reinvented the Flash character, giving him a new costume, name, and background. This new Flash, named [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], was completely unrelated to Jay Garrick. In fact, Garrick had never existed, as far as the new books were concerned. Barry Allen's first appearance shows him reading a copy of ''Flash Comics'', lamenting that Garrick was \"just a character some writer dreamed up\". Readers welcomed the new Flash, but still had an interest in the old one.\n\nJay Garrick made a guest appearance in ''Flash'' #123. In this issue, Garrick was treated as residing in a parallel universe ([[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]]), which allowed the character to exist without any continuity conflicts with Barry Allen (who existed on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]]), yet allowed him to make guest appearances in [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] books. Garrick only made guest appearances for most of the 60s and 70s. However, starting in 1976, Garrick became a regular character in the revived ''All-Star Comics'', partaking in adventures with the Justice Society, in stories set in modern times. In 1981, he and the Justice Society appeared in ''All-Star Squadron'' in stories set during World War II.\n\nIn 1985, DC Comics merged all of its fictional characters into a single shared universe. Jay Garrick now shared the same world as the new Flash. DC wrote the character out of continuity in the one-shot ''[[Last Days of the Justice Society of America|Last Days of the Justice Society]]'', but brought the character back in the 1990s due to fan interest. Unlike characters such as Batman or Superman, DC decided not to update Jay as a young hero, but portrayed him as a veteran of World War 2 with a magically-prolonged lifespan. Jay Garrick became a regular character in ''JSA'' and ''Justice Society of America''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===The Flash===\n'''Jason Peter Garrick'''<ref>''JSA'' #87 (September 2006)</ref> is a college student, who, prior to 1940 (later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to 1938), accidentally inhales [[hard water]] vapors after taking a smoke break in his laboratory where he had been working (later stories would change this to [[heavy water]] vapors). As a result, he finds that he can run at [[superhuman]] speed and has similarly fast reflexes. Retcons imply that the inhalation simply activated a latent [[metahuman|metagene]].\n\nAfter a brief career as a [[college football]] star, he dons a red shirt with a lightning bolt and a stylized [[Brodie helmet|metal helmet]] with wings (based on images of the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]). He then begins to fight crime as the Flash.<ref name=\"Beatty\"/> The helmet belonged to Jay's father, Joseph, who fought during [[World War I]].<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #208 (May 2004)</ref> He sometimes uses the helmet as a weapon or a type of shield, as seen in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #4 (March 2006)</ref> He has also used it to direct a beam of light at [[Eclipso]]. In [[The Flash: Rebirth]](2010), he used it to de-stabilize [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash]].\n\nIn the early stories, it seems to be widely known that Garrick is the Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Gardner F.

The effectiveness of this is debatable, as he later blamed his girlfriend, [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Joan Garrick|Joan]], deducing his true identity on his lack of a mask. Garrick ultimately made his identity as the Flash public to the world.<ref>DC Special Series #11 (1978)</ref>\n\nDuring his career, he would often find himself embroiled in semi-comic situations inadvertently initiated by [[Winky, Blinky, and Noddy]], a trio of [[tramp]]s known as the Three Dimwits, who tried their hand at one job after another, and never successfully.\n\nHis first case involves battling the Faultless Four, a group of blackmailers (Sieur Satan, Serge Orloff, Duriel, and Smythe), who plot to steal an atomic bombarder and sell it. It is later revealed that a professor found the last container of heavy water vapors and used it to gain superspeed, becoming the [[Reverse-Flash#The Rival|Rival]]. He briefly takes away Jay's speed after capturing him, making him super-slow, but Jay uses the gases again, allowing him to regain his superspeed and defeat the Rival.\n\nLike the Flashes who followed him, Garrick became a close friend of the [[Green Lantern]] of his time, [[Alan Scott]], whom he met through the Justice Society of America.\n\n===Justice Society of America===\nThe Flash soon became one of the best-known of the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] of superheroes. He was a founding member of the Justice Society of America and served as its first chairman.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Gardner F.

He left the JSA after issue #6, but returned several years later (issue #24, spring 1945). He had a distinguished career as a crime-fighter during the 1940s.\n\nGarrick's early history was largely the subject of [[retcons]]. A story explaining the retirement of the JSA members, including the Flash, explained that, in 1951, the JSA was investigated by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] for possible [[Communist]] sympathies and asked to reveal their identities. This was later revealed to be partly caused by [[Per Degaton]]. The JSA declined, and Garrick, who recently married his longtime girlfriend Joan, retired from superhero life. As a trained scientist, he ran an experimental laboratory for several decades.\n\n''[[All-Star Squadron]] Annual'' #3 states that the JSA fought a being named [[Ian Karkull]], who imbued them with energy that slowed their aging, allowing Garrick and many others \u2013 as well as their girlfriends and sidekicks \u2013 to remain active into the late 20th century without infirmity. The 1990s ''[[Starman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Starman]]'' series notes that [[Shade (comics)|the Shade]] prompted Garrick to come out of retirement in the 1950s, but the details of his activities during this time are hazy at best.\n\n===Earth-Two===\nGarrick emerged from retirement in 1961 to meet the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] Flash, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]]. The rest of the JSA soon joined the Flash, although their activities during the 1960s (other than their annual meeting with Earth-One's [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]) were unrecorded, although it is clear that Garrick and [[Green Lantern (Alan Scott)]] were good friends. It is also established that Garrick has become a respected scientist on his Earth.\n\nGarrick was a key member of the JSA's 1970s adventures (as chronicled in ''All-Star Comics'' and ''[[Adventure Comics]]''). Garrick also helped to launch the careers of [[Infinity Inc.]] Following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', all the parallel worlds are merged into one, and Keystone City becomes the twin city of Allen's [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], with the two separated by a river. An updated story suggests that Keystone in this new continuity is rendered invisible and wiped from the memories of the world for many years through the actions of several [[supervillain]]s.\n\n===21st Century===\nIn the early 21st century, many of Garrick's JSA cohorts have retired or died, but Garrick remains active with the latest incarnation of the group. He is physically about 50 years old, thanks to the effects of several accidental anti-aging treatments, but his chronological age is closer to 90. He is one of the few surviving members of the Justice Society of America after [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]].<ref>''Zero Hour: Crisis in Time'' #2 (September 1994)</ref> Of the three original JSA members still on the team (along with Alan Scott and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]]), Jay takes a fatherly approach toward his teammates and the DC superhero community in general.\n\n===''Infinite Crisis'' and ''One Year Later''===\n{{main|Infinite Crisis|One Year Later}}\n\nGarrick and his wife, Joan, have guardianship of [[Bart Allen]] after [[Max Mercury]]'s disappearance. During the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', Garrick states that the [[Speed Force]] is gone after a battle in which many speedsters, living and dead, wrestle [[Superboy-Prime]] into the Speed Force and disappear. Garrick is left behind on Earth by the other speedsters when he reaches his speed limit and cannot follow. Bart Allen returns, aged several years, having absorbed the entire Speed Force during his pursuit of the escaped Superboy-Prime. Garrick claims that without the Speed Force, his own power is less than before: like [[Wally West]] in the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' aftermath, he can only run close to the [[speed of sound]]. He also states that, as the Speed Force is no longer retarding his aging, his speed is diminishing with time. After Bart leaves Keystone City for Los Angeles, Garrick, once again, is the city's sole guardian. After hearing news of Bart's demise, Garrick collapses with grief, consoled by Jesse Chambers.\n\nGarrick continues his work as a member of the reformed Justice Society of America, under the leadership of [[Power Girl]]. After the death of Bart Allen, Garrick's full speed returns. Garrick is currently the mayor of Monument Point, where the JSA is now based. He faces problems due to the JSA being based in the Town,{{Clarify|reason=What town? And why is Town capitalized?|date=March 2017}} but after talking to another official, who says that, as Garrick is not a politician, he doesn't have to worry about being re-elected, Garrick gains confidence.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #49 (May 2011)</ref>{{Dubious|date=March 2017|reason=I thought that mayors are elected, so Garrick \"not having to worry about being re-elected\" doesn't make any sense to me...what am I missing?}} Soon after this, he holds a funeral for [[Alan Scott]], who is killed defeating the villain D'arken, and tells the Justice Society that they must endure.\n\n====Clone====\nIn the ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]: [[One Year Later]]'' story arc, a clone of Garrick appears as an antagonist, created by the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. He appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s and is brainwashed into working for a Malinese dictator. The clone is defeated by the combined efforts of the Outsiders. He possesses Jay Garrick's super-speed, but none of his memories or expertise.<ref>''Outsiders'' #36 (July 2006)</ref> His unconscious body is placed in the custody of Alan Scott, [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'s White King.\n\nBecause of lingering issues in the cloning process, made more unpredictable by the metagene itself, the clone is infected by a fast acting version of the ''clone plague'' deteriorating and shortening the lifespan of clones in the DC Universe. This makes it difficult for Checkmate to find a way to wake him and undo his brainwash, because, even with his special suit, tailored to stave the degenerating process, he would be doomed to a slow death whenever he awakens from his [[suspended animation]].\n\n===''Brightest Day''===\nIn Brightest Day, Garrick and the rest of the JSA help Alan Scott and his children overcome the power of the Starheart, and, in turn, help save the planet from the Dark Avatar. After the events of the ''Brightest Day'', Garrick and the rest of the JSA travel to the city of Monument Point, which has been attacked by a superpowered terrorist named Scythe. Just before being defeated, Scythe snaps Jay's long standing friend Alan Scott's neck.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #44</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}} In the following story, it is revealed that Scythe is the product of Nazi genetic engineering, and that Scott and Garrick had been tasked by the president with killing him back when he was in infancy during World War II. The two heroes could not agree on a course of action, and, as a result, Scythe was allowed to live.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #45</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}} Doctor Mid-Nite discovers that the injuries Scott sustained have paralyzed Scott, and that any attempt to heal himself could break his constant concentration, which could result in the Starheart once again regaining control of his body.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #46</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nJade visits her bed-ridden father in the Emerald City, and offers to use her abilities to help him walk again. Scott declines his daughter's offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it could result in the deaths of everyone in the city. [[Eclipso]] attacks the city, which results in [[Jesse Quick]] having to get Scott to safety.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #55</ref>\n\nLater, the JSA tries to take down the villain D'arken, who has broken free from imprisonment beneath Monument Point and absorbed the powers of JSA members, but D'arken is too powerful for the JSA to take him down. Due to the entity's ability to absorb powers from superhumans in its vicinity, only non-superpowered and magical members fight D'arken. The JSA tells Alan Scott that unleashing the Starheart is the only way to destroy D'arken. However, after releasing the Starheart energies, Scott's body begins to incinerate itself. Afterwards, the JSA attends a funeral for Scott, whom they believe to be dead.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #54 (August 2011)</ref> Garrick is upset at having lost one of his closest friends and founding members of the JSA.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{In-universe|section|date=June 2017}}\nFollowing the return of [[Wally West]] to DC continuity during ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Barry Allen is overwhelmed by the Speed Force when he shakes hands with Wally West. This not only causes Barry to become possessed by an echo of Eobard Thawne, but also causes Barry to start being absorbed into the Speed Force itself. It takes both Wally and the current [[Wally West II|Kid Flash]]'s interference to prevent Barry from being absorbed for good. Barry later reveals that, when he was overwhelmed by the Speed Force, he saw visions of possible future events. He also reveals his last glimpse before he was returned to normal was that something more was trapped inside the Speed Force and although he could not recognize it, it still filled him with hope. The object that Barry saw was then revealed to be the helmet of the pre-Flashpoint Jay Garrick.<ref>''The Flash'' #9</ref>\n\nWhile tracking a [[Doctor Manhattan|mysterious force]] responsible for the recent universal reset, Barry and [[Batman]] experience another flash in the form of a vision of Jay's helmet, although he attributes it to the helmet of Mercury. While chasing Thawne, Bruce and Barry can hear someone call out for the latter but Barry believes it to be calls from lost moments that could have been. As the Cosmic Treadmill begins to break apart, the voice intensifies and Bruce tells Barry to listen and grab onto the voice. As the voice says \"Jay\", Barry says the name as well and Jay Garrick arrives, claiming he is free and provides enough speed and power to get Batman and Barry back home. Jay explains he didn't kill Thawne, he is a friend, and (also) Flash. He tries to get Barry to remember who he is; Barry is unable to, but finds Jay familiar and somehow trusts him. Then Jay is absorbed by a blue light and taken away. Barry believes Jay may be from another time that no longer exists and Barry is not the person that keeps him tethered to reality, saying he's \"not his lightning rod.\"<ref>''The Flash'' #22</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Watchmen]]\" sequel \"[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\" Lois Lane finds a flash-drive among the mess while at the Daily Planet.

The limits of his speed have fluctuated over the years, though he has usually been second to DC's \"flagship\" Flash, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]].\n\nIn his earliest appearances, Garrick's speed was derived from a metagene that activated after he inhaled hard water vapours.  This allowed him to move swiftly enough to intercept bullets. He could carry people away with him at super-speed without causing injury due to extreme acceleration. He could make himself invisible by vibrating his body at high frequencies. Over time, Jay Garrick learns to access a new fuel for his powers (and those of other speedsters), the [[Speed Force]].\n\nIn the 2012 series Earth 2, Jay's powers are a blessing from the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. He can magically transform his clothing into his costume at will.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n{{Main|List of Flash supporting characters#Golden Age}}\n===Joan Garrick===\n'''Joan Williams''', later '''Joan Garrick''' is a fictional character from [[DC Comics]], a [[supporting character]] and romantic interest of Flash (Jay Garrick) She is debuted as the earliest recurring supporting character of Flash within the [[DC Universe]]. \n\nFirst depicted as the girlfriend, and later wife, of Jay Garrick.

Following this, a new multiverse is established and all series were relaunched as part of DC's [[The New 52]] publishing event. The post-''52'' pre-''Flashpoint'' Earth-2 Jay Garrick ceases to exist, as did the mainstream Jay Garrick. A new but entirely different Earth-2 Jay Garrick then becomes the continually published version of the character ([[#The New 52|see publication history]]).\n\n===Elseworlds===\nIn the [[Elseworlds]] book ''[[JSA: The Unholy Three]]'', Jay Garrick is portrayed as a post-WW2 United States [[intelligence agent]] stationed in Russia, working under the code-name '''Mercury'''. He is instrumental in bringing down the story's [[General Zod|rogue Superman]].<ref>''JSA: The Unholy Three'' (2003)</ref>\n\n===Wonderland===\nWhen Brother Grimm helped Captain Cold and Mirror Master trap Wally West in an alternate world where the Speed Force never existed, it is revealed that Jay Garrick never gained his speed in the accident and died during the Second World War.\n\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' reality, Jay Garrick died rather than developing super-speed after inhaling hard water.<ref>''Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n{{main|Flash in other media}}\n\n===Television===\n\n====Animation====\n* In  [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]] episode \"Legends\" a character named '''The Streak''' voiced by [[David Naughton]] is based on Jay Garrick. The Streak was the speedster of the [[Justice Guild of America]]. He died along with the other members of the JGA during a war that destroyed most of their homeworld. The character of The Streak is based on the Golden Age Flash, Jay Garrick, with some costume differences: the helmet (Jay wears a WWI helmet given to him by his father emblazoned with wings like those on Flash's hood, not a pilot helmet), the pants (which are blue instead of red with yellow overshorts) and the lightning bolt on the shirt (which rises up from the bottom and takes up most of its main body).\n* Jay Garrick is a recurring character in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Andy Milder]]. He is of the heroes [[Batman]] most frequently teams up with. In the teaser plot of \"Trials of the Demon!\", he and Batman stop the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and Scream Queen on [[Halloween]]. After learning that the Halloween pumpkins are infected with the Scarecrow's fear toxin, Garrick rounds up every pumpkin in town. When the townspeople demand to know what happened, Garrick finds Batman already gone. Garrick briefly appears in \"The Fate of Equinox\", in which he lends his powers to Batman to help against Equinox. He returns as a member of the Justice Society in the episode \"The Golden Age of Justice\". In \"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster\", Garrick acknowledges that Barry Allen disappeared in a battle with [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom]]. Batman, Jay and [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] use the cosmic treadmill to travel to the 25th century and help Barry battle Professor Zoom.\n* Jay Garrick appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Geoff Pierson]]. He and Joan (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) are introduced in the episode \"Downtime\", where the Allen and West families throw a birthday party for Jay. Jay is referred to as a 'retired speedster' by Joan Garrick, and does not appear to possess the slowed-aging that his comic book counterpart does. He temporarily comes out of retirement in the episode \"Bloodlines\" in order to help Barry, Kid Flash, and Impulse during a battle against [[Neutron (comics)|Neutron]], as well as in the series  finale to help the Justice League save the Earth. Through the series, it is mentioned that the Garricks have been acting as Impulse's guardians. He returns in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'' episode \"Illusion of Control\" where he is seen sitting next to his wife Joan at a hospital in Central City. In the episode \"Early Warning,\" Kid Flash and Blue Beetle are unable to assist the Outsiders because they are with Jay attending Joan's funeral. In the episode \"Elder Wisdom,\" Jay Garrick reminds Lex Luthor during his interview with [[Glorious Godfrey|G. Gordon Godfrey]] that the Hero Registration didn't work when Lex Luthor suggests reviving it.\n\n====Live action====\n* The character is alluded to in the 1990 ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' live-action TV series.

In season four's \"Run\", the name is one of [[Bart Allen]]'s aliases. The actual character appears in season nine's \"Absolute Justice\" (played by Billy Mitchell). He is a superhero in the 1970s, as well as a research scientist. He was framed by the government for fraud as part of their plan to disable the JSA. He, like the others, falsely confessed to all charges, but they were never convicted. With law enforcement aware of his superhero identity, Garrick retired. In 2010, [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Chloe Sullivan]] find old black and white police footage of Garrick, along with his criminal record. Very little is said about him, but it was confirmed by [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] he was still alive, and it was hinted he had children. In the eleventh issue of the comic book continuation, it is revealed that Garrick's leg was disabled, and that he could no longer run at superhuman speed, which is how the government was able to arrest him. It is also revealed that Bart got Garrick's name, along with those of Barry Allen and Wally West, through [[subliminal stimuli]] from the Speed Force. Garrick becomes a recluse after retiring.<ref>''Smallville Season 11'' #11 (March 2013)</ref> Clark and Bart consult Jay to find out how to stop the Black Flash.

The three speedsters enter \"Flashtime\", a state in which they move so fast that time appears to be frozen. After several unsuccessful attempts to stop the explosion, operating in Flashtime for so long begins to take its toll on Garrick's aged body, forcing him to drop back into normal speed. Eventually, after the disaster is averted, Garrick announces that he has decided to retire from superhero work and will begin training a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e to succeed him as Earth-3's Flash. By [[The Flash (season 6)|season six]], Garrick has retired and settled down with his wife [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]] (portrayed by Michelle Harrison).\n\n===Films===\nJay Garrick makes a cameo appearance in the opening credits of the animated film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''. He is seen being forced out of heroics by the government.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n[[Smallville Season 11]]: Garrick first appears in \"Haunted\", where, in an attempt to help [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] find a way to keep his speed demon from stalking him, Clark takes Impulse to the JSA Brownstone, saying that they must find Garrick, because, as a fellow speedster, he might have answers they need. Arriving at an old residence in the outskirts of Utah, Superman and Impulse encounter an old withered version of Garrick equipped with a cane. At first, Garrick isn't thrilled at meeting Impulse, who had stolen his identity a few years earlier. Clark informs Garrick of Carter Hall's initial plan (prior to his untimely death) to reinstate the Justice Society of America, with the remaining living members helping to guide the new generation of Heroes. Impulse asks Garrick to reveal all that he knows about the [[Black Flash]]. Garrick shows signs of fear at the mention of that name, and begins to reveal the reason behind his handicap. The Government broke his leg a decade ago, and Garrick refused to have it repaired \u2013 thus depriving himself of his Super Speed abilities, which would prevent the Black Flash from haunting Garrick. However, Garrick can still feel the Black Flash's presence, and he realizes that the Black Flash has its sights set on Impulse. The only way to stop the Black Flash is for Impulse to die. As the speed storm crackles in Utah, Clark tries to reason with Garrick, saying that there must be another way to help Bart. Garrick asserts that there is no choice in the matter, and that by using the Speed Force, the demon{{Clarify|reason=What demon?|date=March 2017}} is there to collect the debt. Clark asks why there were no records of speed storms while Garrick was with the JSA. Garrick surmises that Impulse is so fast that it has made the creature hungry and desperate. Picking up on the thought, Clark reasons that it is sending out the speed storms to try to create a new speedster to take on as its prey. Impulse realizes that the biology of the speedsters is special and that that's why so many have died in the attempts. Impulse asks Garrick how many speedsters there are. Garrick gives a mealy answer about not being the first and Impulse not being the last. Impulse confronts him about not having raced the demon{{Clarify|reason=Again, what demon?|date=March 2017}} himself to stop to have possibly stopped it, and Garrick denounces their abilities as a curse. Clark offers that curses can be blessings if they don't let their powers control their lives. Garrick likens Clark to Carter Hall and Impulse takes the opportunity to call Garrick out for not having stayed in touch with his team, mentioning that even though Garrick didn't know Carter, he still attended his funeral. Garrick owns up to not being proud of how he acted, but Impulse is still unsatisfied. Riled up, Impulse starts tapping into the Speed Force before Clark manages to stop him. Clark fields communication from Chloe at Watchtower. He asks how she is and she tells him she's coping. She alerts him to a speed storm brewing in Las Vegas, a huge one that isn't slowing down and is killing many. Clark relays the message to Impulse, who tries running off on his own. Clark grabs him and Impulse argues that the racer is waiting for him there and is calling to him. Clark tells Chloe that they didn't come up with a solution. She responds that S.T.A.R. Labs might have something. Patched to Emil Hamilton, the doctor explains they took the concept of sending Clark into the sun to remove his irradiation to fashion a containment suit. He states that they modified the suit to collect speed energy and that Clark might be able to use it to constantly move fast enough to confront the demon. The scientists at S.T.A.R. fire a pod into the atmosphere and it quickly rockets its way to the young heroes' location in Utah. The pod opens to reveal the new suit, a black and silver affair with a glowing S-Shield. Clark quickly puts on the suit and speeds to the massive storm in Las Vegas. Boldly, Clark proclaims to the demon that it's \"time for round two.\" After Clark leaves Garrick, Impulse sits silently and watches the speed storm on the horizon. Impulse decides to go help Clark. Before he{{Clarify|reason=Who? Clark, Impulse, or Garrick?|date=March 2017}} leaves, he tells Impulse that he heard the same names that Impulse did the first time he got his powers. Jay tells him that the speed force is something that binds all the speedsters together. Impulse then runs off. Later, Garrick and Clark meet at the JSA brownstone and talk about Impulse and Carter. Clark tells him not to blame himself, but Garrick thinks that he should have done something about it years ago. Garrick leaves with [[Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel)|Abigail Hunkel]] when Emil shows up, but not before looking at his old tin hat. Jay runs a school for the \"gifted\" in San Francisco with [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent/Superboy]], [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Speedy]], [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]], [[Miss Martian]] & [[Wonder Twins|Zan and Jayna]] as his students.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roger|first1=Veneta|title=BRYAN Q.

Jay Garrick has made numerous appearances in other media, including his live-action debut as a cameo in ''[[Smallville]]'', played by Billy Mitchell, and recurring in the [[Arrowverse]] show ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[John Wesley Shipp]].\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:FllashComics GA 1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|First appearance in ''Flash Comics'' #1 (Jan 1940).]]\nThe character of Jay Garrick was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert. The character first appeared in the first issue of the anthology series ''Flash Comics'' in 1940, published by [[All-American Publications]]. He was soon featured in ''All-Star Comics'' as part of the [[Justice Society of America]]. In 1941, he got his own solo comic book series, ''[[All-Flash]]''.\n\nAfter World War II, superheroes declined in popularity, <!-- thus causing the Flash's comic book series to be canceled - right? I assumed that that is why it mentioned superheroes' declining popularity. -->causing many of the Flash's comic book series to be canceled. ''All-Flash'' was canceled in 1948 after 32 issues. ''Flash Comics'' was canceled in 1949 after 104 issues. ''All-Star Comics'' was canceled in 1951 after 57 issues, marking Garrick's last [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] appearance. Garrick would not appear again for ten years, and never got another solo series.\n\nIn 1956, DC Comics reinvented the Flash character, giving him a new costume, name, and background. This new Flash, named [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], was completely unrelated to Jay Garrick. In fact, Garrick had never existed, as far as the new books were concerned. Barry Allen's first appearance shows him reading a copy of ''Flash Comics'', lamenting that Garrick was \"just a character some writer dreamed up\". Readers welcomed the new Flash, but still had an interest in the old one.\n\nJay Garrick made a guest appearance in ''Flash'' #123. In this issue, Garrick was treated as residing in a parallel universe ([[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]]), which allowed the character to exist without any continuity conflicts with Barry Allen (who existed on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]]), yet allowed him to make guest appearances in [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] books. Garrick only made guest appearances for most of the 60s and 70s. However, starting in 1976, Garrick became a regular character in the revived ''All-Star Comics'', partaking in adventures with the Justice Society, in stories set in modern times. In 1981, he and the Justice Society appeared in ''All-Star Squadron'' in stories set during World War II.\n\nIn 1985, DC Comics merged all of its fictional characters into a single shared universe. Jay Garrick now shared the same world as the new Flash. DC wrote the character out of continuity in the one-shot ''[[Last Days of the Justice Society of America|Last Days of the Justice Society]]'', but brought the character back in the 1990s due to fan interest. Unlike characters such as Batman or Superman, DC decided not to update Jay as a young hero, but portrayed him as a veteran of World War 2 with a magically-prolonged lifespan. Jay Garrick became a regular character in ''JSA'' and ''Justice Society of America''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===The Flash===\n'''Jason Peter Garrick'''<ref>''JSA'' #87 (September 2006)</ref> is a college student, who, prior to 1940 (later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to 1938), accidentally inhales [[hard water]] vapors after taking a smoke break in his laboratory where he had been working (later stories would change this to [[heavy water]] vapors). As a result, he finds that he can run at [[superhuman]] speed and has similarly fast reflexes. Retcons imply that the inhalation simply activated a latent [[metahuman|metagene]].\n\nAfter a brief career as a [[college football]] star, he dons a red shirt with a lightning bolt and a stylized [[Brodie helmet|metal helmet]] with wings (based on images of the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]). He then begins to fight crime as the Flash.<ref name=\"Beatty\"/> The helmet belonged to Jay's father, Joseph, who fought during [[World War I]].<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #208 (May 2004)</ref> He sometimes uses the helmet as a weapon or a type of shield, as seen in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #4 (March 2006)</ref> He has also used it to direct a beam of light at [[Eclipso]]. In [[The Flash: Rebirth]](2010), he used it to de-stabilize [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash]].\n\nIn the early stories, it seems to be widely known that Garrick is the Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Gardner F.

The effectiveness of this is debatable, as he later blamed his girlfriend, [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Joan Garrick|Joan]], deducing his true identity on his lack of a mask. Garrick ultimately made his identity as the Flash public to the world.<ref>DC Special Series #11 (1978)</ref>\n\nDuring his career, he would often find himself embroiled in semi-comic situations inadvertently initiated by [[Winky, Blinky, and Noddy]], a trio of [[tramp]]s known as the Three Dimwits, who tried their hand at one job after another, and never successfully.\n\nHis first case involves battling the Faultless Four, a group of blackmailers (Sieur Satan, Serge Orloff, Duriel, and Smythe), who plot to steal an atomic bombarder and sell it. It is later revealed that a professor found the last container of heavy water vapors and used it to gain superspeed, becoming the [[Reverse-Flash#The Rival|Rival]]. He briefly takes away Jay's speed after capturing him, making him super-slow, but Jay uses the gases again, allowing him to regain his superspeed and defeat the Rival.\n\nLike the Flashes who followed him, Garrick became a close friend of the [[Green Lantern]] of his time, [[Alan Scott]], whom he met through the Justice Society of America.\n\n===Justice Society of America===\nThe Flash soon became one of the best-known of the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] of superheroes. He was a founding member of the Justice Society of America and served as its first chairman.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Gardner F.

He left the JSA after issue #6, but returned several years later (issue #24, spring 1945). He had a distinguished career as a crime-fighter during the 1940s.\n\nGarrick's early history was largely the subject of [[retcons]]. A story explaining the retirement of the JSA members, including the Flash, explained that, in 1951, the JSA was investigated by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] for possible [[Communist]] sympathies and asked to reveal their identities. This was later revealed to be partly caused by [[Per Degaton]]. The JSA declined, and Garrick, who recently married his longtime girlfriend Joan, retired from superhero life. As a trained scientist, he ran an experimental laboratory for several decades.\n\n''[[All-Star Squadron]] Annual'' #3 states that the JSA fought a being named [[Ian Karkull]], who imbued them with energy that slowed their aging, allowing Garrick and many others \u2013 as well as their girlfriends and sidekicks \u2013 to remain active into the late 20th century without infirmity. The 1990s ''[[Starman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Starman]]'' series notes that [[Shade (comics)|the Shade]] prompted Garrick to come out of retirement in the 1950s, but the details of his activities during this time are hazy at best.\n\n===Earth-Two===\nGarrick emerged from retirement in 1961 to meet the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] Flash, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]]. The rest of the JSA soon joined the Flash, although their activities during the 1960s (other than their annual meeting with Earth-One's [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]) were unrecorded, although it is clear that Garrick and [[Green Lantern (Alan Scott)]] were good friends. It is also established that Garrick has become a respected scientist on his Earth.\n\nGarrick was a key member of the JSA's 1970s adventures (as chronicled in ''All-Star Comics'' and ''[[Adventure Comics]]''). Garrick also helped to launch the careers of [[Infinity Inc.]] Following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', all the parallel worlds are merged into one, and Keystone City becomes the twin city of Allen's [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], with the two separated by a river. An updated story suggests that Keystone in this new continuity is rendered invisible and wiped from the memories of the world for many years through the actions of several [[supervillain]]s.\n\n===21st Century===\nIn the early 21st century, many of Garrick's JSA cohorts have retired or died, but Garrick remains active with the latest incarnation of the group. He is physically about 50 years old, thanks to the effects of several accidental anti-aging treatments, but his chronological age is closer to 90. He is one of the few surviving members of the Justice Society of America after [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]].<ref>''Zero Hour: Crisis in Time'' #2 (September 1994)</ref> Of the three original JSA members still on the team (along with Alan Scott and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]]), Jay takes a fatherly approach toward his teammates and the DC superhero community in general.\n\n===''Infinite Crisis'' and ''One Year Later''===\n{{main|Infinite Crisis|One Year Later}}\n\nGarrick and his wife, Joan, have guardianship of [[Bart Allen]] after [[Max Mercury]]'s disappearance. During the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', Garrick states that the [[Speed Force]] is gone after a battle in which many speedsters, living and dead, wrestle [[Superboy-Prime]] into the Speed Force and disappear. Garrick is left behind on Earth by the other speedsters when he reaches his speed limit and cannot follow. Bart Allen returns, aged several years, having absorbed the entire Speed Force during his pursuit of the escaped Superboy-Prime. Garrick claims that without the Speed Force, his own power is less than before: like [[Wally West]] in the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' aftermath, he can only run close to the [[speed of sound]]. He also states that, as the Speed Force is no longer retarding his aging, his speed is diminishing with time. After Bart leaves Keystone City for Los Angeles, Garrick, once again, is the city's sole guardian. After hearing news of Bart's demise, Garrick collapses with grief, consoled by Jesse Chambers.\n\nGarrick continues his work as a member of the reformed Justice Society of America, under the leadership of [[Power Girl]]. After the death of Bart Allen, Garrick's full speed returns. Garrick is currently the mayor of Monument Point, where the JSA is now based. He faces problems due to the JSA being based in the Town,{{Clarify|reason=What town?

He appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s and is brainwashed into working for a Malinese dictator. The clone is defeated by the combined efforts of the Outsiders. He possesses Jay Garrick's super-speed, but none of his memories or expertise.<ref>''Outsiders'' #36 (July 2006)</ref> His unconscious body is placed in the custody of Alan Scott, [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'s White King.\n\nBecause of lingering issues in the cloning process, made more unpredictable by the metagene itself, the clone is infected by a fast acting version of the ''clone plague'' deteriorating and shortening the lifespan of clones in the DC Universe. This makes it difficult for Checkmate to find a way to wake him and undo his brainwash, because, even with his special suit, tailored to stave the degenerating process, he would be doomed to a slow death whenever he awakens from his [[suspended animation]].\n\n===''Brightest Day''===\nIn Brightest Day, Garrick and the rest of the JSA help Alan Scott and his children overcome the power of the Starheart, and, in turn, help save the planet from the Dark Avatar. After the events of the ''Brightest Day'', Garrick and the rest of the JSA travel to the city of Monument Point, which has been attacked by a superpowered terrorist named Scythe. Just before being defeated, Scythe snaps Jay's long standing friend Alan Scott's neck.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #44</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}} In the following story, it is revealed that Scythe is the product of Nazi genetic engineering, and that Scott and Garrick had been tasked by the president with killing him back when he was in infancy during World War II. The two heroes could not agree on a course of action, and, as a result, Scythe was allowed to live.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #45</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}} Doctor Mid-Nite discovers that the injuries Scott sustained have paralyzed Scott, and that any attempt to heal himself could break his constant concentration, which could result in the Starheart once again regaining control of his body.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #46</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nJade visits her bed-ridden father in the Emerald City, and offers to use her abilities to help him walk again. Scott declines his daughter's offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it could result in the deaths of everyone in the city. [[Eclipso]] attacks the city, which results in [[Jesse Quick]] having to get Scott to safety.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #55</ref>\n\nLater, the JSA tries to take down the villain D'arken, who has broken free from imprisonment beneath Monument Point and absorbed the powers of JSA members, but D'arken is too powerful for the JSA to take him down. Due to the entity's ability to absorb powers from superhumans in its vicinity, only non-superpowered and magical members fight D'arken. The JSA tells Alan Scott that unleashing the Starheart is the only way to destroy D'arken. However, after releasing the Starheart energies, Scott's body begins to incinerate itself. Afterwards, the JSA attends a funeral for Scott, whom they believe to be dead.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #54 (August 2011)</ref> Garrick is upset at having lost one of his closest friends and founding members of the JSA.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{In-universe|section|date=June 2017}}\nFollowing the return of [[Wally West]] to DC continuity during ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Barry Allen is overwhelmed by the Speed Force when he shakes hands with Wally West. This not only causes Barry to become possessed by an echo of Eobard Thawne, but also causes Barry to start being absorbed into the Speed Force itself. It takes both Wally and the current [[Wally West II|Kid Flash]]'s interference to prevent Barry from being absorbed for good. Barry later reveals that, when he was overwhelmed by the Speed Force, he saw visions of possible future events. He also reveals his last glimpse before he was returned to normal was that something more was trapped inside the Speed Force and although he could not recognize it, it still filled him with hope. The object that Barry saw was then revealed to be the helmet of the pre-Flashpoint Jay Garrick.<ref>''The Flash'' #9</ref>\n\nWhile tracking a [[Doctor Manhattan|mysterious force]] responsible for the recent universal reset, Barry and [[Batman]] experience another flash in the form of a vision of Jay's helmet, although he attributes it to the helmet of Mercury. While chasing Thawne, Bruce and Barry can hear someone call out for the latter but Barry believes it to be calls from lost moments that could have been. As the Cosmic Treadmill begins to break apart, the voice intensifies and Bruce tells Barry to listen and grab onto the voice. As the voice says \"Jay\", Barry says the name as well and Jay Garrick arrives, claiming he is free and provides enough speed and power to get Batman and Barry back home. Jay explains he didn't kill Thawne, he is a friend, and (also) Flash. He tries to get Barry to remember who he is; Barry is unable to, but finds Jay familiar and somehow trusts him. Then Jay is absorbed by a blue light and taken away. Barry believes Jay may be from another time that no longer exists and Barry is not the person that keeps him tethered to reality, saying he's \"not his lightning rod.\"<ref>''The Flash'' #22</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Watchmen]]\" sequel \"[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\" Lois Lane finds a flash-drive among the mess while at the Daily Planet.

The limits of his speed have fluctuated over the years, though he has usually been second to DC's \"flagship\" Flash, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]].\n\nIn his earliest appearances, Garrick's speed was derived from a metagene that activated after he inhaled hard water vapours.  This allowed him to move swiftly enough to intercept bullets. He could carry people away with him at super-speed without causing injury due to extreme acceleration. He could make himself invisible by vibrating his body at high frequencies. Over time, Jay Garrick learns to access a new fuel for his powers (and those of other speedsters), the [[Speed Force]].\n\nIn the 2012 series Earth 2, Jay's powers are a blessing from the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. He can magically transform his clothing into his costume at will.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n{{Main|List of Flash supporting characters#Golden Age}}\n===Joan Garrick===\n'''Joan Williams''', later '''Joan Garrick''' is a fictional character from [[DC Comics]], a [[supporting character]] and romantic interest of Flash (Jay Garrick) She is debuted as the earliest recurring supporting character of Flash within the [[DC Universe]]. \n\nFirst depicted as the girlfriend, and later wife, of Jay Garrick.

This version of Garrick, portrayed as a 21-year-old recent [[Bachelor's degree or higher|college graduate]], is spurned by his girlfriend, Joan, and possesses very little in terms of career prospects. The character receives his superspeed from [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], a dying [[List of Roman deities|Roman god]] who sees bravery in Garrick, and is also the last god to fall following a war with [[Apokolips]]. Mercury claims that he has been held for the past 10 years by a greater threat than Apokolips. Garrick escapes a World Army Helicopter that sees the event as Mercury dies and tells Garrick to run. He saves a couple from Apokorats, saying he will do it in \"a Flash\". Later, Garrick arrives in Poland and meets [[Hawkgirl]].<ref>''Earth-2'' #2 (June 2012)</ref> Working alongside [[Hawkgirl]] and [[Alan Scott#The New 52|Alan Scott]], he assists in defeating [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], making his first public debut as the Flash.<ref>''Earth-2'' #5 (September 2012)</ref>\n\n===''52 ''and ''Countdown''===\nIn the final issue of DC's year-long series ''[[52 (comics)|52]] ''in 2007, a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is revealed, originally consisting of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|52 identical realities]]. Among the parallel realities shown, one is designated \"Earth-2\". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] \"eating\" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-Two, now called Earth-2, to distinguish the two separate realities. In one-panel, a new counterpart to Jay Garrick is shown, among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear,<ref>{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=13 | panel=3 }}</ref> but they are later specifically used in the ''Countdown: Arena ''series, where the new Earth-2 Flash is specifically identified as Jay Garrick and does not allow others to call him \"Flash\". Despite being an almost exact duplicate to the original World War II Garrick, it is shown that the new Earth-2 Garrick is much younger, having no gray hair at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 |title=The 52 exit interviews: grant morrison |accessdate=2007-05-12 |last=Brady |first=Matt |date=2007-05-08 |publisher=Newsarama |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510031223/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 |archivedate=May 10, 2007 }}</ref> Other Garricks are shown in the 52 multiverse. A second young Jay Garrick lives on the unspecified Earth that Wally West went to with his young children at the beginning of Bart Allen's tenure as the Flash. This Garrick is separate from the young post-Crisis Earth-2 Garrick, as the post-Crisis Earth-2 heroes make no mention of Wally or his children on their Earth.<ref>''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #6 (January 2007)</ref>\n\nThe multiverse established in ''52'' is later replaced following DC's 2011 ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] ''storyline. Following this, a new multiverse is established and all series were relaunched as part of DC's [[The New 52]] publishing event. The post-''52'' pre-''Flashpoint'' Earth-2 Jay Garrick ceases to exist, as did the mainstream Jay Garrick. A new but entirely different Earth-2 Jay Garrick then becomes the continually published version of the character ([[#The New 52|see publication history]]).\n\n===Elseworlds===\nIn the [[Elseworlds]] book ''[[JSA: The Unholy Three]]'', Jay Garrick is portrayed as a post-WW2 United States [[intelligence agent]] stationed in Russia, working under the code-name '''Mercury'''. He is instrumental in bringing down the story's [[General Zod|rogue Superman]].<ref>''JSA: The Unholy Three'' (2003)</ref>\n\n===Wonderland===\nWhen Brother Grimm helped Captain Cold and Mirror Master trap Wally West in an alternate world where the Speed Force never existed, it is revealed that Jay Garrick never gained his speed in the accident and died during the Second World War.\n\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' reality, Jay Garrick died rather than developing super-speed after inhaling hard water.<ref>''Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n{{main|Flash in other media}}\n\n===Television===\n\n====Animation====\n* In  [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]] episode \"Legends\" a character named '''The Streak''' voiced by [[David Naughton]] is based on Jay Garrick. The Streak was the speedster of the [[Justice Guild of America]]. He died along with the other members of the JGA during a war that destroyed most of their homeworld. The character of The Streak is based on the Golden Age Flash, Jay Garrick, with some costume differences: the helmet (Jay wears a WWI helmet given to him by his father emblazoned with wings like those on Flash's hood, not a pilot helmet), the pants (which are blue instead of red with yellow overshorts) and the lightning bolt on the shirt (which rises up from the bottom and takes up most of its main body).\n* Jay Garrick is a recurring character in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Andy Milder]]. He is of the heroes [[Batman]] most frequently teams up with. In the teaser plot of \"Trials of the Demon!\", he and Batman stop the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and Scream Queen on [[Halloween]]. After learning that the Halloween pumpkins are infected with the Scarecrow's fear toxin, Garrick rounds up every pumpkin in town. When the townspeople demand to know what happened, Garrick finds Batman already gone. Garrick briefly appears in \"The Fate of Equinox\", in which he lends his powers to Batman to help against Equinox. He returns as a member of the Justice Society in the episode \"The Golden Age of Justice\". In \"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster\", Garrick acknowledges that Barry Allen disappeared in a battle with [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom]]. Batman, Jay and [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] use the cosmic treadmill to travel to the 25th century and help Barry battle Professor Zoom.\n* Jay Garrick appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Geoff Pierson]]. He and Joan (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) are introduced in the episode \"Downtime\", where the Allen and West families throw a birthday party for Jay. Jay is referred to as a 'retired speedster' by Joan Garrick, and does not appear to possess the slowed-aging that his comic book counterpart does. He temporarily comes out of retirement in the episode \"Bloodlines\" in order to help Barry, Kid Flash, and Impulse during a battle against [[Neutron (comics)|Neutron]], as well as in the series  finale to help the Justice League save the Earth. Through the series, it is mentioned that the Garricks have been acting as Impulse's guardians. He returns in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'' episode \"Illusion of Control\" where he is seen sitting next to his wife Joan at a hospital in Central City. In the episode \"Early Warning,\" Kid Flash and Blue Beetle are unable to assist the Outsiders because they are with Jay attending Joan's funeral. In the episode \"Elder Wisdom,\" Jay Garrick reminds Lex Luthor during his interview with [[Glorious Godfrey|G. Gordon Godfrey]] that the Hero Registration didn't work when Lex Luthor suggests reviving it.\n\n====Live action====\n* The character is alluded to in the 1990 ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' live-action TV series. The [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] paints a statue of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] red and yellow to mock the Flash (Barry Allen). The statue resembles Jay Garrick's costume.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The series features Barry Allen's older brother '''Jay Allen''' (played by [[Tim Thomerson]]), named after Jay Garrick as a homage to him,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and his murder in the pilot episode inspires Barry's career as the Flash. A street in that show's Central City is named Garrick, and in one instance a cop reports from the corner of Gardner and Fox.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n* Jay Garrick is alluded to in ''[[Smallville]]''. In season four's \"Run\", the name is one of [[Bart Allen]]'s aliases. The actual character appears in season nine's \"Absolute Justice\" (played by Billy Mitchell). He is a superhero in the 1970s, as well as a research scientist. He was framed by the government for fraud as part of their plan to disable the JSA. He, like the others, falsely confessed to all charges, but they were never convicted. With law enforcement aware of his superhero identity, Garrick retired. In 2010, [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Chloe Sullivan]] find old black and white police footage of Garrick, along with his criminal record. Very little is said about him, but it was confirmed by [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] he was still alive, and it was hinted he had children. In the eleventh issue of the comic book continuation, it is revealed that Garrick's leg was disabled, and that he could no longer run at superhuman speed, which is how the government was able to arrest him. It is also revealed that Bart got Garrick's name, along with those of Barry Allen and Wally West, through [[subliminal stimuli]] from the Speed Force. Garrick becomes a recluse after retiring.<ref>''Smallville Season 11'' #11 (March 2013)</ref> Clark and Bart consult Jay to find out how to stop the Black Flash. After Bart sacrifices his life to stop the Black Flash, Jay feels guilty for not doing anything about the Black Flash years ago. He then forms a school for gifted children in San Francisco, forming a team of teenaged superheroes, the [[Teen Titans]], consisting of [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Speedy]], [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]], [[Wonder Twins]], and later [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]].

The three speedsters enter \"Flashtime\", a state in which they move so fast that time appears to be frozen. After several unsuccessful attempts to stop the explosion, operating in Flashtime for so long begins to take its toll on Garrick's aged body, forcing him to drop back into normal speed. Eventually, after the disaster is averted, Garrick announces that he has decided to retire from superhero work and will begin training a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e to succeed him as Earth-3's Flash. By [[The Flash (season 6)|season six]], Garrick has retired and settled down with his wife [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]] (portrayed by Michelle Harrison).\n\n===Films===\nJay Garrick makes a cameo appearance in the opening credits of the animated film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''. He is seen being forced out of heroics by the government.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n[[Smallville Season 11]]: Garrick first appears in \"Haunted\", where, in an attempt to help [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] find a way to keep his speed demon from stalking him, Clark takes Impulse to the JSA Brownstone, saying that they must find Garrick, because, as a fellow speedster, he might have answers they need. Arriving at an old residence in the outskirts of Utah, Superman and Impulse encounter an old withered version of Garrick equipped with a cane. At first, Garrick isn't thrilled at meeting Impulse, who had stolen his identity a few years earlier. Clark informs Garrick of Carter Hall's initial plan (prior to his untimely death) to reinstate the Justice Society of America, with the remaining living members helping to guide the new generation of Heroes. Impulse asks Garrick to reveal all that he knows about the [[Black Flash]]. Garrick shows signs of fear at the mention of that name, and begins to reveal the reason behind his handicap. The Government broke his leg a decade ago, and Garrick refused to have it repaired \u2013 thus depriving himself of his Super Speed abilities, which would prevent the Black Flash from haunting Garrick. However, Garrick can still feel the Black Flash's presence, and he realizes that the Black Flash has its sights set on Impulse. The only way to stop the Black Flash is for Impulse to die. As the speed storm crackles in Utah, Clark tries to reason with Garrick, saying that there must be another way to help Bart. Garrick asserts that there is no choice in the matter, and that by using the Speed Force, the demon{{Clarify|reason=What demon?|date=March 2017}} is there to collect the debt. Clark asks why there were no records of speed storms while Garrick was with the JSA. Garrick surmises that Impulse is so fast that it has made the creature hungry and desperate. Picking up on the thought, Clark reasons that it is sending out the speed storms to try to create a new speedster to take on as its prey. Impulse realizes that the biology of the speedsters is special and that that's why so many have died in the attempts. Impulse asks Garrick how many speedsters there are. Garrick gives a mealy answer about not being the first and Impulse not being the last. Impulse confronts him about not having raced the demon{{Clarify|reason=Again, what demon?|date=March 2017}} himself to stop to have possibly stopped it, and Garrick denounces their abilities as a curse. Clark offers that curses can be blessings if they don't let their powers control their lives. Garrick likens Clark to Carter Hall and Impulse takes the opportunity to call Garrick out for not having stayed in touch with his team, mentioning that even though Garrick didn't know Carter, he still attended his funeral. Garrick owns up to not being proud of how he acted, but Impulse is still unsatisfied. Riled up, Impulse starts tapping into the Speed Force before Clark manages to stop him. Clark fields communication from Chloe at Watchtower. He asks how she is and she tells him she's coping. She alerts him to a speed storm brewing in Las Vegas, a huge one that isn't slowing down and is killing many. Clark relays the message to Impulse, who tries running off on his own. Clark grabs him and Impulse argues that the racer is waiting for him there and is calling to him. Clark tells Chloe that they didn't come up with a solution. She responds that S.T.A.R. Labs might have something. Patched to Emil Hamilton, the doctor explains they took the concept of sending Clark into the sun to remove his irradiation to fashion a containment suit. He states that they modified the suit to collect speed energy and that Clark might be able to use it to constantly move fast enough to confront the demon. The scientists at S.T.A.R. fire a pod into the atmosphere and it quickly rockets its way to the young heroes' location in Utah. The pod opens to reveal the new suit, a black and silver affair with a glowing S-Shield. Clark quickly puts on the suit and speeds to the massive storm in Las Vegas. Boldly, Clark proclaims to the demon that it's \"time for round two.\" After Clark leaves Garrick, Impulse sits silently and watches the speed storm on the horizon. Impulse decides to go help Clark. Before he{{Clarify|reason=Who? Clark, Impulse, or Garrick?|date=March 2017}} leaves, he tells Impulse that he heard the same names that Impulse did the first time he got his powers. Jay tells him that the speed force is something that binds all the speedsters together. Impulse then runs off. Later, Garrick and Clark meet at the JSA brownstone and talk about Impulse and Carter. Clark tells him not to blame himself, but Garrick thinks that he should have done something about it years ago. Garrick leaves with [[Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel)|Abigail Hunkel]] when Emil shows up, but not before looking at his old tin hat. Jay runs a school for the \"gifted\" in San Francisco with [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent/Superboy]], [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Speedy]], [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]], [[Miss Martian]] & [[Wonder Twins|Zan and Jayna]] as his students.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roger|first1=Veneta|title=BRYAN Q.

He is portrayed as a former talk show host dressed in a wild costume with a green, yellow, and red color scheme. He is characterized by super strength, agility, and stamina; a healing factor enabling him to heal from virtually any wound; physically painful laughter; and proficiency in the martial arts.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=75}}</ref> Most of his physical powers and abilities are the results of effects from serums and devices invented by scientist [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Vincent Yatz]].

He later spun off into two brief series, one written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] in 1968 and another written by Len Kaminski in 1997 and 1998. In the interim, he was kept alive with sporadic appearances in solo runs and guest shots. His last comic appearance was in a six-issue miniseries written by [[Steve Niles]] in 2006. He also appeared in television shows like ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', as well as the ''[[Batman Arkham]]'' video game series.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Showcase73.jpg|left|thumb|200px|alt=The Creeper leaping|''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #73 (April 1968), the Creeper's first appearance, with art and script by [[Steve Ditko]] & dialogue by [[Don Segall]].]] \nThe character [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #73 (April 1968).<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = The Creeper | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 89 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 129 |quote = Writer/artist Steve Ditko and co-scripter Don Segall gave [character Jack Ryder] more than the last laugh as the garishly garbed Creeper, one of DC's quirkiest protagonists.}}</ref> Following his debut in ''Showcase'', the Creeper was given his own series ''[[Beware the Creeper]]'', written by [[Dennis O'Neil]]; Steve Ditko plotted the first issue.

(Similarly, the 1990s series casts doubt on both The Creeper and Proteus\u2019 origins.) Shortly after his last solo issue, the Creeper teamed with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #80 (November 1968), then guested in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #70 (March 1969), where it was asked whether the Creeper was an outlaw. He also appeared with Batman in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #418 (December 1971). After the origin was reprinted in ''Detective Comics'' #443 (November 1974), one of the \"[[DC 100 Page Super Spectacular]]\" series, the Creeper's alter ego Jack Ryder was shown working as a news anchor on Gotham City television in issue #445 (March 1975), and in ''Detective Comics'' #447\u2013448 (May\u2013June 1975) he became the Creeper again to help Batman escape a frame-up for murder.\n\nDC kept the character active with sporadic solo runs and guest shots over the next few years. He turned up almost immediately in issue #3 (October 1975) of the [[Joker (character)|Joker's]] short-lived, [[Joker (comic book)|self-titled series]], in a story written by O'Neil, where the similarity in green hair and maniacal laughter caused confusion between the two. This was followed with a one-off solo story in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #7 (October 1975), [[penciler|penciled]] by Ditko.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Jack|title=''1st Issue Special'': It Was No ''Showcase'' (But It Was Never Meant to Be)|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=44|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Other appearances in this period included team-ups with [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] in ''[[Super-Team Family]]'' #2 (January 1976), again written by O'Neil; with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #143 (October 1978) and #178 (September 1981); and with many fellow alumni (and a few non-graduates) of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in that comic's 100th issue (May 1978). A story intended for the never-published ''Showcase'' #106 in 1978 (written and drawn by Ditko and which would be included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' #2) was included in ''The Creeper by Steve Ditko'' hardcover collection published by DC in 2010.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Ditko|first1= Steve|authorlink1= Steve Ditko |title= The Creeper by Steve Ditko |year= 2010 |publisher= [[DC Comics]] |isbn= 1-4012-2591-8}}</ref> Among further solos were backup series in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #445\u2013447 (1976), ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #249\u201355 (1978\u20131979, written and fully drawn by Ditko), and ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #318\u2013323 (1983).\n\nBeginning in a team-up with [[Superman]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #88 (December 1985), written by [[Steve Englehart]]) during the\n''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' company-wide story arc, the Creeper's depiction changed under different writers, which included a revised origin that was referenced but never wholly revealed. His deranged behavior, initially an act to frighten criminals, transformed into genuine, narcotics-induced psychotic behavior. In addition, Ryder could access his enhanced physical abilities only in his costumed form, and could no longer control his transformations. The new version came into focus when the Creeper teamed with the [[Justice League International]] in 1987. A decade later, DC gave the Creeper another chance in a solo comic, ''The Creeper''. It lasted 12 issues (December 1997&nbsp;\u2013 November 1998), including the 1998 [[DC One Million]] special numbering.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/5733/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 1997 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> Writer [[Len Kaminski]] focused on the breakdown of Ryder's sanity under the influence of the Creeper and made many references to previous continuity: the character is initially in an asylum and is formally diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]];<ref>''The Creeper'' (Volume 1) #3, p.&nbsp;3</ref> his two personas frequently battle for control of their shared body.\n\nThe Creeper starred in a six-issue mini-series, ''The Creeper'' volume 2 (October 2006&nbsp;\u2013 March 2007), written by [[Steve Niles]] and drawn by [[Justiniano]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/19429/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 2006 series)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Jack Ryder''' is a former [[Gotham City]] television [[talk show]] [[talk show host|host]] who was fired due to his outspoken nature. In ''[[Bruce Wayne: The Road Home#Outsiders|Bruce Wayne: The Road Home: Outsiders]]'', it is revealed that he once dated [[Vicki Vale]]. Finding employment in security headed by [[Bill Brane]], he attempts to rescue a scientist named [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz]] whom mobsters headed by gangster [[Angel Devlin]] have kidnapped in order to obtain his newest discoveries. The chief mobster hosts a masquerade party at his mansion. To gain entry, Ryder improvises a costume from yellow tights and facial make-up designed to look like skin, a green wig and trunks, and red gloves, boots, and furry cloak. Ryder locates Yatz inside, but the mobsters discover him and first shoot at him, but then finally stabs him, wounding Ryder. Yatz injects Ryder with a serum and implants a device in his wound. The serum confers the power to almost instantly heal any wound and grants Ryder enhanced strength and agility. The device, used with its activator, causes the costume to disappear, leaving Ryder naked (he can later change into his formal clothes on command). Yatz inadvertently leaves the activator out of the wound, but does not realize this until after the wound had healed. At this point, the mobsters find their victims again, this time killing Yatz. Ryder discovers that with the activator, he can regain the wild costume whenever he wishes. With it, a crazy laugh and his enhanced physical abilities, he has no trouble routing the crooks.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAs the Creeper, Ryder has a series of adventures dealing with supervillains, while hiding his secret identity from his friends and cohorts and dealing with weather girl personality [[Vera Sweet]] who also acts as his love interest.\n\nThe eventual revision of the Creeper's origin eliminated the serum and claims that the scientist surgically implanted two devices (some accounts claim a single device with two effects) that enhance Ryder's physical abilities and can recreate an object whose \"imprint\" is stored in its circuitry. The scientist performs this surgery to save Ryder's life after criminals he was investigating attacked and drugged him. Because the scientist is unaware of the drugs in Ryder's system he inadvertently recorded their \"imprint\" at the same time he recorded the \"imprint\" of the costume, thus the device that recreates Ryder's costume when he becomes the Creeper also recreates the drugs in his system, explaining the Creeper's odd personality. These drugs so overwhelm Ryder's system that their effect becomes cumulative and the Creeper gradually becomes more irrational. When the Creeper changes back to Jack Ryder, the drugs disappear and with them, the psychosis. Eventually, Ryder comes to believe that he and the Creeper are two entirely different people instead of two roles played by the same man; he also holds this belief in his Creeper persona, which becomes increasingly disdainful of \"Jack Ryder\". The Creeper once regained his rationality while bound by [[Wonder Woman]]'s magic lasso, but the implications of this have never been explored.\n\n===Fighting Eclipso===\nThe Creeper appeared in the ''[[Eclipso: The Darkness Within]]'' annuals in 1992, tricked into taking up one of [[Eclipso]]'s dark crystals, putting him under Eclipso's control. He is later freed by Bruce Gordon, a longtime adversary of Eclipso. In the self-titled ''Eclipso'' comic book series, the Creeper, Gordon and his wife Mona make an initial foray into the South American territory that Eclipso has conquered. This leads to an Eclipso-possessed peasant throwing the Creeper (and himself) off a cliff. The peasant is mentally abandoned and both are left to plunge to their deaths. The intervention of a stunt squad saves the lives of both men. Several other heroes join in the fight against Eclipso, including [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]], the original [[Commander Steel|Steel]], [[Amanda Waller]], and [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Wildcat]] II. They form a team called the [[Shadow Fighters]]. In issue #13 of ''Eclipso'', a portion of the Fighters, including the Creeper, make another trip into Eclipso's territory. Several hyenas, possessed by Eclipso, track down the Creeper and tear him to shreds. Most of the infiltration team is slain; only small parts of the Creeper are actually recovered. The remains, along with the other dead heroes, are stolen out from under Eclipso's control by surviving Shadow Fighters.\n\nDespite this death, a Creeper series was launched in 1997. There are indications in this comic that the Dr. Yatz origin as detailed in previous appearances is somehow false and that the Creeper's actual origins are in some way related to his longtime villain, Proteus. Before this was fully explored, however, the series ceased publication.\n\n===Rebooted origin===\nIn 2006, a new version of the Creeper appears in the ''Brave New World'' one shot, published following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In the one shot, Jack Ryder is now the host of a controversial TV show, ''You Are Wrong!'', promising $1,000,000 to the person who catches the Creeper.\nFollowing this, a six-issue Creeper miniseries revealed the new origin, seemingly taking place during Batman's early years.\n\nRyder is said to support Dr. Vincent Yatz, who has been combining [[stem cell]] therapy and medical [[nanotechnology]] to create a revolutionary \"nanocell\" therapy called \"smart-skin\", which would enhance the body's regeneration to the point of giving new skin to burn victims and those who have suffered severe scarring. Ryder visits Yatz's lab just as the scientist is being threatened by mobsters attempting to steal the latest test batch of his newly discovered technology. Unable to escape, Yatz injects the last sample of smart-skin, still somewhat unstable, into Ryder's body in an attempt to keep it safe from the mobsters. When the criminals shoot Ryder in his head, the smart-skin activates, resurrecting Ryder moments later as the Creeper, a yellow-skinned man with superhuman physicality, green hair, and a mane of red hair growing on his back (as opposed to wearing fake red fur, like previous incarnations). The Creeper is a separate personality from Ryder and dispatches the criminals. Ryder discovers he and the Creeper can trade places, after which each acts as a witness to the other's activities and can mentally communicate with their alter ego.\n\nInitially wanting nothing to do with the Creeper, Ryder lets him out when the yellow-skinned creature convinces him to seek revenge on their would-be killers. During their pursuit of the criminals, the Creeper and Ryder learn that Yatz has secretly intended the smart-skin to be a weapon. Side effects of its use on human subjects seem to be a loss of mental control, along with the test subjects all getting yellow skin and a mixture of red and green hair. Yatz credits these side effects on the mind and body as resulting from a nerve agent (provided by his silent partner) he had added to the nanocells. This partner is revealed to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], who had hoped to combine his Joker venom (which causes temporary madness and usually death by laughter) and Yatz's technology to create an army of maniacal, superstrong, near-immortal soldiers. Batman and Ryder defeat the Joker, who later attacks Yatz in revenge. Batman discovers Ryder's double identity and creates a chemical agent that can cure him of the Creeper, but Ryder refuses and forms a truce with his alter ego, agreeing to let the Creeper out from time to time to fight criminals while hiding his identity from everyone including news rival and love interest [[Vera Sweet]].\n\n===''Countdown''===\nIn ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis#Secondary titles|Countdown to Mystery]]'' #2, Jack Ryder is approached by [[Eclipso]], who hopes to seduce him as she did [[Plastic Man]]. She succeeds, but the Creeper is later freed from the corruption by Bruce Gordon. In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #24 (2007), the Creeper is seen, along with other heroes, fighting members of the [[Sinestro Corps]] in the streets of [[New York City|New York]].\n\n===''Reign in Hell''===\nDuring the ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' miniseries, the Creeper was presented as a demon that co-inhabited the body of Jack Ryder rather than an identity he assumed due to scientific experimentation. The story shows the Creeper demon separating from Jack Ryder, having been recalled to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] by [[Lilith]], the mother of all Earthborn atrocities. It is later revealed that the Creeper demon is just one of a similar-looking species of demon. The ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries had many internal continuity errors that made its place in DC Comics canon questionable and the idea that the Creeper was a demonic entity was not repeated afterward.\n\n===Outsiders===\nThe Creeper has joined the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref>''The Outsiders'' #15 (April 2009)</ref> Later, the Creeper is one of the many heroes recruited to keep the villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] from exploiting his resemblance to Bruce Wayne.

It revealed that Katana's sword was used to kill the Creeper. In the following issue, the Creeper is seen bonding to Jack Ryder's dead body. The Creeper notes that he had used Ryder's body previously, calling him \"old friend\". He later confronts Katana and then retreats.<ref>''Katana'' #4 (July 2013)</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the rebooted continuity of the 2017 initiative [[DC Rebirth]], Jack Ryder appears to be back to his original pre-New 52 version from before. While investigating a series of murdered criminals down in Chicago, Ryder ends up transforming into the Creeper again and battling against a [[Deathstroke]] copycat; while running into the real Deathstroke at the same time.

A man in squalor disposes of a dead body, but is met with a surprise.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Original===\nThe Creeper's powers are physical in nature and a result of [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz's]] inventions. He displays virtually superhuman agility and stamina, combined with strength. This enables him to perform amazing feats of acrobatics and leaping. He also seems to be able to climb sheer walls with little or no difficulty. His strength is enough to enable him to throw grown men several feet or jump several feet in the air. His speed and reflexes have also been enhanced greatly. These combined abilities make the Creeper a formidable fighter, incorporating brawling techniques with his physical prowess. A signature move of his is jumping onto the backs of his opponents and throwing them off balance. The Creeper also possesses a superhuman healing factor, which enables him to heal from virtually any wound; gunshots and stab wounds healing within a matter of minutes. It even allowed him to return from death when his body regenerated after being torn apart by Eclipsed hyenas. Also, his laugh is depicted as being physically painful to the ears of his victims, causing a psychotic comatose state.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Current===\nAccording to the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, the Creeper form of Jack Ryder is actually a member of a unique demonic species who all share similar physical characteristics. This idea was dismissed by other writers and in the retcon origin by Steve Niles, the Creeper was the result of Yatz's experiments and had the same powers as his original incarnation, along with a laugh that seemed to disorient opponents.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===''Beware the Creeper''===\nThe 2003 series ''[[Beware the Creeper]]'', which is set in 1920s [[Paris]], features a female Creeper.\n\n===''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===\nThe Creeper makes a cameo appearance in the 2001\u20132002 miniseries ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', wherein he has already been struck fatally.

The trail leads to present day Jack Ryder, who was tired of being a superhero. Jack and The Creeper became separate parts of each other, actual living beings. After The Creeper side kept splitting into bizarre and dangerous alternate Creepers each representing a different part of The Creeper's personality, Jack realized that whether he liked it or not, the Creeper was a part of him. The future Creeper ingested all the alternate Creepers, but realizing the truth of the event, he returned them to the original Creeper and told him and Jack Ryder to remerge, and The Creeper was reborn. The future Creeper returns to IAI with the last remaining alternate Creeper, the one representing self-loathing, which he disposes of before transforming back into RYDR to catalogue the event.<ref>''The Creeper'' Volume 1 #1,000,000</ref>\n\n===Tangent Comics===\nIn the [[Tangent Comics]] universe, the Earth-9 version of the Creeper is a powerful warlock and member of occult organization known as the Black Circle.

In the episode \"Beware the Creeper\", he [[news anchor|anchors]] a live TV special on [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s career from Ace Chemicals, where the Joker douses Ryder with his laughing gas and then pushes Ryder into a vat of chemicals. The gas and the chemicals transform him into the Creeper. The Creeper then goes on a crusade against the Joker to avenge himself (he's the first person that the Joker ever describes as a '[[lunatic]]'), while frequently being sidetracked by an infatuation with [[Harley Quinn]] and his own stream-of-consciousness rambling. Batman manages to use a skin patch to suppress the Creeper, and informs Ryder he can still salvage his career. After Batman and Robin leave, Ryder thinks the situation over and removes the patch. Ryder begins chuckling, which soon becomes the Creeper\u2019s signature laughter.\n** The Creeper made frequent non-speaking appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as one of the sixty members of the extended [[Justice League]] international.\n* The Creeper appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Brian Bloom]]. In \"Shadow of the Bat\", [[Booster Gold]] states that he has to cancel an appearance on Jack Ryder's talk show due to an emergency meeting of the [[Justice League International]]. The Creeper teams up with Batman in the teaser for \"Time Out For Vengeance!!!\", in which he cheers on and eventually helps Batman fight [[Hellgrammite (comics)|Hellgrammite]]. While initially annoyed at Ryder's antics, Batman eventually admits that Creeper is indeed a valuable ally. After Hellgrammite was defeated, Creeper left when the police arrived.\n\n===Video games===\n====''Batman Arkham''====\nThe Creeper's alter ego Jack Ryder is featured as a supporting character in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' franchise where he is voiced by [[James Horan (actor)|James Horan]]:<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1282022/fullcredits#cast Full Cast & Crew of ''Batman: Arkham Asylum'' (2009 Video Game)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', he can be heard reporting about the Arkham breakout with a banner beneath the headline reads \"The Jack Ryder Show\". In the same game, he is also an unlockable bio when the player scans a radio broadcasting Ryder's show. Ryder's bio also makes mention of the fact that he is the vigilante \"Creeper\".\n* He later plays a bigger role in the sequel ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.gamesradar.com/f/must-watch-batman-arkham-city-video-has-12-minutes-of-gameplay-to-drool-over/a-2011070112275546007 |title= Must Watch: Batman: Arkham City Video Has 12 Minutes of Gameplay to Drool Over |publisher= GamesRadar.com}}</ref> After the game begins, one of the early missions features Bruce Wayne rescuing Ryder from some thugs in Arkham City, Ryder revealing that he wound up in Arkham City after he began to investigate Hugo Strange's actions and motivations in creating Arkham City. He reveals information about Strange to Batman after he is saved. He is also on [[Deadshot]]'s hit list and Batman must save him before he is killed. Additionally, an interview between [[Vicki Vale]] and Mayor Quincy Sharp can be heard that reveals vigilantes operating in Gotham, including the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] and the Creeper.\n* In the end credits of ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', he is featured as heard interviewing several well known figures of Gotham City about the events that transpired during Christmas Eve involving Batman, the 8 assassins that were hired to hunt him down, and other villains involved. This led to Quincy Sharp issuing a statement, blaming the problem on the incompetence of Blackgate Prison, as well as vowing to reopen Arkham Asylum to house the supervillains that now reside in Gotham.\n* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', a \"Gotham's Most Wanted Mission\" involves Batman rescuing Jack Ryder from [[Deacon Blackfire]]'s cult. After the revelation of Batman really being Bruce Wayne, Jack apologized about all the things he said to Batman about Bruce Wayne and all the things he said to Bruce Wayne about Batman. He also mentions how he \"wishes [he] had super powers\", a reference to his Creeper alter ego.\n\n====Other games====\n* Jack Ryder appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Leif Anders]]. His voice is in TV/Radio segments called \"You Are Wrong\" found throughout Gotham and Metropolis. When found, Ryder proceeds to tell the truth about certain characters and plots (such as outing Lex Luthor as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains) presumably using his alter-ego Creeper to gather this information.\n* Jack Ryder appears in ''[[Batman: The Telltale Series]]'', voiced by [[Robert Clotworthy]]. While the game proceeds, Jack Ryder is seen reporting on news about the recent events of [[Gotham City]] involving [[Batman]], [[Catwoman]], the [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]], and other things. The most talked news that Jack Ryder talked about is the allegations that Thomas Wayne was allied with [[Carmine Falcone]] where they and Mayor Hamilton Hill placed those who wouldn't surrender their land to Thomas Wayne in Arkham Asylum. In Episode 5, Jack Ryder is kidnapped by Two-Face if the player chose to stop Penguin in Episode 4. After Bruce stops the villain, Jack tells Bruce he plans to praise his actions on the news to help restore Wayne's reputation.\n* Jack Ryder appears in ''[[Batman: The Enemy Within]]'', a sequel to ''Batman: The Telltale Series'', voiced again by Robert Clotworthy. In Episode 1, he reports on the lower crime rate and the explosion at Wayne Enterprises that killed Lucius Fox. In Episode 2, Jack Ryder reports on Riddler's death and the attacks that are caused by the Pact.\n* The Creeper appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.\n\n===Toys===\n* [[Hasbro]] released an action figure of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' version of the character in the late 1990s.\n* [[Mattel]] released an action figure of the comic book version in its [[DC Universe Classics]] line in January 2011.\n* Mattel released an action figure of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' version in its [[DC Universe: Justice League Unlimited Fan Collection]] line in November 2011.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nThe Creeper has appeared in a ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' comic book, in which Batman enlists his aid to unravel a plan to detonate a nuclear device in Gotham.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.dcuguide.com/chronology.php?name=creeper2 DCU Guide: The Creeper Chronology]\n* [http://www.toonopedia.com/creeper.htm The Creeper] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

He later spun off into two brief series, one written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] in 1968 and another written by Len Kaminski in 1997 and 1998. In the interim, he was kept alive with sporadic appearances in solo runs and guest shots. His last comic appearance was in a six-issue miniseries written by [[Steve Niles]] in 2006.

(Similarly, the 1990s series casts doubt on both The Creeper and Proteus\u2019 origins.) Shortly after his last solo issue, the Creeper teamed with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #80 (November 1968), then guested in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #70 (March 1969), where it was asked whether the Creeper was an outlaw. He also appeared with Batman in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #418 (December 1971). After the origin was reprinted in ''Detective Comics'' #443 (November 1974), one of the \"[[DC 100 Page Super Spectacular]]\" series, the Creeper's alter ego Jack Ryder was shown working as a news anchor on Gotham City television in issue #445 (March 1975), and in ''Detective Comics'' #447\u2013448 (May\u2013June 1975) he became the Creeper again to help Batman escape a frame-up for murder.\n\nDC kept the character active with sporadic solo runs and guest shots over the next few years. He turned up almost immediately in issue #3 (October 1975) of the [[Joker (character)|Joker's]] short-lived, [[Joker (comic book)|self-titled series]], in a story written by O'Neil, where the similarity in green hair and maniacal laughter caused confusion between the two. This was followed with a one-off solo story in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #7 (October 1975), [[penciler|penciled]] by Ditko.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Jack|title=''1st Issue Special'': It Was No ''Showcase'' (But It Was Never Meant to Be)|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=44|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Other appearances in this period included team-ups with [[Wildcat (comics)#Earth-One|Wildcat]] in ''[[Super-Team Family]]'' #2 (January 1976), again written by O'Neil; with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #143 (October 1978) and #178 (September 1981); and with many fellow alumni (and a few non-graduates) of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in that comic's 100th issue (May 1978). A story intended for the never-published ''Showcase'' #106 in 1978 (written and drawn by Ditko and which would be included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' #2) was included in ''The Creeper by Steve Ditko'' hardcover collection published by DC in 2010.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Ditko|first1= Steve|authorlink1= Steve Ditko |title= The Creeper by Steve Ditko |year= 2010 |publisher= [[DC Comics]] |isbn= 1-4012-2591-8}}</ref> Among further solos were backup series in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #445\u2013447 (1976), ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #249\u201355 (1978\u20131979, written and fully drawn by Ditko), and ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #318\u2013323 (1983).\n\nBeginning in a team-up with [[Superman]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #88 (December 1985), written by [[Steve Englehart]]) during the\n''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' company-wide story arc, the Creeper's depiction changed under different writers, which included a revised origin that was referenced but never wholly revealed. His deranged behavior, initially an act to frighten criminals, transformed into genuine, narcotics-induced psychotic behavior. In addition, Ryder could access his enhanced physical abilities only in his costumed form, and could no longer control his transformations. The new version came into focus when the Creeper teamed with the [[Justice League International]] in 1987. A decade later, DC gave the Creeper another chance in a solo comic, ''The Creeper''. It lasted 12 issues (December 1997&nbsp;\u2013 November 1998), including the 1998 [[DC One Million]] special numbering.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/5733/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 1997 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> Writer [[Len Kaminski]] focused on the breakdown of Ryder's sanity under the influence of the Creeper and made many references to previous continuity: the character is initially in an asylum and is formally diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]];<ref>''The Creeper'' (Volume 1) #3, p.&nbsp;3</ref> his two personas frequently battle for control of their shared body.\n\nThe Creeper starred in a six-issue mini-series, ''The Creeper'' volume 2 (October 2006&nbsp;\u2013 March 2007), written by [[Steve Niles]] and drawn by [[Justiniano]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/19429/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 2006 series)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Jack Ryder''' is a former [[Gotham City]] television [[talk show]] [[talk show host|host]] who was fired due to his outspoken nature. In ''[[Bruce Wayne: The Road Home#Outsiders|Bruce Wayne: The Road Home: Outsiders]]'', it is revealed that he once dated [[Vicki Vale]]. Finding employment in security headed by [[Bill Brane]], he attempts to rescue a scientist named [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz]] whom mobsters headed by gangster [[Angel Devlin]] have kidnapped in order to obtain his newest discoveries. The chief mobster hosts a masquerade party at his mansion. To gain entry, Ryder improvises a costume from yellow tights and facial make-up designed to look like skin, a green wig and trunks, and red gloves, boots, and furry cloak. Ryder locates Yatz inside, but the mobsters discover him and first shoot at him, but then finally stabs him, wounding Ryder. Yatz injects Ryder with a serum and implants a device in his wound. The serum confers the power to almost instantly heal any wound and grants Ryder enhanced strength and agility. The device, used with its activator, causes the costume to disappear, leaving Ryder naked (he can later change into his formal clothes on command). Yatz inadvertently leaves the activator out of the wound, but does not realize this until after the wound had healed. At this point, the mobsters find their victims again, this time killing Yatz. Ryder discovers that with the activator, he can regain the wild costume whenever he wishes. With it, a crazy laugh and his enhanced physical abilities, he has no trouble routing the crooks.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAs the Creeper, Ryder has a series of adventures dealing with supervillains, while hiding his secret identity from his friends and cohorts and dealing with weather girl personality [[Vera Sweet]] who also acts as his love interest.\n\nThe eventual revision of the Creeper's origin eliminated the serum and claims that the scientist surgically implanted two devices (some accounts claim a single device with two effects) that enhance Ryder's physical abilities and can recreate an object whose \"imprint\" is stored in its circuitry. The scientist performs this surgery to save Ryder's life after criminals he was investigating attacked and drugged him. Because the scientist is unaware of the drugs in Ryder's system he inadvertently recorded their \"imprint\" at the same time he recorded the \"imprint\" of the costume, thus the device that recreates Ryder's costume when he becomes the Creeper also recreates the drugs in his system, explaining the Creeper's odd personality. These drugs so overwhelm Ryder's system that their effect becomes cumulative and the Creeper gradually becomes more irrational. When the Creeper changes back to Jack Ryder, the drugs disappear and with them, the psychosis. Eventually, Ryder comes to believe that he and the Creeper are two entirely different people instead of two roles played by the same man; he also holds this belief in his Creeper persona, which becomes increasingly disdainful of \"Jack Ryder\". The Creeper once regained his rationality while bound by [[Wonder Woman]]'s magic lasso, but the implications of this have never been explored.\n\n===Fighting Eclipso===\nThe Creeper appeared in the ''[[Eclipso: The Darkness Within]]'' annuals in 1992, tricked into taking up one of [[Eclipso]]'s dark crystals, putting him under Eclipso's control. He is later freed by Bruce Gordon, a longtime adversary of Eclipso. In the self-titled ''Eclipso'' comic book series, the Creeper, Gordon and his wife Mona make an initial foray into the South American territory that Eclipso has conquered. This leads to an Eclipso-possessed peasant throwing the Creeper (and himself) off a cliff. The peasant is mentally abandoned and both are left to plunge to their deaths. The intervention of a stunt squad saves the lives of both men. Several other heroes join in the fight against Eclipso, including [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]], the original [[Commander Steel|Steel]], [[Amanda Waller]], and [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Wildcat]] II. They form a team called the [[Shadow Fighters]]. In issue #13 of ''Eclipso'', a portion of the Fighters, including the Creeper, make another trip into Eclipso's territory. Several hyenas, possessed by Eclipso, track down the Creeper and tear him to shreds. Most of the infiltration team is slain; only small parts of the Creeper are actually recovered. The remains, along with the other dead heroes, are stolen out from under Eclipso's control by surviving Shadow Fighters.\n\nDespite this death, a Creeper series was launched in 1997. There are indications in this comic that the Dr. Yatz origin as detailed in previous appearances is somehow false and that the Creeper's actual origins are in some way related to his longtime villain, Proteus. Before this was fully explored, however, the series ceased publication.\n\n===Rebooted origin===\nIn 2006, a new version of the Creeper appears in the ''Brave New World'' one shot, published following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In the one shot, Jack Ryder is now the host of a controversial TV show, ''You Are Wrong!'', promising $1,000,000 to the person who catches the Creeper.\nFollowing this, a six-issue Creeper miniseries revealed the new origin, seemingly taking place during Batman's early years.\n\nRyder is said to support Dr. Vincent Yatz, who has been combining [[stem cell]] therapy and medical [[nanotechnology]] to create a revolutionary \"nanocell\" therapy called \"smart-skin\", which would enhance the body's regeneration to the point of giving new skin to burn victims and those who have suffered severe scarring. Ryder visits Yatz's lab just as the scientist is being threatened by mobsters attempting to steal the latest test batch of his newly discovered technology. Unable to escape, Yatz injects the last sample of smart-skin, still somewhat unstable, into Ryder's body in an attempt to keep it safe from the mobsters. When the criminals shoot Ryder in his head, the smart-skin activates, resurrecting Ryder moments later as the Creeper, a yellow-skinned man with superhuman physicality, green hair, and a mane of red hair growing on his back (as opposed to wearing fake red fur, like previous incarnations). The Creeper is a separate personality from Ryder and dispatches the criminals. Ryder discovers he and the Creeper can trade places, after which each acts as a witness to the other's activities and can mentally communicate with their alter ego.\n\nInitially wanting nothing to do with the Creeper, Ryder lets him out when the yellow-skinned creature convinces him to seek revenge on their would-be killers. During their pursuit of the criminals, the Creeper and Ryder learn that Yatz has secretly intended the smart-skin to be a weapon. Side effects of its use on human subjects seem to be a loss of mental control, along with the test subjects all getting yellow skin and a mixture of red and green hair. Yatz credits these side effects on the mind and body as resulting from a nerve agent (provided by his silent partner) he had added to the nanocells. This partner is revealed to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], who had hoped to combine his Joker venom (which causes temporary madness and usually death by laughter) and Yatz's technology to create an army of maniacal, superstrong, near-immortal soldiers. Batman and Ryder defeat the Joker, who later attacks Yatz in revenge. Batman discovers Ryder's double identity and creates a chemical agent that can cure him of the Creeper, but Ryder refuses and forms a truce with his alter ego, agreeing to let the Creeper out from time to time to fight criminals while hiding his identity from everyone including news rival and love interest [[Vera Sweet]].\n\n===''Countdown''===\nIn ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis#Secondary titles|Countdown to Mystery]]'' #2, Jack Ryder is approached by [[Eclipso]], who hopes to seduce him as she did [[Plastic Man]]. She succeeds, but the Creeper is later freed from the corruption by Bruce Gordon. In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #24 (2007), the Creeper is seen, along with other heroes, fighting members of the [[Sinestro Corps]] in the streets of [[New York City|New York]].\n\n===''Reign in Hell''===\nDuring the ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' miniseries, the Creeper was presented as a demon that co-inhabited the body of Jack Ryder rather than an identity he assumed due to scientific experimentation. The story shows the Creeper demon separating from Jack Ryder, having been recalled to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] by [[Lilith]], the mother of all Earthborn atrocities. It is later revealed that the Creeper demon is just one of a similar-looking species of demon. The ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries had many internal continuity errors that made its place in DC Comics canon questionable and the idea that the Creeper was a demonic entity was not repeated afterward.\n\n===Outsiders===\nThe Creeper has joined the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref>''The Outsiders'' #15 (April 2009)</ref> Later, the Creeper is one of the many heroes recruited to keep the villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] from exploiting his resemblance to Bruce Wayne.

It revealed that Katana's sword was used to kill the Creeper. In the following issue, the Creeper is seen bonding to Jack Ryder's dead body. The Creeper notes that he had used Ryder's body previously, calling him \"old friend\". He later confronts Katana and then retreats.<ref>''Katana'' #4 (July 2013)</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the rebooted continuity of the 2017 initiative [[DC Rebirth]], Jack Ryder appears to be back to his original pre-New 52 version from before. While investigating a series of murdered criminals down in Chicago, Ryder ends up transforming into the Creeper again and battling against a [[Deathstroke]] copycat; while running into the real Deathstroke at the same time. In ''[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]'' he is a member recruited by Bizarro.\n\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Creeper is shown to have been captured by [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra]]'s cult until he is \"saved\" by [[Black Adam]].<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018).

A man in squalor disposes of a dead body, but is met with a surprise.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Original===\nThe Creeper's powers are physical in nature and a result of [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz's]] inventions. He displays virtually superhuman agility and stamina, combined with strength. This enables him to perform amazing feats of acrobatics and leaping. He also seems to be able to climb sheer walls with little or no difficulty. His strength is enough to enable him to throw grown men several feet or jump several feet in the air. His speed and reflexes have also been enhanced greatly. These combined abilities make the Creeper a formidable fighter, incorporating brawling techniques with his physical prowess. A signature move of his is jumping onto the backs of his opponents and throwing them off balance. The Creeper also possesses a superhuman healing factor, which enables him to heal from virtually any wound; gunshots and stab wounds healing within a matter of minutes. It even allowed him to return from death when his body regenerated after being torn apart by Eclipsed hyenas. Also, his laugh is depicted as being physically painful to the ears of his victims, causing a psychotic comatose state.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Current===\nAccording to the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, the Creeper form of Jack Ryder is actually a member of a unique demonic species who all share similar physical characteristics. This idea was dismissed by other writers and in the retcon origin by Steve Niles, the Creeper was the result of Yatz's experiments and had the same powers as his original incarnation, along with a laugh that seemed to disorient opponents.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===''Beware the Creeper''===\nThe 2003 series ''[[Beware the Creeper]]'', which is set in 1920s [[Paris]], features a female Creeper.\n\n===''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===\nThe Creeper makes a cameo appearance in the 2001\u20132002 miniseries ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', wherein he has already been struck fatally.

DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===DC One Million===\nIn the year 85,271 depicted in the 1998 \"[[DC One Million]]\" storyline, on the planet IAI, an entity known as RYDR senses a disturbance that may unravel all that is and transforms into its other, the sum total of collective unreason, shamanic avatar and raw distillate of madness known as The Creeper. The trail leads to present day Jack Ryder, who was tired of being a superhero. Jack and The Creeper became separate parts of each other, actual living beings. After The Creeper side kept splitting into bizarre and dangerous alternate Creepers each representing a different part of The Creeper's personality, Jack realized that whether he liked it or not, the Creeper was a part of him. The future Creeper ingested all the alternate Creepers, but realizing the truth of the event, he returned them to the original Creeper and told him and Jack Ryder to remerge, and The Creeper was reborn. The future Creeper returns to IAI with the last remaining alternate Creeper, the one representing self-loathing, which he disposes of before transforming back into RYDR to catalogue the event.<ref>''The Creeper'' Volume 1 #1,000,000</ref>\n\n===Tangent Comics===\nIn the [[Tangent Comics]] universe, the Earth-9 version of the Creeper is a powerful warlock and member of occult organization known as the Black Circle.

The gas and the chemicals transform him into the Creeper. The Creeper then goes on a crusade against the Joker to avenge himself (he's the first person that the Joker ever describes as a '[[lunatic]]'), while frequently being sidetracked by an infatuation with [[Harley Quinn]] and his own stream-of-consciousness rambling.

Thus the municipality of Jezero was established by the decision of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska in June 1996.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe village name ''Jezero'' derives from ''[[wikt:jezero#Serbo-Croatian|jezero]]'', which in several [[Slavic languages]], including [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], means \"lake\".\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"8\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Jezero municipality\n|-\n|Settlement\n|1948.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|Total\n|2,604\n|3,323\n|\n|\n|\n|1,949\n|1,144\n|-\n|Borci\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|227\n|\n|-\n|\u010cerkazovi\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|220\n|\n|-\n|Drenov Do\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|145\n|\n|-\n|\u0110umezlije\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|92\n|\n|-\n|'''Jezero'''\n|\n|\n|655\n|595\n|728\n|834\n|702\n|-\n|Kova\u010devac\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|131\n|\n|-\n|Ljoli\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|205\n|\n|-\n|Peru\u0107ica\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|95\n|\n|}\n\n=== Ethnic composition ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Jezero town\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|702 (100,0%)\n|834 (100,0%)\n|728 (100,0%)\n|595 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|477 (57,19%)\n|409 (56,18%)\n|435 (73,11%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|\n|282 (33,81%)\n|245 (33,65%)\n|131 (22,02%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|34 (4,077%)\n|46 (6,319%)\n|6 (1,008%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|\n|33 (3,957%)\n|13 (1,786%)\n|19 (3,193%)\n|-\n|Others\n|\n|8 (0,959%)\n|9 (1,236%)\n|4 (0,672%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|6 (0,824%)\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"11\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Jezero municipality\n|-\n|Nationality\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|1,144 (100,0%)\n|834 (100,0%)\n|728 (100,0%)\n|595 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|477 (57,19%)\n|409 (56,18%)\n|435 (73,10%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|841 (73,51%)\n|282 (33,81%)\n|245 (33,65%)\n|131 (22,01%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|11 (0,962%)\n|33 (3,95%)\n|13 (1,78%)\n|19 (3,19%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|34 (4,07%)\n|46 (6,31%)\n|6 (1,00%)\n|-\n|Others\n|5 (0,437%)\n|8 (0,95%)\n|15 (2,06%)\n|4 (0,67%)\n|}\n<br />\n==Tourism==\nThe municipality of Jezero has significant water potential (rivers Pliva, Jo\u0161avka and rivers of Peru\u0107ica, lake \u0110ol in Ljolji\u0107i).

What is specific for Jezero is that it is located exactly on the confluence of the river Pliva with Great Pliva Lake, surrounded with beautiful mountain range. Except Pliva Lake, there are two more lakes nearby, those are Veliki \u0110ol (Great \u0110ol) and Mali \u0110ol (Small \u0110ol), places remarkably famous among the fishermen.
