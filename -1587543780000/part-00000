McGovern campaign manager [[Gary Hart]] suggested [[Boston]] [[Mayor of Boston|Mayor]] [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]]. McGovern called White, and received \"an emphatic yes\", but the leader of the Massachusetts delegation, [[Ken Galbraith]], said the Massachusetts delegation would walk out if the announcement was made to the Convention that McGovern had chosen White as his vice-presidential candidate, as White had backed Muskie during the Massachusetts primary. Massachusetts ended up being the only state (along with the District of Columbia) that McGovern would carry in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] on election day.\n\nMcGovern then asked [[Abe Ribicoff]], who declined, and Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]] to be his running mate. Nelson also declined, but suggested Tom Eagleton, whom McGovern ultimately chose, with only a minimal background check, as had been customary for vice presidential selections up until that time.<ref>McGovern, George S., ''Grassroots: The Autobiography of George McGovern'', New York: Random House, 1977, pp. 190-191</ref><ref>Theodore White, ''The Making of the President, 1972'', (1973), pp. 256-258</ref> Eagleton made no mention of his earlier hospitalizations, and in fact decided with his wife to keep them secret from McGovern while he was flying to his first meeting with the presidential nominee.\n\n===Replacement on the ticket===\nOn July 25, 1972, just over two weeks after the 1972 Democratic Convention, Eagleton admitted the truth of news reports that he had received electroshock therapy for clinical depression during the 1960s.

He is best remembered for briefly being the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] nominee under [[George McGovern]] in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]]. He suffered from bouts of [[depression (mood)|depression]] throughout his life, resulting in several hospitalizations, which were kept secret from the public. When they were revealed, it humiliated the McGovern campaign and Eagleton was forced to quit the race. He later became adjunct professor of [[Public administration|public affairs]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]].\n\n==Early life and political career==\nEagleton was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the son of Zitta Louise (Swanson) and Mark David Eagleton, a politician who had run for mayor. His paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants, and his mother had Swedish, Irish, French, and Austrian ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/call-me-tom-james-n-giglio/1101041346?ean=9780826219404|title=Call Me Tom: The Life of Thomas F.

McGovern had been convinced that Kennedy would join the ticket. Kennedy ended up refusing. McGovern campaign manager [[Gary Hart]] suggested [[Boston]] [[Mayor of Boston|Mayor]] [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]]. McGovern called White, and received \"an emphatic yes\", but the leader of the Massachusetts delegation, [[Ken Galbraith]], said the Massachusetts delegation would walk out if the announcement was made to the Convention that McGovern had chosen White as his vice-presidential candidate, as White had backed Muskie during the Massachusetts primary. Massachusetts ended up being the only state (along with the District of Columbia) that McGovern would carry in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] on election day.\n\nMcGovern then asked [[Abe Ribicoff]], who declined, and Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]] to be his running mate. Nelson also declined, but suggested Tom Eagleton, whom McGovern ultimately chose, with only a minimal background check, as had been customary for vice presidential selections up until that time.<ref>McGovern, George S., ''Grassroots: The Autobiography of George McGovern'', New York: Random House, 1977, pp. 190-191</ref><ref>Theodore White, ''The Making of the President, 1972'', (1973), pp. 256-258</ref> Eagleton made no mention of his earlier hospitalizations, and in fact decided with his wife to keep them secret from McGovern while he was flying to his first meeting with the presidential nominee.\n\n===Replacement on the ticket===\nOn July 25, 1972, just over two weeks after the 1972 Democratic Convention, Eagleton admitted the truth of news reports that he had received electroshock therapy for clinical depression during the 1960s. McGovern initially said he would back Eagleton \"[[1000 percent]]\".

He teamed with the Ring Crew Express (Dunn and Marcos) in the ''Trios Tournament 2005'', losing to the Rottweilers. At ''Stalemate'', he lost to [[Roderick Strong]], then teaming with Sal Rinauro against [[The Embassy (professional wrestling)|The Embassy]] at ''New Frontiers'' (and losing). He only received a few more matches, losing to [[Austin Aries]] at ''Fate of an Angel'' and getting his first win against fellow IWS alumnus Kevin Steen at ''The Homecoming'' (a match that didn't even make it to the event's DVD). His final ROH match of this run was a loss to [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]] at ''Dragon Gate Invasion''.\n\nGenerico returned to ROH in late 2006, making an appearance at ''Dethroned'', where he was defeated by [[Brent Albright]]. Following this, he took part in (and lost) a Four Corner Survival match to [[Jimmy Rave]] at ''Final Battle 2006''. In 2007, El Generico formed a permanent team with Kevin Steen, taking on the Briscoe Brothers at the ''Fifth Year Festival: Philly''. Much like many previous matches, they were defeated in this encounter, but the two men had a memorable showing that eventually earned them a full-time spot on the roster. Throughout 2007, the two teams feuded with one another, having several memorable matches including (but not limited to) a great match on the ''Driven'' pay-per-view, ROH's second-ever. Their feud came to an end following a brutal Street Fight at ''Death Before Dishonor V: Night 1'', a steel cage match at ''Caged Rage'', a two out of three falls match at ''Manhattan Mayhem 2'' and a ladder match advertised as a \"Ladder War\" at ''Man Up''. This final match became the Main Event of ROH's third pay-per-view.\n\n[[File:El Generico in May 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250x|Generico in 2008]]\nAlso during this time, Generico broke out as a singles competitor, having a strong run in the Race to the Top Tournament of 2007. He defeated (in order) [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]], Chris Hero and [[Davey Richards]], only to lose in the final match of the tournament to Claudio Castagnoli. After the feud with the Briscoes ended, Generico and Steen spent several months feuding with the Hangmen Three in an inconclusive feud that carried on into 2008. They also worked through the tag ranks and attempted to win the tag titles, but came up short in a tag title tournament at ''Up For Grabs''. Generico took ROH World champion [[Nigel McGuinness]] to the limit at ''Age of Insanity'', but eventually lost.\n\nOn September 19, 2008, Generico and Steen finally won the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship]] by beating [[The Age of the Fall]] at [[Driven (2008)|Driven]].<ref name=\"ROHtag\"/> Generico lost a second match to McGuinness at ''Glory by Honor VII''. Generico was booked in another match against McGuinness at [[Caged Collision]], which he lost.

At ''Stalemate'', he lost to [[Roderick Strong]], then teaming with Sal Rinauro against [[The Embassy (professional wrestling)|The Embassy]] at ''New Frontiers'' (and losing). He only received a few more matches, losing to [[Austin Aries]] at ''Fate of an Angel'' and getting his first win against fellow IWS alumnus Kevin Steen at ''The Homecoming'' (a match that didn't even make it to the event's DVD). His final ROH match of this run was a loss to [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]] at ''Dragon Gate Invasion''.\n\nGenerico returned to ROH in late 2006, making an appearance at ''Dethroned'', where he was defeated by [[Brent Albright]]. Following this, he took part in (and lost) a Four Corner Survival match to [[Jimmy Rave]] at ''Final Battle 2006''. In 2007, El Generico formed a permanent team with Kevin Steen, taking on the Briscoe Brothers at the ''Fifth Year Festival: Philly''. Much like many previous matches, they were defeated in this encounter, but the two men had a memorable showing that eventually earned them a full-time spot on the roster. Throughout 2007, the two teams feuded with one another, having several memorable matches including (but not limited to) a great match on the ''Driven'' pay-per-view, ROH's second-ever. Their feud came to an end following a brutal Street Fight at ''Death Before Dishonor V: Night 1'', a steel cage match at ''Caged Rage'', a two out of three falls match at ''Manhattan Mayhem 2'' and a ladder match advertised as a \"Ladder War\" at ''Man Up''.

He defeated (in order) [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]], Chris Hero and [[Davey Richards]], only to lose in the final match of the tournament to Claudio Castagnoli. After the feud with the Briscoes ended, Generico and Steen spent several months feuding with the Hangmen Three in an inconclusive feud that carried on into 2008. They also worked through the tag ranks and attempted to win the tag titles, but came up short in a tag title tournament at ''Up For Grabs''. Generico took ROH World champion [[Nigel McGuinness]] to the limit at ''Age of Insanity'', but eventually lost.\n\nOn September 19, 2008, Generico and Steen finally won the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship]] by beating [[The Age of the Fall]] at [[Driven (2008)|Driven]].<ref name=\"ROHtag\"/> Generico lost a second match to McGuinness at ''Glory by Honor VII''.

During the reign of his son, King [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV]] (1378\u20131419), a period of intense turmoil ensued. During Easter 1389, members of the Prague clergy announced that Jews had desecrated the host (Eucharistic wafer) and the clergy encouraged mobs to pillage, ransack and burn the Jewish quarter.

Having become too dangerous for the political and religious establishment, Hus was summoned to the [[Council of Constance]], put on trial for [[heresy]], and burned at the stake in [[Constanz]] in 1415.\n\nFour years later Prague experienced its [[Defenestrations of Prague|first defenestration]], when the people rebelled under the command of the Prague priest [[Jan \u017delivsk\u00fd]].

He lived in the Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover too, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], the painter [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo|Arcimboldo]], the alchemists [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee]], the poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], and others.\n\nIn 1618, the famous [[Defenestrations of Prague|second defenestration of Prague]] provoked the [[Thirty Years' War]], a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia. [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]]; however his army was crushed in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) not far from the city.

The population increased to 80,000 inhabitants by 1771. Many rich merchants and nobles enhanced the city with a host of palaces, churches and gardens full of art and [[Music from Eighteenth-Century Prague|music]], creating a [[Baroque]] city renowned throughout the world to this day.\n\nIn 1784, under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the four municipalities of Mal\u00e1 Strana, Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto, Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto, and Hrad\u010dany were merged into a single entity. The Jewish district, called [[Josefov]], was included only in 1850. The [[Industrial Revolution]] had a strong effect in Prague, as factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby region. A first suburb, [[Karl\u00edn]], was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.\n\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutions in Europe in 1848]] also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed.

Prague had a German-speaking majority in 1848, but by 1880 the number of German speakers had decreased to 14% (42,000), and by 1910 to 6.7% (37,000), due to a massive increase of the city's overall population caused by the influx of [[Czechs]] from the rest of Bohemia and [[Moravia]] and also due to return of social status importance of the Czech language.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Masaryk in Prague.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, Prague|Statue]] of [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] near [[Prague Castle]]]]\n\n====First Czechoslovak Republic====\n{{Main|First Czechoslovak Republic}}\nWorld War I ended with the defeat of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the creation of Czechoslovakia.

Precipitation in Prague (and most of the Bohemian lowland) is rather low (just over {{convert|20|in|mm|-2|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=sqbr}} per year) since it is located in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Sudetes]] and other mountain ranges. The driest season is usually winter while late spring and summer can bring quite heavy rain, especially in form of thundershowers. [[Inversion (meteorology)|Temperature inversions]] are relatively common between mid-October and mid-March bringing foggy, cold days and sometimes moderate air pollution. Prague is also a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of {{convert|16|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} that often help break temperature inversions and clear the air in cold

the capital of the Czech Republic and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is de facto again a statutory town, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the Central Bohemia Region.\n\nUntil 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. [[Cadastre|Cadastral area]] (for example, [[Vinohrady]], [[Sm\u00edchov]]) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.\n\nPrague is composed of 112 cadastral territories of different size, character and importance. The city also consists of 22 administrative districts (1\u201322).[[H\u00e1jek (Prague)|Hajek]] is a district of Prague.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===City government===\n[[File:Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib 2019 Praha.jpg|thumb|upright|Mayor [[Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib]]]]\nPrague is automously administered by the [[Prague City Assembly]], which is elected through municipal elections and consists of 55 to 70 members.

The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Mal\u00e1 Strana and castle area. On 9 July 1357 at 5:31&nbsp;am, Charles IV personally laid the first foundation stone for the Charles Bridge. The exact time of laying the first foundation stone is known because the [[palindromic number]] 135797531 was carved into the Old Town bridge tower having been chosen by the royal astrologists and numerologists as the best time for starting the bridge construction.<ref>Stone, Andrew.

The work is reputed to have been ordered by Charles IV as a means of providing employment and food to the workers and their families.\n\nCharles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV]] (1378\u20131419), a period of intense turmoil ensued.

Rudolf was an art lover too, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], the painter [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo|Arcimboldo]], the alchemists [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee]], the poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], and others.\n\nIn 1618, the famous [[Defenestrations of Prague|second defenestration of Prague]] provoked the [[Thirty Years' War]], a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia. [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]]; however his army was crushed in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) not far from the city.

The Jewish district, called [[Josefov]], was included only in 1850. The [[Industrial Revolution]] had a strong effect in Prague, as factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby region. A first suburb, [[Karl\u00edn]], was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.\n\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutions in Europe in 1848]] also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed.

Prague is also a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of {{convert|16|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} that often help break temperature inversions and clear the air in cold

the capital of the Czech Republic and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is de facto again a statutory town, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the Central Bohemia Region.\n\nUntil 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. [[Cadastre|Cadastral area]] (for example, [[Vinohrady]], [[Sm\u00edchov]]) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.\n\nPrague is composed of 112 cadastral territories of different size, character and importance. The city also consists of 22 administrative districts (1\u201322).[[H\u00e1jek (Prague)|Hajek]] is a district of Prague.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===City government===\n[[File:Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib 2019 Praha.jpg|thumb|upright|Mayor [[Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib]]]]\nPrague is automously administered by the [[Prague City Assembly]], which is elected through municipal elections and consists of 55 to 70 members.
