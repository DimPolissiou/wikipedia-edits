Instead, Indian cultural influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through Southeast Asia, making the traditions a part of the region. The interactions between [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were marked by waves of influence and dominance. At some points, the Indian culture solely found its way into the region, and at other points, the influence was used to take over. Indianization was seen as the total influence of all aspects of Southeast Asian history. Before the take over of the influence of Indian culture, Southeast Asia was seen as a place with no history. The beginning of Indianization marked the start of the cultural commencement in Southeast Asia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Previous source no longer exists (and was self-published)}}\n\n===Theories of Indianization===\n{{Further|Indianization of Southeast Asia}}\nAs conclusive evidence is missing numerous Indianization theories of [[Southeast Asia]] have emerged since the early 20th century. The central argument usually revolves around the question, who was the main propagator exporting Indian institutional and cultural ideas to Southeast Asia.\n\nOne theory of the spread of Indianization that focuses on the caste of [[Vaishya]] [[Sadhaba|traders]] and their role for spreading Indian culture and language into Southeast Asia through trade. There were many trade incentives that brought Vaishya traders to Southeast Asia, the most important of which was gold. During the 4th century C.E., when the first evidence of Indian trader in Southeast Asia, the Indian sub-continent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the [[Roman Empire]]. This made many Vaishya traders look to the seas to acquire new gold, of which Southeast Asia was abundant. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes.<ref name=lukas/>\n\nAnother theory states that Indianization spread through the warrior class of [[Kshatriya]]. This hypothesis effectively explains state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory hasn't attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it.<ref name=lukas>{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Helmut|title=1 THEORIES OF INDIANIZATIONExemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia)|journal=International SanskritConference|date=21 May 2001|url=https://www.academia.edu/4803585}}</ref>\n\nThe most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of [[Brahman]] scholars. These Brahmans brought with them many of the Hindu religious and philosophical traditions and spread them to the elite classes of Southeast Asian polities. Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmans were also experts in art and architecture, and political affairs, thus explaining the adoption of many Indian style law codes and architecture into Southeast Asian society<ref name=lukas/>\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also | Literature about Southeast Asia | South Asian literature }}\nScripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos, and Cambodia are variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.<ref name=smith>{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Monica L.|authorlink1=Monica L.

Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.<ref name=coedes>{{harvtxt|Coedes|1967}}</ref> The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity, Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \"reincarnations or descendants\" of the Hindu Gods. However, once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.\n\n===Religion, authority and legitimacy===\nThe pre-Indic political and social systems in Southeast Asia were marked by a relative indifference towards lineage descent. Hindu God kingship enabled rulers to supersede loyalties, forge cosmopolitan polities and the worship of Shiva and Vishnu was combined with ancestor worship, so that Khmer, Javanese, and Cham rulers claimed semi-divine status as descendants of a God. Hindu traditions, especially the relationship to the sacrality of the land and social structures, are inherent in Hinduism's transnational features. The epic traditions of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a further legitimized a ruler identified with a God who battled and defeated the wrong doers that threaten the ethical order of the world.<ref name=\"oxford press\">{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0112.xml | title= Hinduism in Southeast Asia | publisher= Oxford Press |date=28 May 2013 | access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nHinduism does not have a single historical founder, a centralized imperial authority in India proper nor a bureaucratic structure, thus ensuring relative religious independence for the individual ruler.

The exact location of the kingdom is the subject of studies among historians.\n* '''[[Srivijaya]]''': From the 7th to 13th centuries Srivijaya, a maritime empire centered on the island of [[Sumatra]] in Indonesia, had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers from Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa to the [[Sailendra]]s. A stronghold of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], Srivijaya attracted pilgrims and scholars from other parts of Asia. I Ching reports that the kingdom was home to more than a thousand Buddhist scholars.

The name had been forgotten until scholars recognized Tambralinga as Nagara Sri Dharmaraja (Nakhon Si Thammarat). Early records are scarce but its duration is estimated to range from the seventh to the fourteenth century. Tambralinga first sent tribute to the emperor of the Tang dynasty in 616 CE. In Sanskrit, Tambra means \"red\" and linga means \"symbol\", typically representing the divine energy of Shiva.\n* '''[[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]]''': The Medang-i-Bhumi Mataram Kingdom flourished between the 8th and 11th centuries. It was first centered in central Java before moving later to east Java. This kingdom produced numbers of Hindu-Buddhist temples in Java, including [[Borobudur]] Buddhist mandala and the [[Prambanan]] [[Trimurti]] Hindu temple dedicated mainly to [[Shiva]]. The [[Sailendra]]s were the ruling family of this kingdom at an earlier stage in central Java, before being replaced by the [[Isyana Dynasty]].\n* '''[[Kediri Kingdom|Kadiri]]''': In the 10th century, Mataram challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King [[Airlangga]] (c. 1020\u20131050), the kingdom split on his death; the new state of Kediri, in eastern Java, became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries, spreading its influence to the eastern parts of Southeast Asia. The [[spice]] trade was now becoming increasingly important, as demand from European countries grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the [[Maluku Islands]] (or \"Spice Islands\") in Indonesia, and so Kediri became a strong trading nation.\n* '''[[Singhasari]]''': In the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and [[Singhasari]] arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king [[Kertanegara]]. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, [[Majapahit]]. By the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, part of [[Borneo]], the southern Celebes and the Moluccas. It also exerted considerable influence on the mainland.\n* '''[[Majapahit]]''': The Majapahit empire, centered in East Java, succeeded the [[Singhasari]] empire and flourished in the Indonesian archipelago between the 13th and 15th centuries. Noted for their naval expansion, the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] spanned west\u2013east from Lamuri in [[Aceh]] to Wanin in [[West Papua (province)|Papua]]. Majapahit was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Most of [[Bali]]nese Hindu culture, traditions and civilisations were derived from Majapahit legacy. A large number of Majapahit nobles, priests, and artisans found their home in Bali after the decline of Majapahit to [[Demak Sultanate]].\n* '''[[Galuh Kingdom|Galuh]]''' was an ancient Hindu kingdom in the eastern Tatar Pasundan (now west Java province and Banyumasan region of central Java province), Indonesia. It was established following the collapse of the Tarumanagara kingdom around the 7th century. Traditionally the kingdom of Galuh was associated with the eastern Priangan cultural region, around the [[Citanduy]] and Cimanuk rivers, with its territory spanning from Citarum river on the west, to the Pamali (present-day Brebes river) and Serayu rivers on the east. Its capital was located in Kawali, near present-day Ciamis city.\n* '''[[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]''': The Kingdom of Sunda was a Hindu kingdom located in western Java from 669 CE to around 1579 CE, covering the area of present-day Banten, Jakarta, West Java, and the western part of Central Java. According to primary historical records, the Bujangga Manik manuscript, the eastern border of the Sunda Kingdom was the Pamali River (Ci Pamali, the present day Brebes River) and the Serayu River (Ci Sarayu) in Central Java.\n\n===Issues with Indianization===\n====Development in Southeast Asia====\nOne of the major issues with Indianization is the common debate about whether or not Indianization is the reason for the development in South East Asia. Many struggle to date and determine when colonization in Southeast Asia occurred because of the structures and ruins found that were similar to those in India.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=Some Problems in Ancient History of the Hinduized States of South-East Asia|date=1964|publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian History}}</ref> Several books and anthropologists believe that India is seen as the superior culture that influenced a lot of Southeast Asian countries. However, throughout this time that many began to debate, other anthropologists suggested that Southeast Asia had indigenous civilization and the idea of indianization was just seen as a 'national motivation. These debates continued for some time, until the Pacific War, which led to legitimately ending the debates and reviewing Southeast Asia's response to Indianzation.\n\n====Development of caste system====\nAnother main concern for Indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had shown that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Dougald J. W|title=Early Civilizations of Southeast Asia|journal=AltaMira Press|date=2007}}</ref>\nSimilar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of Indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove Indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the Indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n===Fall of Indianization===\n====Khmer Kingdom====\nBeginning shortly after the 12th century, the Khmer kingdom, one of the first kingdoms that began the dissipation of Indianization started after Jayavarman VII in which expanded a substantial amount of territory, thus going into war with Champa.  Leading into the fall of the Khmer Kingdom, the Khmer political and cultural zones were taken, overthrown, and fallen as well.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehman|first1=Don|title=The Rise & Fall of Southeast Asia's Empires|date=2015|publisher=Lulu|edition=5}}</ref> Not only did Indianization change many cultural and political aspects, but it also changed the spiritual realm as well, creating a type of Northern Culture which began in the early 14th century,  prevalent for its rapid decline in the Indian kingdoms. The decline of Hinduism kingdoms and spark of Buddhist kingdoms led to the formation of orthodox Sinhalese Buddhism and is a key factor leading to the decline of Indianization. Sukhothai and Ceylon are the prominent characters who formulated the center of Buddhism and this became more popularized over Hinduism.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n====Rise of Islam====\nNot only was the spark of Buddhism the driving force for Indianization coming to an end, but Islamic control took over as well in the midst of the thirteenth century to trump the Hinduist kingdoms. In the process of Islam coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms, trade was heavily practiced and the now Islamic Indians started becoming merchants all over Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamic control has spanned to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca, and has therefore stressed a widespread rise of Islamization.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Indian cultural sphere==\n{{Further|Indosphere}}\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]\nThe use of ''Greater India'' to refer to an Indian cultural sphere was popularised by a network of Bengali scholars in the 1920s who were all members of the Calcutta-based Greater India Society.

They called this vast region \"Greater India\" \u2013 a dubious appellation for a region which to a limited degree, but with little permanence, had been influenced by Indian religion, art, architecture, literature and administrative customs. As a consequence of this renewed and extensive interest in Greater India, many Indians came to believe that the entire South and Southeast Asian region formed the cultural progeny of India; now that the sub-continent was reawakening, they felt, India would once again assert its non-political ascendancy over the area... While the idea of reviving the ancient Greater India was never officially endorsed by the Indian National Congress, it enjoyed considerable popularity in nationalist Indian circles.

One key source of this knowledge is a warm tribute paid to [[Sylvain L\u00e9vi]] and his ideas of an expansive, civilising India by Jawaharlal Nehru himself, in his celebrated book, ''The Discovery of India'', which was written during one of Nehru's periods of imprisonment by the British authorities, first published in 1946, and reprinted many times since.... The ideas of both L\u00e9vi and the Greater India scholars were known to Nehru through his close intellectual links with Tagore. Thus L\u00e9vi's notion of ancient Indian voyagers leaving their invisible 'imprints' throughout east and southeast Asia was for Nehru a recapitulation of Tagore's vision of nationhood, that is an idealisation of India as a benign and uncoercive world civiliser and font of global enlightenment.

Southeast Asia had developed some prosperous and very powerful colonial empires that contributed to Hindu-Buddhist artistic creations and architectural developments. Art and architectural creations that rivaled those built in India, especially in its sheer size, design and aesthetic achievements. The notable examples are Borobudur in Java and Angkor monuments in Cambodia. The Srivijaya Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence in the region.\n\nA defining characteristic of the cultural link between Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent was the adoption of ancient Indian [[Vedic period|Vedic]]/Hindu and Buddhist culture and philosophy into [[Myanmar]], [[Tibet]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

Pollock's 2006 book ''The Language of the Gods in the World of Men'' makes a case for studying the region as comparable with Latin Europe and argues that the Sanskrit language was its unifying element.\n\nScripts in [[Sanskrit]] discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to [[Southeast Asia]]. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos, and Cambodia are variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.\n\nSanskrit and related languages have also influenced their [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking neighbors to the north through the spread of Buddhist texts in translation.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|van Gulik|1956|p=?}}</ref>   The spread of Buddhism to Tibet allowed many Sanskrit texts to survive only in Tibetan translation (in the [[Tanjur]]).  Buddhism was similarly introduced to China by [[Mahayana|Mahayanist]] missionaries sent by the Indian Emperor Ashoka mostly through translations of [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]] and Classical Sanskrit texts, and many terms were transliterated directly and added to the Chinese vocabulary.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, languages such as [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]] contain many [[loan word]]s from Sanskrit, as does [[Khmer language|Khmer]] to a lesser extent. For example, in Thai, [[Ravana|R\u0101va\u1e47a]], the legendary emperor of [[Sri Lanka]], is called 'Thosakanth' which is derived from his Sanskrit name 'Da\u015baka\u1e47\u1e6dha' (\"having ten necks\").\n\nMany Sanskrit loanwords are also found in [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Javanese language|Javanese]] particularly the [[Old Javanese|old form]] from which nearly half the vocabulary is derived from the language.<ref>See [[:id: Daftar kata serapan dari bahasa Sansekerta dalam bahasa Indonesia|this page]] from the [[Indonesian Wikipedia]] for a list</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zoetmulder|1982|p=ix}}</ref> Other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malay language|traditional Malay]], [[Indonesian language|modern Indonesian]], also derive [[List of loan words in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|much of their vocabulary]] from Sanskrit, albeit to a lesser extent, with a large proportion of words being derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]].  Similarly, [[Philippine languages]] such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] have [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Sanskrit|many Sanskrit loanwords]].\n\nA Sanskrit loanword encountered in many Southeast Asian languages is the word ''[[Indonesian language|bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101]]'', or spoken language, which is used to mean language in general, for example ''bahasa'' in Malay, Indonesian and [[Tausug language|Tausug]], ''basa'' in Javanese, [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and [[Balinese language|Balinese]], ''phasa'' in Thai and Lao, ''bhasa'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and ''phiesa'' in [[Khmer language|Khmer]].\n\nThe utilization of [[Sanskrit]] has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes. [[Sanskrit]] terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Coedes|1967|p=98}} The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of [[Vietnam]] once embraced the [[Sanskrit]] dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \"reincarnations or descendants\" of the [[Hindu]] gods. However once [[Buddhism]] began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.\n\n===Linguistic commonalities===\n* In the [[Malay Archipelago]]: [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] have absorbed a large amount of [[Sanskrit]] loanwords into their respective lexicons  (see: [[List of loan words in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|Sanskrit loan words in Indonesian]]).

In Sanskrit, it means \"The Land of Gold\". Thailand's [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]] is named after this toponym, signifying its intent to be a major transport hub of Southeast Asia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n* Several of Indonesian [[toponym]]s have Indian parallel or origin, such as [[Madura]] with [[Mathura]], [[Serayu]] and [[Sarayu]] river, [[Semeru]] with [[Sumeru]] mountain, [[Kalingga]] from [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga Kingdom]], and [[Yogyakarta|Ngayogyakarta]] from [[Ayodhya]].\n* Siamese ancient city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] also derived from Ramayana's Ayodhya.\n* Names of places could simply render their Sanskrit origin, such as [[Singapore]], from Singapura (''Singha-pura'' the \"lion city\"), [[Jakarta]] from ''Jaya'' and ''kreta'' (\"complete victory\").\n* Some of the Indonesian regencies such as [[Indragiri Hulu Regency|Indragiri Hulu]] and [[Indragiri Hilir Regency|Indragiri Hilir]] derived from Indragiri River, Indragiri itself means \"mountain of [[Indra]]\".\n* Some Thai toponyms also often have Indian parallels or Sanskrit origin, although the spellings are adapted to the Siamese tongue, such as [[Ratchaburi]] from ''Raja-puri'' (\"king's city\"), and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]] from ''Nagara Sri Dharmaraja''.\n* The tendency to use Sanskrit for modern [[neologism]] also continued to modern day. In 1962 Indonesia changed the colonial name of [[New Guinea]]n city of Hollandia to [[Jayapura]] (\"glorious city\"), Orange mountain range to [[Jayawijaya Mountains]].\n* Malaysia named their new government seat as [[Putrajaya]] (\"prince of glory\") in 1999.\n\n==Historiography of Indianization==\n===Indianization of Southeast Asia===\nThe history of [[South East Asia]] was mostly always written from the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region. The prevalent interpretation caused because of the ontological differences, the fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre-colonial Asia and the conclusion from it was that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies had caused innovation to become prey to tyranny and had rendered the history of the region cyclical, immobile and non-linear.\n\nThe belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction gained additional support, such as the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus [[Indosphere|Indianization]] was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-01JisWpJbEC&q=Indian#v=snippet&q=Indian&f=false | title=Strange Parallels: Volume 1, Integration on the Mainland: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c.800\u20131830| isbn=9781139437622| last1=Lieberman| first1=Victor| date=2003-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Caste systems===\nAnother main concern for [[Indian culture|Indianization]] was the understanding and development of caste systems.

Southeast Asia was now situated in the central area of convergence of the Indian and the East Asian maritime trade routes, the basis for economic and cultural growth. The earliest Hindu kingdoms emerged in Sumatra and Java, followed by mainland polities such as Funan and Champa. Adoption of Indian civilization elements and individual adaptation stimulated the emergence of centralized states and the development of highly organized societies.

Instead, Indian cultural influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through Southeast Asia, making the traditions a part of the region. The interactions between [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were marked by waves of influence and dominance. At some points, the Indian culture solely found its way into the region, and at other points, the influence was used to take over. Indianization was seen as the total influence of all aspects of Southeast Asian history. Before the take over of the influence of Indian culture, Southeast Asia was seen as a place with no history. The beginning of Indianization marked the start of the cultural commencement in Southeast Asia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Previous source no longer exists (and was self-published)}}\n\n===Theories of Indianization===\n{{Further|Indianization of Southeast Asia}}\nAs conclusive evidence is missing numerous Indianization theories of [[Southeast Asia]] have emerged since the early 20th century. The central argument usually revolves around the question, who was the main propagator exporting Indian institutional and cultural ideas to Southeast Asia.\n\nOne theory of the spread of Indianization that focuses on the caste of [[Vaishya]] [[Sadhaba|traders]] and their role for spreading Indian culture and language into Southeast Asia through trade. There were many trade incentives that brought Vaishya traders to Southeast Asia, the most important of which was gold. During the 4th century C.E., when the first evidence of Indian trader in Southeast Asia, the Indian sub-continent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the [[Roman Empire]]. This made many Vaishya traders look to the seas to acquire new gold, of which Southeast Asia was abundant. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes.<ref name=lukas/>\n\nAnother theory states that Indianization spread through the warrior class of [[Kshatriya]]. This hypothesis effectively explains state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory hasn't attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it.<ref name=lukas>{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Helmut|title=1 THEORIES OF INDIANIZATIONExemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia)|journal=International SanskritConference|date=21 May 2001|url=https://www.academia.edu/4803585}}</ref>\n\nThe most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of [[Brahman]] scholars. These Brahmans brought with them many of the Hindu religious and philosophical traditions and spread them to the elite classes of Southeast Asian polities. Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmans were also experts in art and architecture, and political affairs, thus explaining the adoption of many Indian style law codes and architecture into Southeast Asian society<ref name=lukas/>\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also | Literature about Southeast Asia | South Asian literature }}\nScripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos, and Cambodia are variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.<ref name=smith>{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Monica L.|authorlink1=Monica L.

Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.<ref name=coedes>{{harvtxt|Coedes|1967}}</ref> The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity, Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \"reincarnations or descendants\" of the Hindu Gods. However, once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.\n\n===Religion, authority and legitimacy===\nThe pre-Indic political and social systems in Southeast Asia were marked by a relative indifference towards lineage descent. Hindu God kingship enabled rulers to supersede loyalties, forge cosmopolitan polities and the worship of Shiva and Vishnu was combined with ancestor worship, so that Khmer, Javanese, and Cham rulers claimed semi-divine status as descendants of a God. Hindu traditions, especially the relationship to the sacrality of the land and social structures, are inherent in Hinduism's transnational features. The epic traditions of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a further legitimized a ruler identified with a God who battled and defeated the wrong doers that threaten the ethical order of the world.<ref name=\"oxford press\">{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0112.xml | title= Hinduism in Southeast Asia | publisher= Oxford Press |date=28 May 2013 | access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nHinduism does not have a single historical founder, a centralized imperial authority in India proper nor a bureaucratic structure, thus ensuring relative religious independence for the individual ruler.

An essential factor for the spread and adaptation of these religions originated from trading systems of the third and fourth century.<ref name=\"smith\" /> In order to spread the message of these religions Buddhist monks and Hindu priests joined mercantile classes in the quest to share their religious and cultural values and beliefs.

It is likely that Hindu and Buddhist traders, priests, and princes traveled to Southeast Asia from India in the first few centuries of the Common Era and eventually settled there. Strong impulse most certainly came from the region's ruling classes who invited Brahmans to serve at their courts as priests, astrologers and advisers.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism/The-spread-of-Hinduism-in-Southeast-Asia-and-the-Pacific | title=The spread of Hinduism in Southeast Asia and the Pacific | publisher= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= | access-date=20 December 2016 }}</ref> Divinity and royalty were closely connected in these polities as Hindu rituals validated the powers of the monarch.

In his inscriptions, Purnavarman associated himself with Vishnu, and Brahmins ritually secured the hydraulic project.\n* '''[[Kalingga Kingdom|Kalingga]]''': Kalingga (Javanese: Karajan Kalingga) was the 6th century Indianized kingdom on the north coast of Central Java, Indonesia. It was the earliest Hindu-Buddhist kingdom in Central Java, and together with Kutai and Tarumanagara are the oldest kingdoms in Indonesian history.\n* '''[[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]]''' was a classical Southeast Asian kingdom. The primary sources for much of the information on the kingdom are the New History of the Tang, and the memoirs of the Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing who visited in 671 CE, and states that it was \"absorbed\" by Srivijaya by 692 CE, but had \"broken away\" by the end of the eleventh century according to Chao Jukua. The exact location of the kingdom is the subject of studies among historians.\n* '''[[Srivijaya]]''': From the 7th to 13th centuries Srivijaya, a maritime empire centered on the island of [[Sumatra]] in Indonesia, had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers from Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa to the [[Sailendra]]s. A stronghold of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], Srivijaya attracted pilgrims and scholars from other parts of Asia. I Ching reports that the kingdom was home to more than a thousand Buddhist scholars. A notable Buddhist scholar of local origin, [[Dharmakirti]], taught Buddhist philosophy in Srivijaya and [[Nalanda]] (in India), and was the teacher of [[Atisha]]. Most of the time, this Buddhist [[ethnic Malay|Malay]] empire enjoyed cordial relationship with China and the [[Pala Empire]] in [[Bengal]], and the 860 CE [[Nalanda inscription]] records that Maharaja [[Balaputra]] dedicated a monastery at [[Nalanda|Nalanda university]] near Pala territory. The Srivijaya kingdom ceased to exist in the 13th century due to various factors, including the expansion of the Javanese, Singhasari, and Majapahit empires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=87|title=Thailand's World : The Srivijaya Kingdom in Thailand|accessdate=25 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120002507/http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=87|archive-date=20 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* '''[[Tambralinga]]''' was an ancient kingdom located on the Malay Peninsula that at one time came under the influence of Srivijaya. The name had been forgotten until scholars recognized Tambralinga as Nagara Sri Dharmaraja (Nakhon Si Thammarat). Early records are scarce but its duration is estimated to range from the seventh to the fourteenth century. Tambralinga first sent tribute to the emperor of the Tang dynasty in 616 CE. In Sanskrit, Tambra means \"red\" and linga means \"symbol\", typically representing the divine energy of Shiva.\n* '''[[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]]''': The Medang-i-Bhumi Mataram Kingdom flourished between the 8th and 11th centuries. It was first centered in central Java before moving later to east Java. This kingdom produced numbers of Hindu-Buddhist temples in Java, including [[Borobudur]] Buddhist mandala and the [[Prambanan]] [[Trimurti]] Hindu temple dedicated mainly to [[Shiva]]. The [[Sailendra]]s were the ruling family of this kingdom at an earlier stage in central Java, before being replaced by the [[Isyana Dynasty]].\n* '''[[Kediri Kingdom|Kadiri]]''': In the 10th century, Mataram challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King [[Airlangga]] (c. 1020\u20131050), the kingdom split on his death; the new state of Kediri, in eastern Java, became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries, spreading its influence to the eastern parts of Southeast Asia. The [[spice]] trade was now becoming increasingly important, as demand from European countries grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the [[Maluku Islands]] (or \"Spice Islands\") in Indonesia, and so Kediri became a strong trading nation.\n* '''[[Singhasari]]''': In the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and [[Singhasari]] arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king [[Kertanegara]]. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, [[Majapahit]]. By the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, part of [[Borneo]], the southern Celebes and the Moluccas. It also exerted considerable influence on the mainland.\n* '''[[Majapahit]]''': The Majapahit empire, centered in East Java, succeeded the [[Singhasari]] empire and flourished in the Indonesian archipelago between the 13th and 15th centuries. Noted for their naval expansion, the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] spanned west\u2013east from Lamuri in [[Aceh]] to Wanin in [[West Papua (province)|Papua]]. Majapahit was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Most of [[Bali]]nese Hindu culture, traditions and civilisations were derived from Majapahit legacy. A large number of Majapahit nobles, priests, and artisans found their home in Bali after the decline of Majapahit to [[Demak Sultanate]].\n* '''[[Galuh Kingdom|Galuh]]''' was an ancient Hindu kingdom in the eastern Tatar Pasundan (now west Java province and Banyumasan region of central Java province), Indonesia. It was established following the collapse of the Tarumanagara kingdom around the 7th century. Traditionally the kingdom of Galuh was associated with the eastern Priangan cultural region, around the [[Citanduy]] and Cimanuk rivers, with its territory spanning from Citarum river on the west, to the Pamali (present-day Brebes river) and Serayu rivers on the east. Its capital was located in Kawali, near present-day Ciamis city.\n* '''[[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]''': The Kingdom of Sunda was a Hindu kingdom located in western Java from 669 CE to around 1579 CE, covering the area of present-day Banten, Jakarta, West Java, and the western part of Central Java. According to primary historical records, the Bujangga Manik manuscript, the eastern border of the Sunda Kingdom was the Pamali River (Ci Pamali, the present day Brebes River) and the Serayu River (Ci Sarayu) in Central Java.\n\n===Issues with Indianization===\n====Development in Southeast Asia====\nOne of the major issues with Indianization is the common debate about whether or not Indianization is the reason for the development in South East Asia. Many struggle to date and determine when colonization in Southeast Asia occurred because of the structures and ruins found that were similar to those in India.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=Some Problems in Ancient History of the Hinduized States of South-East Asia|date=1964|publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian History}}</ref> Several books and anthropologists believe that India is seen as the superior culture that influenced a lot of Southeast Asian countries. However, throughout this time that many began to debate, other anthropologists suggested that Southeast Asia had indigenous civilization and the idea of indianization was just seen as a 'national motivation. These debates continued for some time, until the Pacific War, which led to legitimately ending the debates and reviewing Southeast Asia's response to Indianzation.\n\n====Development of caste system====\nAnother main concern for Indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had shown that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Dougald J. W|title=Early Civilizations of Southeast Asia|journal=AltaMira Press|date=2007}}</ref>\nSimilar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of Indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove Indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the Indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n===Fall of Indianization===\n====Khmer Kingdom====\nBeginning shortly after the 12th century, the Khmer kingdom, one of the first kingdoms that began the dissipation of Indianization started after Jayavarman VII in which expanded a substantial amount of territory, thus going into war with Champa.  Leading into the fall of the Khmer Kingdom, the Khmer political and cultural zones were taken, overthrown, and fallen as well.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehman|first1=Don|title=The Rise & Fall of Southeast Asia's Empires|date=2015|publisher=Lulu|edition=5}}</ref> Not only did Indianization change many cultural and political aspects, but it also changed the spiritual realm as well, creating a type of Northern Culture which began in the early 14th century,  prevalent for its rapid decline in the Indian kingdoms. The decline of Hinduism kingdoms and spark of Buddhist kingdoms led to the formation of orthodox Sinhalese Buddhism and is a key factor leading to the decline of Indianization. Sukhothai and Ceylon are the prominent characters who formulated the center of Buddhism and this became more popularized over Hinduism.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n====Rise of Islam====\nNot only was the spark of Buddhism the driving force for Indianization coming to an end, but Islamic control took over as well in the midst of the thirteenth century to trump the Hinduist kingdoms. In the process of Islam coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms, trade was heavily practiced and the now Islamic Indians started becoming merchants all over Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamic control has spanned to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca, and has therefore stressed a widespread rise of Islamization.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Indian cultural sphere==\n{{Further|Indosphere}}\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]\nThe use of ''Greater India'' to refer to an Indian cultural sphere was popularised by a network of Bengali scholars in the 1920s who were all members of the Calcutta-based Greater India Society.

Indian religion, Indian culture, Indian laws, and Indian government moulded the lives of the primitive races all over this wide region, and they imbibed a more elevated moral spirit and a higher intellectual taste through the religion, art, and literature of India.

They called this vast region \"Greater India\" \u2013 a dubious appellation for a region which to a limited degree, but with little permanence, had been influenced by Indian religion, art, architecture, literature and administrative customs. As a consequence of this renewed and extensive interest in Greater India, many Indians came to believe that the entire South and Southeast Asian region formed the cultural progeny of India; now that the sub-continent was reawakening, they felt, India would once again assert its non-political ascendancy over the area... While the idea of reviving the ancient Greater India was never officially endorsed by the Indian National Congress, it enjoyed considerable popularity in nationalist Indian circles. Indeed, Congress leaders made occasional references to Greater India while the organisation's abiding interest in the problems of overseas Indians lent indirect support to the Indian hope of restoring the alleged cultural and spiritual unity of South and Southeast Asia.\"</ref> and [[Hindu nationalism]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Thapar|1968|pp=326\u2013330}} Quote: \"At another level, it was believed that the dynamics of many Asian cultures, particularly those of Southeast Asia, arose from Hindu culture, and the theory of Greater India derived sustenance from Pan-Hinduism.

The ideas of both L\u00e9vi and the Greater India scholars were known to Nehru through his close intellectual links with Tagore. Thus L\u00e9vi's notion of ancient Indian voyagers leaving their invisible 'imprints' throughout east and southeast Asia was for Nehru a recapitulation of Tagore's vision of nationhood, that is an idealisation of India as a benign and uncoercive world civiliser and font of global enlightenment.

Pollock's 2006 book ''The Language of the Gods in the World of Men'' makes a case for studying the region as comparable with Latin Europe and argues that the Sanskrit language was its unifying element.\n\nScripts in [[Sanskrit]] discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to [[Southeast Asia]]. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos, and Cambodia are variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.\n\nSanskrit and related languages have also influenced their [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking neighbors to the north through the spread of Buddhist texts in translation.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|van Gulik|1956|p=?}}</ref>   The spread of Buddhism to Tibet allowed many Sanskrit texts to survive only in Tibetan translation (in the [[Tanjur]]).  Buddhism was similarly introduced to China by [[Mahayana|Mahayanist]] missionaries sent by the Indian Emperor Ashoka mostly through translations of [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]] and Classical Sanskrit texts, and many terms were transliterated directly and added to the Chinese vocabulary.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, languages such as [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]] contain many [[loan word]]s from Sanskrit, as does [[Khmer language|Khmer]] to a lesser extent. For example, in Thai, [[Ravana|R\u0101va\u1e47a]], the legendary emperor of [[Sri Lanka]], is called 'Thosakanth' which is derived from his Sanskrit name 'Da\u015baka\u1e47\u1e6dha' (\"having ten necks\").\n\nMany Sanskrit loanwords are also found in [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Javanese language|Javanese]] particularly the [[Old Javanese|old form]] from which nearly half the vocabulary is derived from the language.<ref>See [[:id: Daftar kata serapan dari bahasa Sansekerta dalam bahasa Indonesia|this page]] from the [[Indonesian Wikipedia]] for a list</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zoetmulder|1982|p=ix}}</ref> Other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malay language|traditional Malay]], [[Indonesian language|modern Indonesian]], also derive [[List of loan words in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|much of their vocabulary]] from Sanskrit, albeit to a lesser extent, with a large proportion of words being derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]].  Similarly, [[Philippine languages]] such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] have [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Sanskrit|many Sanskrit loanwords]].\n\nA Sanskrit loanword encountered in many Southeast Asian languages is the word ''[[Indonesian language|bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101]]'', or spoken language, which is used to mean language in general, for example ''bahasa'' in Malay, Indonesian and [[Tausug language|Tausug]], ''basa'' in Javanese, [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and [[Balinese language|Balinese]], ''phasa'' in Thai and Lao, ''bhasa'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and ''phiesa'' in [[Khmer language|Khmer]].\n\nThe utilization of [[Sanskrit]] has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes. [[Sanskrit]] terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Coedes|1967|p=98}} The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of [[Vietnam]] once embraced the [[Sanskrit]] dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \"reincarnations or descendants\" of the [[Hindu]] gods. However once [[Buddhism]] began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.\n\n===Linguistic commonalities===\n* In the [[Malay Archipelago]]: [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] have absorbed a large amount of [[Sanskrit]] loanwords into their respective lexicons  (see: [[List of loan words in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|Sanskrit loan words in Indonesian]]).

An example is how the name of the late King of Thailand, [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], is spelled in Sanskrit as \"Bhumibol\"\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e25, yet is pronounced in Thai as \"Phumipon\" \u0e1e\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e19 using Thai-Sanskrit pronunciation rules since the original Sanskrit sounds do not exist in Thai. <!--the source says: \"which in Sanskrit would be written Bhumibal Atulyatej\"--><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nepalitimes.com/issue/2003/08/15/Culture/3595 |title=King Bhumibol and King Janak |last1=Sharma\n |first1=Sudhindra  |date= |work=nepalitimes.com |publisher=Himalmedia Private Limited |accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Toponyms===\n* [[Suvarnabhumi]] is a toponym that has been historically associated with Southeast Asia. In Sanskrit, it means \"The Land of Gold\". Thailand's [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]] is named after this toponym, signifying its intent to be a major transport hub of Southeast Asia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n* Several of Indonesian [[toponym]]s have Indian parallel or origin, such as [[Madura]] with [[Mathura]], [[Serayu]] and [[Sarayu]] river, [[Semeru]] with [[Sumeru]] mountain, [[Kalingga]] from [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga Kingdom]], and [[Yogyakarta|Ngayogyakarta]] from [[Ayodhya]].\n* Siamese ancient city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] also derived from Ramayana's Ayodhya.\n* Names of places could simply render their Sanskrit origin, such as [[Singapore]], from Singapura (''Singha-pura'' the \"lion city\"), [[Jakarta]] from ''Jaya'' and ''kreta'' (\"complete victory\").\n* Some of the Indonesian regencies such as [[Indragiri Hulu Regency|Indragiri Hulu]] and [[Indragiri Hilir Regency|Indragiri Hilir]] derived from Indragiri River, Indragiri itself means \"mountain of [[Indra]]\".\n* Some Thai toponyms also often have Indian parallels or Sanskrit origin, although the spellings are adapted to the Siamese tongue, such as [[Ratchaburi]] from ''Raja-puri'' (\"king's city\"), and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]] from ''Nagara Sri Dharmaraja''.\n* The tendency to use Sanskrit for modern [[neologism]] also continued to modern day. In 1962 Indonesia changed the colonial name of [[New Guinea]]n city of Hollandia to [[Jayapura]] (\"glorious city\"), Orange mountain range to [[Jayawijaya Mountains]].\n* Malaysia named their new government seat as [[Putrajaya]] (\"prince of glory\") in 1999.\n\n==Historiography of Indianization==\n===Indianization of Southeast Asia===\nThe history of [[South East Asia]] was mostly always written from the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region. The prevalent interpretation caused because of the ontological differences, the fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre-colonial Asia and the conclusion from it was that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies had caused innovation to become prey to tyranny and had rendered the history of the region cyclical, immobile and non-linear.\n\nThe belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction gained additional support, such as the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus [[Indosphere|Indianization]] was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-01JisWpJbEC&q=Indian#v=snippet&q=Indian&f=false | title=Strange Parallels: Volume 1, Integration on the Mainland: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c.800\u20131830| isbn=9781139437622| last1=Lieberman| first1=Victor| date=2003-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Caste systems===\nAnother main concern for [[Indian culture|Indianization]] was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the [[India]]n culture and calling it their own in each region. This had showed that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized {{citation needed|date=January 2020}} and able to flourish their own interests. For example, [[Cambodia]]'s caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.

Ha-has are used in landscape design to prevent access to a garden by, for example, grazing livestock without obstructing views.  In security design, the element is used to deter vehicular access to a site while minimizing visual obstruction.\n\nThe name \"ha-ha\" is thought to have stemmed from the exclamations of surprise by those coming across them, as the walls were intentionally designed so as not to be visible on the plane of the landscape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/teesside/article_1.shtml|title=What's so funny about a ha-ha wall?|website=[[BBC.co.uk]]|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> Alternatively referrred to as 'ha-hah' as an abreviation of 'half and half' with half a wall and half a ditch.

A successful personal injury claim of \u00a335,000 was settled upon, as the judge presiding the case deemed the ha-ha to be a dangerous man-made feature, and thus it was up to the groundskeepers to highlight the invisible danger that it presented.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=1f7c86a6-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7|title=JOHN COWAN v.

Surrounding vegetation was removed two years before the works opened up the ha-ha to the public. However environmental services were made aware that the ha-ha was in a state of disrepair, and without appropriate warning signs. The total cost of repairs was thought to be around \u00a365,000; environmental services contributed \u00a39,000, and the rest of the funds was taken from capital funds.<ref>{Cite web|url=http://www.losra.org/docs/Ha-Ha%20repairs.pdf|title=Ha-Ha Repairs|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n*In 2016 the ha-ha wall in Dalzell estate was repaired after it became unsafe due to a collapse of the stonework.

''The Punisher'' was shot on location in [[Tampa, Florida]], and surrounding environs in mid to late 2003. It was distributed by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] in North America, although [[Artisan Entertainment]], which released a [[The Punisher (1989 film)|1989 film adaptation of the same name]] on [[DVD-Video|DVD]], financed and co-distributed the film with eventual Artisan owner Lionsgate, while [[Columbia Pictures]] distributed the film in non-North American countries.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Screenwriter [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] agreed to helm the film during its development stage despite a dispute with [[Marvel Studios]], marking his [[directorial debut]].\n\nThe film was released on April 16, 2004, by [[Lionsgate]], grossing $13 million in the United States over its opening weekend, and reached a total gross of $54 million against a budget of $33 million.

This was the final film produced by Artisan Entertainment for theatrical distribution.\n\n==Plot==\nA smuggling operation in [[Tampa Bay]] results in the deaths of Bobby Saint, the son of [[boss (crime)|mafia boss]] Howard Saint, and Otto Krieg, an arms dealer. However, Krieg's death was faked; he is revealed to be undercover [[FBI]] agent and [[Delta Force]] veteran<ref>''Punisher: Countdown'' vol. 1, #1 September 2004</ref> Frank Castle on his final mission before retirement. Enraged over the death of his son, Howard Saint orders his men to find out everything they can about Krieg, and learns of Krieg's true identity. He orders Castle killed at a family reunion, while Saint's wife Livia requests that Castle's family be killed as well. At the reunion, Saint's men, among them Quentin Glass and Bobby's identical twin, John, kill Castle's entire family and shoot Castle, leaving him for dead. Castle survives and is nursed back to health by a local fisherman.\n\nWith the police and FBI unwilling to pursue the killers due to Saint's power and influence, Castle moves into an abandoned apartment occupied by three outcasts, Joan, Bumpo and Dave, and begins his mission to bring the Saints down. With information provided by Mickey Duka, one of Saint's less malevolent and more disgruntled minions, Castle studies the Saint family and learns their every move, in the process discovering Glass to be a [[closeted]] [[gay|homosexual]]. He openly attacks Saint's business and sabotages his partnership with his Cuban partners.\n\nSaint discovers Castle is alive and sends assassins to kill him. The first, Harry Heck, ambushes Castle on a bridge but is killed when Castle slits his throat with a [[ballistic knife]]. The second, a Russian behemoth, nearly beats Castle to death in his own apartment. Castle kills him by dousing his face in boiling oil and pushing him down a flight of stairs, breaking his neck. John, Glass and the goons arrive for Castle. The tenants hide Castle and refuse to disclose his location, despite Glass pulling Dave's piercings out with pliers. They leave one of their men to intercept Castle, but Castle kills him after they leave.\n\nWith Mickey's help, Castle poses as an anonymous blackmailer and arranges for Glass to be at certain places while planting Livia's car in the same location, and ultimately placing one of Livia's earrings in Glass's bed, leading Saint to believe they are having an affair. Saint confronts Glass in his own home and stabs him to death, and throws Livia off an overpass onto a railroad track, where she is run over by a train. With Saint despondent, Castle assaults Saint's club and kills every member of his mob, among them his remaining son John, though Saint, wounded, escapes the building. Castle pursues him and shoots him in a [[duel]]. As Saint lies dying, Castle reveals his schemes that led Saint to kill his friend and wife. He ties Saint to a car and sends it into the club's parking lot, which is laced with explosives. Saint dies in the subsequent explosion.\n\nCastle returns home and prepares to kill himself with his mission fulfilled, but sees a vision of his wife and changes his mind, instead deciding to continue to fight crime as the Punisher. He leaves some of Saint's money as a farewell gift to the tenants for protecting him. The film ends with Castle standing alone on the [[Sunshine Skyway Bridge]], as he vows, \"Those who do evil to others...the [[murder|killers]], the [[rapist]]s, [[psychopathy|psychos]], [[sadomasochism|sadists]]...you will come to know me well.

''The Punisher'' was shot on location in [[Tampa, Florida]], and surrounding environs in mid to late 2003. It was distributed by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] in North America, although [[Artisan Entertainment]], which released a [[The Punisher (1989 film)|1989 film adaptation of the same name]] on [[DVD-Video|DVD]], financed and co-distributed the film with eventual Artisan owner Lionsgate, while [[Columbia Pictures]] distributed the film in non-North American countries.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Screenwriter [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] agreed to helm the film during its development stage despite a dispute with [[Marvel Studios]], marking his [[directorial debut]].\n\nThe film was released on April 16, 2004, by [[Lionsgate]], grossing $13 million in the United States over its opening weekend, and reached a total gross of $54 million against a budget of $33 million.

This was the final film produced by Artisan Entertainment for theatrical distribution.\n\n==Plot==\nA smuggling operation in [[Tampa Bay]] results in the deaths of Bobby Saint, the son of [[boss (crime)|mafia boss]] Howard Saint, and Otto Krieg, an arms dealer. However, Krieg's death was faked; he is revealed to be undercover [[FBI]] agent and [[Delta Force]] veteran<ref>''Punisher: Countdown'' vol. 1, #1 September 2004</ref> Frank Castle on his final mission before retirement. Enraged over the death of his son, Howard Saint orders his men to find out everything they can about Krieg, and learns of Krieg's true identity. He orders Castle killed at a family reunion, while Saint's wife Livia requests that Castle's family be killed as well. At the reunion, Saint's men, among them Quentin Glass and Bobby's identical twin, John, kill Castle's entire family and shoot Castle, leaving him for dead. Castle survives and is nursed back to health by a local fisherman.\n\nWith the police and FBI unwilling to pursue the killers due to Saint's power and influence, Castle moves into an abandoned apartment occupied by three outcasts, Joan, Bumpo and Dave, and begins his mission to bring the Saints down. With information provided by Mickey Duka, one of Saint's less malevolent and more disgruntled minions, Castle studies the Saint family and learns their every move, in the process discovering Glass to be a [[closeted]] [[gay|homosexual]]. He openly attacks Saint's business and sabotages his partnership with his Cuban partners.\n\nSaint discovers Castle is alive and sends assassins to kill him. The first, Harry Heck, ambushes Castle on a bridge but is killed when Castle slits his throat with a [[ballistic knife]]. The second, a Russian behemoth, nearly beats Castle to death in his own apartment. Castle kills him by dousing his face in boiling oil and pushing him down a flight of stairs, breaking his neck. John, Glass and the goons arrive for Castle. The tenants hide Castle and refuse to disclose his location, despite Glass pulling Dave's piercings out with pliers. They leave one of their men to intercept Castle, but Castle kills him after they leave.\n\nWith Mickey's help, Castle poses as an anonymous blackmailer and arranges for Glass to be at certain places while planting Livia's car in the same location, and ultimately placing one of Livia's earrings in Glass's bed, leading Saint to believe they are having an affair. Saint confronts Glass in his own home and stabs him to death, and throws Livia off an overpass onto a railroad track, where she is run over by a train. With Saint despondent, Castle assaults Saint's club and kills every member of his mob, among them his remaining son John, though Saint, wounded, escapes the building. Castle pursues him and shoots him in a [[duel]]. As Saint lies dying, Castle reveals his schemes that led Saint to kill his friend and wife. He ties Saint to a car and sends it into the club's parking lot, which is laced with explosives. Saint dies in the subsequent explosion.\n\nCastle returns home and prepares to kill himself with his mission fulfilled, but sees a vision of his wife and changes his mind, instead deciding to continue to fight crime as the Punisher. He leaves some of Saint's money as a farewell gift to the tenants for protecting him. The film ends with Castle standing alone on the [[Sunshine Skyway Bridge]], as he vows, \"Those who do evil to others...the [[murder|killers]], the [[rapist]]s, [[psychopathy|psychos]], [[sadomasochism|sadists]]...you will come to know me well.

In 1983, childhood friend Neil Wilson joined as singer and the band changed their name to Tyrant enlisting Grant Wallace as second guitarist and began playing a harder-edged style of blues-influenced rock in the style of [[AC/DC]], [[Rose Tattoo]] and [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]]. Tyrant were also influenced by countless Overseas metal acts including, [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Accept (band)|Accept]].\n\nIn 1984, Tyrant released a four-track EP titled ''Never Too Loud'', which topped the metal charts on the local radio stations and gained them a massive following in Tasmania. A successful tour of Tasmania followed, including a show at the Hobart City Hall in front of 2000 people. Tyrant moved to Sydney, becoming one of the leading hard rock bands in the city. Amazingly, Tyrant 'headlined' the inaugural \"Metal Crusade\" show in 1985, the lineup being: Tyrant, Bengal Tigers, Shy Thunder, Statez and Vice before 1800 metalheads. Despite 'rave' reviews in both ''RAM'' and ''Juke'' magazines at the time, a strong fanatical fan base, a record deal never eventuated with Tyrant splitting up in late 1986 due to different musical interests among the band members.\n\nIn 1987, brothers Andy and Roberet Zarins re-formed Slyder, which split up again in 1990 after releasing one single titled \"Dreams\".\n\nMeanwhile, Neil Wilson and fellow Tyrant member, guitarist Grant Wallace formed a band called in 1987 called, The Law and played for a couple of years in Sydney, until both Wilson and Wallace formed a band called, \"Sonic Temple\" which was a concept band for UK rockers, The Cult.\n\nIn 1998 Tyrant reformed again with the original line-up, Neil 'Steel' Wilson, Grant Wallace, Andrew Zarins and Robert Zarins \u2013 returning to a packed house on 11 November 2000 at the Iron Duke Hotel in Sydney. Tyrant delivered many shows over the next couple of years, recording two full-length albums ''Freaks of Nature'' (2000) and ''Thunder Down Under'' (2003) before playing their 'last show' together with childhood heroes, Rose Tattoo. The band now middle aged, moved onto married life with the exception of Wilson.\n\nVocalist Neil Wilson returned to Tasmania in 2004, forming a NEW line-up of Tyrant which released a live CD in 2005 titled, ''Live Bootleg''. The new CD exposed a band that was far more ferocious, than the previous incarnation with the sound shifting its style musically speaking, with Tyrant moving away from their AC/DC, Rose Tattoo roots to a more modern and heavier metal sound with the new lineup consisting of vocalist, Neil Wilson, Brett Collidge on guitars, Simon Wilson guitars, Jason Smith bass guitar, and Nathan Sproule on drums. While only being a 'bootleg' recording, the new Tyrant was far more together musically with a fearsome beast displayed over the recording.\n\nIn August 2008 Tyrant singer, Neil Wilson was returning home from a recording session for the bands' \"25th Anniversary\" project that was underway, when Wilson was involved in a 'head on' car accident, luckily escaping with relative minor injuries.\n\nRecording of the \"Anniversary\" CD re-commenced in early 2009 with 2 new songs, albeit in 'demo' form titled, \"Running From The Law\" and \"Defenders Of The Faith\" uploaded to the bands' My Space page (TyrantAustralia) \u2013 the first new studio recordings by Tyrant since 2003.\n\nThe \"Save The Devil\" (demo edition) was released March 2011 containing 10 songs of attitude fuelled, obnoxious hard rock metal that sees the Tasmanian metal act deliver possibly their finest effort to date. Full of barn storming anthems, a cool cover and a ballad - \"Save The Devil\" was recorded at Izaneer studios, in Tasmania - and was the fifth self-financed CD by TYRANT being engineered, mixed and produced by Brett Collidge. A number of videos have been up loaded to [[YouTube]] (keywords Tyrant Australia) including a new song, 'Lay Down The Law' off the latest CD.\n\nOn 19 August 2011 saw the inception of a new \"All Star\" TYRANT at the Brisbane Hotel in Hobart. The new line up features: James Shelverton (Lady Crimson), Adrian Scott (Hammerhead), Michael Adkins (Raise The Flag/Rogue Sharks) and Neil Steel (Roadkill).\n\nThe 'SPECIAL EDITION' of the \"Save The Devil\" CD was issued 1 June 2012 - the CD being remixed and mastered, produced by Brett Collidge and re-mixed by Michael Shelley in Hobart at the Green Room studios. The CD includes 2 different cover art and contains 8 songs! TYRANT returned to the stage playing in Hobart on 18 May 2012 - supporting US metal legend, TIM RIPPER OWENS on his first Australian solo tour!\n\nThe band played its '30th Anniversary Show' at the Brisbane hotel, Hobart (Tasmania) in March 2013 and now has an 'official' page at Facebook (tyrantaustralia)and will release their 7th product - an 'Anniversary Edition' 2 CD version of \"Never Too Loud\" release in March 2015. The 2-CD set contains 8 tracks, the 'original' 1984 4 song (demo cassette)and the same 4 songs in re-recorded versions!
